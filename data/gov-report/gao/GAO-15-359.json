In addition, the act required USPC to enact other rules  and regulations as necessary to carry out a national parole policy.

The  Revitalization Act, along with related D.C. legislation, instituted reforms in  the sentencing and supervision structure for D.C. offenders, which in  many respects were similar to those that the Sentencing Reform Act of  1984 had established for federal offenders. Revitalization Act required the District of Columbia to move to a  determinate sentencing structure for certain offenses and abolished  parole. Also, it provided for terms of supervised release to follow the  determinate sentences to be imposed. Further, it provided USPC with  ongoing jurisdiction for supervision and revocation decisions for D.C.

Further, USPC derives its powers from existing  statute to subpoena witnesses for parole and supervised release  revocation hearings. Thus, any organization assuming USPC\u2019s  functions would likewise need relevant statutory authority to do so.", "Specialized processes, procedures, and personnel. USPC has  mechanisms in place, as well as the appropriate expertise, for  handling and hearing parole and supervised release cases. No other  organization that could potentially assume USPC\u2019s jurisdiction has  these same mechanisms in place already. For example, USPC\u2019s  standard operating procedures describe the hearing processes and  the specific steps hearing officials are required to take before making  recommendations to the Parole Commissioners for parole and  supervised release cases. Additionally, according to USPC officials,  because USPC is the only organization in the federal government that  makes parole and supervised release decisions based on federal and  D.C. statutes, its personnel have developed the necessary expertise  to carry out its responsibilities over time.", "Formal agreements with other organizations concerning parole and  supervised release decisions. USPC has formal agreements  concerning its decisions for parole and supervised release cases with  other criminal justice partners. Thus, an entity absorbing USPC\u2019s  jurisdiction would need to establish these formal agreements anew  and stipulate roles. For example, according to USPC officials, USPC  conducts many decision hearings for D.C. offenders who have been  released outside of the D.C. metro area. In order to conduct those  hearings, USPC leverages its formal agreement with U.S. Probation  and Pretrial Services, to ensure that it has access to offenders and  information on these offenders. Further, according to CSOSA  officials, their agency\u2019s understanding with USPC is formalized in an  interagency agreement. They noted that any transfer of jurisdiction  would require a new, formalized agreement with any new entity  accepting USPC\u2019s jurisdiction to ensure ongoing and successful D.C.  offender management. Further, according to USPC officials, formal  agreements are reinforced with statutory authorities.

For  example, start-up costs could include, among others, costs related to  hiring and training personnel; renting or building work space; and  establishing processes, procedures, and an infrastructure of technology.  Such initial costs could possibly be neutralized by longer term savings  attributable to reductions in USPC operations. However, because it is  difficult to estimate both the specific start up costs involved and any  projected efficiencies resulting from a modification to USPC\u2019s jurisdiction,  a net cost effect is difficult to estimate as well.", "Estimating the dollar amount of start-up costs is challenging on several  fronts. We spoke with representatives from the D.C. Office of the Deputy  Mayor for Public Safety and Justice, which has oversight of D.C.\u2019s  criminal justice agencies and thus could have responsibility for  supervising a new entity if the entity were to be housed in the D.C.  government. According to these officials, they are not well positioned to  generate a cost estimate for creating a new entity for three reasons. First,  D.C. has not recently established an entirely new organization and thus  these officials had no example upon which to base an estimate. Second,  they noted that D.C. had recently consolidated several agencies, and that  this process resulted in increased costs. Finally, they explained that  estimates of this type are often required to be made years in advance in  order to secure the necessary statutory and funding changes from their  city council and Congress.", "Estimating projected efficiencies resulting from a modification to USPC\u2019s  jurisdiction is also difficult. This is mainly because USPC would still incur  operating costs related to its authorities over federal offenders even after  its jurisdiction over D.C. offenders was transferred. In addition, USPC\u2019s  operations with respect to D.C. offenders would still need to operate for  some amount of time before a new or altered entity would be ready to  assume its responsibilities. Thus, there would be some overlap of  expenses before funding shifted.", "It is also important to note that D.C. government organizations that could  oversee a new or altered entity already rely on federal funding. For  example, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia received about  $115 million in funding from the federal government in fiscal year 2014.", "Additionally, the Public Defender Service for District of Columbia\u2019s Parole  Division, which provides representation to D.C. offenders facing  revocation before USPC, among other things, received about $40 million  in fiscal year 2014 from the federal government to do so. Thus,  withdrawing funding from USPC to provide additional federal funds to  another organization that already receives federal funding would likely  just shift the federal burden. On the other hand, if the new or altered entity  could perform USPC\u2019s functions related to D.C. offenders more efficiently  and at a lower cost than USPC, then federal savings might be realized.  Assessing USPC\u2019s current operational expenses and analyzing where  efficiencies could be achieved would require a thorough evaluation. Such  an evaluation, and the implementation of any changes resulting from it,  could require upfront costs. Thus, it is difficult to estimate whether or not  any longer term savings could be achieved after the initial investments to  alter an existing entity or establish a new organization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["Altering the characteristics of an existing entity or establishing a new  organization with the structure to assume USPC\u2019s jurisdiction could  initially result in delays in decision-making but the longer term impact is  also challenging to assess.

According to USPC and  CSOSA officials, this could result in the other entity experiencing potential  delays in making parole or supervised release decisions. These officials  further stated that such delays could result in increased incarceration and  supervision costs, risks of litigation, and threats to public safety.", "Specifically, according to USPC and CSOSA officials, because offenders  cannot be released until the organization processes decisions, delays in  decision-making by the other entity could result in, for example, offenders  staying incarcerated longer and having higher housing-related costs.  These officials also stated that if offenders are under supervision and a  decision to revoke their status is delayed, then this could result in more  supervision-related expenses. Further, according to USPC and CSOSA  officials, when decisions are made outside the statutory timeframes  because of delays, offenders could be positioned to file lawsuits, which  could result in additional costs related to, for example, defending the  organization\u2019s actions.
