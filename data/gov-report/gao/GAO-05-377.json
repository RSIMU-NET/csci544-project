For years, some mining operators did not reclaim land, creating environmental, health, and safety risks. Beginning in 1981, federal regulations required all operators to reclaim BLM land disturbed by these operations. In 2001, federal regulations began requiring operators to provide financial assurances before they began exploration or mining operations. GAO was asked to determine the (1) types, amount, and coverage of financial assurances operators currently use; (2) extent to which financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim land not reclaimed by the operator since BLM began requiring financial assurances; and (3) reliability and sufficiency of BLM's automated information system (LR2000) for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to GAO's survey of BLM state offices, as of July 2004, hardrock operators were using 11 types of financial assurances, valued at about $837 million, to guarantee reclamation costs for existing hardrock operations on BLM land. Surety bonds, letters of credit, and corporate guarantees accounted for most of the assurances' value. However, these financial assurances may not fully cover all future reclamation costs for these existing hardrock operations if operators do not complete required reclamation. BLM reported that, as of July 2004, some existing hardrock operations do not have financial assurances and some have no or outdated reclamation plans and/or cost estimates, on which financial assurances should be based. BLM identified 48 hardrock operations on BLM land that had ceased and not been reclaimed by operators since it began requiring financial assurances. BLM reported that the most recent cost estimates for 43 of these operations totaled about $136 million, with no adjustment for inflation; it did not report reclamation cost estimates for the other 5 operations. However, as of July 2004, financial assurances had paid or guaranteed $69 million and federal agencies and others had provided $10.6 million to pay for reclamation, leaving $56.4 million in reclamation costs unfunded. Financial assurances were not adequate to pay all estimated costs for required reclamation for 25 of the 48 operations because (1) some operations did not have financial assurances, despite BLM efforts in some cases to make the operators provide them; (2) some operations' financial assurances were less than the most recent reclamation cost estimates; and (3) some financial assurance providers went bankrupt. Also, cost estimates may be understated for about half of the remaining 23 operations because the estimates may not have been updated to reflect inflation or other factors. BLM's LR2000 is not reliable and sufficient for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations because BLM staff do not always update information and LR2000 is not currently designed to track certain critical information. Specifically, staff have not entered information on each operation, and for those operations that are included, the information is not always current. Also, LR2000 does not track some critical information--operations' basic status, some types of allowable assurances, and state- and county-held financial assurances. Given these limitations, BLM's reliance on LR2000 to manage financial assurances is mixed: headquarters does not always rely on it and BLM state offices' reliance varies. To compensate for LR2000's limitations, some BLM offices use informal record-keeping systems to help manage hardrock operations and financial assurances. BLM has taken some steps and identified others to improve LR2000 for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The General Mining Act of 1872 encouraged development of the West by  allowing individuals to stake claims and obtain exclusive rights to gold,  silver, copper, and other valuable hardrock mineral deposits on land  belonging to the United States. Since then, thousands of operators have  extracted billions of dollars worth of hardrock minerals from land now  managed by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management  (BLM)\u2014the agency that manages the largest amount of federal land.  However, some operators did not reclaim BLM land disturbed by hardrock  operations related to exploration, mining, and mineral processing when  their operations ceased. These operators left BLM with many thousands of  acres of disturbed land, some of which posed environmental and health  and safety risks.", "The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 states that the  Secretary of the Interior shall take any action required to prevent the  \u201cunnecessary or undue degradation\u201d of public land and its resources. BLM  has developed and revised regulations and issued policy under this  provision. Specifically, BLM issued regulations, effective in 1981, that  require all operators to reclaim BLM land disturbed by their hardrock  operations. For plan-level operations\u2014those disturbing over 5 acres of  land or those in certain designated areas, such as the national wild and  scenic rivers system\u2014operators were to have a BLM-approved plan that  documented all the anticipated hardrock activities and all required  reclamation. For notice-level operations\u2014those causing a surface  disturbance of 5 acres or less\u2014operators were to submit notices that  informed BLM of the operators\u2019 intentions, but these notices did not  require BLM\u2019s approval. Plans have to be approved and notices received by  BLM before the operators begin exploration or mining operations. Also, to  guarantee that reclamation costs are paid, these regulations stated that  BLM could require plan-level operators to provide bonds or other financial  assurances in an amount specified by BLM, taking into consideration the  estimated cost of reasonable stabilization and reclamation of the disturbed  land.BLM also could require notice-level operators with a history of  noncompliance with federal regulations to submit a plan of operation and  thus notice-level operators could be required to provide financial  assurances. Through a formal agreement, BLM can designate a state agency  as responsible for managing some or all hardrock requirements, including  financial assurances. Operators have used a variety of types of financial  assurances, ranging from funded assurances, such as cash and negotiable  U.S. securities, to corporate guarantees, which are promises to complete  reclamation that are backed only by the financial strength of the operator.  Despite having the regulatory authority to do so, BLM rarely required  operators to provide financial assurances throughout the 1980s.", "In August 1990, BLM issued a policy instructing BLM officials to require  operators to provide financial assurances for all plan-level operations and  for notice-level operations if the operators had a record of noncompliance  with federal regulations. BLM generally limited financial assurances to  $1,000 per acre for exploration and $2,000 per acre for mining operations.  However, BLM required operators using leaching chemicals, such as  cyanide and sulfuric acid, to extract minerals from ore and required  operators with a record of noncompliance to provide financial assurances  to cover all estimated reclamation costs for hardrock operations. For these  operations, BLM was to estimate the cost of reclamation and add to it the  reasonable administrative costs that would be incurred if reclamation were  done under contract. However, BLM did not further specify the types of  financial assurances that could or could not be used.", "Concerns about the types of financial assurance and the lack of financial  assurances requirements for all notice-level operations, among other  things, prompted BLM to establish new regulations in 2001. The new  regulations require operators to include reclamation plans and cost  estimates in the notices and plans of operation that they submit to BLM for  acceptance or approval. The new regulations require that before  exploration or mining operations begin, operators must provide financial  assurances to cover all estimated reclamation costs for both notice- and  plan-level hardrock operations. In addition, BLM must periodically review  the estimated cost of reclamation to determine if the cost estimates should  be updated. The regulations also specify the types of acceptable financial  assurances and prohibit new corporate guarantees and increases or  transfers in the corporate guarantees used under BLM\u2019s previous policy.  The financial assurance provisions of the new regulations applied  immediately\u2014on January 20, 2001, for new notice- and plan-level  operations and on January 20, 2003, for extended notice-level operations,  unless the notice was modified. Plans of operations that were approved  before January 20, 2001, were required to have financial assurances in  place no later than November 20, 2001.", "Under federal regulations, if an operator fails to complete required  reclamation, BLM or the designated state agency may take steps to obtain  funds from the financial assurance providers. Providers then have the  option of (1) relinquishing the amount guaranteed by the financial  assurance to BLM or the designated state agency, which would then use the  funds for reclamation, or (2) completing the reclamation themselves. The  regulations also give BLM the authority to take steps, such as issuing  noncompliance and suspension orders, and revoking plans of operation, if  operators do not comply with the financial assurance or other regulatory  requirements.", "BLM established an automated information system\u2014the Legacy Rehost  2000 (LR2000)\u2014in 1999 that combined into one system several existing  systems that collect and store information on the programs and land BLM  manages. LR2000 is composed of a number of subsystems, some of which  contain information on hardrock operations and financial assurances.", "You asked us to determine the (1) types, amount, and coverage of financial  assurances operators currently use to guarantee reclamation costs, (2)  amount that financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim  operations that had ceased and not been reclaimed since BLM began  requiring financial assurances and the estimated costs of completing  reclamation for such operations, and (3) reliability and sufficiency of BLM\u2019s  LR2000 for managing financial assurances for hardrock operations.", "We did not rely on LR2000 information to address these objectives, but  instead designed two surveys to obtain information from BLM\u2019s state and  field offices because they maintain the case files and other specific  information on hardrock operations. We asked the 12 BLM state offices  that manage BLM programs across the United States to complete surveys  for each state in their jurisdiction with hardrock operations. We verified  the information in the surveys through discussions with BLM officials in  two state and four field offices and by reviewing case files and other  documents. In the first survey, which focused on states\u2019 experiences with  hardrock operations, we asked these 12 offices to provide information on  (1) the number of existing hardrock operations for each state within their  jurisdiction, (2) the types and the amounts of financial assurances  provided for existing hardrock operations in each state, (3) their views on  the effectiveness of the various types of financial assurances, (4) their  views on the reliability and sufficiency of hardrock operation data  contained in LR2000, and (5) their use of LR2000 for managing hardrock  operations and financial assurances in their states. In the second survey,  which focused on selected hardrock operations, we asked these 12 offices  to provide detailed information on hardrock operations within their  jurisdiction that met both of the following criteria: the operator (1) ceased  operations after the requirement for financial assurances went into effect\u2014 August 1990 for plan-level operations, January 2001 for new notice-level  operations, and January 2003 for existing notice-level operations and (2)  failed to complete the required reclamation. We used information in this  survey to determine the estimated reclamation costs and the adequacy of  financial assurances for reclaiming each hardrock operation that BLM  identified as meeting these criteria. We took steps to determine whether  BLM officials identified all hardrock operations that met these criteria,  such as comparing BLM\u2019s list of operations with operations identified by  others. To the extent that BLM did not identify all hardrock operations that  had ceased and not been reclaimed by the operator, the information it  reported to us would be understated. In addition, we did not collect  information on the thousands of ceased hardrock operations since 1872  that did not require financial assurances and therefore fell outside the  scope of this review.", "We also took steps to understand BLM\u2019s management and oversight of  hardrock operations and the use of financial assurances to ensure  reclamation. We reviewed BLM regulations, documents, and independent  studies relevant to hardrock operations and financial assurances. We also  discussed these issues with BLM officials at headquarters and in selected  state and field offices. To understand the relationship between BLM and  state agencies responsible for overseeing hardrock operations, we met  with BLM state office and state agency officials in several states, and  reviewed relevant memorandums of understanding and other agreements.  To understand the reliability and sufficiency of LR2000, we spoke with BLM  officials responsible for administering the system and staff in selected BLM  state and field offices who enter information into the system and who use  the system to manage hardrock operations and financial assurances. We  also discussed relevant hardrock operation and financial assurance issues  with experts and representatives from the mining industry, academia, and  environmental groups. Finally, to better understand hardrock operations  and reclamation requirements, we visited five mining operations in Nevada  and Montana.

Figure 1 shows the  BLM land available for hardrock operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Hardrock Operations Work and the Importance of Reclamation", "paragraphs": ["Hardrock operations consist of three primary stages\u2014exploration, mining,  and mineral processing. Operators are responsible for reclaiming the land  disturbed by such operations at the earliest economically and technically  feasible time, if this land will not be further disturbed. Exploration involves  prospecting and other steps to locate mineral deposits. Drilling is the most  common exploration tool for identifying the extent, quantity, and quality of  minerals within an area. The mining phase includes developing the mining  infrastructure (water, power, buildings, and roads) and extracting the  minerals. Mineral extraction generally entails drilling, blasting, and hauling  ore from pit areas to processing areas. To process minerals, operators  prepare the ore by crushing or grinding it to extract minerals. The material  left after the minerals are extracted\u2014tailings (a combination of fluid and  rock particles)\u2014is then disposed of, often in a nearby pile. In addition,  some operators use a leaching process to recover microscopic hardrock  minerals from heaps of crushed ore by percolating solvent (such as cyanide  for gold and sulfuric acid for copper) through the heap of ore. Through this  heap-leaching process, the minerals adhere to the solvent as it runs through  the leach heap and into a collection pond. The mineral-laced solution is  then taken from the collection pond to the processing facility, where the  valuable minerals are separated from the solution for further refinement.  Figure 2 provides an overview of the three stages of a hardrock operation  using a heap-leaching process.", "At the earliest feasible time, operators are required to reclaim BLM land  that will not be further disturbed to prevent or control on-site or off-site  damage. Reclamation practices vary by type of operation and by applicable  federal, state, and local requirements. However, reclamation generally  involves resloping pit walls to minimize erosion, removing or stabilizing  buildings and other structures to reduce safety risks, removing mining  roads to prevent damage from future traffic, and capping and revegetating  leach heaps, tailings, and waste rock piles to control erosion and minimize  the potential for contamination of groundwater from acid rock drainage and other potential water pollution problems. Addressing potential water  pollution problems may involve long-term monitoring and treatment.  Reclamation costs for hardrock mining operations vary by type and size of  operation. For example, the costs of plugging holes at an exploration site  are usually minimal. Conversely, reclamation costs for large mining  operations using leaching practices can be in the tens of millions of dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws and Regulations for Hardrock Operations", "paragraphs": ["Hardrock operations on BLM land are regulated by federal and state laws.  Under the General Mining Act of 1872 (Mining Act), an individual or  corporation can establish a claim to any hardrock mineral on public land.  Upon recording a mining claim with BLM, the claimant must pay an initial  $25 location fee and a $100 maintenance fee annually per claim; the  claimant is not required to pay royalties on any hardrock minerals  extracted. The Mining Act was designed to encourage the settlement and  development of the West; it was not designed to regulate the associated  environmental effects of mining. The number of hardrock operations left  abandoned throughout the West after operations ceased is not known but is  estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands, many of which pose  environmental, health, and safety risks. Until Congress passed the Federal  Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), development of  hardrock minerals on public land remained largely unregulated. FLPMA states that the Secretary of the Interior shall take any action necessary to  prevent \u201cunnecessary or undue degradation\u201d of public land.", "Under FLPMA, BLM has developed and revised regulations and issued  policies to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of BLM land from  hardrock operations. BLM issued regulations that took effect in 1981 on  how these operations were to be conducted. Named for their location in  the Code of Federal Regulations, the \u201c3809\u201d regulations classify surface  disturbance generated by hardrock operations into three categories: casual  use, notice-level operations, and plan-level operations. For all three  operation levels, the operator must prevent unnecessary and undue  degradation and complete reclamation at the earliest feasible time. BLM  issued the revised 3809 regulations, effective in part in January 2001 that,  among other things, changed the definition of the types of operations,  modified the reclamation requirements, and strengthened the financial  assurance requirements. Table 1 describes each type of operation under  both the old and new regulations.", "While the performance standards for reclamation under the 1981 and 2001  regulations remain the same, the 2001 regulations specifically identified the  components involved in reclamation. For standards under both regulations,  the operator of a notice- or plan-level operation must reclaim the disturbed  land at the earliest time that is economically and technically feasible,  except to the extent necessary to preserve evidence of the presence of  minerals, by taking reasonable measures to prevent or control on-site and  off-site damage to federal land. Reclamation must include the following  actions:  saving topsoil to be applied after reshaping disturbed areas;  taking measures to control erosion, landslides, and water runoff;  taking measures to isolate, remove, or control toxic materials;  reshaping the area disturbed, applying the topsoil, and revegetating  disturbed areas, where reasonably practicable; and  rehabilitating fisheries and wildlife habitat.", "The 2001 regulations specified that, as applicable, reclamation components  include:   isolating, controlling, or removing acid-forming and deleterious   regrading and reshaping the disturbed land to conform with adjacent  landforms, facilitating revegetation, controlling drainage, and  minimizing erosion;  placing growth medium and establishing self-sustaining vegetation;   removing or stabilizing buildings, structures, or other support facilities;  plugging drill holes and closing underground workings; and  providing for post-mining monitoring, maintenance, or treatment.", "The 2001 regulations also significantly strengthened the financial assurance  requirements for hardrock mining operations. Under the 1981 regulations,  BLM had the option of requiring an operator to obtain a bond or other  financial assurances for plan-level hardrock operations and for notice-level  operations where the operator had a record of noncompliance. However,  BLM rarely exercised this option. In 1990, BLM instructed its officials to  require operators of plan-level operations to provide (1) financial  assurances of $1,000 per acre for exploration and $2,000 per acre for  mining and (2) financial assurances for all estimated reclamation costs for  operations that used leaching chemicals and for operators with a record of  noncompliance. Under the 2001 regulations, BLM requires all notice- and  plan-level hardrock operators to provide financial assurances that cover all  estimated reclamation costs for all plan- and notice-level operations before  exploration or mining operations begin. Casual-use operations do not have  to provide financial assurances.", "The 2001 regulations amended the types of financial assurances that can be  used. The 1981 regulations identified three types of acceptable financial  assurances\u2014bonds, cash, and negotiable U.S. securities. BLM could also  accept evidence of an existing bond pursuant to state law or regulations if  BLM determined that the coverage would be equivalent to the amount that  would be required by BLM. Some operations used corporate guarantees,  which were allowable under state laws and regulations. In contrast, the  2001 regulations prohibit the use of corporate guarantees for new  operations and state that corporate guarantees currently in use under an  approved BLM and state agreement cannot be increased or transferred.  The 2001 regulations specify the following types of financial assurances as  acceptable:   surety bonds that meet the requirements of U.S. Treasury Circular 570; cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial  assurance and maintained in a federal depository account of the U.S.  Treasury by BLM;  irrevocable letters of credit from a bank or other financial institution  organized or authorized to transact business in the United States;   certificates of deposit or savings accounts not in excess of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s maximum insurable amount;  negotiable U.S., state, and municipal securities or bonds with a market  value of at least the required dollar amount of the financial assurance  maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured  trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of  the Secretary of the Interior; investment-grade securities that (1) have a Standard and Poor\u2019s rating of  AAA or AA, or an equivalent rating from another nationally recognized  securities rating service, (2) have a market value of at least the required  dollar amount of the financial assurance, and (3) are maintained in a  Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a  licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the Secretary of the  Interior;  certain types of insurance underwritten by a company having an A.M.", "Best rating of \u201csuperior\u201d or an equivalent rating from another nationally  recognized insurance rating service;  evidence of an existing financial assurance under state law or  regulations, as long as the financial assurance is held or approved by the  state agency for the same operations covered by the notice or plan of  operation, has a value equal to the required amount, and is redeemable  by BLM. These financial assurances can include any of the above  instruments. In addition, they can include state bond pools, as well as  corporate guarantees that existed on January 20, 2001, under an  approved BLM and state agreement; or  trust funds or other funding mechanisms available to BLM. The 2001  regulations require operators, when BLM identifies a need for it, to  establish a trust fund or other funding mechanism to ensure  continuation of long-term treatment to achieve water quality standards  and for other long-term, post-mining maintenance requirements.", "Finally, under the 2001 regulations, all notice- and plan-level operators  must submit a reclamation plan and an associated cost estimate with its  notice or plan of operation and any modifications or renewals. The  financial assurance amount is based on the cost estimate. Furthermore, the  associated cost estimate must reflect the cost to BLM as if the agency had  to contract with a third party to complete reclamation. In addition, BLM  issued guidance in February 2003, which was revised in March 2004, setting  forth factors that should be considered in developing cost estimates. For  example, estimates should include administrative and other indirect costs.  The regulations require BLM to periodically review the estimates to  determine if the estimate should be updated to reflect any necessary  changes in the cost of reclaiming the operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM\u2019s Management and Oversight of Financial Assurances", "paragraphs": ["BLM headquarters manages and oversees hardrock operations as well as its  other programs, primarily through its headquarters, 12 state offices, and  157 field offices.

This office is also responsible  for evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation at the state- and  field-office levels. For example, in 2004, BLM conducted a survey of 18 of  its 157 field offices to determine, among other things, whether operators  had obtained financial assurances as required.", "Each state office is headed by a state director who reports to the Director  of BLM in headquarters. BLM state office delegations of responsibilities for  financial assurances vary from state to state. For example, some state  offices verify the authenticity of the financial assurance and confirm that  financial assurances are payable to BLM. The state offices manage BLM  programs and land in the geographic areas that generally conform to the  boundary of one or more states. The state offices are Alaska, Arizona,  California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,  Wyoming, and Eastern States.

Field office staffs are generally responsible for, among  other things, (1) reviewing notices and plans of operations, along with  associated reclamation plans and cost estimates; (2) determining the  amount of financial assurances needed to pay reclamation costs; and (3)  inspecting hardrock operations for compliance with regulations.", "In addition, BLM has specialized centers, which are organizationally  affiliated with headquarters, to carry out a variety of activities. One of these  centers, near Denver, Colorado, administers BLM\u2019s LR2000, which is an  automated information system used to collect and store information on  BLM land and programs, including hardrock operations. LR2000 includes  several subsystems that contain information on hardrock operations and  the financial assurances provided by operators.

Surety bonds are a third party guarantee that an operator  purchases from an insurance company. As a third party with possible  financial responsibility for reclamation, the insurance company has a  strong incentive to monitor the operator\u2019s environmental safety record and  efforts to fulfill reclamation obligations. If the operator does not complete  required reclamation once operations cease, the insurance company has  the option of performing the reclamation work or paying the financial  assurance value to BLM or the designated state agency for reclamation.  According to industry representatives and experts, insurance companies  are amenable to issuing surety bonds for hardrock operations for  predictable reclamation activities that will occur in a defined time frame.  As table 2 shows, operators in 10 of the 12 states with hardrock operations  are using surety bonds. In 7 of these 10 states, BLM state offices rated  surety bonds as \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cvery effective\u201d for minimizing losses to the  federal government; in the other three states, BLM state offices reported  that they had no experience (that is, they had not taken steps to obtain  funds from the financial assurance provider) in using this type of assurance  in minimizing losses to the federal government.", "Letters of credit. Letters of credit, which hardrock operators typically  purchase from a bank or other financial institution, require the institution  to pay BLM or the designated state agency the value of the letter of credit if  the purchaser does not complete the required reclamation. Depending on  the financial condition of the operator, the financial institution may require  a deposit or collateral. Letters of credit are used in nine states with  hardrock operations. In seven of these states, BLM state offices rated  letters of credit as \u201cmoderately effective\u201d or \u201cvery effective\u201d in minimizing  losses to the federal government; in the other two states, the BLM state  offices reported that they had no experience in using this type of assurance  in minimizing losses to the federal government.", "Corporate guarantees. Corporate guarantees are promises by operators,  sometimes accompanied by a test of financial stability, to pay reclamation  costs, but do not require that funds be set aside to pay such costs. Although  BLM prohibits new corporate guarantees in its 2001 regulations, 3 of the 12  states had existing corporate guarantees that were to cover almost one  fourth of the total estimated reclamation costs, as of July 2004. Most of  these corporate guarantees\u2014$200 million of the approximately $204  million\u2014are for operations in Nevada. The Nevada BLM state office rated  corporate guarantees as \u201cnot effective\u201d for minimizing losses to the federal  government. Operators in Utah and Wyoming are also using corporate  guarantees, although in relatively smaller amounts of $122,000 and $3.4  million, respectively. The Utah BLM state office reported that it has no  experience in using this type of financial assurance to minimize losses to  the federal government and therefore did not rate the effectiveness of this  type of assurance. The Wyoming BLM state office rated corporate  guarantees as a \u201cvery effective\u201d financial assurance, although the office  reported it had no experience with an operation that had this type of  financial assurance and failed to reclaim the land.", "State bond pools. Operators in two states\u2014Alaska and Nevada\u2014use state  bond pools to cover reclamation costs. According to Alaska BLM state  office officials, all hardrock operators on BLM land in Alaska participate in  the state bond pool. Operators in the Alaska bond pool do not develop  individual cost estimates for reclaiming the land disturbed by their  operations. The bond pool, administered by the Alaska Department of  Natural Resources, had $1 million in reclamation funds as of July 2004.  According to Alaska BLM state office officials, if the bond pool funds are  not sufficient to cover reclamation costs, the state of Alaska has agreed to  cover any additional costs. The Alaska BLM state office rated the bond pool  as \u201ceffective\u201d in minimizing financial losses to the federal government. The  office also reported that to date no requests or claims have been initiated to  use bond pool funds for reclamation because either BLM has successfully  negotiated with the operators to have the operations reclaimed, or the  operations are pending further action.", "The Nevada reclamation bond pool\u2014which had about $1.2 million as of  July 2004\u2014is open to operators on BLM or private lands. The state\u2019s  Division of Minerals administers this pool that was designed to help smaller  operations that may have difficulty securing other forms of financial  assurances. The Nevada bond pool does not establish the amount of the  assurance required for each operation; this is typically done by BLM for  operations on BLM land. The maximum bond amount for a participant is  $3 million. The Nevada BLM state office rated the state\u2019s bond pool as  \u201cvery effective\u201d in minimizing financial losses but noted that the pool had  not been used as of our July 2004 survey. Subsequently, the office told us  that the bond pool was used for the first time in late 2004, when BLM  requested funds from the pool to reclaim a hardrock operation.", "Certificates of deposit and savings accounts. Certificates of deposit and  savings accounts can be used to guarantee reclamation costs but must not  exceed the maximum amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation. Operators use certificates of deposit in 10 of the 12 states  with hardrock operations. BLM state offices in 7 of these 10 states rated  these assurances as \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cvery effective\u201d in minimizing losses to  the federal government. Another state office rated this type of assurances  as \u201cmoderately effective\u201d and noted that care must be given to ensure that  BLM is the beneficiary of the certificate. In the other two states, the BLM  state offices reported that they had no experience with this type of  assurance in minimizing losses to the federal government. Operators in one  state are using savings accounts, and the BLM rated savings accounts as  \u201cvery effective\u201d for minimizing losses to the federal government.", "Cash accounts. Operators provide cash to BLM to guarantee reclamation  costs, and BLM must deposit and maintain this cash in a federal depository  account of the U.S. Treasury. Operators in 10 of the 12 states with hardrock  operations use cash accounts.

An official in Oregon\u2019s BLM state office,  which manages BLM programs in Oregon and Washington, said that two  operations in Washington did not have financial assurances, probably  because the responsible BLM field office did not have adequate staff to  enforce compliance with this requirement.

According to BLM state office officials, the  operators of two operations did not provide financial assurances, even  though BLM told them that financial assurances were required.  According to an official in the BLM state office, the heavy workloads  associated with other BLM programs dissuaded staff from taking  enforcement actions that could involve time-consuming activities, such  as obtaining court orders. Furthermore, the official said that case files  indicated the third operation had financial assurances sometime during  the 1990s, but information on the type and amount of financial  assurances after it ceased could not be found. No reason was given for  the fourth operation.", "Four operations in Nevada. According to BLM state office officials,  operators of three operations did not provide financial assurances, even  though BLM notified the operators that financial assurances were  required. At one of these operations, for example, BLM\u2019s field office  issued a noncompliance order that, after the operator appealed it, was  upheld by the BLM state office. BLM is currently working with the state  of Nevada to reclaim this operation. BLM state office officials said that  the operator of another operation, who eventually went bankrupt, was  never able to provide a suitable financial assurance instrument.  Regarding the fourth operation\u2014Relief Canyon\u2014officials in BLM\u2019s  responsible field office told us that the operator refused to provide  financial assurances despite the field office\u2019s enforcement steps.

However, the operator never obtained the  financial assurances. According to BLM, the mine\u2019s plan of operation  was last updated in October 1996, and before the operation ceased, the  operator estimated reclamation costs at about $889,000. BLM reported  that, as of July 2004, 26 to 50 percent of the operation had been  reclaimed. BLM officials told us that they had revoked the mine\u2019s plan  of operation, operations had ceased, and the operator should complete  reclamation, but the operator has appealed this revocation to Interior\u2019s  Board of Land Appeals. The operator contends that he plans to either  begin mining operations when he gets the funds or sell the operation.  When we visited the operation in September 2004, we did not see any  signs of ongoing mining activity and observed that buildings, collection  pond liners, the security fence, and other structural facilities needed  repair.

Three mining  operations\u2014Zortman and Landusky, MacArthur Mine and Paradise Peak\u2014 accounted for about 95 percent of the amount that the cost estimates  exceeded the financial assurances.", "For these 13 hardrock operations, we identified several reasons why  financial assurances were less than the most recent reclamation cost  estimate. In particular:  Estimates at the time operations ceased for 6 of the 13 operations did  not consider all costs. BLM reported that some estimates excluded BLM  administrative or indirect costs, interim maintenance costs, long-term  maintenance and monitoring costs, costs for inflation, and/or other  costs. For example, estimates for five operations did not include  sufficient funds to cover BLM administrative or indirect costs, which  can be high, especially if BLM gets involved with bankruptcy  procedures. In its guidance on preparing cost estimates BLM states that  estimates should include (1) costs for contract administration, which  should be between 6 and 10 percent of estimated operations and  maintenance costs, depending on the size of the operation, and (2)  indirect costs, which should be 21 percent of the contract  administration costs.", "One operator intentionally understated reclamation costs for an  operation to minimize the amount of financial assurances required,  according to BLM field office officials in Nevada. They said, for  example, that the operator calculated the estimate as if very large  equipment were going to be used, which would reduce costs; however,  the operator did not have such equipment available in the state. The  field office officials said that the BLM staff who reviewed the cost  estimate were inexperienced and did not detect the understatement.", "Reclamation plans and cost estimates sometimes were not updated to  reflect all reclamation costs when the scope of the plan of operations  changed and, as a result, the reclamation requirements changed. For  example, BLM reported that the amount of financial assurances for the  Zortman and Landusky mining operation in Montana was significantly  less than the cost estimate prepared after the operations ceased. The  difference in costs was due in part to the failure to update the  reclamation plan to address acid rock drainage found during an  inspection in the early 1990s, despite efforts by the operator to update  the plan. Specifically, the most recent cost estimate for water treatment  is greater than the estimate prepared before operations ceased. In  addition, the cost estimate increased because the revised reclamation  plan required more extensive work on the heap-leach pad than in the  earlier plan. Approval of the plan was delayed until 2002 by the review  process and litigation over the effects of the proposed changes, and by  that time the operator had declared bankruptcy.", "According to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which  jointly manages the hardrock operation with BLM, the value of the  financial assurances increased during this period. However, the most  recent reclamation cost estimate was still greater than the associated  financial assurances. An estimate of $85.2 million for reclamation costs  was prepared after operations ceased and addressed water  contamination and other reclamation activities, such as backfilling,  regrading, and revegetating. This estimate included $36.3 million for  earthworks, $22 million for water treatment through 2017, and $26.9  million for long-term water monitoring and treatment, according to  BLM field office officials. This estimate was $27.4 million more than the  $57.8 million in financial assurances provided for the reclamation. The  financial assurances consisted of $29.6 million in surety bonds for  earthworks, a $2 million construction assurance bond for water  treatment facilities, $13.9 million in surety bonds for water treatment  through 2017, and $12.3 million in a trust fund for long-term water  treatment and monitoring.

For three of these  operations\u2014Paradise Peak, County Line, and MacArthur Mine\u2014an  operator used corporate guarantees totaling $4.2 million to guarantee part  of the estimated reclamation costs. However, these corporate guarantees  lost all their value when the operator went bankrupt. Reclamation costs for  the fourth operation were guaranteed with a surety bond underwritten by a  company that went bankrupt and spent $850,650 for partial reclamation of  the operation instead of relinquishing the $1.8 million surety bond. In  particular:  Paradise Peak, a mining operation in central Nevada, used heap leaching  to extract gold from ore. When the operation ceased, it covered almost  1,000 acres, about half of which was on BLM land. The plan of operation  was last updated in May 1996, and in November 1995, the operator  estimated that reclamation costs would be $5,462,000. The operator,  Arimetco Inc., provided financial assurances totaling $4,625,000\u2014 $1,157,000 in a surety bond and $3,468,000 in a corporate guarantee that  lost all of its value when Arimetco went bankrupt. As of July 2004, the  surety bond company had relinquished the $1,157,000, but none of the  funds had been spent. BLM reported that estimated reclamation costs  were $21,157,000\u2014$20 million more than the funds the surety bond  company relinquished. This estimated cost is significantly more than the  original estimate, according to BLM state office officials, because the  original estimate did not include all costs that it should have, such as  costs for reclaiming collection ponds, and because the cost estimate  was not updated to reflect changes in the reclamation plan. BLM  reported that no reclamation had been done as of July 2004, but it was  very likely that reclamation would be completed because a portion of  the needed funding was obtained through bankruptcy procedures and  BLM was working with the operator to perform reclamation.", "County Line Project, located on 130 acres of BLM land in western  Nevada, used heap leaching to extract gold from ore.

As of July 2004, the surety bond company  had relinquished the $210,000, but none of the funds had been spent.  BLM reported that, as of July 2004, between 26 percent and 50 percent  of the operation had been reclaimed. BLM also reported that it was very  unlikely that reclamation would ever be completed because it was  unlikely that the operator would remain viable after bankruptcy.", "The MacArthur Mine covers about 550 acres, over three-quarters of  which are on BLM land. The MacArthur Mine was purchased by  Arimetco in 1988. This copper mine consisted of a pit, waste dump, and  roads used to haul ore from the pit to three heap-leach pads that  Arimetco constructed on the nearby Yerington Mine, which was also on  BLM land, to extract copper from the MacArthur ore. BLM reported  that Arimetco began operating the MacArthur Mine in 1992 and ceased  operations in 1997, after it filed for bankruptcy. BLM also reported that  the plan of operation was last updated in 1995 and that Arimetco had no  reclamation cost estimate before operations ceased. Further, BLM  provided documents that showed the MacArthur reclamation plan  covered not only the MacArthur land but also the heap-leach pads at the  Yerington Mine. Although Arimetco had no cost estimate, it did have  $184,300 in financial assurances\u2014$47,000 in a surety bond and $137,300  in a corporate guarantee that had lost all of its value when Arimetco  went bankrupt. BLM reported that, as of July 2004, the $47,000 in surety  bond funds had been relinquished but not spent. BLM also reported that  estimated reclamation costs would be $17,047,000\u2014$17 million more  than the funds relinquished by the surety bond company. This estimate,  according to an official in a BLM Nevada field office, was prepared by  the state of Nevada for bankruptcy procedures. BLM reported that, as of  July 2004, no reclamation of the MacArthur operation had been  undertaken or completed and that it was very unlikely reclamation of  this operation would occur. However, in March 2005, the BLM official  told us that the Yerington Mine, including the leach heaps built and used  by Arimetco for the MacArthur operation, would be cleaned up under  the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA). CERCLA governs  cleanup of severely contaminated hazardous waste sites.", "The Olinghouse Mine operation, a exploration and mining operation in  northwest Nevada, used heap leaching to extract gold from ore on 502  acres, of which 447 acres were BLM land. The plan of operation was last  updated in September 2002, and the operator estimated that reclamation  costs would be about $851,000. BLM has not reported any more recent  cost estimates. Alta Gold Company, the operator of the Olinghouse  operation and eight other hardrock operations in Nevada, provided  financial assurances to guarantee reclamation of all nine operations  through a statewide surety bond underwritten by the Frontier Insurance  Company (Frontier).

BLM entered into an agreement with Frontier for it to perform  reclamation using contractors, with BLM oversight. Frontier completed  the agreed-upon reclamation by February 2003, and in December 2003,  BLM released the company from future financial obligations for this  operation. Frontier performed the reclamation for $850,650, which was  significantly less than the $1.8 million surety bond that it would have  relinquished if Frontier had not performed the reclamation. BLM state  and field office officials told us that this solution was satisfactory to all  parties, even though all reclamation required by the reclamation plan  was not completed.

Some BLM officials believed reclamation would be completed because  funds were available from financial assurances or other sources. For  example, BLM reported that completion was very likely for the Zortman  and Landusky mining operation in Montana, which was between 86 and 95  percent reclaimed as of July 2004, partly because funds for earthwork were  available and work was under way. At the same time, BLM noted that more  than $18 million in additional funds would be needed to maintain water  treatment at the operation in perpetuity. In other cases, officials believed  that operations may be taken over by new operators, or reopened by the  existing operators, who will ultimately complete reclamation of the  operations. For example, BLM reported that completing reclamation of an  operation in Alaska that was less than 50 percent reclaimed was very likely  because another operator agreed to reclaim the area in conjunction with  taking over the operation from the bankrupt operator.

LR2000 uses the term  \u201copen\u201d to identify both operations that are ongoing and operations that  have ceased and should be reclaimed. It uses the term \u201cclosed\u201d to refer  to those operations where reclamation has been completed. While field  staff should know whether an operation is ongoing or has ceased  because of first-hand knowledge or access to case files in their offices,  BLM headquarters and state office officials do not have ready access to  this basic information. For example, in response to our survey regarding  the number of ongoing hardrock operations with financial assurances,  the Arizona state office reported that only 32 of 55 plan-level operations  had financial assurances. The office also reported that it was reviewing  its case files to determine the status of the operations without financial  assurances, such as whether any of these operations have ceased, been  reclaimed, and should have been closed in LR2000. Also, in response to  our survey, the California state office reported that LR2000 showed 639  \u201copen\u201d hardrock operations in the state, but officials estimated that only  303 of these operations were actually ongoing.

Specifically, we  were asked to determine the (1) types, amount, and coverage of financial  assurances operators currently use to guarantee reclamation costs; (2)  amount that financial assurance providers and others have paid to reclaim  operations that had ceased and not been reclaimed since BLM began  requiring financial assurances and the estimated costs of completing  reclamation for such operations; and (3) reliability and sufficiency of BLM\u2019s  automated LR2000 information system for managing financial assurances  for hardrock operations.", "To address these objectives, we designed two surveys to obtain information  from BLM\u2019s state and field offices because they maintain the case files and  other specific information on hardrock operations. We asked the 12 BLM  state offices that manage BLM programs across the United States to  complete surveys for each state in their jurisdiction with hardrock  operations. The 12 BLM state offices were Alaska, Arizona, California,  Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming,  and Eastern States.", "We used the first survey, which focused on states\u2019 experiences with  hardrock operations, to determine the types and amounts of financial  assurances currently used to guarantee reclamation costs. Specifically, we  asked the 12 BLM state offices to provide information on (1) the number of  existing hardrock operations for each state within their jurisdiction, (2) the  types and the amounts of financial assurances provided for existing  hardrock operations in each state, (3) their views on the effectiveness of  the various types of financial assurances, (4) their views on the reliability  and sufficiency of hardrock operation data contained in the LR2000, and  (5) their use of LR2000 for managing hardrock operations in their states.", "We used the second survey, which focused on selected hardrock  operations, to determine the amount of funds provided by financial  assurances and others to reclaim hardrock operations that had ceased and  not been reclaimed by operators since BLM began requiring financial  assurances and the estimated costs of completing reclamation of such  operations. We asked the state offices to provide detailed information on  each hardrock operation within their jurisdiction that met both of the  following criteria: the operator (1) ceased operations after the requirement  for financial assurances went into effect\u2014August 1990 for plan-level  operations, January 2001 for new notice-level operations, and January 2003  for existing notice-level operations\u2014and (2) failed to complete the  required reclamation. In most cases, BLM field office staff completed this  survey because hardrock operation case files are maintained in these  offices. Also, as necessary, we obtained information from BLM state and  field staff to clarify responses to the survey. We used the information  obtained to determine the estimated reclamation costs and the adequacy of  financial assurances for reclaiming the hardrock operations that BLM  identified as meeting our criteria.", "To determine the adequacy of financial assurances, we compared the most  recent complete reclamation cost estimate that BLM reported for each  operation with the dollar value of the financial assurance that BLM  reported for that operation. We then computed the difference between the  most recent cost estimate and the value of the financial assurance to  determine the total net excess or deficiency of the financial assurances.  The total is the sum of the differences between the values of the financial  assurances and the cost estimates that were made at different times over  the past 15 years and were not adjusted for inflation. For each operation,  we asked BLM to report the value of the (1) estimates that the operator had  before operations ceased, (2) estimates that BLM prepared after operations  ceased, (3) actual reclamation costs, (4) BLM\u2019s estimate of the shortfall in  funds needed to complete reclamation in excess of funds relinquished by  the financial assurance provider, and (5) BLM\u2019s estimates of funds needed  to complete required reclamation. BLM reported one or more of these  values for 43 operations, and no value for the other 5 operations. For 24 of  these 43 operations, BLM reported only one value, and we used that value  as the most recent reclamation cost estimate. For the other 19 operations,  BLM reported two or more values. In determining which value to use for  our analysis, we generally did not use the (1) actual costs for operations  that were not fully reclaimed because the actual cost could not be known  unless reclamation was complete and (2) estimated funds needed to  complete reclamation for operations that were partly reclaimed because  those estimates did not include funds that had already been spent. We used  the following values as the most recent reclamation cost estimate for these  19 operations.", "For 12 operations, we used BLM\u2019s estimate prepared after operations  ceased because those estimates were the most recent.", "For three operations that BLM reported as having no reclamation  completed or not knowing the status of reclamation, we used BLM\u2019s  reported estimate of funds needed to complete required reclamation.", "For one operation that BLM reported as being fully reclaimed, we used  BLM\u2019s reported actual cost.", "For one operation, we used BLM\u2019s estimate of the shortfall of funds  needed in excess of funds relinquished by the financial assurance  provider because that estimate was the most recent and most accurate,  according to BLM officials.", "For one operation, we used the estimate available before operations  ceased because the only other value reported for the operation was  BLM\u2019s estimate of funds needed to complete reclamation and  reclamation was only partly completed.", "For one operation, we used the estimate available before operations  ceased because the other values reported for the operation were BLM\u2019s  estimate of funds needed to complete reclamation and the reported  amount of actual costs, but reclamation was only partly completed.", "We provided a copy of these two surveys to BLM headquarters and  incorporated officials\u2019 comments as appropriate. We also pretested these  surveys with state and field office staff in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona and  made changes in the surveys\u2019 scope and content as appropriate. Further,  after respondents submitted their answers, we (1) verified the information  in the survey that focused on states\u2019 hardrock operations experience  through discussions with BLM officials in two state offices with extensive  financial assurance experience in hardrock operations\u2014Nevada and  Montana\u2014and (2) verified information reported in four randomly selected  hardrock operations surveys through discussions with officials and a  review of case files in three Nevada field offices\u2014Carson City, Elko, and  Winnemucca\u2014and one Montana field office\u2014Lewistown. We checked the  answers respondents had given to the questions against information  contained in the case files. In many cases, staff provided answers based on  their own knowledge and information in the case files.", "Some BLM state offices had difficulty identifying hardrock operations that  met our criteria. For example, some states completed our surveys for  hardrock operations that did not appear to meet our criteria, and we  contacted the respondents to clarify whether the operations did or did not  meet the criteria. We eliminated 12 surveys that did not meet the criteria  from our analysis.", "Furthermore, we cannot know whether BLM reported to us all hardrock  operations that met our criteria. To address this concern, we took  additional steps to help ensure that BLM completed the selected hardrock  operations survey for all operations that met our criteria. For example, in  Nevada, we compared a list of bankrupt operations prepared by the Nevada  Bonding Task Force with a list of BLM\u2019s completed surveys to identify  potential omissions. In addition, we asked selected experts, interest  groups, and others to identify instances when operators failed to complete  required reclamation and the federal government or others paid such  reclamation costs or the required reclamation was not fully completed. To  the extent that BLM staff did not identify all of the operations that met our  criteria or did not report information on those operations that did meet the  criteria, the information the BLM staff reported is incomplete.  Furthermore, we did not collect information on the thousands of ceased  hardrock operations since 1872 that did not require financial assurances  and, therefore, fell outside the scope of this review.", "To determine the reliability and sufficiency of BLM\u2019s LR2000 system, we  spoke with BLM information technology officials in the headquarters unit  near Denver, Colorado, who are responsible for administering the system;  BLM state and field office staff in two states who enter information into the  system; and BLM managers at headquarters and in two states who use  information from the system. In addition, we visited information  technology officials near Denver to discuss the structure and history of  LR2000 and to observe firsthand how data are entered into and processed  by the two subsystems used to manage financial assurances\u2014the Case  Recordation System, which contains information about hardrock  operations, and the Bond and Surety System, which contains information  about financial assurances. Also, in our two surveys of BLM\u2019s 12 state  offices, we asked questions to gather data on whether each respondent  used LR2000 to respond to the survey. Specifically, we asked questions  about whether the information used to respond came from LR2000 or from  state office personnel\u2019s knowledge, field office personnel\u2019s knowledge,  other databases, case files, or other sources. These questions helped us  determine the extent to which BLM officials used and relied on the data in  LR2000.", "It is important to note that the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey introduce various types of errors. Differences in how a particular  question is interpreted and differences in the sources of information  available to respondents can also be sources of survey response errors. We  included steps in both the data collection and data analysis stages to  minimize such errors. These steps included developing our survey  questions with the aid of our survey specialists, conducting pretests of the  questionnaires, and twice verifying the entry of survey data where  applicable.", "In addition to the surveys, we took several steps to understand BLM\u2019s  management and oversight of hardrock operations and the use of financial  assurances to ensure reclamation. We reviewed GAO reports, federal laws  and regulations, BLM documents, and independent studies on hardrock  operations and financial assurances. We also discussed these issues with  BLM officials at headquarters and in selected state and field offices in  Arizona, Montana, Nevada, and Utah. To understand the relationship  between BLM and state agencies responsible for overseeing hardrock  operations, we met with BLM and state agency officials in Colorado and  Nevada, and we reviewed relevant memorandums of understanding and  other documents for these and other states. We also discussed relevant  hardrock operation and financial assurance issues with experts and  representatives from the mining industry, academia, and environmental  groups. Finally, to better understand hardrock operations and reclamation  requirements, we visited five hardrock operations on BLM land in two  states\u2014the Florida Canyon, MacArthur Mine, Olinghouse, and Relief  Canyon operations in Nevada and the Zortman and Landusky operation in  Montana.", "We conducted our review from October 2003 through May 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards,  including an assessment of data reliability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Notice- and Plan-Level Hardrock Operations and Value of Associated Financial Assurances", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides information on the number of notice- and plan-level  operations and dollar value of associated financial assurances for the 12  states with existing hardrock operations as of July 2004, as reported by  BLM."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detailed Information on 48 Hardrock Operations That Had Ceased and Not Been Reclaimed by Operators", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides detailed information obtained from our survey on  the 48 hardrock operations that BLM identified as ceased but not reclaimed  by the operator since BLM began requiring financial assurances.

See agency comments and our evaluation section of this report. 2. See agency comments and our evaluation section of this report. 3. We did not change the title of the report because doing so would  indicate that adequate financial assurances are in place to guarantee  reclamation costs. As we report, this is not the case.  4. We added a sentence to state that plans of operations that were  approved before January 20, 2001, were required to have financial  assurances in place no later than November 20, 2001. 5. We changed the language to state that BLM has the authority to take  steps, such as issuing noncompliance and suspension orders or  revoking plans of operations, if operators do not comply with financial  assurance or other regulatory requirements. 6. The \u201cother\u201d sources of information on hardrock operations that had  ceased and not been reclaimed, as required, are identified in appendix I. 7. We added the National Research Council as one of the other sources  used to develop figure 2. 8. We removed step 5, which described leftover material known as  tailings, from figure 2.  9. We changed the language to clarify that upon recording a mining claim  with BLM, the claimant must pay the fees discussed in our report, and  that the location fee is not paid annually. 10. We did not add this language to this section of the report because we  explain in the background section of the report that BLM requires all  notice- and plan-level hardrock operations to have financial assurances  before exploration or mining operations begin.  11. We clarified the language by adding \u201cnotice- and plan-level\u201d before  hardrock operations. 12. We clarified this sentence in our conclusion to state that \u201cHowever,  while federal regulations and BLM guidance set forth financial  assurance requirements for notice- and plan-level hardrock mining  operations, BLM has no process for ensuring that the regulations and  guidance are effectively implemented to ensure that adequate financial  assurances are in place, as required.\u201d Our report shows that BLM state  offices with hardrock operations reported that, as of July 2004, some  hardrock operations did not have adequate financial assurances.  Furthermore, past experience has shown that some hardrock  operations have ceased without operators having the adequate  financial assurances required by regulations and BLM guidance. We  continue to believe that until BLM establishes monitoring and  accountability mechanisms to ensure that all hardrock operations have  required financial assurances based on sound plans and current cost  estimates, these problems will continue. 13. We did not change this sentence in our conclusion because evidence in  our report shows that LR2000 does not track the critical information  BLM needs to effectively manage financial assurances on hardrock  operations. Specifically, we reported that LR2000 does not track some  critical information, including the operation\u2019s basic status, such as  whether the operation is ongoing or has ceased and should be  reclaimed; some types of financial assurances being used, such as  corporate guarantees, bond pools, and trust funds; and the adequacy of  financial assurances to pay the cost of required reclamation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Andrea Wamstad Brown, Byron S.
