We verified by telephone that the matched firms had federal contracts. We then reviewed Board decisions to identify characteristics of the violations.Finally, we analyzed the GSA database for characteristics of contracts held by these violators in fiscal year 1993.

GSA\u2019s data show that federal contracts in fiscal year 1993 totaled about $182 billion. Approximately 22 percent of the labor force, 26 million workers, is employed by federal contractors and subcontractors, according to fiscal year 1993 estimates of the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).", "Federal law and an executive order place greater responsibilities on federal contractors compared with other employers in some areas of workplace activity. For example, federal contractors must comply with Executive Order 11246, which requires a contractor to develop an affirmative action program detailing the steps that the contractor will take and has already taken to ensure equal employment opportunity for all workers, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In addition, the Service Contract Act and the Davis-Bacon Act require the payment of area-prevailing wages and benefits on federal contracts in the service and construction industries, respectively. NLRA, as amended, provides the basic framework governing private sector labor-management relations. The act, passed in 1935, created an independent agency, NLRB, to administer and enforce the act. Among other duties, NLRB is responsible for preventing and remedying violations of the act\u2014unfair labor practices (ULPs) committed by employers or unions. NLRB\u2019s functions are divided between its Office of the General Counsel and a five-member board. The Office of the General Counsel, organized into 52 field offices in 33 regions, investigates and prosecutes ULP charges. The Board, appointed by the President with Senate approval, reviews all cases decided by administrative law judges (ALJ) in the regions.", "Under Section 8 of the act, it is illegal for employers to interfere with workers\u2019 right to organize or bargain collectively or for employers to discriminate in hiring, tenure, or condition of employment in order to discourage membership in any labor organization; and such behavior is defined as a ULP. After concluding that a violation has been committed, the Board typically requires firms to cease and desist the specific conduct for which a ULP is found. The Board may order a variety of remedies, including requiring the firm to reinstate unlawfully fired workers or restore wages and benefits to the bargaining unit. In some cases, the Board will also issue a broad cease and desist order prohibiting the firm from engaging in a range of unlawful conduct.", "If an employer to whom the federal government owes money (such as a federal contractor) has failed to comply with an order by the Board to restore wages or benefits, the government has the option of withholding from any amount owed to that employer (including payments under a federal contract) any equal or lesser amount that the contractor owes under the Board order. A withholding in this manner is referred to as a collection by administrative offset.", "In addition to the remedies mentioned above, the Congress has considered debarring from federal contracts firms that have violated NLRA in the past. In 1977, legislation that would have debarred firms from federal contracts for a 3-year period for willfully violating NLRA was introduced but was never enacted.", "NLRB has several databases that track cases at different stages of processing. One of NLRB\u2019s databases, the Executive Secretary\u2019s database, tracks all cases that go before the Board. Many of these cases were first heard by an ALJ after an investigation by the Office of the General Counsel\u2019s regional staff determined the case had merit. Cases that go before the Board represent only a small percentage of all ULP cases because most cases are withdrawn, dismissed, or informally settled without being reviewed by the Board.

In 24 cases, firms were ordered to stop threatening employees with the loss of the job or the shutdown of the firm. Firms were ordered in 33 cases to stop other kinds of threats, such as interrogating employees and circulating lists of employees associated with the union.

In addition to Defense, significant contract dollars were awarded to violators by the Department of Energy ($3.7 billion), National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($1.2 billion), and GSA ($702 million). Similarly, these four agencies were the source of most contract dollars (88 percent) to all federal contractors. However, a higher percentage of contract dollars awarded to violators came from the Departments of Defense and Energy as compared with that awarded to all federal contractors from these two agencies. (See app. II, fig. II.5.)", "Most contract dollars\u2014$15.6 billion or 67 percent\u2014went to violators who were primarily engaged in manufacturing. An examination of more detailed violators\u2019 industry codes shows that the highest percentage of contract dollars in manufacturing went toward the production of aircraft parts, guided missiles, and space vehicles. Although manufacturing is the industry in which most violators are engaged, a significant percentage of contract dollars\u201425 percent, about $6 billion\u2014went to companies primarily engaged in providing services. As is the case for violators, most contract dollars to all federal contractors went to firms in the manufacturing and services industries.

By contrast, only 22 violators had 500 or fewer employees and still fewer (5) were so small as to have 25 or fewer employees. For those 64 violators for which annual sales information was available, 32 had more than $1 billion in sales annually. Ten firms had annual sales greater than $10 billion. (See app. II, figs.

This included four firms that received a broad cease and desist order. Cease and desist orders are typically narrow in that they prohibit continuation of the specific conduct found to be unlawful. However, in some cases, the Board issues a broad cease and desist order prohibiting the firm from engaging in a range of unlawful conduct. This may occur when a firm has demonstrated a proclivity to violate the act or when there has been widespread or egregious misconduct. The Board may also issue a broad cease and desist order to cover all of an employer\u2019s facilities or those facilities where a union has jurisdiction if there has been a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct.", "Also among the 12 firms whose Board-ordered remedy was more comprehensive are two firms that received a Gissel bargaining order. The Board imposes a Gissel bargaining order as an extraordinary remedy when the firm has committed ULPs that have made the holding of a fair election unlikely or that have undermined the union\u2019s majority and caused an election to be set aside. Also among the firms whose Board-ordered remedy was more comprehensive, we included 10 firms ordered to cease and desist 10 or more types of unlawful actions against workers. Although these cease and desist orders were narrow, the relatively high number of unlawful actions listed in the Board decision suggest that the firm may be a more serious violator.", "Examples of violators whose Board-ordered remedies were comprehensive relative to remedies in other cases include Monfort of Colorado, Inc., a meat processing firm, which received a broad cease and desist order because of ULPs committed at its facility in Greeley, Colorado. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., was found by the Board to have discriminated against 258 former union employees by applying more rigorous hiring criteria and taking numerous actions against employees to discourage union activity. Waste Management, Inc. (Salt Lake Division), a firm engaged in waste pickup and disposal, received a bargaining order in addition to a broad cease and desist order. The firm had taken numerous actions against employees in a West Jordan, Utah, facility to discourage union activity and created employer-dominated committees during a union organizing drive that it then dissolved after the union lost the election. The Board ordered a Tyson Foods, Inc., facility in Dardanelle, Arkansas, that engaged in poultry processing, to cease and desist 10 or more types of unlawful actions against workers, including \u201cdirecting, controlling, circulating, and assisting in the circulation of a petition\u201d to decertify a union.", "Firms were also considered to be serious violators if their violations affected the job status of more than 20 individual workers, which was true for four firms. These workers had either been unlawfully fired or subjected to some other unfavorable change in their job status; for example, not hired in the first place because of activities for or association with a union.", "For example, Caterair International, a firm that caters food for commercial airlines, was ordered to reinstate 289 workers who were permanently replaced when they lawfully went on strike at three facilities in Los Angeles to protest ULPs committed by the firm. Fluor Daniel, Inc., a general contractor in the construction business, was ordered to hire 53 applicants who the firm discriminatorily refused to hire at several facilities in Kentucky because of their union affiliation. In addition, the Board ordered Fluor Daniel, Inc., to reinstate another employee who was fired because he refused to cross a picket line.", "Another criterion that could identify a serious violator is whether or not the firm has a history of labor law violations. Although we were unable to systematically determine the labor relations record for each of the 80 violators, we were able to determine which of the 15 firms that we had already identified as serious violators also had a history of violations.", "Five of the 15 serious violators had a history of labor law violations, and 3 firms (Beverly Enterprises; Monfort of Colorado, Inc.; and Overnite Transportation Co.) had several prior Board decisions against them.Monfort of Colorado, Inc., for example, received another broad cease and desist order in 1987 for firing two workers because of their union activities at a facility in Grand Island, Nebraska. At this facility, Monfort of Colorado, Inc., was also found to have refused to grant contract-specified wage increases to the bargaining unit, assisted an employer-dominated committee, and promised a bonus to discourage workers\u2019 support for a union.", "Beverly Enterprises, which operates nursing homes, violated the NLRA in additional facilities before its fiscal year 1993 and 1994 violations. For example, in 1986, the Board ordered Beverly Enterprises to bargain with the union and restore wages and benefits that had been unilaterally changed at a nursing home in Waterloo, Iowa. In 1990, the Board found Overnite Transportation Co., a firm engaged in the interstate transportation of freight, to have unlawfully fired one employee at a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, because he gave testimony at a hearing before an ALJ.

For example, a firm might have filed a motion for dismissal of the case. All together, 27 percent of the 176 cases were eliminated after reviewing the Board decisions and appeals cases. (See fig. I.2.)", "Our review of Board cases revealed the range of violations and remedies. We categorized each case by type of violation and remedy, as well as number of workers affected if this information was contained in the Board decision.

Limitations of NLRB\u2019s databases made a comprehensive search for recidivists among all 80 firms too time-consuming to complete during this assignment.

For those matched firms that we had verified, we used variations of the firm name as they appeared in FPDS and corresponding corporate identification codes to retrieve all contracts for fiscal year 1993. We found that it was necessary to report contract data for violators at the parent firm level because (1) the location where the violation occurred did not necessarily appear in FPDS and (2) there was no way to determine which contractor establishment code (CEC) was associated with that location. However, to ensure that all contract information retrieved using GSA\u2019s corporate identification codes went to that parent firm, we checked that the names of divisions, plants, and subsidiaries that were retrieved were, in fact, affiliated with the parent firm.", "Using FPDS, we identified characteristics of the federal contracts. We examined, for example, total contract dollars that went to each violator, federal agencies that they contracted with, the industry in which the firms are engaged, and the products and services these firms provided. Total contract dollars would not include dollars that may have been awarded by primary contractors to subcontractors with violations because we could not identify these subcontractors.", "FPDS classifies the type of industry the firm is engaged in using standard industrial classification (SIC) codes, a federal classification system. To capture what products and services a federal contractor provides, FPDS includes product and services codes. In addition to major categories, more detailed codes are available under both the SIC and product and services coding systems. These detailed codes were useful to our efforts in developing key contract information by individual firm, as reported in appendix III. We also compared contract data for violators on many of these characteristics with all federal contractors.", "Although workforce size and annual sales data were not included on the version of FPDS we used in this review, GSA provided these data at our request. These data are current as of fiscal year 1994. Because GSA did not have data for all 80 firms, we filled in missing data on workforce size with information gathered during our telephone calls to verify matched firms. The firms provided the most current data available, typically fiscal year 1995 data.
