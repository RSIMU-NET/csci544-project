To help manage the environmental impacts of these wells, the Department of the Interior's (Interior) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires oil and gas operators to reclaim disturbed land in a manner it prescribes. To help ensure operators reclaim leased land, BLM requires them to provide a bond before beginning drilling operations. BLM refers to oil and gas wells and leased land that will require reclamation as potential liabilities because BLM may have to pay for reclamation if the operators fail to do so. GAO was asked to determine (1) BLM's policies for managing potential federal oil and gas well liability, (2) the extent to which BLM has implemented these policies, and (3) the challenges, if any, BLM faces in managing potential oil and gas well liability. GAO analyzed agency data on bonding and wells and interviewed BLM officials. We surveyed all 48 BLM field offices with an oil and gas program, and received 33 responses covering these offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To manage potential liability on federal land, BLM has developed policies for reviewing bond adequacy and for managing idle wells (wells that have not produced for at least 7 years) and orphan wells (wells that generally have no responsible or liable parties). The bond adequacy policy is intended to ensure that bonds are regularly reviewed by BLM field offices when certain events occur, or periodically, and increased as necessary to ensure that they reflect the level of risk posed by the operator. BLM's idle and orphan well policy is intended to ensure that nonproducing wells are either plugged or returned to production; this policy directs BLM field offices to develop an inventory of such wells and rank and prioritize them for reclamation based on potential environmental harm, among other things. BLM has not consistently implemented its policies for managing potential liabilities. Specifically, for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, GAO found that 13 of the 33 field office survey respondents reported that they either did not conduct any reviews or did not know the number of reviews conducted. Most field office officials told GAO that a lack of resources and higher priorities were the primary reasons for not conducting these reviews. In addition, BLM state offices also did not consistently interpret BLM policy on when to increase bond amounts. For example, officials in three state offices told GAO that they generally require evidence of operator noncompliance before raising a bond amount, while another state office increased bond amounts for most operators because it viewed them as a potential risk to the government. With regard to reviews of idle or orphan wells, 11 of the 33 field office survey respondents reported that they had not conducted any reviews in one or more fiscal years during the 5-year period GAO examined. The shortage of resources was identified by officials as the primary reason that these reviews were not conducted. In addition, 2 BLM state offices and 22 field offices have not created action plans for reviewing bond adequacy and idle and orphan wells, as BLM policies call for. BLM faces two challenges in managing potential liability, according to field office officials. First, its bonding system impairs BLM's ability to manage potential liability. Specifically, the minimum bond amounts--not updated in more than 50 years--may not be sufficient to encourage all operators to comply with reclamation requirements. These officials also stated that criteria in the policy for deciding when to increase a bond is vague, creating ambiguity about whether a request for an increase should be submitted and whether it will be approved. Second, limitations with the data system BLM uses to track oil and gas information on public land restrict the agency's ability to evaluate potential liability and monitor agency performance. For example, the BLM field offices GAO surveyed reported a total of about 2,300 idle wells that had been inactive for 7 years or more as of fiscal year 2009. However, other Interior data indicate that the number of idle wells on federal land is nearly double the amount reported by the BLM field offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that BLM develop a comprehensive strategy to, among other things, increase minimum bond amounts over time and improve its data system to better evaluate potential liability and agency performance. In commenting on a draft of this report BLM agreed with GAO's recommendations and noted that it has already taken steps to improve the completeness and accuracy of its oil and gas data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The oil and natural gas resources located on federal land are important to  the U.S. energy supply. In fiscal year 2010, wells on federal land produced  11 percent of the nation\u2019s gas supply and 5 percent of the nation\u2019s oil  supply. Due in part to an interest in reducing our nation\u2019s reliance on  foreign energy sources, the number of oil and gas wells on federal land has  increased dramatically in recent years. Of the approximately 93,000 wells  on federal land in fiscal year 2010, roughly 19,000 (about 20 percent) were  drilled within the past 5 years.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Land Management  (BLM) is responsible for managing onshore federal oil and gas resources.  On BLM land, the agency is also responsible for implementing the Federal  Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended, which directs  Interior to manage federal land for multiple uses, such as recreation and  mineral extraction, while also taking any action required to prevent the  \u201cunnecessary or undue degradation\u201d of federal land, including federal land  that has been leased for oil and gas operations.", "To carry out these responsibilities, BLM, among other things, issues leases  to oil and gas operators that require the operators to reclaim the leased  land once operations have ceased. Reclamation is intended to return land  disturbed by oil and gas operations to as close to its original condition as  is reasonably practical, including plugging wells, removing structures, and  reshaping and revegetating the land around the wells. BLM requires that  operators provide a bond to the agency before beginning drilling  operations to ensure that operators reclaim the land that they disturb, as  well as to satisfy the lease\u2019s other terms and conditions.", "All operators are required to complete reclamation, but they do not always  do so. In these circumstances, BLM may use the bond to help defray some  of the cost of completing reclamation. Wells become orphaned if an  operator does not perform the required reclamation and if the bond is not  sufficient to cover well plugging and surface reclamation and there are no  other responsible or liable parties to do so. In these cases, BLM uses  appropriated funds to complete the reclamation.", "BLM is also concerned with the status of idle wells. These are wells that an  operator has decided not to operate for a period of time because, for  example, the operator is waiting for oil and gas prices to rise or for a  pipeline to be constructed. Under certain conditions, BLM must approve a  well\u2019s \u201cidle\u201d status. BLM may also review the adequacy of bond amounts  and the status of idle wells that have not been in production for a period of  time. BLM refers to oil and gas wells and leased land that require  reclamation as potential liabilities because BLM may have to pay for  reclamation if the operators fail to do so. BLM uses its bond adequacy and  idle well status reviews to guide its management of idle wells.", "In this context, you asked us to address a range of issues concerning  BLM\u2019s bonding requirements and efforts to ensure that operators reclaim  federal land after oil and gas operations cease. We have previously  reported on the number, value, and coverage of bonds BLM holds for oil  and gas operations; the amount that BLM has paid to reclaim orphaned  wells over the past 20 years ($3.8 million to reclaim 295 orphaned wells)  and the number of orphaned wells BLM has identified but has not yet  reclaimed (144 orphaned wells); and the bonding requirements of the 12  western states for oil and gas operations on state and private land and  other Interior agencies\u2019 bonding requirements for other resources. This  report provides the results of our work focused on BLM\u2019s policies and  efforts to ensure that the federal government does not have to pay for oil  and gas well reclamation. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) identify  BLM\u2019s policies for managing potential federal oil and gas well liability, (2)  determine the extent to which BLM has implemented these policies, and  (3) identify the challenges, if any, BLM faces in managing potential oil and  gas well liability.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed federal laws and regulations  regarding BLM\u2019s management of leases for onshore oil and gas production.  To identify BLM\u2019s policies for managing potential federal oil and gas  liabilities, we interviewed officials in BLM\u2019s Washington, D.C.,  headquarters office and reviewed and summarized relevant BLM policies.  To determine the extent to which BLM has implemented these policies, we  surveyed all 48 BLM field offices with an oil and gas program to gather  data on their efforts to implement bond adequacy and idle well polices,  including, among other things, the number of bond reviews and idle well  reviews they had conducted. We received responses representing all of the  48 BLM field offices that we surveyed. However, because some field  offices work together to implement these policies by sharing staff  resources, 15 of the 48 field offices combined their responses with that of  another field office, resulting in a total of 33 survey responses covering all  48 offices. In addition, as part of this survey, we asked BLM field offices to  provide additional data on the increases in amounts to existing bonds and  progress made in reducing their inventory of idle wells\u2014that is, having the  wells plugged or returned to production. To identify the number of idle  wells in BLM\u2019s inventory, we obtained oil and gas well production and  injection data, referred to as Oil and Gas Operations Report (OGOR) data,  from Interior\u2019s Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR)\u2014formerly a  component of the Minerals Management Service. We analyzed these data  to determine which wells on federal land were idle and the length of time  since they had last produced oil or gas. To assess the reliability of the  OGOR data, we electronically tested all fields related to our analysis and  met with agency officials who administer the systems, among other things.  We found that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this  report. We then compared these results with the information from BLM\u2019s  Automated Fluid Minerals Support System (AFMSS)\u2014a database that BLM  uses to track oil and gas information on public land. AFMSS contains data  on, among other things, lease ownership and on well identification,  location, and production. To assess the reliability of these data, we  conducted electronic testing and met with BLM officials who administer  the AFMSS database. We also interviewed officials in 16 of the 33 BLM  field offices that have an oil and gas program. These 16 field offices  collectively manage more than 85 percent of the oil and gas wells on  federal land. We also interviewed officials in the corresponding six BLM  state offices that have jurisdiction over these 16 field offices. In these  interviews, we discussed BLM policies, steps these officials had taken to  implement the policies, whether they had fully implemented them, and if  not, the reasons for not doing so. During these interviews, we also  discussed the challenges, if any, BLM field office officials face in managing  their potential reclamation liability. We present data from AFMSS  regarding the number of wells managed by each of the 33 field offices. We  conducted electronic testing of this data and met with BLM officials who  administer the AFMSS database. We believe AFMSS data are sufficiently  reliable for this purpose, although our audit work determined reliability  issues for other AFMSS data used in other contexts. To better understand  the perspectives of operators and their views of BLM bonding  requirements, we interviewed industry officials with the Independent  Petroleum Association of New Mexico and the Interstate Oil and Gas  Compact Commission.

The number of acres covered  by a lease varies: the maximum number covered is 2,560 acres for leases in  the lower 48 states and 5,760 acres for leases in Alaska. Similarly, the  number of wells on a lease can also vary from 1 to more than 1,000, and well  depths can range from a few hundred feet to more than 26,000 feet deep.", "Operators who have obtained a lease must submit an application for a  permit to drill (APD) to BLM before beginning to prepare land or drilling  any new oil or gas wells.

Accordingly, BLM regulations require the operator to submit  a bond in order to ensure compliance with all of the terms and conditions  of the lease, including, but not limited to, paying royalties, plugging wells,  and reclaiming disturbed land. To ensure operators meet legal  requirements, including reclamation, BLM regulations require them to  have one of the following types of bond coverage:  individual lease bonds, which cover all the wells an operator drills under  one lease;    statewide bonds, which cover all of an operator\u2019s leases in one state;    nationwide bonds, which cover all of an operator\u2019s leases in the United  States; or    other bonds, which include both unit operator bonds that cover all  operations conducted on leases within a specific unit agreement, and  bonds for leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.12 13  BLM accepts two types of bonds: surety bonds and personal bonds. A  surety bond is a third-party guarantee that an operator purchases from a  private insurance company approved by the Department of Treasury. The  operator must pay a premium to the surety company to maintain the bond.  These premiums can vary depending on various factors, including the  amount of the bond and the assets and financial resources of the operator,  among other factors. If the operator fails to reclaim the land they disturb,  the surety company either pays the amount of the bond to BLM to help  offset reclamation costs, or in some circumstances, BLM may allow the  surety company to perform the required reclamation. A personal bond  must be accompanied by one of the following financial instruments:    certificates of deposit issued by a financial institution whose deposits are  federally insured, granting the Secretary of the Interior authority to  redeem it in case of default in the performance of the terms and conditions  of the lease;    cashier\u2019s checks;    negotiable Treasury securities, including U.S. Treasury notes or bonds,  with conveyance to the Secretary of the Interior to sell the security in case  of default in the performance of the lease\u2019s terms and conditions; or  irrevocable letters of credit that are issued for a specific term by a  financial institution whose deposits are federally insured and meet certain  conditions.", "Unit agreements refer to multiple lessees who unite to adopt and operate under a single  plan for the development of any oil or gas pool, field, or like area.", "The amount of a unit operator bond is determined on a case-by-case basis by BLM  officials, and the minimum amount of a National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska bond is set  in regulation\u2014not less than $100,000 for a single lease or not less than $300,000 for a  reservewide bond (submitted separately or as a rider to an already existing nationwide  bond).", "If the operator fails to reclaim the land they disturb, BLM redeems the  certificate of deposit, cashes the check, sells the security, or makes a  demand on the letter of credit in order to pay the reclamation costs.", "The regulations establish a minimum bond amount in order to ensure  compliance with all legal requirements.

Enhanced  recovery operations involve, for example, using the well to inject water  into the oil reservoir and push any remaining oil to operating wells. Idle  wells include:    Temporarily abandoned wells. These are wells that are physically or  mechanically incapable of producing oil or gas of sufficient value to  exceed direct operating costs but may have value for a future use.  Operators must receive BLM approval prior to placing a well in  temporarily abandoned status for more than 30 days.

This situation may occur, for example, when an operator has  declared bankruptcy. For orphan wells, BLM uses the bond and  appropriated funds as necessary to complete the reclamation. As we  reported in 2010, according to BLM data, the agency spent a total of about  $3.8 million to reclaim 295 orphan wells in 10 states from fiscal years 1988  through 2009.

BLM policy calls for field offices  to conduct a bond adequacy review when certain events occur. For  example, 13 of the 33 survey respondents reported that they either did not  conduct any reviews or did not know the number of reviews they  conducted for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. For example, the Vernal  Field Office did not conduct any bond adequacy reviews during this  period. According to officials we interviewed in the Vernal Field Office,  they did not have sufficient staff resources to conduct any bond adequacy  reviews, in part because of a backlog in processing APDs. Table 3 shows  the number of bond adequacy reviews conducted by BLM field offices  from fiscal years 2005 through 2009.", "In addition, the total number of bond adequacy reviews conducted by the  field offices varied substantially each year, from a low of 114 in fiscal year  2005 to a high of 693 in fiscal year 2008. BLM officials said that the  fluctuation in the number of reviews is typically the result of a higher  priority placed on other BLM activities such as completing APDs. As table  3 also shows, the bulk of the bond adequacy reviews was conducted by  just a few field offices. In particular, Bakersfield and Miles City conducted  781, or nearly 45 percent, of the total reported 1,760 bond adequacy  reviews conducted by the field offices included in our survey from fiscal  years 2005 through 2009.", "Lack of resources was a recurring theme at many of the 16 field offices  where we interviewed field office staff. For example, officials at 14 field  offices reported that they face resource limitations for conducting bond  adequacy reviews. Officials in seven field offices told us that their offices  had not reviewed bonds in all instances called for in the policy, in part  because of a lack of staff resources. Similarly, at 13 field offices, officials  told us that they found it difficult to conduct bond adequacy reviews  because BLM headquarters and state offices give priority to other work  activities through annual work plans.", "We found that while many field offices use similar methodologies for  evaluating bond adequacy and deciding whether to increase bonds, some  apply other approaches. Some field office officials told us that they  generally rely on their professional judgment to evaluate bond adequacy,  as allowed by BLM policy. These officials said that they typically gather  and evaluate a variety of information, such as the location and depth of the  wells, the ratio of idle wells to active wells, and whether any money is  owed by the operator for previous violations, as well as any other  pertinent or unusual facts regarding the operator or the wells. They then  use their professional judgment to decide (1) whether to keep the current  amount of the bond; (2) work with the operator to reduce the risk the  operator poses, for example, by developing a plan and a schedule to plug  wells or bring wells back into production; or (3) increase the bond.  Officials in two field offices stated that their offices took the following  additional steps when making bond adequacy determinations:    The Carlsbad Field Office evaluated the remaining oil and gas reserves  available and the estimated remaining lifespan of the well\u2014known as the  production decline curve\u2014to determine when the well might become idle.", "The Farmington Field Office developed an electronic spreadsheet for  evaluating potential liability and automating the process of analyzing of  data. The spreadsheet uses formulas to uniformly assess the number,  depth, and production of wells; the bonding amount; the inflation rate; and  operator compliance history. It then identifies whether there is a need to  increase the bond and the amount of the bond increase. Officials in the  Farmington Field Office told us that the goal is to use this spreadsheet to  ensure that all operators are reviewed for bond adequacy at least once  every 2 years.", "According to our analysis, BLM state offices, like the field offices, have  varied in how they interpret BLM\u2019s policy for deciding whether to approve  an increase to a bond amount requested by a field office. As mentioned  earlier, BLM\u2019s 2006 and 2008 bond adequacy policies stated that \u201cBLM is  mindful of the need to maintain an acceptable risk level, yet not to place  an undue burden on industry.\u201d However, the current policy does not  include this statement and none of the policies define the term \u201cacceptable  risk\u201d or offer guidance on when to increase a bond. Instead, the policy  instructs BLM to rely on the judgment of BLM state office officials in  deciding when to increase a bond, and we found that these officials have  varied in their approaches to increasing bond amounts. For example, BLM  state office officials in Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming told us that  they generally interpreted BLM policy as only allowing bond increases  when the operator is not in compliance, among other things. In contrast,  officials in BLM\u2019s California State Office told us that in 2002 they broadly  interpreted BLM regulations and policy as allowing them to increase bond  amounts for all wells identified as a potential risk to the government. In  coordination with the Bakersfield Field Office, they therefore raised the  bond amounts on all but 40 of their more than 300 leases from regulatory  minimum bond amounts to $20,000 for an individual bond and $75,000 for  a statewide bond. In addition, in situations where an operator only has a  nationwide bond, they require the operator to post a rider to the bond to  cover their wells in California.  This is because they were concerned that  nationwide bonds could cover other wells and that other BLM state and  field offices could draw upon them to reclaim orphan wells, leaving the  wells in California without adequate bond coverage. BLM officials in the  California state office were the only state level officials we interviewed  who interpreted the policy in this manner. According to BLM headquarters  officials responsible for overseeing the oil and gas program, the policy was  intended to allow states some flexibility in making these decisions, and  they have not done a comprehensive review of the implementation of the  policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM\u2019s Field Offices Have Not Reviewed All Their Idle and Orphan Wells and Vary in Their Ability to Reduce the Idle Well Inventory", "paragraphs": ["According to our survey of BLM field offices, not all field offices have  conducted reviews to identify wells that were idle or orphan on an annual  basis as specified in BLM policy. In particular, 11 of the 33 survey  responses indicate that many field offices had not conducted reviews for  at least one of the years from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2009, and  16 responses indicate that several did not know how many wells they had  reviewed for at least one of the years during this period. Furthermore,  three field offices\u2014Bakersfield, Farmington, and Worland\u2014had reviewed  76 percent of the 15,660 wells reviewed by the field offices included in our  survey. Table 4 shows the number of wells each field office reviewed  from fiscal years 2005 through 2009.", "BLM field office officials cited a number of reasons why field offices have  not conducted reviews under the idle and orphan well policy. In addition  to the shortage of resources and other higher priority work mentioned  earlier, some officials told us that they do not have access to complete and  accurate well data, which we believe can impact their ability to conduct  well reviews. For example, officials in the Rock Springs Field Office in  Wyoming told us that they rely on BLM\u2019s AFMSS data to determine which  wells are idle. However, BLM officials have told us that well status data in  AFMSS are not routinely updated on the basis of production data, which  makes it difficult to identify idle wells from these data. In contrast, field  offices that rely on well data that are compiled and updated by the state in  which they are located are more easily able to identify idle well status. For  example, the Farmington and Carlsbad field offices in New Mexico have  access to data compiled by the New Mexico Oil Conservation District, a  New Mexico state agency that regulates oil and gas wells. According to  officials we interviewed, these state data are more complete, accurate, and  user-friendly than BLM well data.", "Finally, field offices we surveyed reported mixed results in getting wells  plugged or returned to production. For example, while three field  offices\u2014Buffalo, Carlsbad, and Casper\u2014had plugged or returned to  production more than 100 wells since fiscal year 2007, several offices we  surveyed had not reduced their number of idle or orphan wells. In  addition, officials in the Newcastle Field Office reported that due to  staffing issues they did not know how many wells had been plugged or  returned to production since fiscal year 2007. Table 5 shows the actions  taken by the field offices we surveyed to either plug or return wells to  production since fiscal year 2007.", "Some of the field offices that had taken steps to have wells plugged or  returned to production were assisted by state programs that create funds  for plugging and reclaiming idle and orphan wells. For example, New  Mexico has created an oil and gas well reclamation fund that is paid for by  production taxes on oil and gas operations. Using this fund, the BLM  Carlsbad Field Office has plugged 26 orphan wells from August 1995 to  December 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Few BLM State Offices and Many Field Offices Have Not Created Action Plans for Bond Adequacy and Idle Wells, and the Plans Varied in the Elements They Contain", "paragraphs": ["Two of BLM\u2019s 10 state offices (Alaska and Arizona) have not developed an  action plan to help ensure that bonds are regularly reviewed for adequacy,  as directed by BLM\u2019s policy in IM 2008-122.

Figure 2 shows the current  amounts set in 1951 and 1960 and these amounts adjusted to 2009 dollars.", "According to BLM officials we interviewed at 12 of the 16 field offices,  these minimum bond amounts are inadequate for managing potential  liability. This is because these minimum amounts may not be sufficient to  serve as an incentive to encourage operators to comply with plugging and  reclamation requirements and the cost to plug and reclaim a well site may  far outweigh the value of the bond. For example, these officials told us  that the cost to plug a well ranges from approximately $2.50 to $20 per  foot depth of well and that wells can range from being just a few hundred  feet deep to more than 26,000 feet deep. In addition, the reclamation costs  can range from $200 to $15,000 per acre. In other situations, these officials  noted, the cost to plug and reclaim a single well may cost more than  $100,000, and it can cost more than $10,000 simply to get a work crew to  the well site. Consequently, in most circumstances, a $10,000 individual  lease bond is insufficient to cover the plugging and reclamation costs for  one well, according to the officials we interviewed.", "Given these factors, a few field office officials we surveyed noted that  some operators, particularly small, independent operators with wells  producing only small amounts of oil and gas, may be inclined to declare  bankruptcy and default on the bond rather than pay to properly plug and  reclaim the well site. These officials also told us that raising bond amounts  for these small operators may in some situations make matters worse  because the operators may not be able to provide the higher bond amount,  and BLM\u2019s effort to seek a bond increase may only hasten their decision to  declare bankruptcy. To avoid this situation, BLM officials told us that they  must devote significant time and resources to supervising these small  operators and persuading them to properly plug and reclaim their wells,  which places a drain on staff resources. Officials at 12 of the 16 field  offices reported that they had too few resources to effectively manage  potential liability.", "Officials in 15 of the 16 field offices we interviewed said that they face  challenges conducting bond adequacy reviews.

First, information on idle well status may be  incomplete because BLM policy allows operators to keep wells in a shut-in  status without alerting the field office that the well is not producing.  According to our analysis of AFMSS data, about 1,600, or 32 percent, of the  idle wells we identified from OGOR data are in shut-in status. However,  this number may actually be higher because operators do not have to  notify BLM when they place their well in shut-in status.

OGOR data are based on information directly entered into an  ONRR database by oil and gas operators. ONRR staff conduct data  reliability checks and make corrections as appropriate. BLM officials told  us that the problems with the linkage were addressed on October 1, 2010.  However, even with this link between OGOR and AFMSS, it is still difficult  to reconcile the data from the two systems. Reconciliation requires staff to  manually compare well status data in AFMSS with production data from  OGOR. Officials in BLM field offices told us that this process can be time  consuming, depending on the total number of wells that must be reviewed,  and can involve months of work looking through significant quantities of  data.", "Third, according to some BLM field office officials, while some field  offices have access to other more reliable sources of production data  gathered by state conservation commissions and the global energy  information provider IHS, these data sources also have limitations.

To evaluate the  accuracy and completeness of these data, we compared the information  the field offices provided with the oil and gas well production data,  referred to as Oil and Gas Operation Report (OGOR) data, from Interior\u2019s  Office of Natural Resource Revenue (ONRR)\u2014formerly a component of  the Minerals Management Service\u2014on all wells that had been idle for 1  year or longer. The OGOR data was extracted by ONNR on July 7, 2010.  We present this data of idle wells on federal land, broken out by the  number of years idle, in figure 3. To compare the OGOR data to the data  provided by BLM field offices, we limited our set of OGOR data to cover a  period through fiscal year 2009\u2014the most current year with complete BLM  data. This comparison is presented in table 9. To assess the reliability of  the OGOR data provided by ONRR, among other things, we electronically  tested all elements related to our analysis and met with agency officials  who administer the systems. We found that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report. We analyzed the production data to  determine which wells on federal land are idle and the length of time since  they last produced oil or gas.", "In our Web-based survey, we also requested the BLM field offices to  submit detailed information on requests for increases in bond amounts  from May 1, 2008 to December 16, 2010. We asked the field offices for  information on the amount of the requested increases and the disposition  of the requests. We used this information to determine the total number of  bond increases requested, the value of the requested bond increases, the  percentage of requests that were approved, and the total value of  approved bond increases. We also asked the field offices to provide  information on the wells they have plugged or returned to production  since September 1, 2007. We used this information to determine the  progress BLM field offices have made in reducing their inventory of idle  wells. We also analyzed the information officials in the 16 BLM field  offices provided during our interviews on BLM policies and steps these  officials had taken to implement these policies. If the officials had not fully  implemented the policies, we asked them why they had not done so.", "The practical difficulties of developing and administering a survey may  introduce errors\u2014from how a particular question is interpreted, for  example, or from differences in the sources of information available to  respondents when answering a question. Therefore, we included steps in  developing and administering the survey to minimize such errors. We  obtained comments on a draft of the survey from officials in BLM\u2019s  Washington, D.C., headquarters office. We also pretested the survey in  person at three BLM field offices\u2014Bakersfield, California, and Carlsbad  and Farmington, New Mexico. We conducted these pretests to check that  (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) terminology was used  correctly, (3) the information could feasibly be obtained, and (4) the  survey was comprehensive and unbiased. We made changes to the content  and format of the Web-based survey after these pretests, based on the  feedback we received.", "To identify the challenges BLM faces in managing potential liabilities, we  analyzed the information officials in the 16 BLM field offices and the  corresponding six state offices provided during our interviews on what  challenges they face, if any, in implementing BLM policies for managing  the potential liability on federal land; whether they had sufficient tools and  resources to implement the policies; and what their views were on BLM\u2019s  bonding system and minimum bonding amounts.", "To assess challenges related to the electronic data available to BLM  officials when evaluating and managing potential oil and gas liabilities, we  requested electronic data, including OGORs from ONRR and data on bond  adequacy reviews and idle well reviews from BLM\u2019s Automated Fluid  Minerals Support System (AFMSS). The OGOR data was extracted by  ONNR on July 7, 2010. The AFMSS data was extracted by BLM on March  17, 2010; May 26, 2010; and October 1, 2010. First, we analyzed the OGOR  and AFMSS data to count the number of idle wells (i.e., wells that have not  produced for 7 years more) as of fiscal year 2009 for each field office, and  we compared these data with idle well data provided by the 33 field offices  we surveyed. We also grouped the idle wells we identified by the number  of years they have remained idle. Second, we counted the number of bond  adequacy reviews and idle well reviews in AFMSS and compared them  with the number of reviews reported by the BLM field offices in our Web- based survey. Third, to determine the number of well records without  bond numbers, we selected current well records in AFMSS without any  information on their associated bond numbers and counted them by their  unique 10-digit American Petroleum Institute number to identify individual  wells that could not be easily associated with a bond.", "We present data from AFMSS regarding the number of wells managed by  each of the 33 field offices. We believe AFMSS data are sufficiently reliable  for this purpose although our audit work determined reliability issues for  other AFMSS data used in other contexts.", "To better understand the perspectives of operators regarding BLM  bonding requirements, we interviewed industry officials with the  Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico and the Interstate Oil  and Gas Compact Commission.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 to February 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Andrea Wamstad Brown  (Assistant Director), Jeffrey B.
