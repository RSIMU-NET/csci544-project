The small fleet of 186 F-22s is central to the Air Force's ability to accomplish its air superiority mission in high threat areas. While the Air Force has focused on other missions over the last 15 years of conflict, it is now trying to refocus on overcoming advanced threats, even as it continues to support ongoing operations. Though the recent introduction of the F-35 gives the Air Force another advanced fighter, the F-35 is primarily designed for the air-to-ground missions and so is intended to complement but not replace the F-22.", "Senate Report 114-255 included a provision for GAO to review a variety of issues related to Air Force F-22 fighter squadrons.

Information DOD deemed classified or sensitive has been omitted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force's organization of its small F-22 fleet has not maximized the availability of these 186 aircraft. Availability is constrained by maintenance challenges and unit organization. For example, stealth is a central feature of the F-22 and, according to Air Force officials, maintaining the stealth coating on the outside of the aircraft is time consuming and significantly reduces the time F-22s are available for missions. Maintenance availability challenges are exacerbated by the Air Force's decision to organize the F-22 fleet into small units\u201418 or 21 primary mission aircraft per squadron and one or two squadrons per wing. Traditional fighter wings have three squadrons per wing with 24 aircraft in each squadron, which creates maintenance efficiencies because people, equipment, and parts can be shared, according to Air Force officials. Moreover, the Air Force organized F-22 squadrons to operate from a single location. However, it generally deploys only a part of a squadron, and the remaining part struggles to keep aircraft available for missions at home. Larger, traditional Air Force squadrons and deployable units provide a better balance of equipment and personnel, according to service officials. The Air Force has not reassessed the structure of its F-22 fleet since 2010. Without conducting a comprehensive assessment to identify and assess F-22 organization, the Air Force may be foregoing opportunities to improve the availability of its small yet critical F-22 fleet, and support combatant commander air superiority needs in high threat environments.", "The Air Force's utilization of its F-22 fleet has limited pilot opportunities to train for air superiority missions in high threat environments. To complete the annual training requirements for air superiority missions, F-22 pilots must train almost the entire year. However, F-22 pilots are not meeting their minimum yearly training requirements for the air superiority missions, according to Air Force training reports and service officials. Moreover, the utilization of F-22s for exercises and operational missions that do not require the F-22's unique capabilities interrupt pilot training and lead to reduced proficiency. For example, F-22 units are often directed to participate in partnership building exercises. However, during these exercises, F-22 pilots may be restricted from flying the F-22 the way they would fly it in combat\u2014due to security concerns about exposing the F-22's unique capabilities. These restrictions limit the value of the exercises and can result in pilots developing bad habits, according to Air Force officials. The Air Force also uses F-22s to support alert missions\u2014a mission that requires certain bases to have jets ready at all times to respond to threats from civil or military aviation. The alert mission does not require the advanced capabilities of the F-22, but there are no other operational Air Force fighter squadrons currently based at the F-22 locations in Alaska and Hawaii, so the alert mission falls to the F-22 units. Pilots and aircraft assigned to the alert mission cannot be used for any other purposes, including training. This limits opportunities for pilots to enhance air superiority skills. Without examining and implementing options to improve F-22 pilot training opportunities, the Air Force may be foregoing opportunities to improve its capability to address the high-end air superiority challenges it expects to face."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Air Force reassess its F-22 organizational structure to determine alternative approaches to organizing F-22 squadrons, and identify ways to increase F-22 pilot training opportunities for high-end air superiority missions.

Potential adversaries around the world are pursuing  technologies and strategies that are reducing the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) relative advantage in a number of areas, according to  the department, including air superiority\u2014a primary mission for the Air  Force. Air superiority is established when the air and missile threat is  reduced to a degree that other operations can occur without significant  interference. As such, the Air Force considers it a precondition for  success of combat operations, and therefore a mission it must address  first. However, fourth generation fighters are increasingly unable to  operate in highly contested environments where advanced air defense  systems render them ineffective, according to the Air Force.  A linchpin  in the Air Force\u2019s ability to establish air superiority in highly contested  environments is its small fleet of F-22s. With a unique combination of  advanced stealth and maneuvering capabilities, the F-22 is designed to  achieve air superiority against the most advanced air and surface threats.  The Air Force currently uses a variety of fourth generation fighters, and  plans to use F-35s for the air superiority mission since F-22 units  constitute only 6 of the Air Force\u2019s 55 combat coded fighter squadrons.", "Over the past 15 years, U.S. air superiority has largely gone  unchallenged, so it has not been a main focus during ongoing operations.

We determined that the reliability of these data were sufficient  for the purposes of describing general trends and making proximate  comparisons. We also analyzed pilot training information, including yearly  memorandums produced by the F-22 operational squadrons for years  2012 through 2016. We also conducted on-site interviews with Air Force  officials from Air Force Headquarters; Air Combat Command; Air National  Guard; Air Force Reserve Command; the four locations with operational  F-22 squadrons; the training unit; and the operational test and evaluation  unit. We discussed how unit organization affects aircraft availability and  the units\u2019 abilities to maintain their aircraft in both the short and long term,  as well as how F-22 utilization affects pilot training for the air superiority  mission. We also discussed issues regarding the need for aircraft that  play the role of adversaries for F-22 training purposes, known as  adversary air. To examine how operational utilization of the F-22 affects  the fleet\u2019s ability to support air superiority, we reviewed mission  assignments and deployment information for F-22 squadrons. We also  interviewed officials from U.S. Central Command, U.S. European  Command, U.S. Northern Command/North American Aerospace Defense  Command, and U.S. Pacific Command, regarding F-22 requirements and  utilization.

The F-22 is optimized for air-to-air combat, able to carry up to eight air-to- air missiles, and equipped with a 20-millimeter cannon. After development  began, the Air Force also added air-to-ground capabilities to the F-22. Air  Force officials emphasized the synergistic benefits of the F-22 to the joint  force. Specifically, the F-22\u2019s individual capabilities, like its stealth and  sensors, help it to coordinate and improve the performance of other  aircraft during operations, including fourth generation fighters. The Air  Force views the F-22 and the F-35\u2014its other fifth generation fighter\u2014as  complementary platforms with some overlapping capabilities. For  example, the F-22 is focused on, and more capable in, air-to-air missions  and the F-35 is focused on, and more capable in, air-to-ground missions.  The Air Force announced in its fiscal year 2018 budget request that it now  intends to retain the F-22 until 2060.

The Air Force F-22 acquisition program began in 1991 with an  intended development period of 12 years and a planned quantity of 648  aircraft. The Air Force had intended to station 40 percent of the  operational fleet outside of the United States. However, schedule delays,  cost increases, and changes to threats, missions, and requirements led  DOD to reduce the number of F-22s it eventually purchased. The Air  Force identified a requirement for 381 F-22s in 2002, but ended aircraft  production in 2012 with approximately half of that number. As of May  2018, the Air Force had a total of 186 F-22s, as shown in figure 2.

The maintenance demands of the F- 22\u2019s Low Observable (LO) coating, a critical component of its stealth  characteristic, reduces aircraft availability. Without the LO maintenance  issues, availability would have been significantly closer to meeting the  annual availability standard, according to the Air Force officials. Fourth  generation fighters do not have to contend with this maintenance issue.  The F-22\u2019s LO coating is actually a series of coatings that require diligent  and time-consuming application and curing, which results in extended  periods of time when the aircraft are not available, according to Air Force  officials. The F-22\u2019s LO coating is also beginning to reach the end of its  service live, requiring maintenance actions that further reduce aircraft  availability. The Air Force has begun to address these maintenance  issues by using a more durable coating and standing up additional repair  facilities.", "Second, the F-22 faces a number of supply challenges that have  contributed to reduced and unpredictable aircraft availability. Officials  from all four operational locations expressed concerns over low supply  levels and difficulties with obtaining needed parts. The F-22 fleet\u2019s small  size and resulting low demand for parts contributes to this problem.  Obtaining missing parts can be a time-consuming and costly process  because some original manufacturers no longer make the parts or are  completely out of business, according to Air Force officials.

The Air Force is planning to organize its active duty F-35 fleet into  traditional sized squadrons with 2 or 3 squadrons per wing. A RAND  study also concluded that larger squadrons and multiple squadrons per  wing create efficiencies. Larger squadrons and wings create efficiencies  because people, equipment, and parts can be shared, according to Air  Force officials. Having a multi-squadron wing is also beneficial when one  squadron deploys a portion of its aircraft, pilots, and maintenance  personnel and leaves another portion of the squadron at the squadron\u2019s  home station. In these cases, collocated squadron(s) can help backfill  shortfalls for the portion of the squadron that remained at home station.", "The Air Force recognizes that smaller F-22 operational squadrons and  wings face sustainment challenges due to their size. Facing cuts in the  total number of aircraft purchased, the Air Force decided in 2006 to  organize its F-22s into 7 operational squadrons, each with 18 primary  mission aircraft. However, in 2010, the Air Force found that this plan was  unsustainable because operational squadrons were not able to produce  adequate sorties. The Air Force then decided to eliminate 1 squadron and  used some of the aircraft from that squadron to increase the number of  primary mission aircraft to 21 in its 5 remaining active duty squadrons.  The Air Force left its one F-22 National Guard squadron with only 18  primary mission aircraft. The Air Force\u2019s intent with this restructuring was  to increase fleet sustainability while retaining enough squadrons for force  projection needs.", "F-22 aircraft availability metrics have fluctuated, but have generally been  better for operational locations with more aircraft per squadron and more  squadrons per wing.

However, due  to security concerns regarding exposing the F-22\u2019s unique capabilities, F- 22 pilots may be restricted from flying the aircraft the way they would in  combat, according to Air Force officials. As a result, the value of the  training is reduced and these types of exercises can result in the F-22  pilots developing bad habits that must be corrected in future training,  according to Air Force officials.", "The Air Force recognizes that exercise demands on F-22 units and other  fighter units make it difficult for pilots to complete their required training.  Based on its analysis, the Air Force is planning to increase the time pilots  have available to conduct home station training, including by establishing  a goal of no more than 1 day on travel for every 5 days at home station.  As a result, the Air Force will be reducing total exercise participation and  thereby increasing the number of days F-22 pilots are at home station in  fiscal year 2018 by 8 days. However, the Air Force projects that F-22  pilots in fiscal year 2018 will still fall 71 days short of the 270 days they  need to meet their yearly training requirement, based on current aircraft  availability rates. Without exploring further reductions in exercise events  that do not contribute to high-end air superiority training, at current aircraft  availability rates F-22 pilots may not be fully prepared to effectively  support combatant commander needs against the most advanced threats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adversary Air Demands for F-22s Detract from the Ability of Pilots to Meet Training Requirements", "paragraphs": ["F-22 pilot training requires flying against aircraft playing the role of  adversaries, but high demand and low supply of adversary air resources  have resulted in training shortfalls. Due to the F-22\u2019s unique air superiority  role and high-end capabilities, the Air Force expects F-22 pilots to face  and defeat numerically superior adversaries. This results in an annual  demand of between 145 and 171 adversary air sorties for every  operational F-22 pilot. The adversary air demand for fourth generation  fighters is much lower. For example, continuation training for the Air  Force\u2019s other air superiority fighter\u2014the F-15C\u2014results in an annual  demand of between 45 and 73 adversary air sorties. To support F-22  training requirements, the Air Force has provided two of the four  operational locations (Virginia and Florida) with a squadron of T-38s to  provide dedicated adversary air support for use in training. In Alaska, an  adversary air squadron is located at a nearby base that is able to provide  some support for F-22 training, according to officials. The F-22s in Hawaii  have no adversary air support on base or nearby. Figure 5 shows F-22  operational locations and their adversary air support.", "All F-22 operational locations report that insufficient adversary air caused  pilots to have shortfalls in their training. For example, the operational F-22  squadron in Florida, which shares an adversary air squadron with a  collocated F-22 training unit, reported that F-22 pilot training deficiencies  in fiscal year 2016 were caused in part by limited adversary air support.  Specifically, adversary air shortfalls negatively impacted the training of 83  percent of the squadron\u2019s pilots for the offensive counter-air mission and  54 percent of the pilots for the defensive counter-air mission. Operational  squadrons at other locations reported similar negative effects on training  caused in part by the limited adversary air.", "Moreover, the limited supply of dedicated adversary aircraft means that  often F-22 pilots must fly their aircraft in an adversary aircraft role to  support the training of the squadron\u2019s other F-22 pilots. For example,  according to a 2017 Air Force memo, 55 percent of all sorties generated  by F-22s based in Hawaii were dedicated to adversary air. The F-22  squadron in Hawaii reported that this practice negatively affected the  combat readiness of all of the squadron\u2019s pilots. The Air Force  categorizes adversary air sorties as useful only for maintaining basic  flying proficiency. Officials from the Virginia unit explained that F-22 pilots  flying adversary air do not fly like they would during combat missions and  so these sorties are wasteful, having no or negative training value. An  official representing the Hawaii unit indicated that the high percentage of  sorties dedicated to adversary air leads to wasteful training and declines  in readiness against potential threats. Air Force officials expect  competing demands for limited adversary air to grow as the Air Force  stands up more F-35 squadrons.", "The Air Force recognizes and is attempting to mitigate adversary air  shortfalls. For example, the Air Force has hired contractors to address  Air Force adversary air shortfalls at exercises, as we previously  reported. In addition, the Air Force has outlined a plan to provide  additional adversary air support for its fighter units, including contract  adversary air support for the F-22 training squadron in Florida and the  operational squadrons at two of the four operational locations (Virginia  and Hawaii) in the 2019 timeframe. However, the Air Force must first  complete additional analysis and finalize funding before additional  adversary support is provided to these locations, according to an August  2017 Air Force briefing on the plan. Until the Air Force explores  additional alternatives for increasing external adversary air training  support at all of the operational locations, F-22 pilots will likely continue to  face training shortfalls and use limited sorties on flying adversary air  themselves.

Limitations on F-22 availability  are due in part to maintenance challenges inherent to the F-22, including  maintaining its LO coating. It is also due in part to Air Force decisions to  organize the F-22 fleet into small wings and squadrons, resulting in lost  efficiencies that come with larger organizations. Further, F-22 squadrons,  designed to operate from one location, face challenges generating  available aircraft when they are split, as current Air Force practices and  future concepts require. The Air Force also requires well-trained pilots in  order to take full advantage of the F-22\u2019s high-end capabilities. However,  F-22 pilots\u2019 ability to train for its air superiority missions and meet  associated training requirements is constrained by factors including  adversary air limitations and participation in exercises with limited training  value.

Air Force efforts to improve  F-22 capabilities and maintainability and wider efforts to address high  exercise demand and adversary air shortfalls are examples of positive  steps the service is taking. The Air Force has also shown a prior  willingness to consolidate its F-22 fleet. Further, the Air Force outlined its  commitment to addressing high-end air superiority challenges in its Air  Superiority 2030 Flight Plan. This effort, along with the planned fielding of  a large number of F-35s provides the Air Force with the opportunity to  more comprehensively review and, if necessary, transform how it should  best organize, posture, train, and utilize its fifth generation assets,  including the F-22. However, unless the Air Force takes steps to assess  and make necessary adjustments to the current organization and use of  its F-22s, F-22 units are likely to continue to experience aircraft  availability and pilot training rates that are below what they could be.

Without the LO maintenance issues, availability would have  been significantly closer to meeting the annual availability standard,  according to Air Force officials. Fourth generation fighters, lacking a full  LO coating, do not have to contend with this maintenance issue. The LO  coating is actually a series of coatings that require diligent and time- consuming application and curing, resulting in extended periods of time  during which aircraft are not available, according to Air Force officials.  Further, the LO coating for each F-22 requires regular and thorough  inspection to ensure that any damaged or degraded areas are identified  and repaired. If damage to the LO coating exceeds a threshold, the F-22  is considered not capable of conducting its mission. An Air Force report  summarizing fiscal year 2016 maintenance issues reported that LO  maintenance was the primary reason F-22s were not considered mission  capable due to maintenance.", "Maintaining the integrity of the LO coating complicates other F-22  maintenance actions because the LO coating must be removed and then  restored. According to Air Force officials, removing and replacing a part  on an F-22 and a fourth generation fighter, like an F-15C, could take a  similar amount of time. However, the F-22 would require additional time at  the beginning and end of the maintenance action to gain access to the  part through the LO coating and then restore the integrity of the coating,  significantly increasing the time aircraft would be unavailable due to  maintenance. The Air Force is taking steps to reduce the impact of LO  maintenance by, for example, creating panels that can be removed  without requiring a full recoating procedure and by developing a more  durable coating. Additionally, Air Force officials told us that the LO coating  for its other fifth generation fighter\u2014the F-35\u2014uses different materials  and processes and should be easier to maintain than the F-22\u2019s LO.", "The F-22\u2019s LO coating is also beginning to reach the end of its service  life, requiring maintenance actions that further reduce aircraft availability.  According to Air Force officials, the LO coating has an 8-to-10 year life  span, but environmental factors such as high temperatures, humidity, and  salinity can reduce that span by 2 to 3 years. Further, the Air Force does  not house its F-22s in climate-controlled hangars at 3 of the 4 operational  locations (Florida, Hawaii, and Virginia), thus exposing them to these LO- degrading environmental factors.

The second option, called cannibalization, is an inefficient way to  conduct maintenance because it doubles the work. A good part needs to  be removed from one aircraft and put into another. Once the replacement  part arrives, it needs to be installed on the cannibalized aircraft. There is  also a chance that the cannibalized part could get damaged in the  process or just not work. Further, cannibalization could result in additional  LO repairs on the donor aircraft. An Air Force report summarizing fiscal  year 2016 maintenance issues reported that F-22 cannibalization rates  have grown by 6 percent between fiscal years 2012 and 2016.", "The F-22\u2019s small fleet size also exacerbates supply challenges it is facing  with its engines, potentially falling below minimum spare part  requirements for multiple calendar years. Further, an increase in flying  hours in 2014 resulted in engines requiring overhauls sooner than  previously anticipated. It is taking time for the engine maintenance  contractor to build up enough capacity to deal with this increased  demand. The officials said that the F-22\u2019s small fleet size contributed to  this problem because, as was the case with other parts issues, low early  demand meant that many of the vendors that built parts for those engines  no longer build the parts or are not in business. Additionally, it takes time  to find vendors and skilled people to build those parts again. The Air  Force is implementing a mitigation plan that includes increasing  production, overflying the standard engine maintenance interval, and  borrowing engines from aircraft in long-term maintenance. According to  Air Force officials, this kind of engine issue is not unique to the F-22.  They noted that there was a time when B-1s, another small fleet, had a  major engine shortfall that resulted in aircraft parked without engines in  them.
