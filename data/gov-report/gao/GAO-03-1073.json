For example, the policy employs a new independent cost estimating process, independent program reviews performed by space experts not connected with the program, and more rigorous analyses of alternatives, requirements, and system interdependencies. This information may help decision-makers assess whether gaps exist between expectations and what the program can deliver. However, the benefits that can be derived from these tools will be limited since the new policy does not alter DOD's practice of committing major investments before knowing what resources will be required to deliver promised capability. Instead, the policy encourages development of leading edge technology within product development, that is, at the same time the program manager is designing the system and undertaking other product development activities. As our work has repeatedly shown, such concurrency increases the risk that significant problems will be discovered as the system is integrated and built, when it is more costly and time-consuming to fix them. Moreover, when even one technology does not mature as expected, the entire program can be thrown off course since time and cost for invention cannot be reliably estimated. DOD's new acquisition policy for its other weapon systems recognizes these risks and consequently requires technology and product development to be done separately."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is spending more than $18 billion  annually to develop, acquire, and operate satellites and other space-related  systems.

It expects to finalize the policy this fiscal year. The  policy is similar to the one used by the National Reconnaissance Office  (NRO). The policy is different from a new acquisition management policy  DOD is implementing for most other weapons-related acquisitions in  several respects.", "Key decisions, including the decision to start product development and  to start building and testing a satellite, will be made earlier in the  development process. According to DOD, this is because satellites  incur most of their costs during the early phases of development.", "The decision to build and produce a satellite will be made at the same  time instead of sequentially. According to DOD, this is because satellites  are produced in very small numbers as compared to other acquisitions.", "Figure 1 provides an overview of differences in key decision points.", "The new space acquisition policy is also different than DOD\u2019s policy for  other weapon systems in terms of decision-making support. For example,  the new policy has created an advisory board distinct from the DOD\u2019s  Defense Acquisition Board (DAB). The Defense Space Acquisition Board  (DSAB), comprised of senior-level DOD officials and mission partners,  will advise the Under Secretary of the Air Force, as the milestone decision  authority, on whether significant investments should move forward in the  development process. Also, temporary Independent Program Assessment  teams (IPA) will be used to conduct an intensive review before key  decisions are made. Under DOD\u2019s process for other weapon systems,  standing Integrated Product Teams (IPT) are used to help programs  conduct key analyses as well as to advise the DAB. Table 1 provides more  details on these differences.", "DOD is already applying this new process to major satellite programs,  including the Space-Based Infrared System (High) (SBIRS-High), the  Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT), the Advanced  Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) system, the Mobile User Objective  System (MUOS), the Global Positioning System (GPS), the National  Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS),  and the Space-Based Radar (SBR) system.

Several programs were  restructured by DOD in the face of delays and cost growth. We have found  that these problems, which are common among many weapon systems,  are largely rooted in a failure to match the customer\u2019s needs with the  developer\u2019s resources\u2014technical knowledge, timing, and funding\u2014when  starting product development. In other words, commitments were made to  satellite launch dates and achieving certain capabilities without knowing  whether technologies being pursued could really work as intended.

Doing otherwise could  result in losing a customer in the short term and losing the company in  the long term. Thus, these firms have adopted practices that put their  individual program managers in a good position to succeed in meeting  these expectations on individual products. Collectively, these practices  ensure that a high level of knowledge exists about critical facets of the  product at key junctures during its development and is used to deliver  capability as promised. While DOD is different from the commercial  world in terms of its need to push for cutting edge technology to maintain  military superiority, its policies for major weapon systems recognize that  maturing technology outside of product development allows needed  stability in executing budgets and allows capability to be delivered to the  warfighter sooner.", "Our reviews have shown that there are three critical junctures at  which firms must have knowledge to make large investment decisions.  First, before product development is started, a match must be made  between the customer\u2019s needs and the available resources\u2014technical  and engineering knowledge, time, and funding. Second, a product\u2019s  design must demonstrate its ability to meet performance requirements  and be stable about midway through development. Third, the  developer must show that the product can be manufactured within cost,  schedule, and quality targets and is demonstrated to be reliable before  production begins.", "The process is building block in nature as the attainment of each  successive knowledge point builds on the proceeding one. While the  knowledge itself builds continuously without clear lines of demarcation,  the attainment of knowledge points is sequential. In other words,  production maturity cannot be attained if the design is not mature, and  design maturity cannot be attained if the key technologies are not mature.", "In applying the knowledge-based approach, the most leveraged decision  point of the three junctures is matching the customer\u2019s needs with the  developer\u2019s resources. This initial decision sets the stage for the eventual  outcome\u2014desirable or problematic. The match is ultimately achieved in  every development program, but in successful development programs, it  occurs before product development. In successful programs, negotiations  and trade-offs occur before product development is started to ensure that  a match exists between customer expectations and developer resources.  Technologies that are not mature continue to be developed in the  technology base (for example, a research laboratory). With achievable  requirements and commitment of sufficient investment to complete the  development, programs are better able to deliver products at cost and  on schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In DOD, Match between Resources and Requirements Is Seldom Achieved at Start of Product Development", "paragraphs": ["Our past work has shown that space programs have not typically achieved  a match between requirements and resources before starting product  development. Product development was often started based on a rigid  set of requirements that proved to be unachievable within a reasonable  development time frame. At times, even more requirements were added  after the program began. When problems arose, adding resources in terms  of time and money became the primary option for solving problems, since  customer expectations about the product\u2019s performance had already  become hardened. For example:    After starting its AEHF satellite program, DOD substantially and frequently  changed requirements. In addition, after the failure of one of DOD\u2019s legacy  communications satellites, DOD decided to accelerate its plans to build  AEHF satellites. The contractors proposed, and DOD accepted, a high risk  schedule that turned out to be overly optimistic and highly compressed,  leaving little room for error and depending on a chain of events taking  place at certain times. Moreover, at the time DOD decided to accelerate  the program, it did not have funding needed to support the activities and  manpower needed to design and build the satellites quicker. The effects of  DOD\u2019s inability to match requirements to resources were significant. Cost  estimates produced by the Air Force reflected an increase from $4.4 billion  in January 1999 to $5.6 billion in June 2001\u2014a difference of 26 percent.  Although considered necessary, many changes to requirements were  substantial, leading to cost increases of hundreds of millions of dollars  because they required major design modifications. Also, schedule delays  occurred when some events did not occur on time, and additional delays  occurred when the program faced funding gaps. Scheduling delays  eventually culminated into a 2-year delay in the launch of the first satellite.  We also reported that there are still technical and production risks that  need to be overcome in the AEHF program, such as a less-than-mature  satellite antenna system and complications associated with the production  of the system\u2019s information security system.", "The SBIRS-High contract for engineering, manufacturing and  development amounted to $2.4 billion. In the fall of 2001, DOD identified  cost growth of $2 billion or more, triggering a mandatory program review  and recertification under 10 U.S.C. section 2433. Currently, SBIRS-High is  under contract for $4.4 billion. We reported that when DOD\u2019s SBIRS-High  satellite program began in 1994, none of its critical technologies were  mature. Moreover, according to a DOD-chartered independent review  team, the complexity, schedule, and resources required to develop  SBIRS-High, in hindsight, were misunderstood when the program began.", "This led to an immature understanding of how requirements translated  into detailed engineering solutions. Even though the program was  restructured by DOD, the independent review team noted that SBIRS-High  still faced significant risks.", "DOD has initiated several programs and spent several billion dollars over  the past 2 decades to develop low-orbiting satellites that can track ballistic  missiles throughout their flight. However, it has not launched a single  satellite to perform this capability. We have reported that a primary  problem affecting these programs was that DOD and the Air Force did not  relax rigid requirements to more closely match technical capabilities that  were achievable. Program baselines were based on artificial time and/or  money constraints. Over time, it became apparent that the lack of  knowledge of program challenges had led to overly optimistic schedules  and budgets that were funded at less than what was needed. Attempts to  stay on schedule by approving critical milestones without meeting  program criteria resulted in higher costs and more slips in technology  development efforts. For example, our 1997 and 2001 reviews of DOD\u2019s  $1.7 billion SBIRS-Low program showed that the program would enter  into the product development phase with critical technologies that were  immature and with optimistic deployment schedules. Some of these  technologies were so critical that SBIRS-Low would not be able to perform  its mission if they were not available when needed. DOD eventually  restructured the SBIRS-Low program because of the cost and scheduling  problems, and it put the equipment it had partially built into storage. In  view of the program\u2019s mismatch between expectations and what it  could achieve, the Congress directed DOD to restructure the program  (now known as the Space Tracking and Surveillance System or STSS) as a  research and development effort.", "We recently reported on crosscutting factors that make it more difficult  for DOD to achieve a match between resources and requirements for  space acquisitions. In particular, space programs often involve a diverse  array of organizations with competing interests involved in overall  satellite development\u2014from the individual military services, to testing  organizations, contractors, civilian agencies, and in some cases, even  international partners and industry. This creates challenges in making  tough tradeoff decisions.", "In addition, like other weapon programs, space acquisition programs  have historically attempted to satisfy all requirements in a single step,  regardless of the design challenge or the maturity of technologies to  achieve the full capability. This approach has made it more difficult to  match requirements to available resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Space Policy May Help Increase Insight into Gaps between Requirements and Resources", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s new space acquisition oversight process may help increase insight  into gaps between requirements and resources. In particular, tools being  adopted, such as technology readiness assessments, alternatives analyses,  and independent cost estimates, may help provide more consistent and  robust information on technologies, requirements, and costs. However, the  value of these tools depends largely on whether or not the knowledge is  used to make decisions. According to DOD officials, similar tools are also  being adopted by other weapon system programs.", "First, DOD is requiring that all space programs conduct technology  maturity assessments before key oversight decisions to assess the  maturity level of technology.  One tool used by many weapon systems is  known as Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). The tool associates  different TRLs with different levels of demonstrated performance, ranging  from paper studies to proven performance on the intended product. The  value of using a tool based on demonstrated performance is that it can  presage the likely consequences of incorporating a technology at a given  level of maturity into a product development, enabling decision-makers to  make informed choices. The tool is even more valuable if it is commonly  used.  Our previous reviews have found the use of TRLs to be a best  practice. (App. II describes TRL levels.)", "Second, DOD is requiring space programs to more rigorously assess  alternatives, consider how their systems will operate in the context of  larger families of systems, and think through operational, technical, and  system requirements before programs are started. For example, programs  will be required to develop an architecture that specifies the structure of  system components, their relationships, and the principles and guidelines  governing their design and evolution over time.", "It is important for DOD to increase attention to requirements earlier in the  acquisition process and force DOD to think through whether there are  more cost-effective alternatives to pursue. A recent DOD study found that  understanding of requirements often occurs too late to affordably change  the system and, more specifically, that space programs do not always  understand how systems fit in with other systems with which they need  to interact and that often a lack of mutual understanding of requirements  exists between the government and contractors. The SBIRS independent  review team also found a need across space programs for more rigorous  up front development of requirements. In addition, in previous reviews,  we found that space programs often do not examine potentially more  cost-effective approaches. In 2001, for example, we reported that  DOD\u2019s SBIRS-Low program was not adequately analyzing alternatives to  SBIRS-Low that could satisfy critical missile defense requirements, such as  Navy ship-based radar capability. At the time, other studies supported the  possibility that other types of sensors could be used to track missiles in  the midcourse of their flight and to cue interceptors.", "Third, the new policy seeks to improve the accuracy of cost estimates by  establishing an independent cost estimating process in partnership with  DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG) and by adopting  methodologies and tools used by the NRO. To ensure timely cost analyses,  the CAIG will augment its own staff with cost estimating personnel drawn  from across the entire national security space cost estimating community,  including cost estimating teams belonging to the intelligence communities,  the Air Force, NRO, the Army, and the Navy. The policy also calls on  programs to produce performance metrics that compare estimated to  actual costs. The policy allows programs to request assistance from the  CAIG for purposes other than DSAB reviews. However, there is no point in  the process that requires DOD to commit to fully fund a space program.", "Improving reliability of cost estimates is critical. Several of our studies\u2014 such as ones on GPS, Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), and  AEHF\u2014have called attention to problems with estimating system costs,  such as errors, omissions, and conflicting assumptions. For example, in  1980 we reported that the cost to acquire and maintain GPS satellites  through 2000 increased from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion due largely to  estimates not previously included for replenishment of satellites, launches,  and user equipment. Moreover, recent DOD studies found initial cost  estimates for the AEHF program as well as SBIRS-High did not accurately  capture program content and risk and were based on optimistic  assumptions. We also reported that costs would be better estimated if  DOD required more knowledge before starting a program. Without  knowing that technologies can work as intended, for example, programs  cannot reliably estimate costs and schedules.", "Another tool that could be useful in gaining insight into whether programs  are positioned for success is the IPA team. IPA teams are to be drawn  from experts who are not directly affiliated with the program. They are  to spend about 8 weeks on-site working full-time with program officials  to study the program, particularly by assessing the acquisition strategy,  contracting information, cost analyses, system engineering, and  requirements. After this study, they are to conclude their work with  recommendations to the DSAB on whether or not to allow the program  to proceed, typically using the traditional \u201cred,\u201d \u201cyellow,\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d  assessment colors to indicate whether the program has satisfied key  criteria in areas such as requirements setting, cost estimates, and risk  reduction. The Under Secretary of the Air Force, however, makes the  decision on whether to allow the program to proceed.", "IPA team studies already performed have called attention to risks faced by  the GPS III, NPOESS, and SBR programs. The NPOESS study, for example,  noted that risk mitigation plans needed to be strengthened and that  independent cost estimates needed to include the winning contractor\u2019s  negotiated contract. The SBR study found that the program needed to  better define how the system would operate in the context of DOD\u2019s  transformational communications architecture and work with key  intelligence systems, such as the planned Distributed Common Ground  Station. Both reviews recommended that the programs move forward  (NPOESS into the build phase and SBR into the study phase) on the  condition that these programs address areas of concern.", "An IPA team studying GPS III found the program was too optimistic  in estimating resources that would be needed. For example, the study  noted that the program budget was not sufficient to support the  program plan by several hundred million dollars. The team also pointed  out that the system\u2019s architecture and acquisition strategy were not  sufficiently defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Space Policy Does Not Call for a Match between Resources and Requirements at Program Start", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s new acquisition management policy for space systems does not  alter DOD\u2019s practice of committing major investments before knowing  what resources will be required to deliver promised capability. Instead, the  policy allows programs to continue to mature technologies while they  are designing the system and undertaking other product development  activities. While space systems are different than other weapon systems in  terms of how they are developed and tested, it is still necessary to mature  technology before starting product development and match resources to  requirements in order to prevent cost increases and schedule delays.", "We previously recommended that DOD should not allow technologies to  enter into a weapon system\u2019s product development until they are  assessed at a TRL 7, meaning that a prototype has been demonstrated in  an operational environment. According to DOD officials, the new space  acquisition policy does not set TRL criteria for deciding what the threshold  for being mature should be. However, DOD officials stated that  technologies may well enter into product development at a TRL 5,  meaning basic components have only been tested in a laboratory, or an  even lower level of maturity. This means that programs will design the  system and conduct other program activities at the same time they build  representative models of key technologies and test them in an  environment that simulates the conditions of space. In essence, DOD will  be concurrently building knowledge about technology and design\u2014an  approach with a problematic history.", "As shown in figure 2, the knowledge building approach for space stands in  sharp contrast to that followed by successful programs and the approach  recommended by DOD\u2019s new acquisition policy for weapon systems.  Successful programs will not commit to undertaking product development  unless they have high confidence that they have achieved a match between  what the customer wants and what the program can deliver. Technologies  that are not mature continue to be developed in an environment that is  focused solely on technology development. This puts programs in a better  position to succeed because they can focus on design, system integration,  and manufacturing.", "By contrast, allowing technology development to carry over into  product development increases the risk that significant problems will be  discovered late in development. Addressing such problems may require  more time, money, and effort to fix because they may require more  extensive retrofitting and redesign as well as retesting. The approach also  makes it more difficult for programs to demonstrate the same level of  design stability since technology and design activities will be done  concurrently. Further, the consequences of problems experienced during  development will be much greater for space programs since the design  review occurs at the same time as the commitment to build and deliver the  first product to a customer.", "Space acquisition officials we spoke with acknowledged the added  risks that come when programs concurrently develop technologies  and design the system. However, they maintain that concurrent  technology and product development is necessary for space acquisitions  for several reasons.", "First, while some testing on satellites can be done on the ground in  thermovac or other environmental simulation chambers and some systems  can also be tested via aircraft, the only way to test satellites in a true  operational space environment is to build one or more demonstrator  satellites and launch them into orbit. Launching demonstrators is costly  and time consuming.", "Our prior reports have recognized that space systems are uniquely difficult  to test in a true operational environment. However, DOD has found ways  to test sensors and other critical technologies on experimental satellites  and it has built and launched technology demonstrator satellites.", "Second, in view of the length of time it takes to develop space systems,  DOD asserts that it will not be able to ensure that satellites, when  launched, will have the most advanced technologies, unless program  managers are continually developing technologies. DOD officials have  stated that they would reduce the added risks of their approach by not  allowing programs to start if too many technologies were deemed to be  immature or by deferring certain capabilities if it turned out that  technologies did not test well.", "We agree that continuing to develop leading edge technology is important  for all system capabilities, not just space systems. However, history has  shown and we have repeatedly reported that conducting technology  development within a product environment consistently delays the  delivery of capability to the user, robs other programs of necessary funds  through unanticipated cost overruns, and consequently, can result in  money wasted and fewer units produced than originally stated as  necessary. A technology development environment is more forgiving  and less costly than a delivery-oriented acquisition program environment.  Events such as test \u201cfailures,\u201d new discoveries, and time spent in attaining  knowledge are considered normal in this environment. Further,  judgments of technology maturity have proven to be insufficient as the  basis for accurate estimates of program risks relative to cost, schedule,  and capability.", "Finally, because operation and support costs make up a smaller portion  of total costs for satellites than other weapon programs, DOD asserts  that earlier insight and decisions are needed on space programs.", "We agree that early insight into programs is important, as we have  reported that over 80 percent of the cost of a weapon system program  is determined by requirements set at the beginning. However, moving  decisions to an earlier point in the product development process without  additional knowledge may actually increase the risk of promising more  than can be delivered and at higher costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The growing importance of space systems to military and civil operations  requires DOD to develop cutting edge technologies and achieve timely  delivery of capability. DOD\u2019s new space acquisition policy does not  position space programs to do either. By allowing major investment  commitments to continue to be made with unknowns about technology  readiness, requirements, and funding, programs will likely continue to  experience problems that require more time and money to address than  anticipated. Over the long run, the extra investment required to address  these problems may well prevent DOD from pursuing more advanced  capabilities. By contrast, DOD is taking steps to better position other  weapon systems for success.

Specifically, we recommend that the Secretary separate  technology development from product development. To ensure that this is  done, we also recommend that the Secretary set a minimum threshold of  maturity for allowing technologies into a program.

In our reviews of numerous  DOD programs, including many satellite developments, it has been clear  that committing to major investments in design, engineering, and  manufacturing capacity without knowing a technology is mature and what  resources are needed to ensure that the technology can be incorporated  into a weapon system has consistently resulted in more money, time, and  talent spent than either was promised, planned for, or necessary.  The  impact of such mistakes in individual programs has also had a damaging  effect on military capability as other programs are taxed to meet  unplanned cost increases and production units are often cut because unit  costs increase and funds run out.", "Although each DOD program differs in its characteristics, GAO\u2019s work  with successful product developers in DOD and the commercial sector has  found that the process of developing leading edge technology and  products that have more capability than their predecessors does not differ.   In fact, successful product developments are marked by adherence to a  disciplined process that collects metrics and establishes and uses common  and consistent criteria for decision-making.  We have found that  companies that adopt these best practices often do so out of necessity,  when their existence is threatened.  While the Air Force has taken some  promising steps in drafting the policy to address DOD\u2019s poor record of  developing satellites within cost and schedule targets and with promised  performance, it will miss an opportunity to dramatically improve  outcomes if it does not adopt similar practices.

We agree that there are consistencies between the two policies in  terms of how they enhance the development of requirements.   However, the policies are very different in terms of their views on  technology development.  DOD\u2019s policy for weapon systems clearly  requires technologies to be mature (demonstrated in a relevant,  preferably operational environment) before beginning product  development.  The space policy does not.  In fact, DOD officials stated  that, under the space policy, technologies may well enter product  development without being demonstrated in a relevant environment.   This might not occur until DOD is close to making its production  decision.   In our view, this difference will be a detriment to the future  success of space programs.     2.  DOD contended that our recommendation to set a minimum threshold  of maturity for allowing technologies into a program ignores  differences among programs and ignores evolutionary acquisition.  We  disagree with these points.  Technology maturity is fundamental to the  success of all programs and cannot be ignored as part of a satellite\u2019s  business case.  While it is possible to take a gamble on a key  technology and have it work out in the end, DOD\u2019s experiences show  that this is an unlikely result.  Moreover, this is not an approach that  successful product developers emulate.  In addition, technology  maturity is essential to successful evolutionary acquisitions.   The  principle of evolutionary development is reaching full capability in  more doable steps.  Technical maturity essentially defines what is  doable for each increment or block.    3.  DOD asserted that it is not feasible for space programs to separate  technology development from product development because it would  delay delivery of the product and make its technologies obsolete.  We  disagree.  Separation of technology development from product  development has been found to be essential to reducing overall  development cycle times and delivering new products within estimated  resources.  The DOD policy for other weapons acquisitions is quite  clear on this as well.  In successful programs, the technologies are  matured, hybrid organizations and agreements between the  technologists and the product developers are established, and  preliminary designs are done, thus providing the basis for a match  between the user's needs and the developer's resources--all before the  commitment to product development is made.  By maturing  technologies before committing significant time and money to product  development and following an evolutionary approach, the product  development cycle time is reduced, while opportunities for inserting  new technologies are more frequent.    4.  DOD asserted that satellite programs cannot be demonstrated in an  operational environment (TRL 7).  We disagree.  NASA, the creator of  TRLs, tests some technologies to a TRL 7 if they are mission critical.   Moreover, while we recognize the difficulties in attaining this level of  maturity for space systems, the space policy does not even encourage  programs to demonstrate technologies in a relevant environment  before committing to a program.  In fact, according to DOD officials,  under the space policy, technologies could enter product development  with a TRL  5 or even lower.   The policy is silent on what the minimum  threshold for maturity should be, leaving that decision to the milestone  decision authority.  5.  DOD stated that none of our prior best practices case studies included  a commercial satellite producer, making the knowledge points  irrelevant to space systems. This assertion is wrong.  In the report that  first promulgated the knowledge points (GAO/NSIAD-98-56), one of the  key case studies was Hughes Space and Communications and its  experience with the HS-702 satellite.  We deliberately included Hughes  because it was a low-volume, high technology producer.  Hughes  insisted on having process control for all key processes and proved  them either through use on other satellite production or through  statistical process control techniques.  Hughes was also included as  part of our best practice study on technology development  (GAO/NSIAD-99-162).  6.  DOD asserted that moving decision points to an earlier point in the  program reduces risks, rather than increases them as our report states.   We disagree.  The space policy proposes to make commitments to  product development (including point estimates on cost, schedule, and  performance) before sufficient knowledge has been achieved and  requires decision makers to commit first to product development  without having technology in hand and second to production of the  first two products without production knowledge in hand.  This is the  traditional DOD approach, which has consistently resulted in  capability being delivered much later and much more expensively than  planned.  The commitment to product development (and the requisite  estimates) can be done more confidently and the product development  cycle time can be much shorter only if decisions are knowledge-based.  7.  While officials have told us that the intent of the policy is to complete  technology development during phase B, they acknowledged that the  policy does not identify an end point for technology development and  that, in some cases, it could continue until the point the program is  ready to begin building the first satellite."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Military Space Operations: Common Problems and Their Effects on  Satellite and Related Acquisitions.
