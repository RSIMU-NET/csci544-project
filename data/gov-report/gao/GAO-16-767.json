Key changes included adding newly planned satellites; removing a satellite that reached the end of its life; and adjusting planned dates for when satellites would launch, begin operations, and reach the end of their lives. For example, in one set of changes between April 2015 and January 2016, NOAA extended the life of older polar orbiting satellites by 1 year, added a new fuel limited life period to its most recently launched satellite (called S-NPP), and changed the launch date and the end-of-life date for another satellite (called JPSS-2), as shown below.", "While NOAA has regularly updated its flyout charts and most of the data on specific satellites were aligned with supporting program documents, it has not consistently ensured that the data were supported by stringent analysis, consistent with underlying program data, clearly communicated, and fully documented. For example, unlike the Air Force, NOAA does not require regular availability assessments for its satellite programs. Also, NOAA's flyout chart updates are not always accurate and consistent with program schedules and polar availability assessments. Further, NOAA does not fully document its changes to the charts. For example, GAO's assessment of 27 key changes between March 2014 and January 2016 showed that 9 were justified in NOAA documentation and 18 were not. Part of the reason for these issues is that NOAA has not established a clear policy to standardize its approach.

Our  review of changes to the flyout charts since March 2014 found that most  of the updates to the flyout charts accurately reflected relevant  information from satellite program offices at the time they were published;  and were subject to internal review before they were finalized as  evidenced by summary packages which can include e-mails, documents  tracking the changes, and the official approval of the charts by the  Assistant Administrator.", "However, in its efforts to provide updated flyout charts to Congress, the  agency has not consistently ensured that the data were (1) supported by  stringent analyses of the satellites\u2019 health and availability; (2) accurate  and consistent with supporting program data; (3) clear in how a satellite\u2019s  extended life is portrayed; and (4) fully documented. More specifically:", "Stringent analysis: NOAA does not require regular satellite  availability assessments for any of its environmental satellite  programs. Satellite managing agencies often perform technical  assessments of health and future availability of operational satellites  to aid in planning and budgeting. For example, the Air Force requires  satellite programs to complete an independent assessment of satellite  and constellation health each year as part of its budget preparations.  While NOAA conducts an annual assessment for its JPSS program, it  does not conduct such assessments for its GOES-R program. Without  requiring regular availability assessments for all satellites, NOAA risks  not having timely information on the probability of continued success  of its operational satellites for program budgeting purposes.", "Accuracy: NOAA\u2019s flyout chart updates are not always accurate and  consistent with agency documentation including program schedules  for future satellites and polar availability assessments. Out of 26  instances where we compared flyout chart data to underlying program  data for a particular satellite, we identified 2 instances where the flyout  charts did not accurately depict the underlying program schedules.  For example, the flyout charts showed launch dates for two satellites  as 4 months earlier and 3 months later than program data. Both of  these issues were later corrected when the next chart was updated 6- 12 months later. However, they were inaccurate at the time they were  provided to Congress.", "In addition, NOAA\u2019s updates were at times inconsistent with the polar  satellite availability assessment data. For example, NOAA\u2019s January  2016 flyout chart depicts JPSS-1 lasting through March 2024 while a  2015 availability assessment shows only a 55 percent probability that  the satellite will be fully functional in 2024. JPSS program officials  explained that polar-orbiting availability assessments are used to only  show degrading health over time, while the flyout charts portray  expected satellite lifespans. However, we believe it is not accurate to  show a satellite as functioning on the flyout chart when underlying  analyses show that the satellite is unlikely to be fully functioning. A  part of the reason for this lack of consistency is that NOAA does not  have a policy in place that requires taking steps to ensure the  accuracy of its charts. Until NOAA ensures its flyout charts correctly  represent the best available knowledge on the health and availability  of the satellite, the agency runs an increased risk that its charts will  not be useful or trusted to inform the budget and appropriations  processes and provide program updates.", "Clarity: NOAA does not clearly and consistently depict how long a  satellite might last once it is beyond its design life. For example,  NOAA received a contractor study in 2005 showing that its  geostationary satellites were likely to last a total of 10 years after  launch, which was beyond the initial 7-year design life. Although the  study was conducted in 2005, the agency did not update the satellites\u2019  expected lives on the flyout charts until 2015. Similarly, in its 2015 and  2016 charts, NOAA shows its expectation that the NOAA-18 and 19  satellites would last 1 more year by extending the expected operation  of the satellites by 1 year, even though the polar availability  assessments show that they will likely last longer. In addition, in 2015  and 2016, NOAA adjusted its flyout charts to show extended life on  three GOES satellites and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting  Partnership (S-NPP) satellite using an extension labeled as \u201cfuel  limited life\u201d in 2015. The agency later explained that this term is  intended to show the maximum possible life assuming all instruments  and the spacecraft continue to function, and not the satellite\u2019s  expected life. However, the agency did not clearly define this term on  its charts, thereby allowing readers to assume that the agency  expects the satellites to last through the end of the fuel-limited life  period. Part of the reason that NOAA does not consistently describe  how long a satellite is expected to last is that the agency does not  have a policy in place requiring a standard approach or nomenclature.  Until the agency establishes a consistent approach to describing a  satellite\u2019s extended life, it is at risk that its charts will be misconstrued,  including by those making budget and appropriations decisions.", "Documentation: While standard internal controls and NOAA\u2019s draft  policy calls for documenting the reasons for changes to the flyout  charts and the executive approval for those changes, NOAA does not  consistently document the justification for its updates. For example, of  the six geostationary and polar summary packages we received by  NOAA, three included justification for at least one key change and  three did not include key program documentation for the changes to  the flyout charts. Furthermore, based on the 27 key changes we noted  on the flyout charts between March 2014 and January 2016, 9 were  justified in NOAA documentation and 18 were not.", "Program officials explained that documentation supporting each  change exists and is widely circulated and vetted; however, we were  unable to find this documentation in the packages provided by NOAA.  Part of the reason for the inconsistencies is that NOAA does not have  a policy in place requiring the creation and approval of standard  justification packages. Until the agency documents and maintains a  standard justification and approval package for each update, it risks  not having all of the information it needs to justify a change to its flyout  charts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While NOAA has a process in place for updating its flyout charts and it  regularly updates them, the agency\u2019s process has multiple shortcomings  and is not established in policy.
