The contracting officer for the vehicle repair contract told GAO that the service will not be needed in the future, while the contracting officer for engineering services stated that he intends to competitively award the next contract for these services. Tribal 8(a) firms eligible for sole-source contracts over $20 million have won a growing number of competed 8(a) contracts since the justification went into effect in 2011.", "DOD contracting officials GAO spoke to overwhelmingly cited an agency-wide emphasis on using competition to obtain benefits, such as better pricing, as a reason for the decline in the use of sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million. Further, officials from almost half of the offices also noted that a decline in their budgets or the amount of goods and services needed rendered the 8(a) justification not applicable because most of their contracts fall below the $20 million threshold. Of the 9 sole-source 8(a) contracts GAO reviewed with subsequently awarded contracts, over half were ultimately competed.

We determined that the federal procurement  data for this period was sufficiently reliable to identify 8(a) contracts that  exceeded the $20 million threshold.", "To determine DOD officials\u2019 opinions on factors influencing these trends,  we identified 14 contracting offices that (1) had awarded the highest  number of sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million over the period in  question (10 offices); (2) were identified in our prior work on this subject  as having used a sole-source 8(a) contract to meet a large requirement   (2 offices); or (3) had awarded a sole-source 8(a) contract over $20  million in fiscal year 2015 (2 offices). For each office, we selected one  contract for a requirement that was met by a sole-source 8(a) contract  over $20 million. For 9 of the 14 contracts selected, we reviewed the  subsequently awarded contracts for the same requirement, which we  refer to as follow-on contracts. Of the remaining 5 contracts, 2 were  awarded in fiscal year 2015, and 2 were for construction and thus did not  have follow-on contracts. For one $76 million contract for duffel bags,  contracting officials were in the process of awarding the follow-on  competitively, but it had not yet been awarded at the time of our review.  We interviewed contracting officials about their experiences with the 8(a)  justification and, where applicable, how they are now meeting  requirements previously met by sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20  million. Our sample of contracting offices included eight Army contracting  offices; three Navy contracting offices (including two from the Marine  Corps); one Air Force contracting office; and two other DOD offices  (Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support and U.S. Special Operations  Command).

For example, in January 2012, we  found that SBA lacked the data and insight to enforce some of the new  requirements put in place to ensure that tribal 8(a) firms do not operate in  the program in perpetuity. We made a number of recommendations to  improve oversight of tribal 8(a) firms, such as ensuring that a new SBA  8(a) database has the capability to track information on 8(a) contracts to  help ensure SBA officials have the information necessary to enforce the  8(a) program regulations.

Consistent with  findings from our past reports, we found that sole-source awards  generally declined in both number and value since 2011, when the 8(a)  justification requirement went into effect. DOD awarded 22 of these  contracts from fiscal years 2011 through 2015, compared to 163 such  contracts in the prior 5-year period (fiscal years 2006 through 2010).

DOD reported awarding 23 such contracts in fiscal  year 2011, 8 in 2012, and 5 in 2013, while we identified 13, 3, and 4 such  contracts in those fiscal years, respectively. Consistent with our findings,  DOD found no sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million awarded in  fiscal year 2014 and a general decline in such contract awards since  2011. Based on our analysis of DOD\u2019s report and discussions with the  official responsible for the report, the differences are due to DOD\u2019s  inclusion of individual task or delivery orders in its count of sole-source  8(a) contracts. We did not include individual task or delivery orders in our  numbers because they are not subject to the 8(a) justification.", "We found that DOD awarded two sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20  million with a total value of over $87 million in fiscal year 2015, one of  which did not complete the 8(a) justification as required.

However, the contracting officer did not  complete an 8(a) justification as required. This contracting officer told  us that the previous contracting officer for the requirement had retired  without warning and there was limited time to award the follow-on  contract. The contract went through several levels of review, including  general counsel, and no one realized that a justification was required.  She explained she had very limited experience awarding 8(a)  contracts and was not aware of the required 8(a) justification. In fact,  our analysis of FPDS-NG data showed that this office had not  awarded any other sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million since  fiscal year 2006. We did not pursue this issue because the contracting  officer recognized that more training was needed and noted that the  director of her office was developing training to address this issue.  She further noted that there will not be a follow-on contract for this  particular requirement, as the service is no longer needed.", "In the other case, Army officials said that they had a limited amount of  time to ensure continuity of an engineering services contract for $63  million after a contract awarded through full and open competition was  protested twice by the previous vendor. Contracting staff said that a  sole-source 8(a) contract, which was not awarded to the previous  vendor, was the only way to meet the requirement without a gap in  services. Officials explained that they decided to shorten the period of  performance on the sole-source contract from 5 years to 3 years and  that the follow-on contract will be competed among 8(a) firms.", "Our analysis of the period of performance for sole-source and competitive  8(a) contracts over $20 million from fiscal years 2006 through 2015  showed that the average length of sole-source contracts has declined  since 2012, while the average length of competitive contracts has  remained more consistent over the time period.

Our prior work has found that agencies liked to use the unique provisions  of tribal 8(a) contracting because they could quickly, easily, and legally  award contracts to meet agency needs. However, in 2012, we reported  that contracting officers\u2014which included DOD contracting officers\u2014were  moving away from sole-source contracts to tribal 8(a) firms and toward  competition. We noted examples where follow-on requirements were  subsequently competed, resulting in estimated savings, according to  agency officials. We also reported that with regard to Alaska Native  Corporations, the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army  (Procurement) issued a memo in January 2011, citing the increased  attention around the Army\u2019s extensive use of sole-source contracts  awarded to 8(a) Alaska Native Corporation firms. It stated that high-dollar  sole-source awards to 8(a) Alaska Native Corporation firms should be the  exception rather than the rule and laid out the expectation that these  awards be scrutinized to ensure they are in the government\u2019s best  interest. Officials we spoke with on this review echoed some of these  sentiments\u2014noting that they had to consider whether the benefits of  awarding a large sole-source 8(a) contract outweighed the negative  aspects. For example, DOD officials from four offices stated that they  prefer competition because it is easier to determine price reasonableness  as compared to a sole-source procurement. Some of these officials noted  that it is harder to negotiate with vendors under a sole-source approach,  especially when they lack the staff to handle complex negotiations  associated with larger contracts. One official also said that he prefers  competition because the process of the contracting office performing  market research and outreach to 8(a) contractors promotes transparency,  in contrast to larger sole-source 8(a) contracts directed to specific  vendors which had faced increased scrutiny due to allegations of fraud.", "Of the 9 sole-source 8(a) contracts we reviewed that had follow-on  awards, 5 had follow-on contracts that were competitively awarded, while  the other 4 had follow-on contracts that were awarded on a sole-source  basis. All of the sole-source follow-on contracts had values less than  $20 million. See figure 2.", "Of the 5 contracts where the follow-on requirement was competed, the  contract values and circumstances varied, as illustrated by the following  examples:", "The Air Force awarded a 5-year $76 million competitive follow-on  contract for base operations support to replace a 10-year $523 million  sole-source contract. Officials told us that they made a concerted  effort to engage different 8(a) firms for the follow-on contract because  their market research indicated that multiple firms could meet the  requirement. Although they had to award two short-term sole-source  8(a) bridge contracts to the incumbent to meet the requirement while  preparing the competitive follow-on award, once the requirement was  opened for competition, they received proposals from seven vendors  and awarded the competitive contract to a new vendor. In addition to  shortening the period of performance, they removed a construction  component of the requirement, and officials told us the removed  component is now being met through a multiple award IDIQ contract  that was competitively awarded to six vendors. The contracting  officials also stated that they were exploring possible ways to insource  other functions previously performed under the sole-source contract.", "The Army competitively awarded a 4-year $140 million contract for  base operations support, which was previously met by a 10-year $397  million sole-source 8(a) contract. The contracting office had to award  three short-term sole-source bridge contracts to the incumbent vendor  to provide more time to prepare a competitive follow-on award.  However, during the competitive process, six 8(a) firms competed for  the follow-on award and the current contract value is about $7 million  less annually than the value of the most recent sole-source bridge  contract. The follow-on award went to an 8(a) firm owned by the same  tribal entity as the incumbent firm.", "The Navy awarded a competitive follow-on to a $49 million sole- source contract for engineering services. The requirement is now met  by a multiple award IDIQ contract to six 8(a) vendors with a total value  of $99 million. A Navy contracting official told us that the prior sole- source 8(a) contract was one of many contracts providing similar  services across this particular command, and, in 2011, the contracting  office implemented a new contracting strategy that would increase  competition and meet its small business goals. This official noted that  the multiple award contract is intended to avoid duplicative contracts  across various contracting offices and that this new strategy is  expected to result in cost savings.", "Officials from almost half of the 14 offices we spoke with noted that a  decline in budgets or a decline in the size of requirements rendered the  8(a) justification not applicable because most of their contracts fall below  the $20 million threshold.

An Army official told us that the requirement decreased due  to management changes and anticipated growth in need that never  materialized.", "As follow-ons to a 5-year $319 million sole-source 8(a) contract for  pre-deployment training exercises, the Marine Corps awarded 2 one- year-long sole-source 8(a) contracts, slightly under $10 million apiece,  within a 6-month period to the same vendor. The current contracting  officer did not know why the previous contracting officer awarded  separate contracts for this requirement. The market research for the  more recent contract stated that there used to be a greater need for  pre-deployment training and estimated that funding for the  requirement had decreased from $85 million annually to less than $10  million in recent years. The contracting officer told us that he intends  to competitively award future follow-on contracts.", "Army officials told us that they now use a series of smaller contracts  to meet a technical support services requirement that used to be met  by a $50 million sole-source contract. Officials explained that the  change in acquisition strategy was due to a decline in the need for  these services and an increase in efficiency by using various  contracting vehicles, such as smaller sole-source 8(a) contracts,  competitive 8(a) awards, and task orders from an existing  government-wide IDIQ contract to meet the requirement. They added  that they preferred this strategy to the original $50 million dollar  contract, which was designed to cover a wide swath of requirements,  and that they want to compete more contracts to replace the smaller  sole-source contracts in the future.", "Even though the FAR states that competition is the preferred contracting  approach, we previously reported\u2014and officials reaffirmed during this  review\u2014that large sole-source 8(a) contracts were an expedient way to  respond to an increased workload and volume of requirements in the mid  to late 2000s. For example, one office we spoke with said that the total  value of the contracts awarded out of his office each year had increased  from $200 million to $1.2 billion over a 10-year period while staff levels  remained constant.

We reviewed 36 8(a) contracts over $20  million that were coded as competed\u2014which represents  approximately 3 percent of the total number of competed contracts for  fiscal years 2006 through 2015\u2014for data reliability purposes and  found 1 sole-source contract that was miscoded as competed. We  also confirmed contract values for 15 competed 8(a) contracts that  were part of the same solicitation but had different contract values.  We obtained these contracts using DOD\u2019s Electronic Document  Access website, a repository for DOD contracts and related  documents.", "We also compared the data reported in FPDS-NG to the information  in the contract files we reviewed.", "We determined that the data for this period were sufficiently reliable to  identify competed and sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million and  describe trends in these contracts. To identify what is being purchased  with 8(a) contracts over $20 million, we identified common products and  services using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)  codes. The NAICS assigns codes to all economic activity within 20 broad  sectors, and the codes reflect the industry in which the firm operates, e.g.,  wireless telecommunication carriers or industrial building construction.  Our analysis of FPDS-NG data for trends among tribal 8(a) firms included  firms owned by Alaska Native Corporations, Indian Tribes, and Native  Hawaiian Organizations.", "To determine the factors to which DOD officials attribute these trends, we  interviewed officials and reviewed contract files from 14 DOD contracting  offices that met the following criteria:", "The 10 contracting offices that awarded the most sole-source 8(a)  contracts over $20 million from fiscal years 2006 through 2015. We  identified these offices using FPDS-NG data and confirmed that the  offices with the most contract awards also had a high total value of  sole-source 8(a) contract awards, either in obligations or Base & All  Options value.", "We selected two offices that had large requirements previously met by  sole-source 8(a) contracts. These contracts were identified in our past  work on this topic. We wanted to determine how these requirements  are currently being met. We selected an Air Force base operations  support services requirement and a U.S. Special Operations  Command translation services requirement.", "The two offices that awarded sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20  million in fiscal year 2015.", "Our final sample of DOD contracting offices included in our review were  as follows:", "Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico", "Marine Corps Logistics Command, Albany, Georgia", "Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia", "National Guard Bureau, Arlington, Virginia", "Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic, North Charleston,", "U.S. Army Contracting Command, Natick, Massachusetts", "U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama", "U.S. Army Contracting Command \u2013 Aberdeen Proving Ground,", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District", "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Savannah District", "U.S. Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command, Fort", "U.S. Special Operations Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida  For each of the 14 offices, we judgmentally selected one sole-source 8(a)  contract over $20 million for review, and, where applicable, we reviewed  subsequently awarded contracts for the same requirement, which we  refer to as follow-on contracts. Specifically, we reviewed:", "Nine sole-source 8(a) contracts that had follow-on contracts. We  confirmed with agency officials that a contract had a follow-on  procurement. We interviewed the contracting officials responsible for  each contract and reviewed relevant paperwork from the contract file.  Our contract file review included looking at follow-on contracts, 8(a)  justifications, acquisition plans, and other contract documents to  compare old and new contracting approaches and determine any  effects of the 8(a) justification. We also met with small business  officials to discuss general trends and their contracting offices\u2019 use of  the 8(a) program.", "Two sole-source 8(a) contracts over $20 million that did not have  follow-on contracts. We selected these contracts because they were  awarded by offices that were top users of sole-source 8(a) contracts  over $20 million from fiscal years 2006 through 2015. The offices  confirmed that the two selected contracts, in addition to the other sole- source 8(a) contracts over $20 million awarded by the office, were for  construction services and would not have follow-on contracts. We  interviewed contracting officials about their experiences with the 8(a)  justification requirement more generally and sole-source 8(a)  contracts over $20 million.", "Two sole-source 8(a) contracts awarded in fiscal year 2015.", "One sole-source 8(a) contract that did not have a follow-on contract  because the contracting officials were in the process of awarding the  follow-on; we looked at the solicitation to confirm their acquisition  strategy.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to June 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
