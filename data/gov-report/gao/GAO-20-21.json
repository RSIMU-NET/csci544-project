The Trust Fund has borrowed from the U.S. Treasury's general fund almost every year since 1979 to make needed expenditures. GAO's June 2019 testimony included preliminary observations that coal operator bankruptcies were further straining Trust Fund finances because, in some cases, benefit responsibility was transferred to the Trust Fund.", "This report examines (1) how coal mine operator bankruptcies have affected the Trust Fund, and (2) how DOL managed coal mine operator insurance to limit financial risk to the Trust Fund. GAO identified coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through 2016 using Bloomberg data. GAO selected these years, in part, because bankruptcies were more likely to be resolved so that their effects on the Trust Fund could be assessed. GAO analyzed information on commercially-insured and self-insured coal operators, and examined workers' compensation insurance practices in four of the nation's top five coal producing states. GAO also interviewed DOL officials, coal mine operators, and insurance company representatives, among others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Coal mine operator bankruptcies have led to the transfer of about $865 million in estimated benefit responsibility to the federal government's Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (Trust Fund), according to DOL estimates. The Trust Fund pays benefits when no responsible operator is identified, or when the liable operator does not pay. GAO previously testified in June 2019 that it had identified three bankrupt, self-insured operators for which benefit responsibility was transferred to the Trust Fund. Since that time, DOL's estimate of the transferred benefit responsibility has grown\u2014from a prior range of $313 million to $325 million to the more recent $865 million estimate provided to GAO in January 2020. According to DOL, this escalation was due, in part, to recent increases in black lung benefit award rates and higher medical treatment costs, and to an underestimate of Patriot Coal's future benefit claims.", "DOL's limited oversight of coal mine operator insurance has exposed the Trust Fund to financial risk, though recent changes, if implemented effectively, can help address these risks. In overseeing self-insurance in the past, DOL did not estimate future benefit liability when setting the amount of collateral required to self-insure; regularly review operators to assess whether the required amount of collateral should change; or always take action to protect the Trust Fund by revoking an operator's ability to self-insure as appropriate. In July 2019, DOL began implementing a new self-insurance process that could help address past deficiencies in estimating collateral and regularly reviewing self-insured operators. However, DOL's new process still lacks procedures for its planned annual renewal of self-insured operators and for resolving coal operator appeals should operators dispute DOL collateral requirements. This could hinder DOL from revoking an operator's ability to self-insure should they not comply with DOL requirements. Further, for those operators that do not self-insure, DOL does not monitor them to ensure they maintain adequate and continuous commercial coverage as appropriate. As a result, the Trust Fund may in some instances assume responsibility for paying benefits that otherwise would have been paid by an insurer."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to DOL to establish procedures for self-insurance renewals and coal operator appeals, and to develop a process to monitor whether commercially-insured operators maintain adequate and continuous coverage.

Black lung benefits are generally to be paid by responsible coal  mine operators. However, the Trust Fund pays benefits in certain  circumstances, including in cases where no responsible mine operator  can be identified or when the liable mine operator does not pay.", "As we reported in May 2018, the Trust Fund faces financial challenges.  Its expenditures have consistently exceeded revenue and the Trust Fund  has essentially borrowed with interest from the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) general fund almost every year since 1979, which  was its first complete fiscal year. In fiscal year 2019, the Trust Fund  borrowed about $1.9 billion to cover its expenditures, according to  Department of Labor (DOL) officials.", "Trust Fund revenue is primarily obtained through a tax on coal produced  and sold domestically, which we refer to in this report as the coal tax.  The coal tax rate has varied over the years. From 1986 through 2018, the  coal tax rate was $1.10 per ton of underground-mined coal and $0.55 per  ton of surface-mined coal, up to 4.4 percent of the sales price. In 2019,  the rate of the coal tax decreased to $0.50 cents and $0.25 cents per ton  of underground-mined and surface-mined coal, respectively, up to 2  percent of the sales price. In 2020, the rate of the coal tax increased to  pre-2019 levels. However, it is scheduled to decrease again beginning in  2021. With less revenue from the coal tax, the Trust Fund will likely need  to borrow more from Treasury\u2019s general fund, and taxpayers will  ultimately be responsible for repaying this accumulating debt.", "In June 2019, we reported preliminary observations that coal operator  bankruptcies were further straining Trust Fund finances because, in some  cases, responsibility for benefit payments was transferred from the  bankrupt operator to the Trust Fund. This may occur, for instance, when  the amount of collateral DOL requires from a self-insured coal operator  does not fully cover the operator\u2019s benefit responsibility should the  operator become insolvent.", "This report examines (1) how coal mine operator bankruptcies have  affected the Trust Fund, and (2) how DOL managed coal mine operator  insurance to limit financial risk to the Trust Fund. To address both  objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and DOL  procedures. We also interviewed DOL officials, coal mine operators, and  insurance company representatives. Additionally, we interviewed officials  from the National Mining Association, National Council on Compensation  Insurance (NCCI), National Council of Self-Insurers, and the American  Academy of Actuaries, among others.", "To assess how coal mine operator bankruptcies affected the Trust Fund,  we analyzed Bloomberg Terminal (Bloomberg) data and consulted DOL  to identify coal operators that filed for bankruptcy from 2014 through  2016, and whose cases had progressed far enough such that the  outcome (or likely outcome) was known. During these years, domestic  coal production declined from about 1 billion tons in 2014 to about 728  million tons in 2016, which was the lowest annual production level since  1978, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data.  Additionally, bankruptcies filed during these years were more likely to be  resolved at the time we conducted our work than more recently filed  bankruptcies, so their effects on the Trust Fund could be assessed. We  identified eight coal mine companies that filed for bankruptcy during our  selected years. To assess the reliability of the Bloomberg data, we  interviewed Bloomberg officials and reviewed relevant system  documentation. In addition, to assess the completeness of the Bloomberg  data, we conducted a limited legal search for bankruptcy filings and  verified our results with DOL. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To examine how each  of the eight coal mine operator bankruptcies affected the Trust Fund, we  interviewed DOL officials and reviewed DOL-provided documentation. For  instance, we reviewed bankruptcy settlement agreements and  reorganization plans, where applicable. We did not conduct a legal  analysis of the relevant bankruptcy court dockets, and relied solely on  documentation DOL provided to describe these bankruptcies.", "To examine how DOL managed coal mine operator insurance to limit  financial risk to the Trust Fund, we analyzed data and documentation on  commercially-insured and self-insured coal mine operators. Specifically,  we reviewed NCCI data on the commercial workers\u2019 compensation  insurance policies purchased by coal mine operators to secure their black  lung benefit liability from 2016 through 2018, the most recent three  complete years of data available. We reviewed the data to identify,  among other things, whether operators had lapses in coverage.", "Specifically, we verified whether the 13 largest coal producers that were  not authorized to self-insure maintained adequate and continuous  commercial coverage during these years. We also reviewed DOL  documentation on each of the 22 coal mine operators that were self- insured at the time we conducted our work. For instance, we identified  the amount of collateral DOL required from these operators to self-insure  and DOL\u2019s most recent reauthorization memo that documented its  periodic review of these operators.", "We assessed the reliability of the NCCI data in several ways. Specifically,  we interviewed DOL and NCCI officials on how policy data is obtained,  processed, stored, and shared; reviewed documentation including a data  dictionary and users guide; reviewed DOL\u2019s procedures and error checks  for validating that the NCCI data conforms to established parameters; and  reviewed the data for obvious errors, outliers, or missing information and  for logical connections between policy and endorsement data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. However, we concluded that the beneficiary data we reviewed in  an attempt to determine the extent to which the Trust Fund paid benefits  during fiscal year 2018 on behalf of uninsured operators were not  sufficiently complete and consistently recorded. Thus, we were unable to  assess the effect on the Trust Fund of DOL not monitoring coal operator  compliance with commercial insurance requirements. This condition and  its causes are further described in the report, which form the basis for one  of our recommendations.", "We also examined workers\u2019 compensation insurance practices in four  states\u2014Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wyoming\u2014to identify  relevant practices that could inform DOL\u2019s administration of coal operator  insurance at the federal level. Such practices may be informative because  both workers\u2019 compensation and federal black lung disability payments  generally support workers with conditions, such as black lung, that were  contracted as a result of their employment. Workers\u2019 compensation is  generally mandated by state law and employers are typically required to  purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance to secure these liabilities, or  may self-insure. Thus, state practices in monitoring and overseeing  workers\u2019 compensation insurance may provide informative context for  examining DOL\u2019s practices in overseeing federal black lung insurance.", "To review state practices for monitoring and overseeing workers\u2019  compensation insurance, we interviewed state insurance commissioners  and reviewed selected workers\u2019 compensation laws, regulations, and  guidance in the four states we contacted. We selected Kentucky,  Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wyoming because they were among  the top five coal producing states in 2017, according to EIA data, and  therefore may be most familiar with workers\u2019 compensation insurance that  covers black lung. Additionally, these states provided geographic  variation covering EIA\u2019s three main domestic coal producing regions: the  Appalachian coal region, the Interior coal region, and the Western coal  region. Kentucky is divided between EIA\u2019s Appalachian and Interior coal  regions. These states also provided variation in terms of the options  available to coal mine operators to secure their workers\u2019 compensation  benefit liability. For instance, with the exception of Wyoming, all selected  states allowed operators to self-insure. In Wyoming, coal mining is  considered an \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d occupation and mine operators must  purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance from a state-provided option.  In our selected states, we obtained information on, among other things,  state practices for determining the amount of collateral required from coal  mine operators to self-insure their workers\u2019 compensation benefit  liabilities, if applicable. We also obtained information about the extent to  which state officials reviewed self-insured coal mine operators to assess  whether the amount of collateral they required changed based on an  operator\u2019s changing financial condition.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2018 through February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

DOL estimates that the average annual cost for medical  care in fiscal year 2019 was approximately $8,225 per miner.", "During fiscal year 2019, about 25,700 beneficiaries received black lung  benefits (see fig. 1). The number of beneficiaries has decreased from  about 174,000 in 1982 as a result of declining coal mining employment  and an aging beneficiary population, according to DOL. Black lung  beneficiaries could increase in the near term due to the rise in the  occurrence of the disease in its most severe form, progressive massive  fibrosis, particularly among Appalachian coal miners, according to the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH  reported that coal miners in central Appalachia are disproportionately  affected; as many as 1 in 5 show evidence of black lung, which is the  highest level recorded in 25 years. NIOSH has attributed the rise in  occurrence of black lung to multiple factors, including increased exposure  to silica.", "Black lung claims are processed by the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation  Programs within DOL. Contested claims are adjudicated by DOL\u2019s Office  of Administrative Law Judges, which issues decisions that can be  appealed to DOL\u2019s Benefits Review Board. Claimants and mine  operators may further appeal these DOL decisions to the federal courts. If  an award is contested, claimants can receive interim benefits until their  case is resolved, which are generally paid from the Trust Fund, according  to DOL. In fiscal year 2019, about 33 percent of black lung claims were  approved, according to DOL data. Final awards are either funded by mine  operators\u2014who are identified as the responsible employers of  claimants\u2014or the Trust Fund, when responsible employers cannot be  identified or do not pay. Of the approximately 25,700 beneficiaries  receiving black lung benefits in 2019, 13,335 were paid from the Trust  Fund; 7,985 were paid by responsible mine operators; and 4,380 were  receiving interim benefits, according to DOL data. DOL officials told us  that the more common reasons that beneficiary claims are paid from the  Trust Fund include operator insolvency and unclear employment history  of miners, among other reasons (see fig. 2).

Specifically, the bankruptcies of Alpha Natural Resources (Alpha),  James River Coal (James River), and Patriot Coal (Patriot) resulted in a  transfer of benefit liability to the Trust Fund of an estimated $865 million,  according to DOL. DOL officials said that the amount of collateral they  required from these three operators to self-insure was inadequate to fully  cover their estimated benefit liability. When this occurs, benefit liability in  excess of the collateral can be transferred to the Trust Fund.

In January 2020, however, DOL  provided updated estimates stating that $865 million in benefit liabilities  would transfer to the Trust Fund as a result of these bankruptcies.  According to DOL, their estimates increased to account for higher black  lung benefit award rates that occurred from fiscal years 2016 through  2019; higher medical treatment cost inflation in recent years; and different  discount rate assumptions. Additionally, DOL\u2019s prior estimate for the  Patriot bankruptcy did not account for future claims and the effect of those  claims on the Trust Fund.", "The three other self-insured coal mine operator bankruptcies we identified  did not affect the Trust Fund. Specifically, Arch Coal, Peabody Energy,  and Walter Energy were also self-insured operators, but DOL officials  said that their federal black lung benefit liabilities were assumed by a  reorganized company or by a purchaser, and therefore did not transfer to  the Trust Fund.", "DOL officials said that they take three key actions, as appropriate, to  protect the financial interests of the Trust Fund during self-insured  operator bankruptcies.  1.  DOL officials said that they file a claim in every case with the  bankruptcy court for the reimbursement of an operator\u2019s full estimated  federal black lung benefit liability.  2.  If an operator plans to reorganize or if it is acquired by a purchaser,  DOL officials said that they negotiate with the company or the  purchaser, as appropriate, to help ensure benefit responsibility will be  \u201cpassed through\u201d to a reorganized operator or purchaser, rather than  be discharged and become the responsibility of the Trust Fund.  3.  If benefit liabilities are not \u201cpassed-through\u201d to an operator, DOL  officials said that they seek settlement agreements, whereby the Trust  Fund receives an allowed general unsecured claim in an amount  based on an operator\u2019s estimated benefit liability.", "DOL officials said that during the bankruptcy of James River they  negotiated a settlement agreement providing DOL with a general  unsecured claim in an amount commensurate with its estimate of the  operator\u2019s benefit liability at the time of bankruptcy. However, these  officials said that given the low priority under bankruptcy law for their  general unsecured claim, the payout they received was only about  $400,000, which was just a small portion of the estimated benefit liability  that transferred to the Trust Fund.", "DOL officials said that during the bankruptcy of Alpha they negotiated  both a \u201cpass through\u201d and a settlement agreement in which certain  liabilities would be transferred to the Trust Fund, while other liabilities  would be retained by Alpha. DOL officials said that they received a payout  from Alpha of $7.4 million, although $494 million in estimated benefit  liability transferred to the Trust Fund. Further, as a condition of the  agreement, DOL officials said that they agreed to let Alpha self-insure  after it emerged from bankruptcy.", "Since 2016, several other self-insured operators have also filed for  bankruptcy, according to DOL officials, including Cambrian Coal, Cloud  Peak Energy, Murray Energy, and Westmoreland Coal. DOL officials said  that $17.4 million in estimated black lung benefit liability will transfer to the  Trust Fund as a result of Westmoreland Coal\u2019s bankruptcy.

As previously discussed, state insurance regulation, insurer  underwriting and risk management practices, and state guaranty funds  also help to protect the Trust Fund from having to assume responsibility  for paying black lung benefits on behalf of bankrupt coal operators.

Eight of the nine insurers that issued  approximately 90 percent of the workers\u2019 compensation policies with  federal black lung coverage from 2016 through 2018, according to our  review of DOL data, had at least an \u201cA-\u201d financial strength rating from  AM Best (with the one remaining being a state insurer that was not  rated).", "In deciding whether to provide federal black lung coverage, insurers we  interviewed said they consider an operator\u2019s historical black lung claim  losses, financial condition, and mine location among other factors.  However, insurance company officials identified various challenges in  writing and pricing black lung coverage that produces an appropriate  amount of premiums to cover expected losses. The challenges cited by  these officials included the long latency period of black lung disease;  changes in law regarding benefit eligibility and how the disease is  defined; the ability of miners to refile claims indefinitely; and the inability  of insurers and operators to settle claims. One official noted that there is  much risk and little profit in black lung coverage.", "Insurance companies can use reinsurance to protect themselves from  catastrophic losses that could threaten their solvency and ability to pay  claims, and to reduce wide fluctuations in their annual losses. For  example, workers\u2019 compensation claims can take years to fully develop  after premiums have been set, which in turn can adversely affect an  insurer\u2019s financial position if premiums have underestimated actual  claims. Insurance company officials said that they reinsure their workers\u2019 compensation coverage, but some said that their reinsurance policies  either explicitly excluded occupational disease claims, including black  lung, or cover black lung but have conditions and loss thresholds that  would generally result in the exclusion of such claims. However,  reinsurance, even if it does not explicitly cover federal black lung claims,  can help manage the risk of workers\u2019 compensation losses and losses in  other lines of insurance that an insurer writes, thereby indirectly helping to  ensure that the insurer can pay all types of claims, including federal black  lung.", "If an insurer becomes insolvent, state guaranty funds reduce the potential  for the Trust Fund to assume responsibility for paying claims. States have  different rules for guaranty fund benefit coverage and limits. In the states  we reviewed, state guaranty funds generally pay federal black lung  benefits, although there may be certain limitations on the claims they will  pay. For example, in West Virginia, there is no maximum claim limit that  the state guaranty fund will pay on standard workers\u2019 compensation  claims; but in Kentucky, a state guaranty fund official told us that, in the  guaranty fund\u2019s opinion, state law limits federal black lung claims to  $300,000. Also, a guaranty fund could reject a federal black lung claim,  which could result in the Trust Fund having to assume responsibility for  paying the claim. An official from one state guaranty fund that maintained  data on rejected black lung claims said that the most common reason for  rejection is that claims are filed after the date set by the bankruptcy court  for receiving claims. DOL officials said it is very uncommon for the Trust  Fund to assume responsibility for federal black lung claims of insolvent  insurers.

Patriot  appealed this decision and, in the 8 months that followed before  Patriot filed for bankruptcy in May 2015, DOL did not obtain additional  collateral, or revoke Patriot\u2019s ability to self-insure because the appeal  was still pending. DOL officials said they would not typically revoke an  operator\u2019s authority to self-insure during an ongoing appeal. As a  result, DOL was hindered from using this enforcement tool.", "Liens on operator assets can be an effective tool to protect the Trust  Fund if an operator defaults on its benefit liabilities, but DOL officials said  that they are hindered from using this tool if an operator files for  bankruptcy. DOL can place a lien on a coal operator\u2019s assets under  federal law if they refuse the demand to pay the black lung benefit  payments for which they are liable. In the event of bankruptcy or  insolvency, federal law states that the lien imposed shall be treated in the  same manner as a lien for taxes due and owing to the United States  under certain laws. However, DOL officials said that operators rarely  stop paying benefits until after they file for bankruptcy. Once a bankruptcy  occurs, DOL officials said that they are generally prevented by the court  from placing a lien and taking an operator\u2019s assets in lieu of payment of  current and future benefit liabilities. Under bankruptcy law, DOL officials  said that they have no special status over other creditors with outstanding  financial claims. Instead, DOL officials said that obtaining sufficient  collateral is a better way to protect the Trust Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Has Implemented a New Self-Insurance Process, but It Lacks Procedures to Help Ensure Enforcement Actions", "paragraphs": ["In July 2019, DOL began implementing a new process for coal mine  operator self-insurance that should help to address some past  deficiencies if implemented effectively. Specifically, DOL is to consider an  operator\u2019s future benefit liability when setting collateral and plans to more  frequently review self-insured operators (see text boxes). Under the new  process, DOL officials plan to assess the risk of operator bankruptcy  using various financial metrics related to profitability and solvency. As a  result, DOL officials said that the amount of collateral they will require  from operators to self-insure going forward will be based on both an  estimate of an operator\u2019s current and future black lung liability and the risk  of default due to insolvency. As of October 2019, DOL officials said that  most self-insured operators had submitted their application and  supporting documentation and that they were reviewing this information to  decide whether these operators should continue to be self-insured.", "DOL\u2019s New Self-Insurance Process Will Include Estimates of Future Benefit  Liability  Coal mine operators applying to DOL to self-insure will be required to submit: a completed application;  a certified consolidated financial statement for each of the 3 years prior to its  application;  recent black lung claims information; and  a certified actuarial report on the operator\u2019s existing and future black lung  benefit liabilities.", "DOL plans to use the information submitted by coal mine operators to assess the  insolvency risk of each operator using various financial metrics related to profitability  and solvency. Depending on the results of their analysis, DOL plans to categorize  the risk-level of each applicant as low, medium, or high. DOL will then set the  amount of collateral required to self-insure by linking the operator\u2019s risk category to a  corresponding percentage of the operator\u2019s actuarial estimated benefit liability. DOL  policies state that they would require a high-risk operator to secure with collateral 90  percent of estimated benefit liability, a medium-risk operator to secure 45 percent,  and a low-risk operator to secure 15 percent. However, in February 2020, DOL  officials said they plan to revise these percentages to 100 percent, 85 percent, and  70 percent for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk operators, respectively.", "DOL\u2019s New Self-Insurance Process Will Require More Frequent Coal Mine  Operator Reviews  Coal mine operators that are already authorized to self-insure will be required to        submit:", "DOL plans to use the information self-insured operators submit to update their  insolvency risk analysis. If an operator\u2019s risk category changes (e.g., from low-to  medium-risk), DOL plans to send a form to the operator requiring an additional  amount or type of collateral. Upon receiving the completed form, and proof that the  collateral has been obtained, DOL stated that they will notify the operator that its  a self-insurance renewal application (annually);  a financial summary (quarterly);  a certified consolidated financial statement (annually);  black lung claims information (annually); and  actuarial estimate of benefit liability (to be submitted every three years).  authority to self-insure has been reauthorized.", "DOL\u2019s new self-insurance process made important changes, but  overlooked other key internal control improvements that are needed to  protect the financial interests of the Trust Fund. DOL\u2019s new requirements  for setting collateral and for the annual and quarterly review of self- insured operators are key components of internal controls, which call for  agency management to implement control activities through policy.  However, DOL\u2019s new self-insurance process lacks procedures that could  help to prevent past oversight deficiencies from reoccurring. Among other  things, DOL\u2019s procedures do not specify (1) the duration of an operator\u2019s  self-insurance authority, (2) the time frames for submitting renewal  applications and supporting documentation, and (3) the conditions under  which an operator\u2019s self-insurance authority would not be renewed.  Without such procedures, DOL has no basis to take enforcement action  should an operator not submit its self-insurance renewal application and  supporting documentation.", "DOL staff are also hindered from taking enforcement action during an  operator\u2019s ongoing appeal, as previously mentioned. DOL policies state  that an operator may request reconsideration if its self-insurance  application has been denied or if it believes the collateral required by DOL  is too high to secure its benefit liabilities. However, DOL lacks procedures  that specify, among other things, the length of time that operators have to  submit supporting information. Further, DOL does not specify a goal for  how much time DOL appeals decisions should take. For example, in  October 2015, DOL recommended revoking Murray Energy\u2019s (Murray)  authority to self-insure due to deteriorating financial conditions. Murray  appealed this decision, and DOL officials said they postponed responding  to the appeal until their new self-insurance process was implemented so  that they could evaluate Murray under its new process along with the  other self-insured operators. However, Murray filed for bankruptcy in  October 2019 and DOL had not revoked its authority to self-insure or  requested additional collateral because Murray\u2019s appeal was still pending  and DOL was still evaluating how much collateral it would require from  the operator under its new self-insurance process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOL Does Not Monitor Whether Coal Mine Operators Maintain Commercial Insurance Coverage", "paragraphs": ["DOL does not monitor coal mine operators that do not self-insure and,  thus, must commercially insure their federal black lung liabilities to make  certain they maintain adequate and continuous coverage as required by  law. DOL previously monitored operators' compliance with the program's  insurance requirements by annually sending letters to a selection of  operators seeking confirmation that they had maintained adequate  coverage, but discontinued the process once the agency began receiving  NCCI policy data. In order to use the policy data for the purpose of  identifying operators that have not maintained coverage, DOL would, as a  starting point, have to maintain a record of all employers that operate a  coal mine. However, DOL officials explained that they do not currently  maintain such a record.", "In the absence of effective DOL monitoring of operator compliance, we  evaluated the potential risk that uninsured operators could pose to the  Trust Fund. Specifically, in examining the 13 largest coal operators that  were not approved to self-insure their federal black lung liabilities and,  therefore, had to obtain commercial coverage, we found that some  insurers erred in reporting endorsements and in one instance an operator  did not have adequate coverage.", "We found six operators (parent or subsidiary) that were not insured for  the entire 3 year period from 2016 through 2018, according to our  review of DOL data. When we discussed our findings with DOL,  agency officials had to research each operator individually and in  some cases contact the operator or their insurer to find out whether or  not they had been covered. DOL concluded that these entities were  insured. However, the insurers had not properly reported the federal  black lung endorsement on new policies or subsequent renewals, in  addition to other reporting issues.", "One of these six operators also had, inadvertently, not maintained  adequate commercial coverage for its mining operations in Texas,  and had not self-insured those operations. In this instance, the  operator obtained an excess loss policy that only pays claims once  they exceed a high threshold and, therefore, is not sufficient by itself  to secure the payment of the operator\u2019s benefit liabilities. DOL data  does not include information on excess loss policies and, while the  data NCCI provides on standard workers\u2019 compensation policies with  federal black lung endorsements lists operators\u2019 addresses, they do  not provide the specific states for which endorsements apply.", "Designing processes to achieve agency objectives and respond to risks is  a principle of effective internal controls. Without a process to monitor  operator compliance with program insurance requirements, DOL risks not  identifying a lapse or cancellation of operator coverage. This could result  in the Trust Fund having to assume responsibility for paying benefits that  would otherwise have been paid by an insurer.", "DOL officials said the Trust Fund infrequently pays claims on behalf of  uninsured operators due to the civil penalties that it can impose on  operators and certain company officers. These officials also said that  operators that do not maintain insurance coverage typically employ few  miners and are out of business by the time a claim is filed and, thus,  cannot be held liable for benefit claims. However, DOL officials  acknowledged that they do not track how often claims are paid by the  Trust Fund on behalf of uninsured operators that should have been  insured.", "We attempted to examine the extent to which claims were paid by the  Trust Fund in fiscal year 2018 on behalf of uninsured operators that  should have been insured. We found that DOL\u2019s black lung claimant  and payment system does not identify whether potentially responsible  operators should have had commercial insurance coverage. The data on  responsible operators and insurers, as well as the basis on which an  operator was determined to be responsible, were not consistently  recorded. DOL officials said that the data fields that identify responsible  operators and their insurers should reflect the information collected from  DOL\u2019s initial determination. DOL officials said that in some cases, after an  adjudication decision determined the Trust Fund was responsible for  paying benefits, claim examiners may have deleted the previously  recorded responsible operator and insurer data, creating potential  inconsistencies in the data.", "DOL officials acknowledged that its processes and guidance for recording  information on responsible operators and the basis for those decisions  resulted in inconsistent and potentially inaccurate recording of claim and  benefit data. As a result, DOL issued preliminary guidance in February  2019 to field supervisors and claims examiners. However, the revised  guidance does not include how to identify potentially responsible  operators that should have had commercial coverage but did not.", "Monitoring agency internal control systems and evaluating the results of  those activities is a principle of effective internal control. Without  complete and consistently recorded information on potentially responsible  operators and insurers, and the basis for determination decisions, DOL is  not able to effectively evaluate the financial impact claims paid on behalf  of uninsured operators have on the Trust Fund.
