GAO's audits and reviews by inspectors general note significant information security control deficiencies that place agency operations and assets at risk. In their fiscal year 2008 performance and accountability reports, 20 of 24 major agencies noted that the information system controls over their financial systems and information were either a significant deficiency or a material weakness. In addition, over the last several years, most agencies have not implemented controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer networks, systems, or information. An underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively implemented key elements for an agencywide information security program, as required by FISMA. Twenty-three of the 24 major federal agencies had weaknesses in their agencywide information security programs. Federal agencies reported increased compliance in implementing key information security control activities for fiscal year 2008; however, inspectors general at several agencies noted shortcomings with agencies' implementation of information security requirements. For fiscal year 2008 reporting, agencies reported higher levels of FISMA implementation for most information security metrics and lower levels for others. Increases were reported in the number and percentage of employees and contractors receiving security awareness training, the number and percentage of systems with tested contingency plans, and the number and percentage of systems that were certified and accredited. However, the number and percentage of employees who had significant security responsibilities and had received specialized training decreased significantly and the number and percentage of systems that had been tested and evaluated at least annually decreased slightly. In addition, the current reporting instructions do not request inspectors general to report on agencies' effectiveness of key activities and did not always provide them with clear guidance for annual reporting. This information could be useful in determining whether agencies are effectively implementing information security policies, procedures, and practices.

Information security is a critical consideration for any federal department  or agency, where information systems and computer networks are used to  carry out its mission and where maintaining the public\u2019s trust is essential.  The need for a vigilant approach to information security is demonstrated  by the increase in reports of security incidents, the wide availability of  hacking tools, and steady advances in the sophistication and effectiveness  of attack technology.", "Without proper safeguards, federal agencies\u2019 computer systems are  vulnerable to intrusions by individuals and groups with malicious  intentions who can obtain sensitive information, commit fraud, disrupt  operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and  networks. The risks to federal systems are well-founded for a number of  reasons, including the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents,  the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools, and steady advances in the  sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology. Over the past few  years, the 24 major federal agencies have reported numerous security  incidents in which sensitive information has been lost or stolen, including  personally identifiable information, which has exposed millions of  Americans to the loss of privacy, identity theft, and other financial crimes.", "Concerned by reports of significant weaknesses in federal systems,  Congress passed FISMA in 2002, which permanently authorized and  strengthened information security program, evaluation, and annual  reporting requirements for federal agencies. Six years after FISMA was  enacted, we continue to report that poor information security is a  widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences. Moreover,  since 1997, we have identified information security as a governmentwide  high-risk issue in our biennial reports to Congress.", "In my testimony today, I will summarize the results of our review of (1) the  adequacy and effectiveness of federal agencies\u2019 information security  policies and practices and (2) agencies\u2019 implementation of FISMA. We  currently have a draft report providing additional detail on that review that  we will be finalizing and issuing publicly at a later date. In conducting our  review, we analyzed agency, inspector general, Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), congressional, and our reports on information security. We  conducted the review from December 2008 to May 2009 in the Washington,  D.C., area in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "After a brief summary of the laws and guidance currently in place, my  remarks will focus on the results of our review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FISMA sets forth a comprehensive framework for ensuring the  effectiveness of information security controls over information resources  that support federal operations and assets. Its framework creates a cycle  of risk management activities necessary for an effective security program;  these activities are similar to the principles noted in our study of the risk  management activities of leading private sector organizations\u2014assessing  risk, establishing a central management focal point, implementing  appropriate policies and procedures, promoting awareness, and  monitoring and evaluating policy and control effectiveness. In order to  ensure the implementation of this framework, FISMA assigns specific  responsibilities to agency heads, chief information officers, inspectors  general, and the National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST). It  also assigns responsibilities to OMB, which include developing and  overseeing the implementation of policies, principles, standards, and  guidelines on information security and reviewing, at least annually, and  approving or disapproving, agency information security programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Law and Policy Established Federal Information Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["FISMA requires each agency, including agencies with national security  systems, to develop, document, and implement an agencywide information  security program to provide security for the information and information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, including  those provided or managed by another agency, contractor, or other  source. Specifically, FISMA requires information security programs to  include, among other things    periodic assessments of the risk that could result from the compromise of  information or information systems;  risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level;   subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems;   security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors;    periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices;   a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies;   procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations; and    an annually updated inventory of major information systems operated by  the agency or under its control.", "FISMA also requires each agency to report annually to OMB, selected  congressional committees, and the comptroller general on the adequacy of  its information security policies, procedures, practices, and compliance  with requirements. In addition, agency heads are required to report  annually the results of their independent evaluations to OMB, except to  the extent that an evaluation pertains to a national security system; then  only a summary and assessment of that portion of the evaluation needs to  be reported to OMB.", "NIST, agency inspectors general, and OMB also play key roles under  FISMA. NIST, for example, is required to provide standards and guidance  to agencies on information security. In addition, NIST is tasked with  developing a definition of and guidelines for detection and handling of  information security incidents as well as guidelines developed in  conjunction with the Department of Defense and the National Security  Agency for identifying an information system as a national security  system. NIST has issued guidance through its FISMA Implementation  Project and has expanded its work through other security activities. In  addition, NIST\u2019s computer security division issued its 2008 annual report,  as mandated by FISMA. Agency inspectors general are required to perform  an independent annual evaluation of the agency\u2019s information security  program and practices. These reviews should include testing of  information security procedures, policies, and practices for a  representative subset of agency systems, as well as an assessment of  compliance with FISMA and any related information security policies,  procedures, standards, and guidelines.", "FISMA also requires OMB to develop policies, principles, standards, and  guidelines on information security and is required to report annually to  Congress on agency compliance with the requirements of the act. OMB has  provided instructions to federal agencies and their inspectors general for  preparing annual FISMA reports.

For example, our analysis of inspector general,  agency, and our own reports reveals that agencies did not have adequate  controls in place to ensure that only authorized individuals could access or  manipulate data on their systems and networks. Weaknesses were  reported in such controls at 23 of 24 major agencies for fiscal year 2008.  Agencies did not consistently (1) identify and authenticate users to  prevent unauthorized access, (2) enforce the principle of least privilege to  ensure that authorized access was necessary and appropriate, (3) establish  sufficient boundary protection mechanisms, (4) apply encryption to  protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices, and (5) log, audit,  and monitor security-relevant events. At least nine agencies also lacked  effective controls to restrict physical access to information assets. We  have previously reported that many of the data losses occurring at federal  agencies over the past few years were a result of physical thefts or  improper safeguarding of systems, including laptops and other portable  devices.", "In addition, agencies did not always configure network devices and  services to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity, patch  key servers and workstations in a timely manner, or segregate  incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one  individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction.  Furthermore, agencies did not always ensure that continuity of operations  plans contained all essential information necessary to restore services in a  timely manner. Weaknesses in these areas increase the risk of  unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, or loss of information.", "An underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified at  federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively implemented  key elements for an agencywide information security program, as required  by FISMA. An agencywide security program, as required by FISMA,  provides a framework and continuing cycle of activity for assessing and  managing risk, developing and implementing security policies and  procedures, promoting security awareness and training, monitoring the  adequacy of the entity\u2019s computer-related controls through security tests  and evaluations, and implementing remedial actions as appropriate.  Twenty-three of the 24 major federal agencies had weaknesses in their  agencywide information security programs.

We have also recommended that  agencies fully implement comprehensive, agencywide information security  programs by correcting shortcomings in risk assessments, information  security policies and procedures, security planning, security training,  system tests and evaluations, and remedial actions. The effective  implementation of these recommendations will strengthen the security  posture at these agencies.", "In addition, the White House, OMB, and some federal agencies have  continued or launched several governmentwide initiatives that are  intended to enhance information security at federal agencies.

Almost all major agencies  reported weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls  during fiscal year 2008. Despite these persistent weaknesses, agencies  reported increased compliance in implementing key information security  activities. While the inspectors general and OMB have made progress  toward fulfilling their statutory requirements, OMB\u2019s annual reporting  instructions did not cover key security activities and were not always  clear. In addition, OMB did not include key information about findings and  significant deficiencies identified by inspectors general in its  governmentwide report to Congress and did not approve or disapprove  agency information security programs.
