By organizational alignment, we mean the integration of organizational components, activities, core processes, and resources to support efficient and effective achievement of outcomes. SBA\u2019s mission is to maintain and strengthen the nation\u2019s economy by aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of the nation\u2019s small businesses and by helping businesses and families recover from natural disasters. SBA has a total portfolio of about $44 billion, including $39 billion in direct and guaranteed small business loans and other guarantees and $5 billion in disaster loans. Over three-quarters of SBA\u2019s 4,075 employees are assigned to the agency\u2019s 10 regional offices, 70 district offices, and other field locations.", "In the past 10 years, SBA has made changes to both its organizational structure and service delivery. In response to budget reductions in the 1990s, SBA streamlined its field structure, downsized its 10 regional offices, and created the Office of Field Operations to act as liaison with the district offices, a function formerly performed by the regional offices. Additionally, SBA restructured its loan programs by creating centers to process and serve the majority of loans\u2014work once largely handled by the district offices. SBA has also gone from making loans directly to guaranteeing loans made by commercial lenders. Most recently, to guide organizational changes needed to improve its delivery of services and respond to issues and challenges raised by GAO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the SBA Inspector General, SBA has drafted a plan for a 5-year workforce transformation. The draft plan we obtained recognizes SBA\u2019s need to restructure its workforce, privatize non-core functions, adjust incentives and goals, and streamline its headquarters\u2019 operation.", "Our testimony today is based primarily on the report we issued on October 26, 2001, as well as additional GAO human capital-related work and our review of SBA\u2019s draft 5-year workforce transformation plan. Our remarks will focus on (1) SBA\u2019s current organizational alignment, issues it poses in SBA\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission, and SBA\u2019s draft workforce transformation plans; and (2) information SBA should consider as it moves forward with its transformation plan. In conducting our work for the October 26, 2001 report, we obtained documents on both current SBA alignment and past reorganization efforts, reviewed laws mandating aspects of SBA\u2019s organization, analyzed the restructuring efforts of other federal agencies, and collected information on best practices in organizational alignment. In addition, we interviewed 78 senior SBA officials in headquarters and field offices.", "SBA\u2019s current structure contributes to the challenges SBA faces in delivering services to the small business community. In particular, ineffective lines of communication; confusion over the mission of district offices; complicated, overlapping organizational relationships; and a field structure not consistently matched with mission requirements combine to impede the efforts of SBA staff to deliver services effectively.

The problem areas include cumbersome communication links between headquarters and field units; complex, overlapping organizational relationships; confusion about the district offices\u2019 primary customer; and a field structure not consistently matched with mission requirements. According to the agency scorecard report for SBA, while SBA recognizes the need to restructure, little progress has been made to date.

The Office of Field Operations had fewer than 10 staff at the time of our review, and senior SBA officials told us that it would be impossible for such a small office to facilitate the flow of information between headquarters and district offices as well as was done by the 10 regional offices when each region had its own liaison staff. As a result, headquarters program offices sometimes communicate with the district offices directly and they sometimes go through the Office of Field Operations. To further complicate communication, the regional offices are still responsible for monitoring goals and coordinating administrative priorities to the district locations. Officials described how these multiple lines of communication have led to district staff being on the receiving end of conflicting or redundant requests. While some SBA officials felt that the regions had a positive effect on communication between headquarters and the districts, others felt that the regions were an unnecessary layer of management. The SBA Inspector General\u2019s office found similar problems with communication within SBA when it conducted management challenge discussion groups with almost 50 senior officials from SBA headquarters, regional, and district offices.", "SBA has recognized that as it transforms itself, it needs to make the lines of communication between the districts, regions, and headquarters clearer to help bring about quick, effective decision-making. SBA plans to increase the responsibilities of the regional offices, perhaps by adding a career deputy regional administrator to assist the Regional Administrator in overseeing the district offices. Under SBA\u2019s draft plan, the deputy would also work closely with the Office of Field Operations to coordinate program delivery in the field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overlapping Organizational Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["We also found evidence of complex, overlapping organizational relationships, particularly among field and headquarters units. For example, district staff working on SBA loan programs report to their district management, while loan processing and servicing center staff report directly to the Office of Capital Access in headquarters. Yet, district office loan program staffs sometimes need to work with the loan processing and servicing centers to get information or to expedite loans for lenders in their district. Because loan processing and servicing centers report directly to the Office of Capital Access, requests that are directed to the centers sometimes must go from the district through the Office of Capital Access then back to the centers. District managers and staff said that sometimes they cannot get answers to questions when lenders call and that they have trouble expediting loans because they lack authority to direct the centers to take any action. Lender association representatives said that the lines of authority between headquarters and the field can be confusing and that practices vary from district to district. Figure 1 depicts the variety of organizational relationships we found between SBA headquarters and field units.", "SBA plans to eliminate the current complicated overlapping organizational relationships between field organizations and headquarters organizations by consolidating functions and establishing specific lines of authority. SBA\u2019s draft transformation plan states that this effort will reduce management layers and provide a more efficient management structure. Specifically, SBA plans to further centralize loan processing, servicing, oversight, and liquidation functions; eliminate area offices for surety bonds and procurements by making regional or district offices responsible; and move oversight for entrepreneurial development programs to district offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disagreement Regarding the District Office\u2019s Primary Customer", "paragraphs": ["We found disagreement within SBA over the primary customer of the district offices. Headquarters executives said that the district offices primarily serve small businesses, while district office officials told us that their primary clients are lenders. The headquarters officials said that the role of the district office was in transition and that, because many lending activities had been centralized, the new role for the district offices was to work with small businesses. However, the district office managers said that their performance ratings were weighted heavily on aspects of loan activity. Moreover, there is only one program\u20148(a) business development\u2014through which district offices typically work directly with small businesses, further reinforcing the perception of the district managers that lenders rather than small businesses are their primary customers.", "According to SBA\u2019s transformation plan, the mission of its districts will become one of marketing SBA\u2019s continuum of services, focusing on the customer, and providing entrepreneurial development assistance. SBA stated that over the next 5 years, it is fully committed to making fundamental changes at the district level, changes that have been discussed for years, but have never been fully implemented. To begin this change, SBA plans to test specific strategies for focusing district offices\u2019 goals and efforts on outreach and marketing of SBA services to small businesses and on lender oversight in three offices during fiscal year 2002. SBA plans to implement the results in 10-20 districts in fiscal year 2003. As part of this change, SBA will need to carefully consider how the new mission of its district offices will affect the knowledge, skills, and abilities\u2014competencies\u2014district staff will need to be successful in their new roles. If competency gaps are identified, SBA will need to develop recruitment, training, development, and performance management programs to address those gaps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Field Structure Not Consistently Matched with Mission Requirements", "paragraphs": ["SBA managers said that, in some cases, the current field structure does not consistently match mission requirements. For example, the creation of loan processing and servicing centers moved some, but not all, loan- related workload out of the district offices. District offices retained responsibility for the more difficult loans and loans made by infrequent lenders. Similarly, the regional offices were downsized, but not eliminated during the 1990s. In addition, they said that some offices and centers are not located to best accomplish the agency\u2019s mission. For example, Iowa has two district offices located less than 130 miles apart, and neither manages a very large share of SBA\u2019s lending program or other workload. SBA also has a loan-related center located in New York City, a very high- cost area where it has trouble attracting and retaining staff. Figure 2 shows the locations of SBA offices around the country.", "SBA officials also stressed that congressional direction has played a part in SBA\u2019s current structure. SBA officials pointed out that Congress has created many new offices, programs, aspects of existing programs, and pilot projects and has prescribed reporting relationship, grade, and/or type of appointment for several senior SBA officials. We found 78 offices, programs, or program changes that were created by laws since 1961, with most of the changes occurring in the 1980s and 1990s. Eleven SBA staff positions and specific reporting relationships were also required by law.", "In its transformation plan, SBA discusses its difficulty with matching its field structure with mission requirements and states that in order for the field structure to reflect the new mission and customer focus, consolidation of functions and the elimination or reduction of redundant offices may be necessary. The result of consolidations will be a streamlined organization with reduced management layers and an increased span of control for the field organizations that remain. For example, over the course of the 5-year plan, SBA plans to consolidate all loan processing, servicing, and liquidation into fewer centers, but give them an expanded role for handling all the functions currently carried out in the district offices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Organizational Alignment is Crucial to Maximizing Performance and Ensuring Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Integrating personnel, programs, processes, and resources to support the most efficient and effective delivery of services\u2014organizational alignment\u2014is key to maximizing an agency\u2019s performance and ensuring its accountability.
