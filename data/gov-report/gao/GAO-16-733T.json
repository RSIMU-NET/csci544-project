In preparing the draft report on which this testimony is based, GAO reviewed 32 18F projects and 13 USDS projects that were underway or completed as of August 2015 and surveyed agencies about these projects; reviewed 18F and USDS in key performance measurement and project prioritization practices; reviewed 25 agencies' efforts to establish digital service teams; and reviewed documentation from four agencies, which were chosen based on their progress made in establishing digital service teams."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In a draft report, GAO determined that the General Service Administration's (GSA) 18F and Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) U.S. Digital Service (USDS) have provided a variety of services to agencies supporting their information technology (IT) efforts. Specifically, 18F staff helped 18 agencies with 32 projects and generally provided development and consulting services, including software development solutions and acquisition consulting. In addition, USDS provided assistance on 13 projects across 11 agencies and generally provided consulting services, including quality assurance, problem identification and recommendations, and software engineering. Further, according to GAO's survey, managers were generally satisfied with the services they received from 18F and USDS on these projects (see table).", "Both 18F and USDS have partially implemented practices to identify and help agencies address problems with IT projects. Specifically, 18F has developed several outcome-oriented goals and related performance measures, as well as procedures for prioritizing projects; however, not all of its goals are outcome-oriented and it has not yet fully measured program performance. Similarly, USDS has developed goals, but they are not all outcome-oriented and it has established performance measures for only one of its goals. USDS has also measured progress for just one goal. Further, it has not fully implemented its procedures for prioritizing projects. Until 18F and USDS fully implement these practices, it will be difficult to hold the programs accountable for results.", "Agencies are beginning to establish digital service teams. Of the 25 agencies that requested funding for these teams, OMB has established charters with 6 agencies for their digital service teams. In addition, according to the USDS Deputy Administrator, USDS plans to establish charters with an additional 3 agencies by the end of the fiscal year\u2014the Department of Education, as well as the Social Security Administration and Small Business Administration. For the remaining 16 agencies, as of April 2016, 8 agencies reported that they plan to establish digital service teams but have yet to establish charters with USDS. The other 8 agencies reported that they do not plan to establish digital service teams by September 2016 because they did not receive requested funding. Further, of the four agencies GAO selected to review, only one has defined the relationship between its digital service team and the agency Chief Information Officer (CIO). This is due, in part, to the fact that USDS policy does not describe the expected relationship between CIOs and these teams. Until OMB updates its policy and ensures that the responsibilities between the CIOs and digital services teams are clearly defined, it is unclear whether CIOs will be able to fulfill their statutory responsibilities with respect to IT management of the projects undertaken by the digital service teams."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's draft report includes two recommendations to GSA and three recommendations to OMB to improve goals and performance measurement.

For example, it performed a discovery sprint for  the Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service that  focused on three areas: authentication of taxpayers, modernizing  systems through event-driven architecture, and redesigning the  agency\u2019s website. USDS delivered a report to the Internal Revenue  Service with recommendations and also suggested that work initially  focus on taxpayer authentication. Consistent with these  recommendations, the group and the agency decided to initially focus  on authentication, to include re-opening of the online application  GetTranscript.", "For the Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s  National Incident Based Reporting System, according to USDS, the  program performed a discovery sprint and made several  recommendations for accelerating deployment of the system.", "Website consultation. USDS provided consultation services for three  agency website projects. For example, for the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Agreements  website, USDS provided website design advice and confirmed that  the agency had the necessary scalability to support the number of  anticipated visitors. Additionally, it consulted with the Office of  Personnel and Management (OPM) on the design, implementation,  and development of a website for providing information on reported  data breaches.", "System stabilization. For the Department of State\u2019s Consular  Consolidated Database, according to USDS, it helped stabilize the  system and return it to operational service after a multi-week outage  in June 2015.", "Information security assessment. USDS helped with an information  security assessment regarding Electronic Questionnaires for  Investigations Processing, which encompasses the electronic  applications used to process federal background check investigations.", "Software engineering. For the Department of Homeland Security  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Transformation project,  USDS\u2019s software engineering advisors provided guidance on private  sector best practices in delivering modern digital services. According  to the department, the group\u2019s work has supported accomplishments  such as increasing the frequency of software releases and improving  adoption of agile development best practices.", "Data management. For the Department of Homeland Security Office  of Immigration Statistics, USDS helped to develop monthly reports on  immigration enforcement priority statistics. According to the  department, USDS supported the development of processes for  obtaining data from other offices within the department and generating  the monthly reports. According to the department, after 7 weeks of  working with USDS, it was able to develop a proof of concept that  reduced the report generating process from a month to 1 day.", "Seven of the 13 projects are associated with major IT investments.

Table 4 describes the  associated investments, including their primary functional areas  planned fiscal year 2016 spending, and CIO rating as of May 2016.", "In addition to helping agencies improve IT services, USDS has developed  guidance for agencies. For example, it developed the Digital Services  Playbook to provide government-wide recommendations on practices for  building digital services. The group also created the TechFAR  Handbook to explain how agencies can use the Digital Services Playbook  in ways that are consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Further, USDS, in collaboration with 18F, developed the draft version of  U.S. Web Design Standards, which includes a visual style guide and a  collection of common user interface components. With this guide, USDS  aims to improve government website consistency and accessibility.", "In addition to developing guidance, USDS, in collaboration with OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Procurement Policy, used challenge.gov to incentivize  the public to create a digital service training program for federal contract  professionals. The challenge winner received $250,000 to develop and  pilot a training program. Additionally, the Deputy Administrator for USDS  stated that 30 federal contract professionals from more than 10 agencies  completed this pilot program in March 2016.

(2) How cost-efficient will the USDS investment be? and  (3) What potential exists to use or reuse a technological solution across  the government?
