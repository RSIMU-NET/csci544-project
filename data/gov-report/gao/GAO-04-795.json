However, GAO's review of visas revoked from October to December 2003, including a detailed review of a random sample of 35 cases, showed that weaknesses remained in the implementation of the revocation process, especially in the timely transmission of information among federal agencies. For example, delays existed in matching names of suspected terrorists with names of visa holders and in forwarding necessary information to State. In at least 3 of the 35 cases, it took State 6 months or more to revoke visas after receiving a recommendation to do so. In 3 cases, State took a week or longer after deciding to revoke visas to post a lookout or notify DHS. Without these notifications, DHS may not know to investigate those individuals who may be in the country. In 10 cases, DHS either failed to notify or took several months to notify immigration investigators that individuals with revoked visas may be in the country. It then took over 2 months for immigration investigators to request field investigations of these individuals. After GAO initiated its inquiry for this report in January 2004, additional actions were taken to improve the process, including revising procedures and reassessing the process. DHS and State believe these actions will help avoid the delays experienced in the past. In April and May, State revised its procedures and formalized its tracking system for visa revocation cases. In March, DHS developed new written procedures and acted to ensure that immigration investigators are aware of all individuals with revoked visas who may be in the country. State and DHS also took some steps to address legal and policy issues related to visa revocations. In April, the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC), an interagency group organized under the FBI, identified the visa revocation process as a potential homeland security vulnerability and developed an informal process for TSC to handle visa revocation cases. However, weaknesses remain. For example, State's and DHS's procedures are not fully coordinated and lack performance standards, such as specific time frames, for completing each step of the process. Outstanding legal and policy issues continue to exist regarding the removal of individuals based solely on their visa revocation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As stated in the President\u2019s National Strategy for Homeland Security, the  U.S. government has no more important mission than protecting the  homeland from future terrorist attacks. The strategy calls for preventing  the entry of foreign terrorists into our country and using all legal means to  identify; halt; and, where appropriate, prosecute or initiate immigration or  other proceedings against terrorists in the United States. The U.S.  homeland security strategy, involving a variety of federal agencies, has  multiple tools for preventing potential terrorists from entering the country  and identifying potential terrorists that have already entered. The visa  revocation process is one such tool.", "In June 2003 we reported that agencies lacked written procedures to  ensure that appropriate personnel are notified and take specific actions  when the Department of State (State) revokes visas on terrorism   grounds. As a result, lookouts were not always posted, other agencies  were not always notified of visa revocations, and there were potential  investigative gaps on individuals with visas revoked based on terrorism  concerns who were in the United States. We recommended that the  Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State  and Attorney General, develop specific policies and procedures for the  interagency visa revocation process to ensure that revocation notices and  related information are transmitted to the appropriate immigration and  law enforcement agencies in a timely manner. We also recommended that  they develop a specific policy on actions that immigration and law  enforcement agencies should take to investigate and locate individuals  who remain in the United States after their visas are revoked.", "At your request, we examined whether weaknesses in the visa revocation  process identified in our June 2003 report were addressed.

This  sample is not projectable because of data problems discussed in appendix  I. We did not review Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) activities to  investigate suspected terrorists. We conducted our evaluation in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Our nation\u2019s border security process includes multiple mechanisms for  addressing potential terrorist threats to the United States. One of these  mechanisms is the visa revocation process. The visa revocation process is  a homeland security tool that can prevent potential terrorists from  entering the United States and can help immigration and law enforcement  officials identify and investigate potential terrorists already in the country.  The visa revocation process begins after consular officers at the  Department of State\u2019s overseas consular posts adjudicate visa applications  for foreign nationals who wish to temporarily enter the United States for  business, tourism, or other reasons. After receiving a visa, foreign  nationals travel to ports of entry within the United States. At ports of  entry, inspectors from DHS\u2019s Customs and Border Protection determine  whether the visa holder is admitted to the United States and, if so, how  long he or she may remain in the country. Once foreign nationals have  entered the United States, DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement  assumes responsibility for enforcing our immigration laws, including  ensuring that foreign nationals are eligible to remain in the United States.", "According to State officials, most visa revocations on terrorism grounds  begin with information from the TIPOFF database, the U.S. government\u2019s  primary terrorist watch list. The TIPOFF database includes individuals the  U.S. government suspects may have ties to terrorism. Information in the  TIPOFF database is provided by various federal agencies including the  FBI, State, and others. At the time of our previous report, this information  was managed by State\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research. In December  2003, TSC assumed responsibility for this function. TSC was officially  formed in December 2003 as a result of a presidential directive designed to  increase information sharing across agencies and to facilitate better  understanding between the intelligence and investigation communities. As  an interagency organization under the administration of the FBI with  representatives from State, DHS, and other federal agencies, part of its  role is to work with federal agencies to provide access to the TIPOFF  database. Figure 1 depicts the visa revocation process in effect during the  October to December 2003 time period we analyzed for this report as  described in agency procedures and as explained to us by agency officials.", "State uses information in TIPOFF to determine if visa holders may be  suspected or actual terrorists. When TSC adds individuals in TIPOFF to  the Department of State\u2019s Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS),  it provides a list of these names to Consular Affairs. State officials told us  that the entry of these names into CLASS and the Interagency Border  Inspection System (IBIS) should help prevent any of those individuals  from entering the United States because border inspectors will be alerted  to deny them entry. This lookout process does not completely address the  potential vulnerability posed by individuals already in the country.  Therefore, the visa revocation process is an important tool to help identify  individuals whom immigration and law enforcement officials should locate  and investigate. After TSC adds names to CLASS and IBIS, Consular  Affairs compares these names with its database of all visa holders and  sends an electronic spreadsheet back to TSC containing probable or  possible matches. TSC refines this list by identifying direct matches and  recommends that Consular Affairs revoke these individuals\u2019 visas. It also  sends Consular Affairs an information package containing a summary of  the derogatory information that led TSC to the recommendation to revoke.", "After determining that the revocation is appropriate, the Consular Affairs  officer posts a lookout in CLASS for the individual. According to State and  DHS officials, this lookout is then accessible in near real time to DHS  inspectors at border ports of entry through the IBIS database. CBP  inspectors at ports of entry use IBIS to check whether foreign nationals  are inadmissible and should be denied entry into the United States. When a  person comes to the United States by air or by sea, CBP inspectors are  required to check that person\u2019s name in IBIS before he or she is allowed to  enter the country. After posting the lookout, the Consular Affairs officer  writes an internal case file memo summarizing the derogatory information,  creates a draft revocation certificate and cable for management review,  and forwards these materials to the appropriate officials within State.  Once these officials clear and sign the revocation certificate, Consular  Affairs sends a cable instructing the overseas post that issued the visa to  contact the visa holder, physically cancel the visa, and report all actions  taken to State. State also notifies other federal agencies of visa  revocations. Specifically, Consular Affairs\u2019 Visa Office faxes a copy of the  revocation certificate to CBP. In addition, the Visa Office sends a copy of  the cable by email that includes the wording of the revocation certificate  to various other agencies, including CBP and ICE.", "Upon receiving the notification from State, CBP determines whether the  individual may have already legally entered the United States by  electronically searching immigration records. If CBP determines that the  individual may be in the country, it notifies ICE. ICE officials also attempt  to determine whether the individual may be in the country. Once ICE  determines that an individual with a visa revoked on national security  grounds may be in the United States, ICE employees query law  enforcement and open source information to attempt to locate the  individual. If they determine that the individual is in the country, they  conduct an additional investigation in law enforcement and intelligence  databases and forward the results of this preliminary research to the  appropriate Special Agent in Charge (field) office or offices. The ICE  Special Agent in Charge office then coordinates with the FBI and conducts  an investigation to locate the individual and determine if the alien is in  compliance with all terms of his or her admission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FBI\u2019s Role in Border Security", "paragraphs": ["While FBI investigators do not play a formal role in the visa revocation  process, they play a key role in the U.S. government\u2019s overall border  security efforts, including investigating suspected terrorists in the United  States.

According to FBI officials, the TIPOFF database is central  to the FBI\u2019s efforts to track suspected terrorists in the United States. When  names of suspected terrorists are added to TIPOFF, this information may  originate from the FBI.

In  addition, conflicting records of how many individuals\u2019 visas were revoked  for terrorism concerns during our reporting period and which of these  people may be in the United States suggest a risk that agencies may have  been prevented from taking appropriate action in some cases. Further, we  found that ICE was not consistently or promptly notified after CBP  determined that aliens with revoked visas might be in the United States.  We also found that ICE officials were generally unaware of the basis for  individual revocations. Additionally, we found that ICE waited more than 2  months to request that field offices investigate individuals with visas  revoked on terrorism grounds who may be in the country. Finally,  outstanding legal and policy issues continue to exist regarding the removal  of individuals based solely on their visa revocation.", "Our review of all visas revoked on terrorism grounds from October  through December 2003 showed that delays occurred in identifying  individuals whose visas should be revoked. According to a State official, in  August and September 2003, there was a backlog of approximately 5,000  names of suspected terrorists in TIPOFF that had not been screened to  identify any visa holders. Therefore, there was a delay between identifying  individuals who may be suspected terrorists and determining whether they  had a visa. This official explained that the backlog developed in part  because of a quadrupling in the amount of counterterrorism intelligence  gathered after September 11 without a commensurate increase in staff  allocated to screen this intelligence information. She added that the  backlog was cleared in December 2003 following the temporary  assignment of additional staff from Consular Affairs.", "Our review of a sample of 35 visas revoked based on terrorism concerns  showed that delays occurred in transmitting recommendations to  Consular Affairs to revoke visas. To eliminate the backlog of names to be  checked, Consular Affairs temporarily assigned two full-time employees to  screen these intelligence data from TIPOFF. TSC officials told us that  terrorism intelligence should be screened to identify visa holders as  quickly as possible. A TSC contractor who typically performs this duty  said that TSC normally sends an average of no more than six  recommendations for visa revocation per day. However, according to a  TSC official, during the time that the Consular Affairs staff were  temporarily assigned to screen intelligence, these staff waited until they  had collected large quantities of recommendations and sent them to  Consular Affairs in large batches. As a result, about 260 visa revocations  on terrorism grounds during the 3-month period we examined were  processed on 2 days, November 25 and December 1.

Additionally, the Visa Office now requires its  personnel performing visa revocations to certify that they have completed  all steps in the process and to provide the date on which each step was  completed. At the end of the process, a designated supervisor must now  review the revocation file and certify that the standard operating  procedures were completed correctly. State revised these procedures  again in late May 2004 to further clarify which federal agencies should  receive notification of the revocation.

We found that the total number of visa revocations differed among these  three data sources. We identified discrepancies and discussed these with  agency officials. In addition, we obtained copies of the official revocation  certificates for individuals whose visas State revoked during that time. We  determined that State made at least 338 visa revocations during this time  period, but we also determined that the data on visa revocations were not  sufficiently reliable to provide an exact count of the number of  revocations.

For the individuals in our sample of 35, we obtained printouts from State\u2019s  Consular Consolidated Database, which provided us with the individuals\u2019  names, biographic data such as dates and places of birth, passport  numbers, and visa information such as issuing posts and types of visa. We  also obtained a copy of the cable sent by State headquarters to the post  that issued the visa that was revoked.

As such, we determined that these data are not sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of determining which individuals with visas  revoked on terrorism grounds are in the country. In addition, because ICE  officials told us they do not rely on CBP to determine which individuals  might be in the country, we obtained additional entry and exit data from  ICE for our sample of 35 cases.

Our report did not indicate that any of the individuals included in our  review were necessarily suspected or actual terrorists. The  Department of State revokes a person\u2019s visa as a precautionary  measure after it learns that person might be a suspected terrorist. The  purpose of this revocation is to obtain additional information from the  person to determine if they are the same person that is suspected to be  a terrorist by requiring them to return to the consulate that issued their  visa. In commenting on our draft report, State explained that all of  these revocations were based on information suggesting possible  terrorist activities or links.  3.  Based on our analysis, we reported that ICE and CBP records  conflicted regarding whether specific individuals whose visas were  revoked on terrorism grounds were or may still be in the country. With  regard to one of these individuals, ICE concluded that the individual  was not in the country and therefore, it did not investigate him.  According to CBP data, this individual has been in the country for  more than a year.

The posting of lookouts in CLASS and IBIS is an important tool for  preventing potential terrorists from entering the country.

As such, the visa revocation process remains a useful tool for  promptly identifying, locating, and investigating individuals who may  be in the United States and may pose a threat to homeland security.  2.  We acknowledge that the Department of State should appropriately  deliberate over visa revocation cases. However, State officials told us  that their involvement in the entire visa revocation process should take  no longer than one week. Given this standard, State\u2019s delay in three  cases of more than 6 months appears excessive.  3.  This report includes a review of all 330+ visas revoked on terrorism  grounds from October through December 2003, including a detailed  review of a random sample of 35 cases. We chose to review this 3- month period to allow some time for the agencies involved to  implement our recommendations for improving the visa revocation  process contained in our June 2003 report.

In February 2004, we requested detailed information from State on 35  individuals whose visas State had revoked on terrorism grounds from  October through December 2003. In April, we received this  information. After reviewing the data, we discussed our preliminary  findings with the Managing Director of State\u2019s Office of Visa Services,  including delays in State\u2019s decisions to revoke three individuals\u2019 visas.   The same day, we provided State the names of these three individuals  and requested information on why these delays occurred. In May, a  State official provided an explanation of State\u2019s actions regarding these  individuals. However, we chose to exclude this information from our  report due to the sensitivity of the type of information involved.  5.  In February 2004, we requested detailed information (including when  lookout codes were entered) for a random sample of 35 visa  revocation cases. In April 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for  Consular Affairs informed us that in researching and gathering this  information, State discovered that, in some cases, the officer  responsible for handling revocations did not enter the revocation  lookout code immediately into CLASS before the revocation certificate  was signed.  6.  Based on information State provided during the course of our review,  we note that State revises its standard operating procedures for visa  revocations as necessary. After reviewing our draft report, State  provided us with a revised copy of its standard operating procedures  dated June 17, 2004, which included more explicit time frames. We  believe this is a good step toward implementing our recommendation.  7.  In conducting this review, we requested a list of individuals whose  visas were revoked based on terrorism concerns from October through  December 2003 from State, CBP, and ICE. State asserts that the  conflicting records were probably due to different methodologies for  compiling various agencies\u2019 lists. We note that we observed multiple  instances where conflicting records could not be explained by  differing methodologies.

We have updated our report to reflect the current status of State\u2019s and  DHS\u2019s discussions of legal and policy issues and have removed all  references to unresolved legal disagreements.  We have added  information reflecting a recent informal understanding reached by  State and DHS that, on a case by case basis, DHS may ask that State  revoke a visa retroactively.  However, we note that legal and policy  issues regarding the removal of individuals based solely on their visa  revocations continue to exist, and agency discussions on how to  address these issues have not been completed.    9.  During the course of our review, State\u2019s and DHS\u2019s discussions evolved  regarding legal and policy issues relating to removing individuals from  the United States based on visa revocations.
