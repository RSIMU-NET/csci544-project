Congress passed the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 to better coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies and financial regulators in combating money laundering. This act required the issuance of an annual National Money Laundering Strategy for 5 years, ending with the issuance of the 2003 strategy. To help with deliberations on reauthorization, GAO determined (1) agency perspectives on the benefit of the strategy and factors that affected its development and implementation, (2) whether the strategy has served as a useful mechanism for guiding the coordination of federal law enforcement agencies' efforts, (3) the role of the strategy in influencing the activities of federal financial regulators, and (4) whether the strategy has reflected key critical components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Treasury, Justice, and financial regulatory officials with whom GAO spoke said that the National Money Laundering Strategy was initially beneficial but that, over time, certain factors and events affected its development and implementation. They endorsed the concept of a strategy to coordinate the federal government's efforts to combat money laundering and related financial crimes. They also said that the strategy initially had a positive effect on promoting interagency planning and communication, but different agency views emerged over the scope and commitment required, and other events affected the strategy, such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The strategy generally has not served as a useful mechanism for guiding the coordination of federal law enforcement agencies' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. While Treasury and Justice made progress on some strategy initiatives designed to enhance interagency coordination of money laundering investigations, most have not achieved the expectations called for in the annual strategies. Also, the 2002 strategy did not address agency roles in investigating terrorist financing, thus, it did not help resolve potential duplication of efforts and disagreements over which agency should lead investigations. In May 2003, Justice and Homeland Security reached an agreement aimed at resolving these problems. Most financial regulators GAO interviewed said that the strategy had some influence on their anti-money laundering efforts because it provided a forum for enhanced coordination, particularly with law enforcement agencies. However, they said that it has had less influence than other factors. They described several other influences on their efforts, particularly their ongoing oversight responsibilities in ensuring compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and, more recently, the USA PATRIOT Act, which was passed in October 2001 to fight terrorist financing and increase anti-money laundering efforts. GAO's work reviewing national strategies has identified several critical components needed for development and implementation; however, key components have not been well reflected in the strategy. The first is clearly defined leadership, with the ability to marshal necessary resources. However, the leadership for the strategy has not agreed on the strategy's scope or ensured that target dates for completing initiatives were met. The second is clear priorities, as identified by threat and risk assessments, to help focus resources on the greatest needs. Each strategy contained more priorities than could be realistically achieved and none of the strategies was linked to a threat and risk assessment. The third is that established accountability mechanisms provide a basis for monitoring and assessing program performance. While later strategies contained several initiatives designed to establish performance measures, as of July 2003, none had yet been completed. Officials attributed this to the difficulty in establishing such measures for combating money laundering."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Money laundering\u2014the process of disguising or concealing illicit funds to  make them appear legitimate\u2014is a serious issue, with an estimated  $500 billion to $1 trillion laundered worldwide annually, according to the  United Nations Office of Drug Control and Prevention. Money laundering provides the fuel for drug dealers, arms traffickers, terrorists, and other  criminals to operate and expand their activities, which can have devastating social and economic consequences.", "Although the U.S. government had been working to combat money  laundering for many years, efforts by law enforcement and regulatory  agencies took on particular urgency, as the operations of large-scale  criminal organizations grew increasingly sophisticated. To better  coordinate the anti-money laundering efforts of federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies and financial regulators, Congress enacted the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 (Strategy  Act). This act called for the annual issuance of a strategy to combat  money laundering\u2014the National Money Laundering Strategy (NMLS). This  requirement will end with the issuance of the 2003 strategy unless  reauthorized by Congress. In anticipation of reauthorization discussions,  Congress is interested in knowing how the strategy has affected  coordination and whether improvements could be made to increase its  benefits.", "While money laundering first became a federal crime in 1986 with the  passage of the Money Laundering Control Act, law enforcement and the  federal financial regulators had sought to protect the U.S. financial system  from certain types of criminal activity since the passage of the Bank  Secrecy Act (BSA) in 1970, which instituted currency reporting  requirements. By periodically amending the BSA, Congress has added  anti-money laundering requirements for many types of financial  institutions and transactions. Such amendments and the resulting  regulations have increased the number of federal agencies with  responsibility for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering  requirements, thereby creating a need to coordinate the efforts of  numerous financial regulatory and law enforcement agencies. Appendix II  describes major anti-money laundering legislation since 1970.", "The Strategy Act requires the President\u2014acting through the Secretary of  the Treasury and in consultation with the Attorney General and other  relevant federal, state, and local law enforcement and regulatory  officials\u2014to develop and submit the annual NMLS to Congress by  February 1 of each year from 1999 through 2003. The goal of the Strategy  Act is to increase coordination and cooperation among the various  regulatory and enforcement agencies and to effectively distribute  resources to combat money laundering. The Strategy Act requires the  NMLS to define comprehensive, research-based goals, objectives, and  priorities for reducing money laundering and related financial crime in the  United States. The NMLS has generally included multiple priorities to  combat money laundering to guide federal agencies\u2019 activities.  Additionally, the Strategy Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to  designate High Intensity Money Laundering and Related Financial Crime  Areas (HIFCA), in which federal, state, and local law enforcement would  work cooperatively to develop a focused and comprehensive approach to  targeting money laundering activity.", "In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed  the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools  Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT  Act) to, among other things, both fight terrorist financing and increase  anti-money laundering efforts through further expansion of the types of  financial institutions and transactions that are subject to anti-money  laundering record keeping and reporting requirements. The NMLS has  also changed to reflect new federal priorities in the aftermath of  September 11, 2001, including a goal to combat terrorist financing in 2002.", "To assist in congressional deliberations on whether there is a continuing  need for an annual NMLS, this report discusses the results of our review of  the development and implementation of the 1999 through 2002 strategies.  Specifically, as agreed with your offices, our objectives were to determine  (1) agency perspectives on the benefit of the NMLS and factors that  affected its development and implementation, (2) whether the strategy has  served as a useful mechanism for guiding the coordination of federal law  enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist  financing, (3) the role of the NMLS in influencing the anti-money  laundering and antiterrorist financing activities of the federal financial  regulators, and (4) whether the NMLS has reflected the critical  components we have found to be necessary for the development and  implementation of such a strategy.", "To determine agency perspectives on the benefit of the NMLS, we  interviewed responsible officials at and reviewed relevant documentation  obtained from the principal law enforcement components with anti-money  laundering responsibilities at the Departments of the Treasury, Justice,  and Homeland Security and the federal financial regulatory agencies. In  general, our work reviewing the strategy\u2019s usefulness for guiding the  coordination of law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts consisted of  (1) examining the structure and operation of HIFCA task forces,  (2) analyzing the implementation of NMLS initiatives to enhance  interagency coordination, and (3) assessing the extent to which the 2002  NMLS addressed agency roles in combating terrorist financing. We did this  by interviewing relevant agency officials, reviewing agency policies for  coordination, evaluating staffing levels and other resources devoted to  NMLS initiatives, and reviewing the NMLS. Our work determining the role  of the NMLS in influencing the efforts of the federal financial regulators  focused primarily on the NMLS goal that sought to coordinate their efforts.  In 2002, the goal was, \u201cPrevent Money Laundering Through Cooperative  Public-Private Efforts and Necessary Regulatory Measures.\u201d This goal had  similar titles in earlier strategies (see table 1). We also examined the role  the financial regulators played in supporting Treasury\u2019s efforts under the  NMLS goal to strengthen international cooperation to fight money  laundering. To do this, we interviewed financial regulatory, Treasury, and  law enforcement agency officials. We also reviewed regulatory  examination guidelines, policies, and training information. To determine  whether the NMLS reflected components we have found necessary for  national strategies, we reviewed drafts of the strategies from 1999 to  2002, interviewed officials that had been involved in the development and  implementation of the strategies, and compared the results from this work  with findings from our past work reviewing national strategies and their  implementation.", "We conducted our work from June 2002 to August 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Although the magnitude of global money  laundering is unknown, many estimates suggest annual ranges in the  hundreds of billions of dollars. The process of money laundering generally  takes place in three stages: placement, layering, and integration. In the  placement stage, cash is converted into monetary instruments, such as  money orders or traveler\u2019s checks, or deposited into financial institution  accounts. In the layering stage, these funds are transferred or moved into  other accounts or other financial institutions to further obscure their illicit  origin. In the integration stage, the funds are used to purchase assets in the  legitimate economy or to fund further activities. All financial sectors and  certain commercial businesses can be targeted during one or more of  these stages. Many of these entities are required to report transactions  with certain characteristics to law enforcement if they appear to be  potentially suspicious. The transactions would generally fall within either  the placement or layering stage if they proved to be involved in money  laundering. Transaction reporting requirements are discussed further later  in this report. Figure 1 shows the three stages of money laundering.", "Terrorist financing is generally characterized by different motives than  money laundering and the funds involved often originate from legitimate  sources. However, the techniques for hiding the movement of funds  intended to be used to finance terrorist activity\u2014techniques to obscure  the origin of funds and the ultimate destination\u2014are often similar to those  used to launder money. Therefore, Treasury, law enforcement agencies,  and the federal financial regulators often employ similar approaches and  techniques in trying to detect and prevent both money laundering and  terrorist financing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Agencies Are Responsible for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing", "paragraphs": ["Agencies under the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, and Homeland  Security are to coordinate with each other and with financial regulators in  combating money laundering.

In addition to  FinCEN, Treasury components actively involved in anti-money laundering  and antiterrorist financing efforts include the Executive Office for  Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, the Office of International  Affairs, and the Internal Revenue Service and its Criminal Investigation  unit (IRS-CI).", "Department of Justice components involved in efforts to combat money  laundering and terrorist financing include the Criminal Division\u2019s Asset  Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section (AFMLS) and Counterterrorism  Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement  Administration (DEA), and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys  (EOUSA) and U.S. Attorneys Offices.

The  NMLS also sought to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement agencies  and financial regulators to ensure that financial institutions were  sufficiently vigilant to detect possible money laundering and that they  reported any suspicious activity to law enforcement agencies to assist in  their efforts to investigate money laundering and, more recently, terrorist  financing.", "The process for developing the NMLS has varied slightly from year to year,  but it has generally involved Treasury working with other agencies to  develop a draft. Treasury officials said that they have sometimes asked  officials from other agencies to take the lead in drafting certain sections  that pertain particularly to their efforts. In other instances, Treasury has  drafted the sections and asked for participating agencies\u2019 review and  comments on the sections relevant to them. Upon completion of the draft  NMLS, the relevant agencies are given the opportunity to clear the final  document through the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s clearance  process, which requires that the agencies approve the document, that is,  signify their agreement with its contents. Treasury officials told us that by  approving the NMLS through this process, the agencies have agreed to it  and should be held accountable to Congress and the public to complete  their assigned responsibilities.", "The drafting process has generally resulted in a document that lists four to  six broad goals, each containing objectives, which in turn contain a list of  priorities. Over time, the goals have changed, sometimes in their wording  or order, and other times to cover new threats. For example, in the wake  of September 11, the 2002 NMLS added the goal, \u201cFocus Law Enforcement  and Regulatory Resources on Identifying, Disrupting, and Dismantling  Terrorist Financing Networks.\u201d As of September 24, the 2003 NMLS had  not yet been issued.

Officials from each  of the agencies endorsed the concept of having a national strategy for  combating money laundering and related financial crimes. Generally, the  officials said that the annual NMLS probably was more beneficial in the  first 2 years (1999 and 2000) than in the subsequent years (2001 and 2002).  As an initial benefit, for example, Treasury officials said that the NMLS  was instrumental in focusing on the need to combat money laundering  systemically and not solely on a case-by-case basis, encouraging multiple  law enforcement agencies to work together, and raising general awareness  of the importance of combating financial crimes. The NMLS enhanced  their planning and communication when it was new because it served to  formalize interagency communication in a way that had not existed before.  Similarly, the officials noted that the early strategies were instrumental in  expanding the perspectives of the regulatory agencies by refocusing them  on the purposes underlying their BSA responsibilities.  The early strategies  renewed attention on the fight against money laundering that supports  particular reporting or record keeping obligations.  That is, due partly to  the strategies, the financial regulators became more focused regarding  ways in which criminals could be using financial institutions for money  laundering activities.", "However, after the first couple of years, the benefit of the annual NMLS  was affected by a number of factors and events, according to the Treasury,  Justice, and regulatory agency officials we interviewed. One factor cited  was that the principal agencies had significantly differing views about the  appropriate purpose and structure of the strategy. For instance, Treasury  preferred a document that covered the full breadth and scope of the  federal government\u2019s planned anti-money laundering efforts, while Justice  preferred a more concise document that included only those priorities that  realistically could be addressed during the year. Likewise, the regulatory  agencies generally favored a more concise document. Several officials said  that this fundamental difference in views resulted in less-than-full  commitment or buy-in from some agencies, which lessened the overall  benefit of the recent strategies.", "An event that affected the 2001 NMLS was the change in presidential  administrations prior to the strategy\u2019s issuance. Treasury and Justice  officials explained that with the arrival of a new administration, it was  necessary to revise a nearly complete NMLS to match the new  administration\u2019s vision for combating money laundering. This redrafting  process caused the NMLS to be issued very late, leaving little time to  implement any goals or objectives before drafting the 2002 NMLS.", "The officials said that the implementation of the recent strategies has been  affected most significantly by external events\u2014particularly September 11,  2001, and its aftermath, which included passage of the USA PATRIOT Act  and the creation of DHS. Treasury and Justice officials said that the 2001  NMLS, which was issued on September 12, 2001, was virtually obsolete at  issuance because the nature of the issues they faced had just changed  dramatically. After September 11, combating terrorist financing became a  major element of the federal government\u2019s anti-money laundering efforts,  but it was not part of the 2001 NMLS.", "The passage of the USA PATRIOT Act increased the requirements on many  financial institutions for conducting due diligence, record keeping,  reporting, and sharing information. Because implementing the USA  PATRIOT Act became the main focus for the financial regulators in the  2002 NMLS, financial regulators attributed their efforts to the USA  PATRIOT Act rather than the NMLS. The creation of DHS required the  transfer of most of the law enforcement functions and staff from agencies  formerly under Treasury to the new agency. Justice anti-money laundering  components remained in Justice. Treasury and Justice officials said that  the implementation of some 2002 NMLS priorities was delayed pending  formation of the new department.

For example, although expected to have  a key role in the federal government\u2019s efforts to disrupt and dismantle  large-scale money laundering organizations, HIFCA task forces generally  were not yet structured and operating as intended and had not reached  their expectations for leveraging investigative resources or creating  investigative synergies. Further, while Treasury and Justice made progress  on some NMLS initiatives designed to enhance interagency coordination of  money laundering investigations, most had not achieved the expectations  called for in the annual strategies. Moreover, the 2002 NMLS did not  address agency roles and interagency coordination procedures for  conducting terrorist financing investigations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HIFCA Task Forces Generally Had Not Yet Been Structured and Operating as Intended", "paragraphs": ["As envisioned by the Strategy Act, HIFCAs represent a major NMLS  initiative and were expected to have a flagship role in the U.S.  government\u2019s efforts to disrupt and dismantle large-scale money  laundering operations. They were intended to improve the coordination  and quality of federal money laundering investigations by concentrating  the investigative expertise of federal, state, and local agencies in unified  task forces, thereby leveraging resources and creating investigative  synergies. While neither the Strategy Act nor the annual NMLS specified a  time frame for when designated HIFCAs were to become fully operational,  we found that the task forces had made some progress but generally had  not yet been structured and operating as intended. As of July 2003,  Treasury and Justice were in the process of reviewing the HIFCA task  forces to remove obstacles to their effective operations.

At that time,  two of the seven HIFCAs (the Southwest Border and Miami) had not  started operations. Law enforcement officials in the Southwest Border  area cited several reasons for the HIFCA\u2019s nonoperational status, including  (1) difficulty in coordinating activities in such a large area and (2) lack of  funds to persuade state and local officials to participate. In Miami, federal  law enforcement officials had met but had not reached agreement on how  the HIFCA should be structured or how it should operate. For example,  the officials had not agreed on whether the Miami HIFCA should conduct  investigations or focus principally on intelligence gathering.", "In September 2003, in commenting on a draft of this report, Justice said  that while the Southwest Border HIFCA has not worked out as intended,  the participants in Texas and Arizona met on numerous occasions over the  past 4 years in an attempt to find an organizational structure that could  meet the needs of all of the participants. Justice also said that  headquarters officials and participants in the Southwest Border area  recently decided that the dual-state HIFCA was too ambitious and that the  HIFCA should be limited to Texas and relocated to augment an existing  task force.", "Although the 2001 NMLS specified that HIFCAs were to conduct  investigations rather than principally gather intelligence, we found that  two of the five operating task forces (Los Angeles and San Francisco)  were primarily focusing on intelligence gathering activities\u2014such as  reviews of Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) and other information  required by the BSA\u2014and had not established multiagency investigative  units to act on the intelligence. HIFCA officials in Los Angeles told us  they planned to locate task force participants together in the same area in  mid- or late-2003, at which time multiagency investigative units would be  established. In San Francisco, a HIFCA official told us their proposal to  become a HIFCA specified that the task force would focus on intelligence  and that there were no plans to establish multiagency investigative units  within the HIFCA. Treasury and Justice officials responsible for  overseeing the HIFCAs told us that headquarters was reluctant to require  the task forces to establish multiagency investigative units, primarily  because the Strategy Act did not provide additional funds or personnel to  establish such units. The officials noted that even though the 2001 NMLS  specified that HIFCAs were to conduct investigations, task forces that  focus on intelligence gathering activities but do not conduct investigations  do enhance interagency efforts to combat money laundering.", "Also, because the investigative activities of the three HIFCAs that had  multiagency investigative units (Chicago, New York/New Jersey, and  Puerto Rico) were based on task force structures already in place before  the HIFCA designation, the overall effect of the NMLS on these task forces  is unclear. For example, the New York/New Jersey HIFCA essentially  represented a renaming of the well-established El Dorado Money  Laundering Task Force, which had existed since 1992. As mentioned  previously, a HIFCA task force could be (1) created when a HIFCA was  designated or (2) based on an existing task force.", "Further, in some cases, federal law enforcement agencies had not  provided the levels of commitment and staffing to the HIFCA task forces  called for by the strategy. As shown in table 2, ICE and/or IRS-CI were  designated the lead agency in each of the five operational task forces. We  found that most of the HIFCAs did not have DEA or FBI agents assigned  full-time to the task forces. For example, regarding the three HIFCAs with  multiagency investigative units, DEA and the FBI were not members of the  Chicago HIFCA, DEA was not a member of the New York/New Jersey  HIFCA, and both DEA and the FBI had only part-time representation on  the Puerto Rico HIFCA. As also shown in table 2, four of the five operating  HIFCAs had little or no participation from state and local law enforcement  agencies, with the notable exception being the New York/New Jersey  HIFCA. The NMLS called for each HIFCA to include participation from all  relevant federal, state, and local agencies.", "Justice headquarters officials said the main problem with supporting the  HIFCA task forces was the absence of additional funds or personnel to  offer law enforcement agencies in return for their participation. A DEA  official told us that, because of differences in agencies\u2019 guidelines for  conducting undercover money laundering investigations, DEA will not  dedicate staff to HIFCA task force investigative units but will support  intelligence-related activities. FBI officials cited resource constraints as  the primary reason why the bureau does not fully participate. Various task  force officials mentioned lack of funding to compensate or reimburse  participating state and local law enforcement agencies as a barrier to their  participation in HIFCA operations. Further, Treasury and Justice officials  noted that a key to the success of the HIFCA program is the ability to  promote interagency cooperation by locating task force participants  together in the same office space. Accordingly, the 2002 NMLS called for  headquarters to examine how to fund the colocation of HIFCA task force  participants absent funds appropriated specifically for that purpose.", "While we recognize that federal law enforcement agencies have resource  constraints and competing priorities, we note that HIFCA task forces were  expected to make more effective use of existing resources or of such  additional resources as may be available.

Fully  addressing these initiatives could help ensure accountability within the  HIFCAs, as well as refine the operational mission, structure, and  composition of the task forces.", "Treasury and Justice officials told us the primary reasons for not  addressing or not yet completing the HIFCA initiatives were that  headquarters (1) was reluctant to impose a structure or reporting  requirement on the field without offering any new resources and (2) did  not believe that a single structure could fit every HIFCA. The officials also  said that the individual HIFCAs were in the best position to address their  specific needs and problems. Further, the officials told us that, while most  of the HIFCA initiatives had not been addressed or were not yet  completed, the HIFCA structure at headquarters has provided a  framework for regular interagency meetings to discuss money laundering  trends and ways to improve interagency cooperation.", "As shown in table 3, although only one of the HIFCA initiatives was  completed by the specified milestone or goal date, many of the initiatives  were still ongoing.

Both the  1999 and the 2000 NMLS contained an initiative to encourage all applicable  federal law enforcement agencies to participate in the Money Laundering  Coordination Center.

DEA officials  added that the center does not meet DEA\u2019s needs because it is used for  deconfliction only. In August 2003, the DEA officials said that DEA had  created and was testing a new database that is designed to be a single  source for information on money laundering investigations related to drug  money.

According to  the 2002 NMLS and our discussions with law enforcement officials, the  lack of uniform guidelines inhibits some agencies from participating in  investigations that have an international component. For example, a DEA  official told us that DEA guidelines generally are more restrictive than  guidelines used by Customs (as part of ICE) in regard to (1) obtaining  approval to initiate and continue undercover investigations and  (2) coordinating activities with foreign counterparts. Therefore, the  officials noted that DEA generally could not participate in international  undercover money laundering investigations led by Customs. The  2002 NMLS called for Treasury and Justice to develop uniform undercover  guidelines by September 2002 to ensure the full participation of all  applicable federal law enforcement agencies in undercover money  laundering investigations.

The financial regulators said that they  have been working on anti-money laundering issues for many years and  generally initiate their own anti-money laundering activities. Bank  regulators and SEC pointed out that the BSA was passed in 1970 and that  they have been concerned with ensuring banks\u2019 and broker-dealers\u2019  compliance with its requirements ever since. The USA PATRIOT Act  extended responsibility for implementing the BSA to additional financial  regulators as well as increased anti-money laundering requirements for  certain financial institutions.

For example, depository institutions have been required to  file SARs since 1996. Since December 2002, securities brokers and dealers  have been required to file SARs with FinCEN as a result of the USA  PATRIOT Act and its implementing regulations. (See app. III.) Certain  financial institutions are also required to file Currency Transaction  Reports with FinCEN for transactions that involve $10,000 or more in  currency.

Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which,  for example, increased the due diligence, reporting, and record keeping  requirements for some financial institutions to guard against their being  used by their customers to launder money or finance terrorist activity.  Some officials noted that USA PATRIOT Act requirements reflected topics  being discussed in the NMLS and other working group meetings that might  still have been in the discussion phase had not September 11 motivated  their inclusion in the USA PATRIOT Act, thus requiring Treasury and other  agencies to issue regulations. Reflecting this change of emphasis, the 2002  NMLS discussed the need to adapt traditional methods of combating  money laundering to unconventional tools used by terrorist organizations  to finance their operations. According to the 2002 NMLS, the primary  responsibility of the financial regulators was to participate in the drafting  and issuance of USA PATRIOT Act regulations and to provide technical  expertise on the operations of depository institutions and other financial  institutions to Treasury.

The federal  financial regulators were expected to participate in NMLS initiatives, but  Treasury, rather than the financial regulators, was usually designated as  the lead agency responsible for implementation. Most federal financial  regulators are independent federal agencies. Therefore, while the financial  regulators have committed to work with Treasury and Justice on NMLS  initiatives, they are not required to do so because, with the exception of  OCC and OTS, they are not part of the executive branch.

However, policies  for enhanced information sharing were not finalized until the USA  PATRIOT Act required that they be developed. For example, section 314 of  the USA PATRIOT Act was designed to enhance cooperation among  certain entities involved in the detection of money laundering.  Section  314(a) encourages regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities  to share with financial institutions information regarding individuals,  entities, and organizations engaged in or reasonably suspected based on  reliable evidence of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering  activities.

As of July 2003, Treasury and  Justice had not yet completed any of these initiatives, although efforts  were still ongoing to complete some of them.", "Generally, the purpose of the 2002 NMLS measurement initiatives was to  provide Congress and other policymakers a basis for (1) evaluating federal  agencies\u2019 anti-money laundering efforts and results and  (2) deciding how to deploy limited public resources most effectively. For  example, the traffic-light scorecard was intended to provide information  on the overall performance of the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat  money laundering and assess how well the government was executing  each of the six goals described in the 2002 strategy (and future strategies).  Also, the 2002 NMLS notes that the initiative to review law enforcement  and financial regulatory costs and resources devoted to anti-money  laundering activities was designed to permit Congress and other  policymakers to draw informed conclusions about the effectiveness of  those activities.", "The 2002 NMLS noted that, while deceptively easy to articulate in the  abstract, the task of developing meaningful performance measures for  federal agencies engaged in combating money laundering has proven to be  quite difficult. Treasury officials also told us that (1) the 2002 strategy was  not published until July 2002, which did not leave much time for either  implementation or evaluation and (2) several measurement initiatives  were put on hold pending the reorganization associated with DHS.  Further, the officials noted that Treasury generally had no plans to report  on performance progress (results and accomplishments) made under the  2002 strategy.", "The 2002 strategy did provide, for the first time in an NMLS, some baseline  facts and figures designed to help determine how well the federal  government was succeeding in its efforts to detect, prevent, and deter  money laundering. For example, the strategy published U.S. Sentencing  Commission data for fiscal year 2000 regarding defendants sentenced in  federal court for the principal offense of money laundering.

The role of the  leadership structure would be to marshal resources to ensure that the  vision laid out in the strategy is achieved, resolve disputes between  agencies, and ensure accountability for strategy implementation. This  leadership mechanism would also be in a good position to evaluate annual  progress and report such progress to Congress, as is currently required of  Treasury. This is especially critical now that there are three principal  departments with anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing  responsibilities, in addition to the federal financial regulators.", "One way to help set clear priorities and focus resources on the areas of  greatest need would be to require that the strategy be linked to a periodic  threat assessment.

These performance measures would be reflected in the  agencies\u2019 annual performance plans.

We believe  that incorporating these critical components into the NMLS would  improve its development and implementation. For example, the current  NMLS leadership structure has not reached consensus on the approach  the strategy should take or ensured that goals and objectives are met, and  has failed to issue any of the annual strategies on time. A clearly defined  high-level leadership structure could better ensure that resources are  appropriately marshaled for achieving the strategy\u2019s vision and goals.", "Also, without an assessment of threats and risks, it is difficult to determine  what the highest-priority activities should be.

Further, the report notes  that HIFCA task force officials said that the lack of funding to compensate  or reimburse participating state and local law enforcement agencies was a  barrier to their participation.

To determine whether the NMLS has  served as a useful mechanism for guiding law enforcement agencies\u2019  efforts, we (1) compared the structure and operation of High Intensity  Money Laundering and Related Financial Crime Area (HIFCA) task forces  to guidance provided in the strategies, (2) assessed whether the  implementation of NMLS initiatives to enhance interagency coordination  has met strategic goals, and (3) assessed the extent to which the 2002  NMLS addressed agency roles in combating terrorist financing. To do this,  we interviewed responsible officials and reviewed documentation from  the four primary agencies responsible for investigating money laundering  and related financial crimes\u2014Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service- Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and Homeland  Security\u2019s Bureau of Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE).

The BSA required, for the first time, that financial institutions  maintain records and reports that financial regulators and law  enforcement agencies have determined have a high degree of usefulness in  criminal, tax, and regulatory matters. The BSA authorizes the Secretary of  the Treasury to issue regulations on the reporting of certain currency  transactions. The BSA had three main objectives: create an investigative  audit trail through regulatory reporting standards; impose civil and  criminal penalties for noncompliance; and improve detection of criminal,  tax, and regulatory violations.", "The reporting system implemented under the BSA was by itself an  insufficient response to money laundering because, under the BSA,  anybody who satisfied the reporting requirements would not be subject to  money laundering violations. Thus, Congress enacted the Money  Laundering Control Act of 1986 (MLCA), which made money laundering a  criminal offense separate from any BSA reporting violations. It created  criminal liability for individuals or entities that conduct monetary  transactions knowing that the proceeds involved were obtained from  unlawful activity and made it a criminal offense to knowingly structure  transactions to avoid BSA reporting. Penalties under the MLCA include  imprisonment, fines, and forfeiture.", "Congress enacted the Money Laundering Prosecution Improvements Act  of 1988 to enhance the provisions of the BSA and the MLCA and amended  provisions in both statutes. The Improvements Act aimed to increase the  cooperation that the government receives from financial institutions by  imposing liability and fines on facilitators, such as negligent bankers. It  also expanded the definition of a financial institution under the BSA and  permitted government agencies to undertake sting operations.", "The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 amended the BSA  in a number of ways. It authorized Treasury to require financial  institutions to report any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible  violation of a law. It also authorized Treasury to require financial  institutions to carry out anti-money laundering programs and create  record-keeping rules relating to fund transfer transactions. Annunzio- Wylie also made the operation of an illegal money transmitting business a  crime.", "As authorized by Annunzio-Wylie, in 1996, Treasury issued a rule requiring  that banks and other depository institutions use a Suspicious Activity  Report (SAR) form to report activities involving possible money  laundering. During the same year, bank regulators issued regulations  requiring all depository institutions to report suspected money laundering  as well as other suspicious activities using this form. The bank regulators  also placed SAR requirements on the subsidiaries, including broker-dealer  firms, of the depository institutions and their holding companies under  their jurisdiction.", "The Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998  (Strategy Act) amended the BSA to require the President, acting through  the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General  and other relevant agencies, including state and local agencies, to  coordinate and implement a national strategy, produced annually for 5  years beginning in 1999, to address money laundering. In addition, it  requires the Secretary of the Treasury to designate certain areas as high- risk areas for money laundering and related financial crimes and to  establish a Financial Crime-Free Communities Support Program. The  purpose of demarcating areas as high risk is to designate the communities  that experience severe problems with money laundering that need more  help. The Strategy Act also authorizes federal funding of efforts by state  and local law enforcement agencies to investigate money laundering  activities.
