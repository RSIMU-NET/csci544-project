For example, GSA procures the vehicles it leases at a discount and passes those savings on to its customers, provides agencies with data analyses that can be used to eliminate unnecessary vehicles, and identifies fraud, waste, and abuse related to leased vehicles. However, GAO identified two areas where GSA's rates and terms have not encouraged agency efforts to reduce fleet costs. First, under GSA's leasing-rate structure, fuel costs are covered by a monthly fee based on miles traveled, among other things, but not on actual fuel used. This rate structure does not provide incentives for agencies to reduce some fuel costs that may not be fully reflected by miles travelled, such as costs associated with idling or speeding. Principles for designing government fees suggest that having each agency pay for the fuel it actually uses could increase incentives to reduce fuel costs. GAO has previously found that government fee decisions also involve considering trade-offs and that other considerations, such as administrative burden, are important. Without examining the trade-offs of changing GSA's rate structure so that agencies pay for the fuel they actually consume, GSA may be missing an opportunity to encourage agencies to minimize fuel costs and save taxpayer dollars. Second, lack of clear GSA guidance on what constitutes excessive wear and tear of leased vehicles can limit the ability of agencies to determine whether it is less expensive to lease or own vehicles. GSA just developed this guidance and is taking steps to implement it.", "The experts and federal fleet managers GAO consulted agreed that the use of telematics can facilitate cost savings for some fleets by providing fleet managers with information\u2014such as data on vehicle location, speed, or condition\u2014that they can use to reduce fleet size, fuel use, misuse of vehicles, and unnecessary maintenance. For example, a fleet manager at the Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory reported that since fiscal year 2011, telematics data have helped officials at that facility decide to eliminate 65 leased vehicles for an estimated annual savings of approximately $390,000. However, various factors\u2014such as telematics' cost, characteristics of the fleet, and the level of management support\u2014influence the potential of telematics to facilitate cost savings for a given fleet. The federal fleet managers on GAO's panels suggested that GSA lower the costs of telematic devices to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and to help allay management's concerns about return on investment. They also suggested that GSA provide information on agencies' experiences with telematics, such as studies or estimates of cost savings, to further support telematics' adoption in the federal fleet. GSA officials noted that they are currently engaged in efforts to obtain lower prices on telematic devices, and while officials do not currently collect information on agencies' experiences with telematics, they would be able to request it and share any information agencies voluntarily provide. One of GSA's strategic objectives is to enhance relationships with its customers, in part by sharing information that drives improved decision-making. By not collecting and sharing information on federal agencies' experiences with telematics, GSA may be missing an opportunity to help agencies determine whether to adopt telematics in their fleets and identify which devices or approaches have the greatest potential to facilitate cost savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA (1) examine the trade-offs of changing GSA's lease-rate structure so that agencies pay for their actual fuel use and (2) request information on agencies' experiences with telematics in their fleets and share this information with agencies.

Some federal fleet  managers also noted that GSA fleet data analysis helps agencies identify  when inefficient driving practices may be occurring, particularly related to  fuel purchases, within their fleets.

For example, one federal fleet manager noted  that GSA\u2019s management of the fault resolution process when government  vehicles are involved in accidents with private vehicles helps reduce costs  that agencies incur from accidents. GSA seeks to ensure that, when  government drivers are not at fault, the party responsible for the accident  reimburses the federal government.

A customer agency\u2019s mileage fee, which is  determined by the miles its leased vehicles travel and GSA\u2019s mileage rate  per category of vehicle leased, may not fully reflect some fuel costs not  associated with miles traveled. These include costs associated with some  driver behaviors such as idling, speeding, and fast stops and starts.", "GSA bases its mileage rate partly on the average cost of fuel per mile  across all agencies for each category of vehicle available for leasing.  According to GSA officials, the rate is designed to cover the leasing  program\u2019s overall variable costs, which GSA pays for, and is a good  approximation of these costs. The fee each agency pays does not  necessarily reflect the fuel it actually uses, however, as the rate is not  designed to capture individual agencies\u2019 fuel costs. Specifically, drivers of  vehicles leased by some agencies may engage in behaviors such as  idling, speeding, and fast stops and starts\u2014which increase fuel use\u2014to a  greater extent than drivers in some other agencies, but all agencies would  pay the same rate per mile for each category of vehicle leased. For  example, according to Air Force officials, GSA identified excessive idling  in leased vehicles at the Dover Air Force base and worked with the Air  Force to curb it. In addition, vehicles used by DHS\u2019s Customs and Border  Patrol (CBP) in the desert on the southern border of the United States  may need to idle often to keep the occupants of the vehicle cool during  hot days. Yet with GSA\u2019s monthly mileage rate, CBP generally pays  based on the number of miles traveled, not the actual amount of fuel  consumed by idling. According to GSA officials, the agency occasionally  adds a surcharge to agency monthly mileage rates for excessive idling,  which GSA evaluates on a month-by-month basis. GSA officials have  acknowledged that its mileage rate does not capture some fuel costs at  the customer agency level, such as those associated with each agency\u2019s  idling or speeding.", "The fuel costs of GSA\u2019s leasing program are significant; they totaled  about $431 million in fiscal year 2012. GSA has identified reducing the  use of resources and environmental impacts as an agency goal, but its  monthly mileage rate structure does not provide agencies with incentives  to reduce the types of fuel use, cited above, that are not reflected in  distance traveled. According to economic principles, when the price paid  for a good does not reflect the full costs of that good, consumers will tend  to use higher amounts of the good than is optimal from a societal  standpoint. Therefore, under the current leasing rate structure in which  some agencies may not bear the full cost of their fuel consumption,  agencies may seek to have the government provide fuel levels that are  economically inefficient. Also, as discussed later in this report, agencies  may lack incentives to adopt telematics, which could lead to savings in  fuel costs and other costs under certain circumstances, since their  monthly leasing fees may not fully reflect any cost savings they achieve.  Principles for designing government fees suggest that having each  agency pay for the fuel it actually uses could foster greater efficiency by  increasing 1) awareness of the costs of fuel and 2) incentives to reduce  fuel costs not reflected in miles traveled.", "Some federal fleet managers on our panels acknowledged that paying for  their own fuel might provide more of an incentive to reduce fuel use in  leased vehicles. However, GSA officials and some panelists stated that  they preferred the current structure. According to GSA officials and these  panelists, including fuel costs as part of the mileage rate aids the  customer agency\u2019s budgeting because GSA assumes the risk of fuel price  increases, allowing agencies to reduce uncertainties in managing fleet  costs. GSA sets its mileage rate at the beginning of the year based on  what it estimates fuel will cost over the course of the year. GSA, not the  agencies, generally bears the cost burden of the increase in fuel prices.  According to GSA officials, the agency imposes a surcharge on agencies  if fuel prices rise to such an extent that GSA believes it cannot absorb the  unanticipated level of costs and also issues a rate reduction when fuel  prices significantly decline in a given fiscal year. In addition, GSA  officials noted that its coverage of fuel costs reduces the fleet- management administrative burden on agencies and prevents duplication  of management effort on the part of GSA and agencies.", "GSA officials also cited reasons that, in their view, changes in the rate  structure may not be needed or may not lead to reduced fuel costs.  According to these officials, improving agency incentives for reducing fuel  use is not needed because agencies are legally required to reduce fuel  costs. using data on agency fuel purchases to identify when fuel use is well  above expected levels and then take appropriate actions, including  adding a fuel surcharge or determining if excessive fuel use is due to  fraud, waste, or abuse.

In a May 2008 report, we found that there are trade-offs to  consider in designing government fees and that every design will have  pluses and minuses. In addition to efficiency, which we have discussed,  we found that considerations in designing fees include equity (meaning  that everyone pays a fair share), the extent to which collections cover  costs, and the administrative burden on agencies. While GSA has  flexibility in administering its rate structure, GSA\u2019s current leasing rate  structure may not be fully equitable, as agencies that are more efficiently  using fuel are to some extent subsidizing agencies that are less efficient  because all agencies are charged the same mileage rate per category of  vehicle. While GSA is required to collect adequate fees to cover the costs  of its leasing program, the extent of the administrative burden for GSA  and its customers of the current rate structure versus one in which  agencies pay for their actual fuel costs is unclear and would depend on  how any changes were implemented.

In addition, GSA  explained that GSA publications such as the Guide to Your GSA Fleet  Vehicle serve as reference material for agencies as well as fleet service  representatives, but a definition of excessive wear and tear is not  provided in this guide. In March 2014, GSA completed development of  guidance for fleet service representatives containing details on what  constitutes normal and excessive wear and tear to leased vehicles.

The experts identified various areas in which fleet managers can  achieve cost savings, including fleet utilization, fuel use, misuse of  vehicles, and maintenance (see fig. 1).", "Fleet managers can achieve savings by analyzing the data provided by  telematics devices and taking actions to reduce costs based on those  data. For example, managers can reduce fleet size by eliminating  vehicles with insufficient use and provide feedback to drivers to reduce  wasteful, abusive, or dangerous behaviors such as speeding or  unauthorized personal use. Fleet managers can also tailor vehicle  maintenance based on improved knowledge of the vehicle\u2019s actual  condition and avoid unnecessary preventative maintenance. One expert,  who is a fleet manager, reported that telematics helped him reduce his  fuel costs by 8 to 15 percent among sections of his fleet with almost  universal telematics installation, though he cautioned that these vehicles  received telematics because they were the most likely to achieve savings.  Another expert reported that telematics helped him reduce his fleet size  by 7 percent over 60 months among the vehicles with telematics installed.  (See sidebars for additional information on the experiences with  telematics of selected experts who manage fleets).", "Experts cautioned that it is not always possible to calculate a  comprehensive return on investment. Experts told us that it can be  challenging to quantify cost savings when a comparative baseline is not  available, telematics are part of a larger improvement effort, or the type of  savings are difficult to quantify financially (such as savings associated  with safety improvements). For example, one expert noted that he was  unable to calculate fuel savings because the devices had been installed  on new plug-in hybrid vehicles; he was unable to differentiate between  the fuel savings achieved by using plug-in hybrids and the fuel savings  from actions taken in response to telematics data.", "Furthermore, experts also noted that the potential return on investment  from the adoption of any telematic technology will vary and that telematics  will not achieve cost savings for every fleet. For example, two experts  explained that telematics would not provide a return on investment for  their own fleets because of how their vehicles are used. One noted that  the vehicles are not used on a daily basis, so the benefits would not  justify the costs. In addition, two experts explained that employees at their  respective companies are authorized to use the vehicles for personal use,  so after-market tracking devices would likely face opposition because of  privacy concerns. Experts also noted that telematics can be a legal  liability if information is gathered but not acted upon. For example, if  telematics data shows that a driver regularly speeds but no corrective  action is taken to stop this behavior, the employer may have a greater  liability risk in the event that the driver is involved in an accident,  according to one expert.", "The experts we interviewed highlighted four key factors that influence  telematics\u2019 potential to facilitate cost savings in vehicle fleets:  Cost of the technology selected: The experts emphasized that the cost of  any telematics program must be accounted for when considering overall  cost savings. As a result, costs must be carefully evaluated in comparison  to projected savings to avoid a net loss. This comparison can be  challenging because the term \u201ctelematics\u201d encompasses a broad array of  technologies, which results in a wide range of associated costs. For  example, telematics can include original equipment installed by the  manufacturer, after-market add-on systems, or mobile device applications  and programs. Further, data can be transmitted via satellite or cellular  connections on a regular basis or when a vehicle passes a fixed-data  download station. Fixed download stations pose mostly upfront, fixed  costs, whereas the cost for a satellite connection is typically levied in  ongoing monthly data charges. In addition, fleets may rent telematic  devices for a short period of time to obtain a snapshot of usage data, or  may select a long-term contract for ongoing monitoring. Various  combinations of device, data access, and contract type will have different  costs, which in turn influences the potential return on investment.", "Fleet characteristics: Experts reported that the characteristics of the fleet  also affect the return on investment. For example, fleets that idle  frequently will have more opportunity for fuel savings than fleets with  carefully controlled fuel consumption. In addition, the number of miles  driven may influence how much fuel can be saved. Experts also  emphasized that the technology must be aligned with the fleet\u2019s  characteristics, or the likelihood for savings will be reduced or eliminated.  For example, some kinds of telematic devices depend on satellite signals  that can be impaired by tall buildings in urban areas. Other devices  depend on wireless connectivity that may be limited in rural locations. Still  others rely on all vehicles in a fleet returning to or passing by a central  location on a regular basis. If data are received sporadically, fleet  managers will have less detailed information on which to act, which  reduces the potential for cost savings. More information on the fleet  characteristics that experts noted could influence the cost savings  potential of telematics can be found in appendix IV.", "Management and organizational support: The experts we consulted  reported that upper management support, fleet managers\u2019 buy-in, and  organizational culture will influence the degree to which telematics can  facilitate cost savings, since these factors can either support or hinder the  cost-savings actions taken in response to telematics data. The experts  said that upper management support is necessary to secure funding,  change policies in response to problems identified through telematics  data, and ensure that corrective actions are taken in a timely manner.  Moreover, a fleet manager will need to have the time, ability, and desire  to conduct analyses of the data to understand what changes are needed,  unless the telematic device includes analytical support. In addition, some  organizations may have cultures and structures that either embrace or  reject monitoring efforts. For example, one expert noted that some unions  support monitoring because of the safety benefits and liability protection,  while other unions resist monitoring to prevent disciplinary actions against  their members.", "Information technology systems: Experts also highlighted the importance  of information technology systems that can efficiently collect and  distribute the data provided by telematics devices. They noted that cost- saving changes can be more effectively implemented when the data  gathered by telematics are readily accessible and integrated with all  relevant information systems. For example, if a fleet uses multiple  telematic-service providers to address different aspects of the fleet, then  the overall visibility will be compromised without an integrated platform."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Fleet Managers Agreed That Telematics Can Reduce Costs and Suggested GSA Do More to Support Use of This Technology", "paragraphs": ["The federal fleet managers on our two panels agreed that the use of  telematics has the potential to reduce costs in the federally leased fleet.While GSA currently provides leasing customers with various types of  information, such as information on fuel use and potential fraud, based  on data collected through its fleet payment card, fleet managers told us  that telematics can provide information that is more detailed. In addition,  telematics may also be able to reduce administrative costs, such as the  cost of personnel to perform manual vehicle data collection.

In a separate interview from the panel discussions, a  Marine Corps fleet manager stated that he believed telematics\u2019 use at  seven installations in the southwestern United States improved safety  and helped defend Marines against fraudulent or erroneous accident  claims. He stated that he believes telematics has been the single  most effective tool for reducing vehicle-operating, maintenance, and  abuse costs, but that no formal analysis has been conducted on the  cost savings.", "Federal fleet managers also agreed that the previously discussed factors  (telematics\u2019 costs, fleet characteristics, management and organizational  support, and information technology systems) influence telematics\u2019 cost- saving potential for the federal fleet. They noted that cost, in particular,  impedes further federal adoption of telematic devices. For some fleet  managers the initial cost was the greatest financial concern, and for  others, it was the rate of ongoing, monthly charges. A few fleet managers  observed that because fuel and some other costs are included in GSA\u2019s  vehicle-leasing rate, it is more challenging for an agency to recoup the  costs of using telematics in leased vehicles under the current rate  structure. As discussed previously, GSA\u2019s monthly mileage rate covers  fuel costs as well as other variable costs of an agency\u2019s leased fleet,  based on the average cost of fuel and maintenance in each vehicle  category. Therefore, agencies\u2019 individual fees would not necessarily  reflect all of the cost savings they achieve from telematics. Fleet  managers from two agencies also noted that this reduces agencies\u2019  incentives to use telematics.", "In addition, federal fleet managers on our panels told us that lack of upper  management support sometimes poses challenges for federal agencies in  adopting telematics.

GSA  Fleet offers agencies the option of having selected vendors install  telematics devices in their leased vehicles. GSA negotiates discounts for  these devices through an agreement it has established with vendors.  However, federal fleet managers told us that the prices are still a barrier  to increasing telematics\u2019 use in federal fleets. The pricing of telematics  devices and service plans available varies depending on many factors,  including the desired capabilities, the quantity ordered, and the length of  time the technology is required. For example, according to a GSA  informational brochure, monthly costs for basic GPS tracking typically  range from $22.50 to $32.50 per vehicle, or $810 to $1,170 for a 3-year  contract, though agencies can negotiate to obtain lower prices.agencies\u2019 leased fleets can include thousands of vehicles, the total costs  of using telematics can be significant.", "One of GSA\u2019s priorities, as stated in its 2012 Annual Performance Report  and reiterated in a 2013 memo from the Administrator to all GSA staff, is  to use the purchasing power of the federal government to drive down  prices, deliver better value, and reduce costs to their customer agencies.  Agency officials explained that GSA has not pursued additional discounts  for telematics because federal agencies have only recently begun to  pursue the technology in significant quantity. GSA is currently engaged in  efforts to secure new contracts for telematics devices for customers and  hopes to have these available by the end of fiscal year 2014.  As part of  this effort, they are seeking to provide these devices at a lower cost to  customers.", "Provide information on federal agencies\u2019 experiences with telematics:  Both panels noted that it would be helpful if GSA were to collect  information on federal agencies\u2019 experiences in using telematics in their  fleets and share this information. Based on information provided by GSA  officials, 12 of the 15 executive branch departments as well as some  independent agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, acquired telematics  for some portion of their fleets (owned or leased) between 2008 and  2012. GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy published an article  relating the Marine Corps\u2019 experiences with telematics in its fleet in 2006.  However, GSA has not compiled information on agencies\u2019 recent  telematic efforts and therefore is unable to provide such information to  agencies. Although GSA has not provided such information, it does  regularly communicate with agencies regarding fleet management topics  through various means, including providing information on its website and  presenting webinars, among other approaches.", "Federal fleet managers agreed that knowing more about the experiences  of other fleets would help them better understand how telematics might  be applied in their own fleets and could be used to bolster support from  upper management, program managers, and drivers. Such information  could include descriptions of federal agencies\u2019 efforts as well as studies  or other information on results of these efforts, including estimates of cost  savings achieved or nonfinancial benefits, such as enhanced program  performance or improved safety and liability protection for employees. It  could also include lessons learned from the experiences. One fleet  manager on our military panel noted that the military services\u2019 fleet  managers already share their experiences with each other, and that such  information sharing, facilitated by GSA, would also be beneficial for  civilian agencies. Another panelist suggested that the studies performed  by other federal fleets would be more credible than the studies provided  by telematics vendors. GSA officials explained that while they do not  currently collect this information, GSA\u2019s Office of Government-wide Policy  would be able to request information from agencies and share information  that agencies voluntarily provided.", "GAO has found that a key factor in helping agencies better achieve their  missions and program results is through appropriate internal controls,  which include relevant, reliable, and timely communications. In addition  to internal communications, this includes communicating with, and  obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have an  impact on the agency achieving its objectives. GSA is pursuing several  strategic objectives that would be better supported by obtaining and  sharing additional information about telematics with other federal  agencies. One such objective is for GSA to enhance relationships with its  customers, in part by improving customer knowledge, and sharing  information that drives improved decision-making and performance in the  fleet policy area. Another such objective is to help provide savings to  federal agencies, including by providing them with information that can be  useful in reducing fuel use. GSA has noted in strategic planning  documents and during interviews that it strives to ensure that customers  receive assistance that meets client needs and strives for a culture of  continuous improvement. Without information, facilitated by GSA, about  other agencies\u2019 experiences with telematics, agencies may expend  additional time and resources to find such information and identify  devices that would best meet their needs and may encounter problems  that could have been avoided.

We also convened two  panels of federal fleet managers who managed federal fleets with over  7,000 vehicles leased from GSA in fiscal year 2011, the most recent data  available at the time of our fleet manager selection, to obtain their views  on this question. One panel consisted of one or more managers from five  civilian agencies (the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Homeland  Security, the Interior, and Veterans Affairs) and the other consisted of one  or more managers from five military agencies (the U.S. Marine Corps, the  Army Corps of Engineers, and the Departments of the Air Force, Army,  and Navy).views of all federal fleet managers, they do provide the perspective of  managers of most of the federal leased fleet, as they manage over 80  percent of the vehicles leased from GSA in fiscal year 2011.

We analyzed panel responses to our  questions, and in reporting the responses, we focused on those related to  reducing fleet costs to the government as a whole rather than to a specific  agency. Views attributed to the panels reflect key messages or themes  derived from these discussions, but we did not attempt to quantify exactly  how many federal fleet managers agreed with each statement or issue   While their views should not be used to generalize about the  under discussion because this was not the goal of the panel and we did  not poll or survey individuals.

Additionally, we conducted interviews with officials  from GSA\u2019s vehicle-leasing program and Chief Financial Office and  requested documentation of their expenditures, program policies, leasing  rate structure, and agency-incurred leasing expenses, such as charges to  agencies for damaged leased vehicles, in order to better understand how  GSA\u2019s vehicle-leasing program operates. We also analyzed GSA\u2019s  leasing rate structure in relation to the principle of economic efficiency,  which has often been used to assess the design of government fees. In  a May 2008 report, we noted that efficiency exists when the fee ensures  that the government is providing the amount of the service that is  economically desirable and that efficient fees increase awareness of the  costs of government services, creating incentives to reduce costs where  appropriate.", "To obtain information regarding telematics\u2019 cost savings potential, we  spoke with 19 experts\u2014including consultants, representatives of  associations, and fleet managers from corporations, government entities,  and universities. Experts were selected based on their knowledge about  fleet management or telematics. First, we reviewed the publications and  conference history of associations and consultants that had recently  participated in GAO work on fleet management or transportation  technology to determine if they possessed expert knowledge of  telematics. These entities included Accenture, Mercury Associates, the  Intelligent Transportation Society of America, the National Association of  Fleet Administrators, and the Automotive Fleet and Leasing Association.  We determined that all five possessed expertise in this area. We then  solicited nominations from these entities for individuals with expertise in  fleet management and knowledge of telematics, and compared these  nominations against publications and relevant literature. We did not  select experts in cases where we, in consultation with our methodologist,  believed the nomination may have been biased by a conflict of interest,  such as a contract, between the nominating party and the nominee, which  was likely to involve telematics. This process eliminated one nomination.  We also reconsidered nominations when a company or organization,  rather than a specific individual expert, was identified. We eliminated  three nominations where we were uncertain that an individual expert  could be reliably identified. After these eliminations, a total of 19 experts  remained, whose views we obtained during group and individual  interviews. Because of the interactive nature of the group interviews, we  collected common themes rather than tabulating individual responses.
