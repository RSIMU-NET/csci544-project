In 2017, GAO added the U.S. government's environmental liability to the list of program areas that are at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or in need of transformation. DOE is responsible for over 80 percent of the federal government's environmental liability. This testimony discusses (1) the status of DOE's environmental liability, (2) management challenges at EM, and (3) EM's reporting on its cleanup efforts. It is based on five GAO reports issued from January to March 2019, updated with information from DOE's recent Fiscal Year 2018 Agency Financial Report and 2020 budget request."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2018, the Department of Energy's (DOE) estimated environmental liability\u2014that is, its estimated probable costs of future environmental cleanup\u2014was $494 billion. Of this amount, DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM)\u2014which is responsible for most of DOE's cleanup activities\u2014accounted for $377 billion. EM's portion of the liability reflects cleanup estimates for 16 sites across the United States. Two of these, the Hanford site in Washington and Savannah River site in South Carolina, have most of EM's nuclear waste stored in tanks, which is particularly costly and complicated to treat. EM's environmental liability grew by $214 billion in fiscal years 2011 through 2018, even though EM spent over $48 billion on cleanup. GAO found that this liability may continue to grow for several reasons:", "EM's environmental liability does not include the costs of all future cleanup responsibilities. For example, as of April 2018, DOE and its contractor had not negotiated a cost for completing a large waste treatment facility, called the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant, at the Hanford site.", "About 30 to 60 percent of EM's cleanup budget goes toward recurring activities necessary to maintain the sites\u2014such as physical security and infrastructure maintenance\u2014rather than toward reducing EM's environmental liability.", "EM officials have not analyzed the root causes of the cost growth.", "GAO found that EM has not resolved long-standing management challenges. First, EM does not have a program-wide cleanup strategy and relies primarily on individual sites to locally negotiate cleanup activities and establish priorities, which does not always balance overall risks and costs. For example, the Hanford and Savannah River sites plan to treat similar radioactive tank waste differently, with Hanford's efforts possibly costing tens of billions more than Savannah River's. In addition, EM manages most of its cleanup work as operations activities, under less stringent requirements than other environmental remediation projects. For example, operations activities are not subject to independent oversight outside EM, and therefore DOE cannot hold EM accountable for its performance.", "GAO also found that EM has not consistently reported to Congress on its cleanup efforts as required, and the information EM has reported has been incomplete or inaccurate. Under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, EM must annually report estimated costs and detailed funding needs for future cleanup activities. EM's fiscal year 2017 submission to Congress was only the second one since fiscal year 2011, and it did not include a detailed list of upcoming activities or funding needed to meet those activities. Finally, GAO found that information provided in EM's fiscal year 2016 to 2018 budget requests did not reflect the funding some DOE officials said it needs to meet its milestones. Budget requests for those years were for at least $1.5 billion less than the $8 billion a senior EM official said EM anticipated was needed annually to meet milestones called for in legally enforceable agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Since January 2019, GAO has made 20 recommendations to DOE to address the growing environmental liability and management challenges and will continue to monitor DOE's implementation of these recommendations.

DOE\u2019s cleanup mission  includes remediating contaminated soil and groundwater; deactivating  and decommissioning contaminated buildings; and designing,  constructing, and operating facilities to treat millions of gallons of  radioactive waste. DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management (EM) is  responsible for most of the department\u2019s cleanup activities. EM\u2019s  estimate of the probable costs for the future cleanup of this waste is  known as its environmental and disposal liability (or environmental  liability).", "In February 2017, we added the federal government\u2019s environmental  liabilities to our list of agencies and program areas that are at high risk for  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or that are most in need of  transformation. In our 2017 High-Risk Series, we noted that DOE\u2019s fiscal  year 2016 environmental liability constituted the largest share\u2014over 80  percent\u2014of the federal government\u2019s total environmental liability and was  likely to increase. Further, we noted that DOE did not have complete  information about its cleanup responsibilities and that inconsistent  approaches to making cleanup decisions prevented DOE from fully and  cost-effectively addressing its environmental liability in ways that reduce  the risks to human health and the environment. We stated that future  progress in addressing the federal government\u2019s environmental liability  depends on, among other things, how effectively DOE and other federal  departments and agencies set priorities under increasingly restrictive  budgets to balance risks and costs when selecting cleanup remedies.", "According to EM documents, the agency\u2019s cleanup responsibilities  generally include (1) storing and treating radioactive and hazardous  waste; (2) treating contaminated soil and groundwater; (3) preparing and  disposing of spent nuclear fuel and highly enriched uranium materials;  and (4) deactivating and decommissioning excess facilities, some of  which are highly contaminated. EM has spent about $177 billion on  cleanup work since it began its cleanup program in 1989. It has  completed cleanup at 91 DOE sites, but cleanup work remains at 16 sites  (see fig. 1). Some of these remaining sites are the most challenging to  address and involve designing, building, starting up, and operating  complex nuclear facilities. These facilities include the Waste Treatment  and Immobilization Plant (WTP) in Hanford, Washington; the Integrated  Waste Treatment Unit at Idaho National Laboratory; and the Salt Waste  Processing Facility at the Savannah River site in South Carolina\u2014each of  which is over budget and behind schedule.", "This statement summarizes highlights of our recent work addressing (1)  the status of DOE\u2019s environmental liability, (2) management challenges at  EM, and (3) EM\u2019s reporting on its cleanup efforts.", "My testimony is based on five reports issued from January to March 2019  related to EM\u2019s cleanup efforts.

Our  reports each include a detailed description of our scope and  methodology. In addition, we updated information on EM\u2019s annual  spending and reported environmental liability with information from DOE\u2019s  fiscal year 2018 financial statement, which was published in December  2018, and DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2020 congressional budget request.

In the financial statement, EM  accounted for $377 billion (over 75 percent) of DOE\u2019s total liability. In  developing its environmental liability estimate, EM estimates the costs of  storing, treating, or disposing of a variety of waste types. Storing and  treating radioactive tank waste account for the largest portion of EM\u2019s  costs. For example, in January 2019 we reported that, in fiscal year 2017  (the most recent year for which these data were available at the time of  our review), EM\u2019s responsibilities to store and treat radioactive waste  stored in underground tanks accounted for nearly half of EM\u2019s total  environmental liability, and its responsibilities for addressing  contaminated facilities and remediating soil and groundwater  contamination accounted for about one-quarter.

This growth has occurred at the  same time as the number of contaminated sites has decreased. In fiscal  years 2011 through 2018, EM spent over $48 billion, primarily to address  radioactive tank waste as well as treat and dispose of other nuclear and  hazardous materials. Nonetheless, since 2011, EM\u2019s environmental  liability grew by $214 billion, from $163 billion to $377 billion, according to  our analysis of DOE financial data and documents (see fig. 4).", "EM\u2019s environmental liability may continue to grow because its currently  estimated environmental liability does not include the costs of all cleanup  activities for which the agency will likely be responsible in the future and  because the cost of addressing some of EM\u2019s largest projects is still  underestimated. First, not all of the cleanup activities EM must undertake  are captured in the current liability because, according to federal  accounting standards, only work that is probable and reasonably  estimable is required to be reported in an agency\u2019s liability. For  example, EM has not yet developed a cleanup plan or cost estimate for  the Nevada National Security site and, as a result, the cost of future  cleanup of this site was not included in EM\u2019s reported environmental  liability. The nearly 1,400-square-mile site has been used for hundreds of  nuclear weapons tests since 1951. These activities have resulted in more  than 45 million cubic feet of radioactive waste at the site, but the costs for  the cleanup of this waste are excluded from EM\u2019s annually reported  environmental liability. Second, the current cost associated with some of  EM\u2019s cleanup efforts may be underestimated. For example, as of April  2018, EM and its contractor had still not negotiated a cost for completing  the WTP\u2014DOE\u2019s largest and most complex construction project.", "Further, although EM typically spends about $6 billion per year on  cleanup activities, a large amount of its cleanup budget does not support  actual cleanup activities. Instead, this funding goes toward recurring  activities necessary to maintain the sites rather than toward reducing the  environmental liability. EM refers to these activities as \u201cminimum safety\u201d  work. According to EM officials, examples of such work include physical  security, health and radiation protection, or critical facility and  infrastructure maintenance for safe conditions. These officials said that  minimum safety work constitutes 30 to 60 percent of individual sites\u2019  budgets, for a total of at least $2.7 billion of EM\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget,  as we reported in February 2019. The Assistant Secretary for EM noted  in September 2018 that much of DOE\u2019s environmental liability is associated with managing minimum safety work and that significant  potential cost savings could result from reducing minimum safety work.  Accordingly, she stated that EM planned an initiative in fiscal year 2019 to  examine how EM can reduce this work.", "EM has undertaken several ad hoc studies and initiatives to address the  growing costs in its cleanup program. However, EM has not conducted a  formal root cause analysis to identify the causes for the growth in its  environmental liabilities. Specifically, EM headquarters officials we  interviewed said they were aware of the increases to the environmental  liability from year to year, as well as the areas in which the liability  changed; however, they said they had not done a detailed analysis of the  root causes of the growth. A leading practice for program management is  monitoring and controlling the program, which includes conducting root  cause analyses and developing corrective action plans. However, in  February 2019, we found that EM\u2019s cleanup policy does not follow this  leading practice because it does not include any such requirements. We  recommended that EM review and revise its policy to include program  management leading practices in its requirements, including for  monitoring and controlling the program. DOE agreed with our  recommendation and stated that it plans to revise its policy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EM Has Not Resolved Management Challenges in Its Cleanup Program", "paragraphs": ["EM has not resolved long standing management challenges that affect its  cleanup program and contracts. In March 2019, we issued our 2019 High- Risk Series, which included updates related to DOE\u2019s environmental  liability and its contract management. While officials at EM have taken  some steps toward management improvements aimed at reducing its  environmental liabilities, we found that EM has not demonstrated  progress toward resolving these challenges. We have identified several  unresolved issues including the following:", "EM does not have a program-wide cleanup strategy. We reported in  January 2019 that EM relies primarily on individual sites to locally  negotiate cleanup activities and establish priorities. Our analysis of  DOE documents identified instances of decisions involving billions of  dollars where such an approach did not always balance overall risks  and costs. For example, we reiterated what we found in May 2017  that two EM sites had plans to treat similar radioactive tank waste  differently, and the estimated costs for treating the waste at one site\u2014 Hanford\u2014may be tens of billions more than those at the other site\u2014 Savannah River. In addition, EM sites generally do not consider  other sites\u2019 risks and priorities when making cleanup decisions. We  reported in January 2019 that this approach is not consistent with  recommendations we and others have made over the last 2 decades  that EM develop national priorities to balance risks and costs across  and within its sites. Moreover, EM has not developed a program- wide strategy that sets such priorities and describes how EM will  address its greatest risks. Instead, according to agency officials, it  continues to prioritize and fund cleanup activities by individual site.  We recommended in January 2019 that EM develop a program-wide  strategy that outlines how EM will direct available resources to  address human health and environmental risks across and within  sites. DOE agreed with our recommendation and has since said it is  working toward this goal.", "EM manages most of its cleanup work as operations activities, under  less stringent requirements than capital asset projects. In February  2019, we reported that EM manages its cleanup work under different  requirements, depending on whether it classifies the work as a capital  asset project or an operations activity. EM currently manages most  of its work as operations activities. In its fiscal year 2019 budget,  operations activities accounted for 77 percent of EM\u2019s budget (about  $5.5 billion), and capital asset projects accounted for 18 percent  (about $1.3 billion). Operations activities have less stringent  requirements. For example, unlike capital asset projects, operations  activities are not required to go through a thorough upfront planning  process to determine the scope of work to be completed. In addition,  under EM cleanup requirements, operations activities are not subject  to independent oversight by entities outside EM. As a result, DOE  management does not have information on how EM manages  operations activities and cannot hold EM accountable for cost- effective and timely completion of this cleanup work. Since 2015,  experts in DOE\u2019s Office of Project Management have raised concerns  that some operations activities, such as cleanup of radioactive tank  waste, should be classified as capital asset projects. In February  2019, we recommended that EM work with DOE\u2019s Office of Project  Management\u2014which is responsible for providing DOE-wide  leadership and assistance pertaining to project management\u2014to  establish requirements for classifying cleanup work as capital asset  projects or operations activities and then work together to asses EM\u2019s  ongoing operations activities to determine if they should be  reclassified as capital asset projects based on the newly established  requirements. DOE generally agreed with our recommendations and  committed to review and revise its requirements as appropriate.", "EM\u2019s cleanup policy does not follow program and project  management leading practices. In February 2019, we also found that  EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy, which outlines procedures that govern the  EM program and its operations activities, does not follow most  selected leading practices for program and project management.  Specifically, we found that EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy does not follow  any of 9 selected program management leading practices related to  scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent reviews. For  example, the policy does not require the program management  leading practice of monitoring and controlling the program, including  conducting root cause analyses and developing corrective action  plans. Further, EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy follows only 3 of 12 selected  project management leading practices related to these areas. For  example, EM\u2019s 2017 cleanup policy does not require any independent  reviews of its operations activities by anybody outside of EM. We  recommended that DOE review and revise EM\u2019s cleanup policy to  include program and project management leading practices related to  scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent reviews. DOE  agreed with our recommendations.", "In addition, broader DOE management challenges affect EM and have  implications for EM\u2019s ability to effectively manage its cleanup work and  begin reducing its environmental liability. EM, like DOE, executes its  program activities primarily through the use of contracts. We have  reported that about 90 percent of DOE\u2019s budget is spent on contractors  that manage the laboratories and carry out DOE\u2019s programs. DOE\u2019s  contract management, however, is one of the areas we have identified as  posing a high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement because  of DOE\u2019s record of inadequate management and oversight of contractors.  As a result, DOE\u2019s contract and project management has been on our  High Risk List since 1990. Most recently, we found in March 2019 that  DOE did not always ensure that contractors audited subcontractors\u2019  incurred costs as required in their contracts. We identified more than  $3.4 billion in subcontract costs incurred over a 10-year period that had  not been audited as required, and some subcontracts remained  unaudited or unassessed for more than 6 years. Completing audits in a  timely manner is important because of a 6-year statute of limitations to  recover unallowable costs that could be identified through such audits.  We recommended that DOE develop procedures that require local offices  to monitor contractors to ensure timely completion of required subcontract  audits. DOE partially concurred with this recommendation and stated that  it plans to review existing requirements and guidance and to consider the  extent to which it requires monitoring of contractors\u2019 progress in  completing required subcontract audits. As we noted in the March 2019  report, we believe that DOE\u2019s plans to further examine the issues raised  in our report is a positive step toward resolving the issues; however, we  continue to believe that the actions called for in our recommendations  remain valid and that DOE could more efficiently resolve the issues by  proceeding to implement those actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Has Not Reported Required Information about the Status of Its Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Accurate and reliable information on the status and progress in a program  is essential for effective management and to ensure key stakeholders are  provided the information they need to fulfill their oversight, advisory, and  other essential roles. However, EM\u2019s performance measures for  operations activities do not provide a clear picture of overall performance,  and EM has not followed best practices in implementing its performance  reporting systems. In addition, EM has historically not provided all of the  statutorily required information about the status of its cleanup effort, and  the information EM has reported has been incomplete or inaccurate.  Finally, in its recent budget materials, EM did not include the funding it  says it needs to meet its schedule cleanup milestones."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EM\u2019s Cleanup Performance Measures Do Not Provide a Clear Picture of Overall Performance", "paragraphs": ["In February 2019, we found that EM\u2019s performance measures for  operations activities\u2014which constitute most of its cleanup activities\u2014do  not provide a clear picture of overall performance. According to EM  documentation and officials, EM uses three tools to measure the overall  performance of operations activities: earned value management (EVM),  performance metrics, and cleanup milestones. We found problems  with EM\u2019s use of each of these tools. Figure 5 summarizes our findings on  these three performance measures and how they affect EM\u2019s ability to  effectively manage the cleanup effort.", "First, we found in February 2019 that EM does not always ensure that its  EVM data are comprehensive or reliable. EVM measures the value of  work accomplished in a given period and compares it with the planned  value of work scheduled for the period and with the actual cost of the  work accomplished. EM relies primarily on EVM data to measure the  overall performance of its operations activities. EM relies on contractors\u2019  EVM systems to measure the performance of its contractors\u2019 operations  activities. We reviewed all 20 EM contracts covering operations activities  and found that EM requires its contractors to maintain EVM systems for  17 of all 20 contracts. We also found that EM paid its contractors to  maintain these systems and provide EVM reports to EM. However, we  found that EM has not followed best practices to ensure that these  systems are (1) comprehensive, (2) provide reliable data, and (3) are  used by EM leadership for decision-making\u2014which are the three  characteristics of a reliable EVM system. For example, only about half of  the EVM systems met the best practices for conducting integrated  baseline reviews and performing ongoing surveillance. Among those,  many of the reviews were not rigorous enough to ensure that the  performance measurement baseline captured all of the work. We found  that EM officials were not performing thorough surveillance reviews to  ensure that EVM systems were in alignment with EVM guidelines and that  the data being reported by the EVM systems were reliable. In addition,  the EVM data for contracts covering operations activities contained  numerous, unexplained anomalies in all the months we reviewed,  including missing or negative values for some of the completed work to  date. Even though EM requires most of its contractors for operations  activities to maintain EVM systems and pays them for doing so, EM\u2019s  2017 cleanup policy generally does not require that EVM systems be  maintained and used in a way that follow EVM best practices. The use of  EVM as a management tool is considered an industry standard and a  best practice for conducting cost and schedule performance analysis for  projects. EVM data can alert project managers to potential problems  sooner than expenditures alone can. Because EM does not follow best  practices in administering its EVM systems, EM leadership may not have  access to reliable performance data to make informed decisions in  managing billions of dollars\u2019 worth of cleanup work every year and to  provide to Congress and other stakeholders. We recommended that EM  update its cleanup policy to require that EVM systems be maintained and  used in a way that follows EVM best practices. DOE agreed with this  recommendation, and said it would implement it.", "Second, we found that EM\u2019s performance metrics do not link performance  to cost. EM collects performance metrics from the sites monthly to  measure progress toward completing the scope of work for the contract  and against a goal set at the beginning of each year. We found in  February 2019 that EM\u2019s performance metrics do not link that work to the  cost of completing it. For example, EM reported that it eliminated 72,000  gallons of radioactive liquid waste out of a target of 342,000 gallons for  fiscal year 2017 at the Savannah River site and disposed of 1,734 cubic  meters of low-level waste out of a target of 360 cubic meters at the Idaho  site. However, in neither case did EM indicate how much that work cost to  accomplish, such as whether those costs were above or below what had  been planned. Because EM\u2019s metrics do not link performance to cost, the  performance information EM has provided to Congress does not indicate  whether EM received good value from the contractor since it does not  show how much that work cost to accomplish. We recommended that EM  integrate EVM data into EM\u2019s performance metrics for operations  activities. DOE agreed with this recommendation and said it would  implement it.", "Finally, we found in February 2019 that sites regularly renegotiate  cleanup milestones they are at risk of missing, and EM does not track  data on the history of postponed milestones or the reasons why  milestones were postponed. As a result, milestones have limited value  as a means of tracking cleanup progress since EM does not track the  original (or any previously revised) milestone dates, which could provide  some data to measure the progress of cleanup activities. We  recommended that EM track and report original milestones dates as well  as changes to its cleanup milestones. DOE agreed with our  recommendation and said it is already tracking this information at the site  level. In response, we reiterated the importance of tracking these  changes and reporting that information at the headquarters level to help  inform Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Has Inconsistently Reported on Cleanup Status and Its Information May Be Misleading", "paragraphs": ["We reported in January 2019 that EM has not submitted congressionally  mandated reports on its cleanup program and the information EM has  reported has been incomplete or inaccurate.

Under the fiscal year  2011 National Defense Authorization Act, EM must annually develop and  report to Congress a Future-Years Defense Environmental Management  Plan that reflects estimated expenditures and proposed appropriations  included in the DOE budget for defense environmental cleanup  activities. It must do so at or about the same time that it submits its  budget request. The plan is to cover the fiscal year for which the budget is  submitted and at least the 4 succeeding fiscal years. The plan is required  to describe the cleanup activities to be carried out during the period  specified by the plan, estimated expenditures and proposed  appropriations necessary to support them, and each milestone in an  enforceable agreement governing the cleanup activity.

For  example, in the 2012 plan, DOE reported that only four out of 218  milestones were at risk of missing their planned completion date, while  the rest were on schedule. When comparing these milestones to the 2017  plan, we found that at least 14 of them had been postponed. Similarly, the  2017 plan listed only one milestone out of 154 as forecast to miss its due  date. However, because EM does not have a historical record of the  changes made to the milestones, it is unclear how many of these  milestones were recently revised or actually represented their original due  dates because the report does not include this information.", "Because DOE is not consistently and comprehensively submitting  complete information about the status of its cleanup, Congress and other  stakeholders may not have access to reliable information to make  informed decisions about billions of dollars of cleanup work.

However, in January 2019 we found that the information EM  provided to Congress in its fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018 budget  requests did not reflect the funding some senior DOE officials said EM  needs to meet its scheduled cleanup milestones. We reported that in a  2015 presentation on cleanup priorities, EM\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary  noted that EM\u2019s anticipated long-term funding needs for the full costs of  cleanup far exceeded the office\u2019s annual budget requests and noted that  in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, EM anticipated that it needed nearly  $8 billion annually to meet scheduled milestones called for in compliance  agreements. However, DOE\u2019s budget requests for those fiscal years were  $5.8 billion, $6.1 billion, and $6.5 billion, respectively\u2014a shortfall of at  least $1.5 billion per year. The Deputy Assistant Secretary also noted  that if EM continued to receive about $6 billion per year in the coming 2  decades, it would face a funding shortfall of about $28 billion. He also  said that the time frame for EM\u2019s cleanup mission would likely be  extended for years, thereby increasing cleanup costs and raising the  environmental liability. Similarly, we reported that in a 2017 site cleanup  meeting, EM\u2019s Associate Principle Deputy Assistant Secretary for Field  Operations said that in order for EM to meet all of the cleanup  requirements reflected in agreements with federal and state regulators,  EM would need a much larger budget than was requested in fiscal year  2018. For example, this official said that EM\u2019s Hanford site, which received about $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, needed more than $4  billion per year to meet scheduled milestones to construct and operate  the WTP\u2014one of many cleanup activities at the site\u2014for the duration of  its planned mission. The official added that EM\u2019s annual budget will not  cover all needs, particularly because infrastructure maintenance, repair,  and replacement needs are growing and extending the completion of  cleanup further into the future. We recommended that DOE disclose the  funding EM needs to meet all of its scheduled milestones. DOE agreed  with this recommendation and said it plans to request the funding needed  to meet its cleanup agreements.", "Chair DeGette, Ranking Member Guthrie, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
