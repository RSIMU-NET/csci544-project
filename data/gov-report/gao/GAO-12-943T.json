To address these challenges, FPS spent about $35 million and 4 years developing RAMP\u0097essentially a risk assessment and guard oversight tool. However, RAMP ultimately could not be used to do either because of system problems.", "This testimony is based on preliminary work for the Chairman and discusses the extent to which FPS is (1) completing risk assessments, (2) developing a tool to complete FSAs, and (3) managing its contract guard workforce. GAO reviewed FPS documents, conducted site visits at 3 of FPS\u0092s 11 regions and interviewed officials from FPS, Argonne National Laboratory, GSA, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Highway Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and guard companies; as well as 4 risk management experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u0092s preliminary results indicate that the Department of Homeland Security\u0092s (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS) is not assessing risks at federal facilities in a manner consistent with standards such as the National Infrastructure Protection Plan\u0092s (NIPP) risk management framework, as FPS originally planned. Instead of conducting risk assessments, since September 2011, FPS\u0092s inspectors have collected information, such as the location, purpose, agency contacts, and current countermeasures (e.g., perimeter security, access controls, and closed-circuit television systems). This information notwithstanding, FPS has a backlog of federal facilities that have not been ssessed for several years. According to FPS\u0092s data, more than 5,000 facilities were to be assessed in fiscal years 2010 through 2012. However, GAO was not able to determine the extent of FPS\u0092s facility security assessment (FSA) backlog because the data were unreliable. Multiple agencies have expended resources to conduct risk assessments, even though they also already pay FPS for this service.", "FPS has an interim vulnerability assessment tool, referred to as the Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST), which it plans to use to assess federal facilities until it develops a longer-term solution. In developing MIST, FPS generally followed GAO\u0092s project management best practices, such as conducting user acceptance testing. However, our preliminary analysis indicates that MIST has some limitations. Most notably, MIST does not estimate the consequences of an undesirable event occurring at a facility. Three of the four risk assessment experts GAO spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess risks. FPS officials stated that they did not include consequence information in MIST because it was not part of the original design and thus requires more time to validate. MIST also was not designed to compare risks across federal facilities. Thus, FPS has limited assurance that critical risks at federal facilities are being prioritized and mitigated.", "GAO\u0092s preliminary work indicates that FPS continues to face challenges in overseeing its approximately 12,500 contract guards. FPS developed the Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) to help it oversee its contract guard workforce by verifying that guards are trained and certified and for conducting guard post inspections. However, FPS faced challenges using RAMP for guard oversight, such as verifying guard training and certification information, and has recently determined that it would no longer use RAMP. Without a comprehensive system, it is more difficult for FPS to oversee its contract guard workforce. FPS is verifying guard certification and training information by conducting monthly audits of guard information maintained by guard contractors. However, FPS does not independently verify the contractor\u0092s information. Additionally, according to FPS officials, FPS recently decided to deploy a new interim method to record post inspections that replaces RAMP."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this testimony.

As a result, FPS\u2019s  Director decided to stop using RAMP to conduct FSAs and instead  pursue an interim tool to replace it. FPS also experienced difficulty using  RAMP to ensure that its guards met training and certification  requirements, primarily because of challenges in verifying guards\u2019 data.", "In June 2012, FPS also decided to stop using RAMP to help oversee its  contract guard program.", "For fiscal year 2012, FPS has a budget of $1.3 billion, with over 1,200  full-time employees and about 12,500 contract security guards, to achieve  its mission to protect federal facilities.

According to this framework, to be considered credible a risk assessment  must specifically address the three components of risk: threat, vulnerability,  and consequence. As a result, FPS has accumulated a backlog of federal  facilities that have not been assessed for several years. According to FPS  data, more than 5,000 facilities were to be assessed in fiscal years 2010  through 2012.

These assessments are taking place even though, according to FPS\u2019s  Chief Financial Officer, FPS received $236 million in basic security fees  from federal agencies to conduct FSAs and other security services in  fiscal year 2011. For example, officials we spoke with at the Internal  Revenue Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency,  Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  stated that they conduct their own risk assessments. GSA is also  expending additional resources to assess risk. We reported in October  2010 that GSA officials did not always receive timely FPS risk  assessments for facilities GSA considered leasing. GSA seeks to have  these assessments completed before it takes possession of a property  and leases it to tenant agencies.

MIST is an interim vulnerability assessment tool  that FPS plans to use until it can develop a permanent solution to replace  RAMP. According to MIST project documents and FPS officials, among  other things, MIST will: allow FPS\u2019s inspectors to review and document a facility\u2019s security  posture, current level of protection, and recommend  countermeasures; provide FPS\u2019s inspectors with a standardized way for gathering and  recording facility data; and allow FPS to compare a facility\u2019s existing countermeasures against  the Interagency Security Committee\u2019s (ISC) countermeasure  standards based on the ISC\u2019s predefined threats to federal facilities  (e.g., blast-resistant windows for a facility designed to counter the  threat of an explosive device) to create the facility\u2019s vulnerability  report.", "According to FPS officials, MIST will provide several potential  improvements over FPS\u2019s prior assessment tools, such as using a  standard way of collecting facility information and allowing edits to GSA\u2019s  facility data when FPS inspectors find it is inaccurate. In addition,  according to FPS officials, after completing a MIST vulnerability  assessment, inspectors will use additional threat information gathered  outside of MIST by FPS\u2019s Threat Management Division as well as local  crime statistics to identify any additional threats and generate a threat  assessment report.

It appears that FPS also better managed MIST\u2019s  requirements. Specifically, FPS\u2019s Director required that MIST be an FSA- exclusive tool and thus helped avoid changes in requirements that could  have resulted in cost or schedule increases during development. In March  2012, FPS completed user acceptance testing of MIST with some  inspectors and supervisors, as we recommended in 2011.FPS officials, user feedback on MIST was positive from the user  acceptance test, and MIST produced the necessary output for FPS\u2019s FSA  process.

Assessing  consequence is important because it combines vulnerability and  threat information to evaluate the potential effects of an adverse event  on a federal facility. Three of the four risk assessment experts we  spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate  consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess the risks to a  federal facility. However, FPS officials stated that incorporating  consequence information into an assessment tool is a complex task.  FPS officials stated that they did not include consequence  assessment in MIST\u2019s design because it would have required  additional time to develop, validate, and test MIST. As a result, while  FPS may be able to identify a facility\u2019s vulnerabilities to different  threats using MIST, without consequence information, federal tenant  agencies may not be able to make fully informed decisions about how  to allocate resources to best protect federal facilities.

FPS did not design MIST to  present comparisons of risk assessment results across federal  facilities. Consequently, FPS cannot take a comprehensive approach  to managing risk across its portfolio of 9,000 facilities to prioritize  recommended countermeasures to federal tenant agencies. Instead,  FPS takes a facility by facility approach to risk management where all  facilities with the same security level are assumed to have the same  security risk, regardless of their location.

FPS currently requires its guard  contractors to maintain their own files containing guard training and  certification information and began requiring them to submit a monthly  report with this information to FPS\u2019s regions in July 2011. To verify the  guard companies\u2019 reports, FPS conducts monthly audits. As part of its  monthly audit process, FPS\u2019s regional staff visits the contractor\u2019s office to  select 10 percent of the contractor\u2019s guard files and check them against  the reports guard companies send FPS each month. In addition, in  October 2011, FPS undertook a month-long audit of every guard file to  verify that guards had up-to-date training and certification information for  its 110 contracts across its 11 regions. FPS provided preliminary October  2011 data showing that 1,152 (9 percent) of the 12,274 guard files FPS  reviewed at that time were deficient, meaning that they were missing one  or more of the required certification document(s). However, FPS does not  have a final report on the results of the nation-wide audit that includes an  explanation of why the files were deficient and whether deficiencies were  resolved.", "FPS\u2019s monthly audits of contractor data provide limited assurance that  qualified guards are standing post, as FPS is verifying that the contractor- provided information matches the information in the contractor\u2019s files. We  reported in 2010 that FPS\u2019s reliance on contractors to self-report guard  training and certification information without a reliable tracking system of  its own may have contributed to a situation in which a contractor allegedly  falsified training information for its guards. In addition, officials at one  FPS region told us they maintain a list of the files that have been audited  previously to avoid reviewing the same files, but FPS has no way of  ensuring that the same guard files are not repeatedly reviewed during the  monthly audits, while others are never reviewed.
