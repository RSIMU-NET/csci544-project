About one-half of these investigations were closed with no disciplinary action because the components found that the allegations were unsubstantiated. For allegations that were substantiated by an investigation, the most common ATF offenses were poor judgment and failure to adequately secure property, while the most common USMS offenses were general violations of policy or procedure and failure to follow instruction. The most common outcomes for both ATF and USMS substantiated investigations were discipline including suspensions of up to 14 days and lesser penalties such as verbal or written warnings. During this period, ATF and USMS investigated over 300 allegations of management retaliation, with few resulting in discipline.", "ATF and USMS have developed some internal controls for managing their employee misconduct investigation and disciplinary processes, but have not consistently documented or monitored key control activities.

These data included misconduct investigations related to  allegations of management retaliation. Where possible, we combined  similar categories of offenses. We also reviewed each component\u2019s  annual reports that described their investigations. To summarize data  related to ATF and USMS employees filing claims of management  retaliation through formal channels other than ATF and USMS Internal  Affairs Division (Internal Affairs), we analyzed fiscal year 2014 through  2018 data from the DOJ Office of Inspector General (OIG), the U.S.  Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and each of the components\u2019 Equal  Employment Opportunity (EEO) office. We also analyzed EEO and  employee misconduct data to determine how many employees who filed  an EEO claim of management retaliation were also subject to a  misconduct investigation.", "As part of this work, we assessed data reliability by analyzing electronic  data fields for potential missing values and anomalies and by interviewing  component officials to discuss the mechanisms in place to ensure data  completeness.

We also  interviewed ATF and USMS officials to help us determine which control  activities they considered important for ensuring the quality and  independence of investigations and adjudications of employee  misconduct. We then compared each component\u2019s procedures for  investigations and adjudications with their respective policies and  guidance, as well as with criteria in Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, Quality Standards for Investigations, and  Department of Justice Community of Practices for Internal Affairs. Based  on our review of policies and procedures, interviews with ATF and USMS  officials, and relevant standards and guidance, we determined that the  key internal controls are investigative supervisory review, legal sufficiency  review, DOJ OIG review, and verification of case management system  data.", "To assess the extent to which ATF and USMS have implemented these  key internal controls, we selected a stratified random sample of case files  within the population of employee misconduct allegation case  management system files that were opened for investigation from fiscal  years 2014 through 2018 and were closed at the time of our review. For  ATF, this included headquarters\u2019 investigations that the agency closed as  of April 2019 and division investigations (management referrals for action)  that were closed as of July 2019. For USMS, this included investigations  that the agency closed as of March 2019 (for cases opened during fiscal  years 2014 through 2017) and April 2019 (for cases opened during fiscal  year 2018). Strata were separate for each component, and included the  severity of misconduct and whether the employee under investigation had  also filed a claim of management retaliation to their respective EEO  office. We used fiscal year 2014 through 2018 data from the components\u2019  information systems from which we randomly selected a generalizable  sample of 65 misconduct cases for ATF and 100 cases for USMS. See  appendix I for additional information on our sampling methodology.", "We analyzed these sample cases to test whether the components  consistently operated and documented the key internal control activities  appropriately in their case management systems or other case file  records. Specifically, we tested each misconduct case by analyzing data  recorded in ATF and USMS systems to determine whether the  component had documented key control activities, which serves as  evidence that the component implemented the control activities. We also  reviewed the case file records that each component retains outside its  case management information systems (e.g., physical case files) for  documentation of supervisory investigative review, legal sufficiency  review, and case management data. To assess whether the components  forwarded allegations to the DOJ OIG for review, we compared ATF and  USMS records with DOJ OIG records. We also reviewed component  policies, procedures, and management reports to determine the extent to  which the agencies had established performance measures and  monitored the timeliness of investigations. Further, we examined  mechanisms used by each component for monitoring compliance with  internal controls (e.g., annual self-assessment programs).", "To address both objectives, we interviewed officials from each component  involved in employee misconduct processes. Specifically, we met with  officials from ATF and USMS Internal Affairs Division, which are the  organizations that investigate allegations centrally at agency  headquarters. ATF\u2019s Internal Affairs resides within the Office of  Professional Responsibility and Security Operations, which reports  directly to the ATF Deputy Director. USMS Internal Affairs reports directly  to the USMS Deputy Assistant Director within the Office of Professional  Responsibility. We also interviewed human resources and employee  relations officials and officials from other offices involved with the  adjudication process at each component, including the Offices of General  Counsel. Further, we interviewed ATF and USMS officials who oversee  each component\u2019s case management information system to discuss and  obtain documentation related to the employee misconduct process, such  as system user guides. To learn of any past issues related to processing  employee misconduct allegations and the status of their resolution, we  reviewed our past work in this subject area, and reports on federal  employee misconduct from the DOJ Office of Inspector General.", "Additionally, for both objectives, we conducted site visits to review local  procedures and interview field staff involved in handling employee  misconduct cases for each component. We selected locations based on  geographic dispersion and the high volume of employee misconduct  cases associated with their locations. For both ATF and USMS, we  interviewed officials who conduct inquiries of employee misconduct  (investigations referred to local management by Internal Affairs) in  Georgia, the District of Columbia, and Texas. Specifically, we interviewed  officials at ATF\u2019s Atlanta and Houston Field Divisions and the Firearms  and Explosives Services Division located in Martinsburg, West Virginia,  each of which manages a high volume of misconduct investigations. We  also interviewed USMS officials from the Southern Texas District, who  manage a high volume of misconduct investigations, and from USMS  District of Northern Georgia and District of Columbia District Court based  on geographic locations. At these locations, we also interviewed senior  officials\u2014ATF Special Agents in Charge and Assistant Special Agents in  Charge, and Division Chiefs and U.S. Marshals and Chief Deputy  Marshals who are responsible for adjudicating employee misconduct  cases. During these site visits, we also met with other staff who assist  these senior officials with the adjudication process.
