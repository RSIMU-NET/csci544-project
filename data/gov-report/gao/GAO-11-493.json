ATATs threaten the U.S. tax system's integrity if honest taxpayers believe that others do not pay their fair share of taxes. GAO was asked to (1) describe what is known about trends in ATAT usage; (2) describe results of IRS's ATAT enforcement efforts; and (3) evaluate IRS's implementation of the ATAT provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Using criteria from the act, GAO analyzed statistics and other documents on trends and results and interviewed IRS and other tax experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While trend data on taxpayers' use of ATATs are limited, IRS and other experts GAO contacted agreed that a problem exists and is continually changing. One theme that emerged from GAO's discussions with these experts is that ATATs marketed by promoters to corporations and wealthy individuals have declined in recent years, although the experts had different views on the extent of the decline. They also said that ATATs have become more international in nature. Even though estimating the extent of the ATAT problem is inexact because ATATs are often hidden, the experts believed that the changing nature of ATATs warrants continuous IRS vigilance. IRS has many ATAT-related enforcement efforts--investigations, examinations, and settlement initiatives--across different divisions but has incomplete data on the results on those efforts. For example, IRS's small business division's promoter investigations help stop promotions, but IRS had incomplete information on why investigations often closed without penalties or injunctions, information that could be used to help decide the types of investigations to start. In addition, IRS recommended billions of dollars in additional taxes from examining tax returns with suspected ATATs, but IRS did not identify the part of the additional amount that was collected or that related to the ATAT issue as opposed to other issues. In addition, some ATAT results were reported inconsistently across IRS divisions. Without comprehensive or consistent information, IRS does not have the best information to decide which promoters to investigate and the number of examinations that should be done as well as to evaluate their impacts. Even though the 2004 act increased the requirements for taxpayers and promoters to disclose their use of transactions and enhanced the penalties for improper disclosure, problems existed. IRS received many disclosures of transaction use from taxpayers, but it had no assurance that its Office of Tax Shelter Analysis received all the disclosures it should have. In addition, IRS did not verify that all the disclosures it received were complete, and a new process for reviewing the completeness of disclosures and following up with taxpayers was not yet finalized. Not receiving disclosures or receiving incomplete disclosures of transactions would keep IRS from having information needed to identify the transactions that merit an examination of their appropriateness and to assess related penalties as needed. Finally, certain promoters who are required by law under threat of penalty to give their list of investors within 20 business days after IRS requested it did so. However, other promoters who are not covered by this requirement often took longer than 20 days to provide the lists without the threat of a similar penalty. IRS did not comprehensively track how quickly the lists were received. Not receiving lists on a timely basis prevents IRS from quickly working to stop promoter activity. GAO suggests that Congress consider instituting a penalty aimed at certain promoters not giving investor lists to IRS within a specified time. GAO also recommends IRS act or establish processes to (1) improve data on the results of ATAT-related investigations and examinations, (2) ensure that required disclosures are filed by taxpayers, (3) review disclosures for completeness; (4) track the time for IRS to receive investor lists; and (5) induce more promoters to provide investor lists by a specified time. In commenting on a draft of this report, IRS agreed with most recommendations but cited resource and capability constraints in tracking ATAT data and investor lists, which GAO believes can be addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Abusive tax avoidance transactions (ATAT) range from tax schemes based  on clearly frivolous arguments to highly technical and abusive tax shelters  engineered and marketed by firms.

Promoters (including material advisors) may encourage the use of  these abusive transactions by their customers. In 2003, we reported that  IRS officials estimated that several hundred thousand participants were  likely engaged in abusive tax avoidance schemes. In addition, we reported  that IRS data sources, all with limitations, suggested that abusive tax  shelters totaled tens of billions of dollars of potential tax losses over about  a decade.

The objectives of this report are to:    describe what IRS and other experts know about trends in the use of    describe the results that IRS\u2019s promoter investigations, investor  examinations, and settlement initiatives have achieved; and  evaluate the results of IRS\u2019s implementation of the ATAT disclosure  and sanction provisions enacted in the AJCA.", "To address these objectives, we did the following (see app. I for details  about our scope and methodology):  reviewed IRS\u2019s documentation on ATAT trends, including its most  recent report on the size of the ATAT problem, and interviewed IRS  officials and outside tax experts\u2014former high-level IRS officials and  their suggested contacts\u2014about these ATAT trends and whether the  nature of ATAT problems changed in sophistication or scope in recent  years;  analyzed IRS investigation, examination, and settlement initiative  statistics, focusing on two IRS divisions that pursue abusive promoters  and that our 2003 work highlighted\u2014the Large Business and  International (LB&I) division and the Small Business/Self-Employed  (SB/SE) division, and interviewed IRS officials about why IRS did  certain investigations and examinations and not others; and    using criteria inherent in the AJCA, evaluated (1) ATAT disclosures to  IRS and their level of completeness, (2) IRS\u2019s requests for the lists of  investors in ATATs from tax advisors, and (3) ATAT penalties and  other sanctions used since 2004, and interviewed IRS officials on why  some disclosures were required to be sent to two places in IRS and  how well that requirement worked.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 through May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["If ATATs are highly technical and organized or marketed, they are often  referred to as abusive tax shelters. According to IRS, abusive tax shelters  result in unlawful tax evasion. Our report on business network-based tax  evasion illustrates how one type of evasive transaction\u2014the installment  sale bogus optional basis\u2014operated. ATATs also include abusive  transactions that are considered scams or schemes based on the  erroneous application of tax law or clearly frivolous arguments.", "Tax shelters can be legitimate to the extent that they take advantage of  various provisions in the tax code to lawfully avoid tax. For instance,  retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)) shelter income by not subjecting certain  wages to federal income taxes until the wages are distributed from the  plan. Tax shelters can feature such techniques as taxpayers trying to avoid  gains altogether or to convert ordinary income into capital gains to take  advantage of lower tax rates on capital gains.", "A difficulty arises when tax shelters are designed to confer a tax benefit  that the Congress did not intend. An example of this type of shelter is the  lease-in, lease-out (LILO) shelter that involved complex purported leasing  arrangements in which corporations supposedly leased large assets, such  as sewer systems, from owners without a tax liability and immediately  leased them back to their original owners in an attempt to delay income  recognition for tax purposes for many years.", "ATATs have been a long-standing problem that the Congress, Treasury,  and IRS have used different methods to address. For example, the Tax  Reform Act of 1986 addressed tax shelters from the 1970s and 1980s by  preventing individual taxpayers from using \u201cpassive activity\u201d losses from  tax shelter investments to reduce taxes by offsetting taxable income.", "Interest in abusive tax shelters picked up again in the 1990s. In 1999, a  Department of the Treasury report described a large and growing problem  with abusive corporate tax shelters. In 2002, citing many ongoing efforts,  Treasury published a plan to further combat ATATs, featuring both  legislative proposals and administrative actions. In 2004, the AJCA  provided updated disclosure and list-maintenance rules and updated  penalty provisions. The list-maintenance rules require that material  advisors keep lists of their investors and make the lists available to the  Secretary of the Treasury within 20 business days of a request. For a  summary of selected provisions of the AJCA related to ATATs, see  appendix II.", "Over time, Treasury\u2019s strategy for addressing tax shelters centered on  rules that were intended to reinforce each other. The rules attempted to do  this by requiring taxpayers entering into certain transactions and tax  advisors recommending the transactions to disclose to IRS information  about the same transactions. The idea was that using these rules, IRS  could follow a transaction from a taxpayer to the taxpayer\u2019s advisor and  from the advisor to any of the advisor\u2019s clients.", "The rules require specified taxpayers to disclose \u201creportable  transactions.\u201d These transactions include \u201clisted transactions\u201d that are  the same or substantially similar to one of the types of transactions that  IRS has determined to be a tax avoidance transaction and identified by  notice, regulation or other published guidance. Reportable transactions  also include \u201cnon-listed\u201d transactions, which are not designated as tax  avoidance transactions but prompt tax avoidance or evasion concerns  nonetheless. Non-listed reportable transactions include certain  transactions (1) offered to a taxpayer under conditions of confidentiality  and for which the taxpayer paid an advisor a minimum fee and (2) certain  loss transactions. Non-reportable abusive transactions are abusive  transactions not described in one of the reportable categories. For a  comparison of requirements for reportable and non-reportable  transactions and a description of how taxpayers, material advisors and  other promoters, and IRS interact with each other, see figure 1.", "IRS has had various forms for filers reporting ATAT information. For  example, taxpayers are to file Form 8886, Reportable Transaction  Disclosure Statement, to disclose their reportable transactions. Form 8918,  Material Advisor Disclosure Statement, is to be filed by material advisors.  This form was created in 2007 to replace Form 8264, Application for  Registration of a Tax Shelter, which was to be filed by tax shelter  organizers in order to describe a transaction and its tax benefits when the  transaction had certain potentially abusive characteristics.", "To enforce compliance, IRS has three interlocking efforts: promoter  investigations, investor examinations, and settlements. Figure 2 focuses on  two IRS operating divisions\u2014LB&I and SB/SE\u2014that develop and evaluate  promoter leads for investigation and shows how each division coordinates  with others, including the Servicewide Abusive Transaction Executive  Steering Committee.", "To make a case against abusive promoters, LB&I or SB/SE may examine  the tax returns of taxpayers investing in the promotions. If they make such  a case, the promoters will be unable to sell their ATATs to taxpayers, and  IRS will thus have fewer taxpayers to examine to see if their investments  in those promotions cause tax concerns. IRS may also settle with groups  of taxpayers without necessarily having to first locate and examine each  taxpayer who used a promotion. IRS induces these taxpayers to come  forward in disputed matters by, in some cases, reducing their penalties in  exchange for conceding tax benefits that they claimed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Limited Trend Data on the Extent of Abusive Transactions, but Many Tax Experts Said That the Ever- Changing Nature of ATATs Requires Constant Vigilance", "paragraphs": ["IRS has limited trend data on the size of the ATAT problem in terms of the  number of abusive promoters and taxpayers investing in the promotions.  Estimating the extent of ATATs is at best an inexact process because  ATATs are often hidden. Data do not exist to measure any ATATs  unknown to IRS with much precision. Given these difficulties, IRS used  various qualitative and quantitative methods in an attempt to develop  some estimates in a 2006 study. IRS estimated that about 1 million tax  returns and between about 11,000 and 15,000 promoters were involved in  ATATs in 2004. Of the 1 million returns, IRS estimated that more than half  related to \u201cbusiness and deduction\u201d schemes and almost a third involved  \u201cfrivolous filer/anti-tax\u201d schemes. IRS put the rest of the returns into six  other categories, such as corporate tax shelters. IRS had no plans to  update these estimates.", "In the absence of data on trends in the use of ATATs, we interviewed a  number of tax experts in IRS or who were former top officials of IRS or  others well-known in the tax community. The experts we interviewed told  us that abusive tax avoidance is still a major issue but the nature of ATATs  has changed. A theme we heard from the experts is that the mass  marketing of ATATs has declined in recent years, although the experts had  different views on the extent of the decline. Mass marketing refers to the  sale of advice by promoters such as larger accounting and tax law firms  about how to structure ATATs. This advice was sold to clients such as  wealthy individuals and corporations. One expert said that mass  marketing of ATATs has significantly declined in recent years. Others  made statements like the battle has been \u201cmore won than not.\u201d", "Although mass marketing of ATATs has declined, these experts said that  ATATs have become more sophisticated and international in scope. In  addition to international transactions, ATATs are changing as false credits  and deductions, customized shelters, and return preparer fraud entities  have come more to the fore. IRS\u2019s \u201cdirty dozen\u201d list, its annual listing of  \u201cnotorious tax scams,\u201d ranks certain abuses that are relevant to ATATs\u2014  such as return preparer fraud and trying to hide income offshore\u2014at the  top.", "The experts we interviewed gave us details about how ATATs involving  international features or tax return preparers changed. For instance, one  expert believed abuse took the form of improperly keeping income  offshore and not reporting it on a tax return. IRS officials said that abusive  transactions moved from being domestic transactions mass marketed by  large accounting and law firms to offshore transactions promoted by  smaller entities and more customized to the buyers. IRS officials also said  that ATATs seemed more international than before, with promoters  changing the countries and mechanics of their promotions. In terms of tax  return preparers, IRS officials told us of promotions systematically using  false or inflated deductions or credits in tax returns. These schemes  achieved broad coverage by taking small scale abusive positions with  individual clients. For instance, preparers solicited clients in an attempt to  improperly claim the First-Time Homebuyer Credit, which first came into  existence in 2008.", "Experts also told us that the nature of the ATAT problem is cyclical and  ever-changing and warrants continuous IRS vigilance. According to IRS  officials, IRS tries to proactively identify and thwart emerging ATATs,  especially early in their life cycles, pointing to early IRS identification of  taxpayers\u2019 attempts to improperly claim the First-Time Homebuyer Credit.", "Three data sources other than the above IRS estimates also give some  indication of changes in ATAT activity. First, taxpayers are disclosing  fewer listed reportable transactions (which are designated as tax  avoidance transactions) to IRS on Forms 8886. Taxpayers disclosed about  6,100 of these transactions in 2007 and about 1,300 each in 2008 and 2009.  However, IRS cannot know how many listed transactions should have  been disclosed but were not.", "Second, the cumulative number of transaction types that IRS has \u201clisted\u201d  since 2000 has leveled off at 36. As figure 3 shows, IRS did not designate  any new listed transactions in years 2008 through 2010. IRS officials said  they detected fewer widely promoted avoidance transactions suitable for  listing in recent years. However, the number of transaction types that are  listed is not an indication of how many promoters or taxpayers are using  them.", "Third, IRS identified two transactions of interest (TOI) in both 2007 and  2008 but none in 2009 or 2010. IRS designates a new promotion that has  the potential for tax avoidance or evasion as a TOI when IRS lacks  information to decide whether to list it as a tax avoidance transaction.  Doing so triggers a requirement for the taxpayers involved to disclose  information about the transaction to IRS on Form 8886."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Shows Vigilance over ATATs in Its Enforcement Efforts, but Quantifying the Impact of the Efforts Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["IRS has investigated promoters in an effort to stop ATATs, examined the  tax returns of taxpayers participating in ATATs, and initiated settlements  with groups of taxpayers without necessarily having to first locate and  examine each taxpayer using the ATAT. IRS efforts in these three areas  are consistent with what we heard about how the ever-changing problems  with ATATs merit continued vigilance.", "However, IRS has difficulty quantifying the IRS-wide impact of these  efforts on the ATAT problem. As context for discussing such IRS-wide  impacts, several examination and settlement initiative projects considered  by the Servicewide Abusive Transaction Executive Steering Committee  showed the challenges of working across IRS units. An internal IRS report  noted that decisions by different divisions on how and when to report  results on their work for one IRS-wide settlement initiative initially  resulted in inconsistent briefings to the Enforcement Committee, to which  the Steering Committee reports. Another IRS team working on an ATAT  issue informed the Steering Committee about obstacles to coordinating  among IRS units and about needed mitigations.

For the same years, SB/SE  closed (e.g., discontinued for various reasons) 905 investigations (62  percent) without penalties or injunctions.", "This annual level of SB/SE investigations shows IRS\u2019s vigilance in  attempting to identify and pursue leads to address ATATs. According to  Lead Development Center (LDC) officials and documents, LDC develops  leads received from such sources as IRS revenue agents and officers and  practicing accountants who suggest an individual may be involved in an  abusive promotion. IRS field offices decide whether to pursue an  investigation. If an investigation cannot sustain a penalty or injunction, it  can be surveyed (closed without promoter contact) or discontinued  (closed after promoter contact). LDC officials said that the reasons for  surveyed or discontinued investigations include the difficulty in proving  abuse, the need to balance limited resources and many priorities in  addressing the most egregious promoters, and the lack of harm to the  government.", "IRS had incomplete data on why investigations were discontinued or  surveyed. In fiscal year 2009, SB/SE discontinued 84 investigations,  surveyed 46, and closed 1 because the promoter died. Of the 130 cases  surveyed or discontinued, we could not analyze 30 because LDC officials  said they did not receive the documentation and 3 because the  documentation was incomplete. In over 65 percent of the other 97 cases  we could analyze, the investigations closed because the parties were not  actively promoting abusive transactions or because IRS could not obtain  enough evidence to support a penalty or injunction.", "In February 2011, LDC started using codes to capture the reasons for  surveying or discontinuing promoter investigations to have more complete  data on these reasons. SB/SE officials told us they plan to promote  consistency in the use of the reason codes by asking field offices to  describe why they selected the codes for each case and by continually  analyzing the different codes used. Because this process had just started,  we had no assurance how these plans would work or how the reason-code  data would be used to make decisions on the types of investigations to  start.", "IRS had no criteria to indicate whether the SB/SE investigation results in  table 1 were at desired levels. While the effectiveness of injunctions is  apparent when they stop promotions, tax experts questioned the  effectiveness of penalties if they do not deter those who will risk a penalty  to engage in an abusive promotion. Without criteria, IRS could not say  whether having 62 percent of investigations closed without penalties or  injunctions was too many, too few, or about right, which would be  important information in deciding which types of cases to select for  investigation.", "Regardless, IRS officials said that closing 62 percent of investigations  without penalty or injunction did not indicate any flaws. They said that  decisions about doing an investigation usually cannot be made without  some field work; decisions about continuing an investigation with  additional field work must be balanced with the available field resources.  These officials said they continually look for ways to develop and refine  leads before turning them over to investigators because successful  investigations of promoters drive unscrupulous individuals out of  business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Examined Thousands of Tax Returns Involving Suspected ATATs and Recommended Billions of Dollars in Additional Taxes, but the Impact Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["The impact of examinations on the ATAT problem is uncertain.

Further, the recommended amounts may not produce actual tax  assessments or collections when taxpayers dispute the recommended  amounts in the appellate or litigation processes. For examinations closed  in fiscal years 2006 through 2010:    LB&I examinations of 9,400 tax returns with suspected ATATs  recommended additional assessments for all tax issues of $42.4 billion,  of which taxpayers disagreed with about 84 percent.", "SB/SE examinations of 125,700 returns with suspected ATATs  recommended additional assessments for all issues of $6 billion, of  which taxpayers contested at least 54 percent in IRS\u2019s Appeals office.", "Neither LB&I nor SB/SE readily tracked how much of the additional taxes  were ultimately assessed and collected after examinations for either ATAT  or all tax issues.

For  instance, the dollar amount for the Global Settlement Initiative, which  aimed to resolve 21 unrelated abusive transaction issues under one  framework, was the amount of additional tax recommended, not the  amount collected. Also, the total for all of the ATAT initiatives as reported  to the Joint Committee did not include any dollars collected from the very  large-dollar LILO and similar Sale-In/Lease-Out (SILO) ATAT initiatives.

However,  IRS knows that a problem exists because, according to IRS officials, IRS  examiners of tax returns have identified some taxpayers who filed their  Form 8886 with their tax return but failed to send it to OTSA.

Studies done in  2008, 2009, and 2010 indicated that mandatory electronic filing would  make processing the Form 8886 less time- and labor-intensive and more  accurate. However, all three studies concluded that mandating electronic  filing was not currently viable or realistic, mainly because, according to  the study reports, the great majority of taxpayers filing the Form 8886 did  not already file their tax returns electronically and would have to change  their filing format. For example, for all Form 8886 filers in processing year  2009, 14 percent filed their tax return electronically, including 43 percent  of corporate filers, 32 percent of partnership filers, 11 percent of individual  filers, and 3 percent of estate and trust filers.", "However, these OTSA studies did not examine whether the returns were  already being prepared on computers. If they were, taxpayers could more  readily comply with an electronic filing mandate. IRS data compiled from  codes collected on tax returns show that about two thirds of all paper  returns in 2008 (and about 92 percent when a paid preparer was used)  were prepared on a computer, printed, and mailed to IRS.

We agree that costs and  benefits must be carefully weighed. In that regard, IRS\u2019s data collection  would not have to be elaborate. For instance, SB/SE officials already send  data on the investor lists received to a central list keeper. These officials  also could send the dates when each list was requested and received to  that same office. In that way, SB/SE could see if the slowness in receiving  some lists that we found is prevalent across the division, and other  divisions could do the same thing. If the slowness is prevalent, IRS  officials would then have the information needed to make decisions on  whether IRS is doing all it can to quickly determine and address any harm  to the government.

In lieu of requiring summonses to  be prepared for the first meeting with non-material advisors, IRS stated  that its Internal Revenue Manual would recommend that IRS agents  consider preparing summonses to use at initial meetings with possibly  problematic non-material advisors. We encourage IRS to track how often  IRS agents provide summonses at these meetings in the future and  whether their doing so expedites obtaining non-material advisor investor  lists. If IRS still finds obtaining the lists difficult after changing the  Internal Revenue Manual, we encourage it to take additional steps to  receive the lists more quickly.
