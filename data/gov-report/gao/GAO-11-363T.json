Congress and the President need reliable, useful, and timely financial and performance information to make sound decisions and conduct effective oversight of federal government programs and policies. Over the years, certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have prevented GAO from expressing an opinion on the accrual-based consolidated financial statements. Unless these weaknesses are adequately addressed, they will, among other things, continue to (1) hamper the federal government's ability to reliably report a significant portion of its assets, liabilities, costs, and other related information; and (2) affect the federal government's ability to reliably measure the full cost as well as the financial and nonfinancial performance of certain programs and activities. This testimony presents the results of GAO's audit for fiscal year 2010 and discusses certain of the federal government's significant long-term fiscal challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three major impediments continued to prevent GAO from rendering an opinion on the federal government's accrual-based consolidated financial statements: (1) serious financial management problems at the Department of Defense, (2) federal entities' inability to adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances, and (3) the federal government's ineffective process for preparing the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the material weaknesses underlying these major impediments, GAO noted material weaknesses involving billions of dollars in improper payments, information security, and tax collection activities. With regard to the Statement of Social Insurance (SOSI), GAO was unable to, and did not, express an opinion on the 2010 SOSI because of significant uncertainties discussed by management in the consolidated financial statements, primarily related to the achievement of projected reductions in Medicare cost growth reflected in the 2010 SOSI. GAO was, however, able to render unqualified opinions on the 2009, 2008, and 2007 SOSIs. Since the enactment of key financial management reforms in the 1990s, the federal government has made significant progress in improving financial management activities and practices. For fiscal year 2010, 20 of 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies were able to attain unqualified audit opinions on their accrual-based financial statements within an accelerated reporting timeframe, up from 6 CFO Act agencies for fiscal year 1996. Also, accounting and financial reporting standards have continued to evolve to provide greater transparency and accountability over the federal government's operations, financial condition, and fiscal outlook. Further, the preparation and audit of financial statements has identified numerous deficiencies, leading to actions to strengthen controls and systems. Much work remains, however, to improve federal financial management. For example, it is essential that the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget, along with other federal entities, address the major impediments discussed above. Also, it is important for the individual federal departments and agencies to remain committed to maintain the progress that has been achieved in obtaining positive audit results and to build upon that progress to make needed improvements. The 2010 Financial Report of the United States Government (Financial Report) introduces the first sustainability statement required under a new financial reporting standard, which presents comprehensive long-term fiscal projections for the U.S. government. Such reporting provides a much needed perspective on the federal government's long-term fiscal position and outlook. The Financial Report, like the latest Congressional Budget Office long-term budget outlook and GAO simulations, shows that the federal government is on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, GAO has made numerous recommendations directed at improving federal financial management.

The department\u2019s Financial  Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, which defines DOD\u2019s  strategy and methodology for improving financial management operations  and controls, has continued to evolve and mature. DOD\u2019s Comptroller has  established two priority focus areas\u2014first, strengthening processes,  controls, and systems that produce budgetary information and support the  department\u2019s Statements of Budgetary Resources; and second, improving  the accuracy and reliability of management information pertaining to  mission-critical assets, including military equipment and real property, and  validating improvement through existence and completeness testing.

In this regard, the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) recently underwent an audit  of its fiscal year 2010 Statement of Budgetary Resources (SBR). Although  the auditors were unable to express an opinion on the USMC SBR, DOD  indicated that the lessons learned from the audit will be applied to the  fiscal year 2011 USMC SBR audit currently underway and shared with the  other DOD components to assist them in their audit readiness efforts.", "A key element of DOD\u2019s strategy is successful implementation of  Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems.

However, there are significant uncertainties concerning the  achievement of these projected decreases in Medicare costs.  \uf0b7  Management has noted that actual future costs for Medicare are likely  to exceed those shown by the current-law projections presented in the  2010 Statement of Social Insurance due to the likelihood of  modifications to the scheduled reductions. The extent to which  actual future costs exceed the projected current-law amounts due to  changes to the physician payments and productivity adjustments  depends on both the specific changes that might be legislated and on  whether legislation would include other provisions to help offset such  costs.  \uf0b7  Management has developed an illustrative alternative projection intended to provide additional context regarding the long-te rm  sustainability of the Medicare program and to illustrate the  uncertainties in the Statement of Social Insurance projections.
