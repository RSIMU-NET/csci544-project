Terrorism concerns involving VWP country citizens have led some to suggest eliminating or suspending the program, while the executive branch is considering adding countries to it. Legislation passed in 2007 led the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop its Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), to screen VWP country citizens before they travel to the United States; if found ineligible, travelers will need to apply for a visa. GAO reviewed how (1) program elimination or suspension, (2) program expansion, and (3) ESTA could affect visa demand, resource needs, and revenues. We collected traveler, staffing, facilities, and cost data from the Department of State (State), DHS, and embassy officials and developed estimates related to the three scenarios above."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The potential elimination or suspension of the Visa Waiver Program could cause dramatic increases in visa demand--from around 500,000 (the average number of people from VWP countries who obtain a U.S. visa each year) to as much as 12.6 million (the average number of people who travel to the United States from VWP countries each year)--that could overwhelm visa operations in the near term. To meet visa demand, State officials said they could need approximately 45 new facilities, which we estimate could cost $3.8 billion to $5.7 billion. We estimate State would also need substantially more staff--around 540 new Foreign Service officers at a cost of around $185 million to $201 million per year, and 1,350 local Foreign Service national staff at around $168 million to $190 million per year, as well as additional management and support positions for a total annual cost of $447 million to $486 million. Because VWP elimination would increase the number of travelers needing a visa, we estimate annual visa fee revenues would increase substantially, by $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, and would offset the year-to-year recurring staffing costs. State has done limited planning for how it would address increased visa demand if the program were suspended or eliminated. Adding countries to the Visa Waiver Program would reduce visa demand in those countries, but likely have a relatively limited effect overall on resources needed to meet visa demand and on State's visa fee revenues. The volume of visa applications is relatively small in most of the 13 \"Road Map\" countries the executive branch is considering for expansion. If all 13 Road Map countries were to join the program, and if all of those countries' citizens who previously traveled with visas were to travel to the United States without visas, the reduction in workload would, we estimate, permit State to move about 21 to 31 Foreign Service officers to other posts in need, and to cut 52 to 77 Foreign Service national positions. In addition, though program expansion would result in less space needed for visa operations, this would likely result in little or no building or lease savings because any resulting excess consular space is in government-owned facilities, and could not be sold. If all 13 Road Map countries were admitted to the Visa Waiver Program, we estimate that State would lose approximately $74 million to $83 million each year in collected visa fees, offsetting any savings in personnel costs. State and DHS officials acknowledged that the implementation of ESTA could increase visa demand in VWP countries, though neither State nor DHS has developed estimates of the increase. DHS is currently developing ESTA, and DHS officials told us the ESTA rejection rate could be between 1 percent and 3 percent, but they currently do not know. In addition, State and embassy officials believe some travelers might choose to apply for a visa rather than face potential, unexpected travel disruptions due to ESTA. Neither DHS nor State has attempted to estimate how these two factors would affect visa demand, and, as a result, State has not estimated what additional resources would be needed to manage the demand, and what additional visa fees would be received. However, State officials told us that, if 1 percent to 3 percent of current VWP travelers came to embassies in VWP countries for visas, it could greatly increase visa demand at some locations, which could significantly disrupt visa operations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), citizens from 27 select countries  can travel to the United States for business or pleasure trips of up to 90  days without first obtaining a visa and paying a visa fee. The program has  many benefits, including facilitating international travel for millions of  foreign nationals seeking to visit the United States each year, creating  substantial economic benefits to the United States, and allowing the  Department of State (State) to allocate resources to visa-issuing posts in  countries with higher-risk applicant pools. However, the program also  poses inherent security, law enforcement, and illegal immigration risks to  the United States. In particular, VWP travelers are not subject to the same  degree of screening prior to their travel to the United States as travelers  with visas because they are not interviewed by a State consular officer  before arriving at a U.S. port of entry. Therefore, there is a greater risk that  some VWP travelers could exploit the program to gain entry into the  United States with the intent to violate U.S. immigration or other laws.", "Terrorist acts and plots involving citizens of VWP countries have led some  critics of the program to suggest that it be eliminated or suspended  because of the security risks it could present. In September 2007, the  Director of National Intelligence testified that Al Qaeda is recruiting  Europeans because many of them do not require a visa to enter the United  States. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and State officials have  acknowledged that the program could be eliminated or suspended in the  event of a major terrorist attack emanating from a VWP country. At the  same time, however, some proponents of the Visa Waiver Program have  called for expansion of the program. In fact, the executive branch  established in 2005 a \u201cRoad Map\u201d initiative to clarify the statutory  requirements for designation as a participating VWP member and has been  consulting with 13 countries as part of the initiative. In August 2007, the  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11  Act) established more flexible criteria for participation in the program,  and the executive branch is now considering adding several countries to  the program later this year. In order to mitigate some of the security risks  of the program while permitting program expansion, the August 2007  legislation required the implementation of an electronic travel  authorization system, which DHS has named the Electronic System for  Travel Authorization (ESTA). ESTA would require citizens from all VWP  countries intending to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver  Program to apply for and receive electronic authorization prior to  embarking on their travel to the United States. In the event that DHS  concludes, based on the ESTA application, that a traveler is ineligible to  travel under the Visa Waiver Program, or that the traveler poses a law  enforcement or security risk, ESTA authorization will be denied and the  traveler may not travel under the Visa Waiver Program. Travelers denied  ESTA authorization would need to apply for a visa if they want to travel to  the United States. DHS has announced that it intends for all visa waiver  travelers to use ESTA by mid 2009 and told us travelers from some VWP  countries could be using it by the summer of 2008.", "In order to understand the potential impact on State visa operations as a  result of significant changes to the Visa Waiver Program, such as (1)  program elimination or suspension, (2) program expansion, and (3)  implementation of ESTA, you asked us to examine how each of these  three different changes could affect the demand for visas, and how  changes in demand could affect the resources that State needs to maintain  its consular operations and the amount of visa revenue that State receives.  We did not assess the security, trade, commerce, tourism, diplomatic,  reciprocity, or other potential effects of changes to the Visa Waiver  Program.", "To address these three objectives, we analyzed DHS/U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) data on the number of travelers to the United  States from each VWP and Road Map country annually from 2001 to 2007  and reviewed State\u2019s data from 2001 to 2007 on the numbers and types of  visas issued in each VWP country as well as on the number of staff  involved in processing visas in VWP and Road Map countries. With State,  we developed costs for each Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service  national staff position. In addition, we met with officials in State\u2019s Bureau  of Consular Affairs, the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO),  and at embassies in three VWP countries\u2014Japan, France, and Spain\u2014and  in four Road Map countries\u2014South Korea, Greece, Czech Republic, and  Hungary\u2014to determine the extent of possible visa demand and staffing  and facilities needs in those countries. We chose these countries primarily  due to the size of their traveler or visa volume and their geographic  diversity. We also analyzed relevant laws regarding the program and its  requirements, and met with State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs to discuss  the fee that State charges for visa applications, what visa processing costs  the fee is intended to cover, and how much new revenue State would  generate in the event of program elimination. We also reviewed State\u2019s  Performance Plan for the Bureau of Consular Affairs to determine State\u2019s  goals and objectives regarding visa issuance, as well as any planning State  had done for these scenarios. Finally, we reviewed standards for internal  controls in the federal government, including those addressing the  importance of identifying risks to achieving program goals and planning  ways to mitigate those risks in order to continue to meet program  objectives.", "To assess the staffing and resource costs associated with each scenario,  we developed our own high-level cost estimates, using data from State,  DHS, and embassies we visited. CBP provided us with data on the number  of travelers from each VWP and Road Map country. State\u2019s Bureau of  Consular Affairs provided us with information on the number of visas  processed in VWP and Road Map countries as well as estimates on the  number of visas that could be expected to be processed by a Foreign  Service officer, the number of Foreign Service national staff that could be  expected to support Foreign Service officers, and\u2014for the elimination  scenario\u2014estimates of the number of new facilities that could be needed.  OBO provided data on the cost, type, and size of recently completed U.S.  government construction projects overseas, the costs and sizes of  overseas leased facilities used for visa processing, and estimates of  operations and maintenance costs for U.S. embassy facilities. State\u2019s  Bureau of Resource Management provided information on the costs of  Foreign Service officers and Foreign Service national staff. In addition, we  collected post-specific data on the above costs when we traveled overseas.  We determined that the data provided to us were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of the report. We prepared the cost estimates using fiscal  year 2007 constant dollars. Appendix I provides a detailed description of  our scope and methodology.", "We recognize that there could be other implications of major changes in  the program, particularly if the program were eliminated.

However, we limited  the scope of our review to the impact on visa demand, visa resources\u2014 including staffing and facilities\u2014and visa revenues. We conducted this  performance audit from May 2007 to April 2008 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

This included  short-term business and tourism visas, as well as visas for students,  temporary workers, foreign exchange visitors, and other visa types. As we  reported in July of 2007, State has had difficulty meeting growing visa  demand over the long term, which has led to operational challenges,  including long wait times. We found that, though State has attempted to  address this demand by adding and reallocating staff worldwide, even with  the increased staffing, State has not been able to keep pace with visa  demand.

At three  U.S. embassies we visited in VWP countries\u2014Japan, France, and Spain\u2014 embassy officials told us they would need hundreds of new Foreign  Service officers to perform visa interviews and adjudicate visa  applications for the millions of new visa applicants arriving at the  embassies.

However, these  officials noted, with all 27 countries, or even several of the larger VWP  countries dropped from the program, it would be impossible to meet new  demand with existing staff.

For  instance, given the potential historic level of visa demand that program  elimination could bring about and State\u2019s inadequate resources to address  this demand, State officials told us they would need to find creative  staffing and facility solutions in the short term and, moreover, may need to  make choices regarding changes in resource allocation, visa policies, and  other considerations to ensure the right balance between security and  facilitating legitimate travel. However, State has not developed a plan that  identifies its options for meeting the facility and staffing needs described  above, or how it would go about making any such changes.", "State officials at posts we visited in existing VWP countries told us they  had not been contacted by their headquarters about undertaking any  contingency planning in the event of program elimination. In addition, they  said they had not been asked for data or post thinking on the issue, or  been provided any information on how post activities, programs, or  resources might change given such a scenario. Embassy officials in all  three VWP countries we visited told us that our visit and questions had  fostered their first real consideration of what was involved in these issues.  Consular officials in these posts expressed concern to us that, in the  absence of planning for this scenario, visa operations at their posts could  be severely disrupted as existing staffing and facilities resources would be  overwhelmed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Expansion of the Visa Waiver Program Would Reduce Visa Demand, but Likely Have Limited Effect on State\u2019s Visa Costs and Resources", "paragraphs": ["Expansion of the Visa Waiver Program would reduce visa demand in Road  Map countries, but have a limited effect on the costs and resources needed  to meet the reduced demand and the amount of visa fees received.

However, visa volume is relatively small in most  of the Road Map countries. For instance, the recent visa volume in Estonia  and the Czech Republic, two countries currently being considered for  expansion, is only around 6,000 visas and 32,500 visas per year,  respectively. Even if all 13 Road Map countries were to join the program,  and if all of those countries\u2019 citizens who previously traveled with visas  were to travel to the United States without visas, the total reduction in visa  demand would be only around 710,000; more than 400,000 of this  reduction would be in South Korea alone. In addition, these posts, many of  which already issue relatively small numbers of visas, would continue to  experience some demand for tourism and business visas and continued  growth in student, long-term work, and other types of visas. Officials told  us they generally expect continued visa travel as some percentage of VWP  travelers will be rejected by ESTA and directed to apply for a visa at the  embassy. Further, consular officials told us they expect that some  travelers may choose to obtain a visa rather than travel via the Visa Waiver  Program due to the risk of being rejected by ESTA, as well as the greater  flexibility a visa offers. For instance, travelers with a 10-year visa can  choose to travel at any time during that 10-year period, and also can  decide to extend the length of their visit for longer than the 90 days  allowed under the program. In addition, consular officials in South Korea  stated that they continue to have large increases year to year in other  types of visas issued there. So, even if most demand for short-term  business and tourism visas were to decrease following acceptance into the  program, there could still be significant growth in demand for other types  of visas. Consular officials in the Road Map countries we visited stated  they expected that their visa volume in the near term would likely be  between 20 percent and 40 percent of recent numbers of travelers\u2014 between 220,000 visas and 440,000 visas. Given all of these factors that  could affect visa demand, consular management officials at locations we  visited stated that, if their posts were added to the Visa Waiver Program,  they would be reluctant in the near term to lose more than 50 percent of  their Foreign Service officers processing visas until they better understand  their new staffing needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expansion of the Visa Waiver Program Would Modestly Impact Overall Staffing Needs", "paragraphs": ["Expansion of the Visa Waiver Program would modestly impact overall  staffing needs in Road Map countries. Although consular conditions in  Road Map countries vary, consular officials in the Road Map countries we  visited expect modest reductions in their visa processing staff needs as  these countries gain acceptance to the program. For example, in the three  Road Map country posts of Athens, Prague, and Budapest, the combined  annual visa workload of around 90,000 is relatively small, and consular  management there told us that eliminating this workload would result in  only around four fewer Foreign Service officer staff among the three  countries. In the Czech Republic, where consular officials process around  32,500 visas per year, officials expect they will need only one fewer  Foreign Service officer when accepted into the program, and only two to  three fewer Foreign Service nationals. Similarly, consular officials  expected relatively modest staff reductions for South Korea, where  consular staff process around 402,000 visas per year\u2014the highest number  of U.S. visas issued among Road Map countries. If South Korea is admitted  to the program, consular officials expect to need 6 to 9 fewer Foreign  Service officers and 15 to 20 fewer Foreign Service nationals.

Moreover,  officials in State\u2019s Consular Affairs Bureau said that Foreign Service  officers no longer needed at new VWP posts will not be eliminated but  rather transferred to other posts, thereby shifting, not eliminating, costs  and revenues generated by those staff. Consular officials noted there is a  need for additional staff in other countries with large backlogs of visa  applications, such as China, India, and Mexico, and consular officials in  South Korea noted that, if the country were accepted into the program,  Foreign Service officers not needed would likely be transferred to such  posts at the end of their regular tour of duty.", "Although acceptance into the Visa Waiver Program would reduce total visa  processing costs for Road Map countries, State and embassy officials  expect increases in some short-term costs, such as severance pay to the  displaced Foreign Service national workforce and the costs of hiring new  Foreign Service national staff to support the transferred Foreign Service  officer staff at their new posts. State and embassy officials noted that  short-term costs for severance payments to displaced Foreign Service  national employees would vary depending on the laws of individual  countries. We estimate that nonrecurring costs of expanding the program  to Road Map countries would be between $3.7 million and $4.3 million\u2014 with around $3.3 million to $3.9 million to cover severance costs and  approximately $385,000 to $476,000 for the costs to hire and train  additional supporting Foreign Service nationals in the Foreign Service  officers\u2019 new locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little or No Consular Facilities Savings Anticipated as Road Map Countries Transition to the Visa Waiver Program", "paragraphs": ["Embassy officials in Road Map countries we visited did not expect dollar  savings from reduced facility usage after the countries are accepted into  the Visa Waiver Program.

DHS officials told  us that, given CBP\u2019s operational experience administering the Visa Waiver  Program as it currently exists, they currently believed that when ESTA is  fully implemented, less than 1 percent of all VWP country travelers would  be rejected by the ESTA screening. DHS officials also told us the rejection  rate could be 2 percent to 3 percent in early years, eventually tapering off  to 1 percent as the system became more established and travelers became  more acclimated to using it, while some officials said it could range as high  as 5 percent. However, DHS officials told us they can not yet determine  the rate of rejection from ESTA, because DHS has not yet decided what  databases it will use to screen names of ESTA applicants. In addition,  given ESTA\u2019s potential for causing last-minute travel disruptions, consular  staff at the posts we visited told us they believe an additional unknown  number of travelers from VWP countries would choose instead to  proactively apply for visas at embassies. For example, around 14 percent  of annual entries to the United States from VWP countries are made by  repeat travelers; one senior consular official estimated that these travelers  who visit the United States multiple times a year may prefer to travel using  a visa rather than through the program. Most officials predicted that the  percentage of travelers who choose to obtain a visa could exceed potential  ESTA rejection rates of 1 percent to 3 percent. State officials told us that  the influx of even a small percentage of current travelers in larger VWP  countries to obtain visas could significantly disrupt visa operations at U.S.  embassies. For example, if 1 percent of the United Kingdom citizens who  currently travel to the United States without visas needed to or chose to  apply for a visa, visa demand there could increase by 35,000 per year, or  around a 31 percent increase in visa workload. Further, embassy officials  in the three VWP countries we visited told us that if 3 percent of current  visa waiver travelers applied for visas, it would result in visa demand that  would overwhelm their current staffing and facilities. However, DHS  acknowledges that it does not know how many travelers may prefer to  directly seek a visa rather than participate in ESTA-approved travel, and it  acknowledges that ESTA rejection rates and the rate of voluntary visa  travelers may vary by country.", "We developed a series of estimates of ESTA\u2019s potential impact on demand  and consular staffing needs, as well as on visa fees. Though State officials  provided us with data to support these estimates, they did not provide data  on ESTA\u2019s impact on facility costs. A State official told us that predicting  ESTA\u2019s impact was very difficult, particularly for facilities, and that  developing such data for facilities would require an extensive analytical  effort involving multiple offices within State, particularly OBO, as well as  extensive management involvement\u2014and, moreover, would take a long  time. Our estimates in table 3 include scenarios where 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10  percent of travelers who currently travel under the Visa Waiver Program  come to U.S. embassies for a visa, and they take into account increases in  visa applications due to ESTA rejections as well as from travelers  choosing voluntarily to apply for visas. Further, table 3 represents  estimates of the potential increases in visa demand globally and for the  largest VWP countries, as a result of the implementation of ESTA,  assuming 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 percent of current VWP travelers went to the  embassies to apply for a visa.", "All of these scenarios would place a strain on existing embassy staffing,  particularly in larger VWP countries, while even small rates of increase in  larger VWP countries could strain consular facilities, necessitating the  construction of new facilities in some countries at potentially significant  costs, according to State and embassy officials. As noted earlier, State has  had a difficult time meeting recent staffing needs globally; State and  embassy officials told us they could find it difficult to meet staffing needs  in high-volume VWP posts in the near term if higher percentages of current  travelers come to the embassies for visas. Furthermore, while we did not  develop estimates of the number of facilities that would be needed, State  and embassy officials agreed that the costs of new facilities could  potentially be significant and that such facilities would most likely be  needed in high-traveler-volume countries where existing facilities are  more likely to become strained. Table 4 shows the impact, on all VWP  countries combined, that such increases in visa demand\u2014of 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10  percent\u2014would have on staffing needs and visa revenues; the table does  not include potentially significant facility costs. We estimate annual visa  fee revenues would increase and offset the year-to-year recurring staffing  costs. However, there would be a lag between when State would have to  fund the staffing increases in the first year and when it would receive the  offsetting increases in visa fees in the second year. Moreover, visa fee  revenues would be less than the costs for facility construction, and,  according to State, visa fee revenue is not used to offset the costs for  constructing new facilities to process visas.", "Two high-traveler-volume VWP countries we visited in particular would be  challenged to address the likely increased visa demand resulting from  ESTA. In Japan, with around 3.26 million travelers to the United States  each year, embassy officials told us that if visa demand increased by 1  percent of Japan\u2019s current VWP travelers, it would present significant  challenges for their existing staff and a workload level that could not be  sustained over the long term. An increase of 2 percent would increase visa  demand by about 70 percent over current levels; as a result, existing staff  could not meet the demand, and current facility space would become  crowded and strained to capacity. Any increase over 2 percent, embassy  officials said, would overwhelm existing staff and facilities; more staff  would be needed, and new facilities for processing visas would need to be  obtained or constructed. In France, where about 870,000 citizens travel to  the United States each year, embassy officials told us that if visa demand  increased by 1 percent of France\u2019s current VWP travelers, their existing  staff would be greatly challenged to meet the demand. They said that  existing staff could handle this increase only for a temporary period of  time without additional staff. An increase of 2 percent could not be  accommodated with existing staff, and visa waiting rooms and processing  space, which are already crowded, would be strained, embassy officials  said. However, if more staff were added, embassy officials told us the  embassy could develop creative ways to work within the existing space,  for example, by adding another shift for visa processing every day. An  increase of 3 percent, embassy officials told us, would require acquiring or  constructing a new visa processing facility.

Elimination of the Visa Waiver  Program has the potential to dramatically increase visa demand, severely  disrupting U.S. visa operations in the short term and costing billions of  dollars. And, while State would likely be able to accommodate program  expansion with minimal disruption, U.S. embassies soon will have to deal  with the impact of the ESTA requirement, which could result in a  substantial number of new travelers needing or choosing to obtain a visa,  potentially creating significant resource gaps and affecting the ability of  the United States to conduct visa operations globally. State has done  limited planning in headquarters or the field for any such changes in the  program. Given the resource and cost implications involved, it is  imperative that State work with posts to plan for imminent as well as  potential program changes. Though the likelihood of program elimination  is unknown, having a comprehensive understanding of how staffing and  facilities would be impacted will enable State to help Congress make  informed decisions on the fate of the Visa Waiver Program and to devise  broad measures to address the immense challenges that would follow  elimination of the program, should it occur.

These implications\u2014for security, tourism, commerce, business, trade,  diplomacy, and reciprocity regarding visa-free travel, for example\u2014could  potentially be significant. However, we limited the scope of our review to  the impact on visa demand, visa resources\u2014including staffing and  facilities\u2014and the associated costs and revenues.", "We undertook the following methodologies for all three of these  objectives. We analyzed relevant law regarding the program and its  requirements, and documentation, including State\u2019s most recent cost of  consular services study from 2004, and met with State\u2019s Bureau of  Consular Affairs to discuss the fee that State charges for visa applications,  what costs of processing a visa the fee is intended to cover, and how much  new revenue State would generate in the event of program elimination. To  assess the staffing and resource costs to State under these scenarios, we  developed our own high-level cost estimates, using State and Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) data. DHS/U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) provided us with data on the number of travelers from  each VWP and Road Map country. State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs  provided us with information on the number of visas processed in VWP  and Road Map countries as well as estimates on the number of visas that  could be expected to be processed by a Foreign Service officer, the  number of Foreign Service national staff that could be expected to support  Foreign Service officers, and\u2014for the elimination scenario\u2014estimates of  the number of new facilities that could be needed. State\u2019s Bureau of  Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) provided data on the cost, type, and  size of recently completed U.S. government construction projects  overseas, the costs and sizes of overseas leased facilities used for visa  processing, and estimates of operations and maintenance costs for U.S.  embassy facilities. State\u2019s Bureau of Resource Management provided  information on the costs of Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service  national staff. In addition, we collected post-specific data on the above  costs when we traveled to selected U.S. embassies. We determined that  the data provided to us were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of the  report. We met with State officials to determine the sources of the data  provided to us. For instance, State\u2019s data on the costs of putting a Foreign  Service officer overseas came from Resource Management\u2019s database of  actual expenditures, which they use to input costs and for budget  purposes. In addition, we collected data from other sources to cross-check  State data whenever possible. For instance, we collected data on the  actual costs of Foreign Service officers and Foreign Service nationals in  the specific countries we visited. Similarly, we cross-checked the costs of  facility operations and maintenance against Department of Defense  facilities pricing guide data to ensure reasonableness. Finally, the  uncertainty analysis we conducted provided us with a level of confidence  in our estimates, because we took into account and stated a range of  possible costs spanning our point estimates. This analysis provided us  with sufficient confidence for the high-level type of estimates we are  presenting. We prepared the cost estimates using fiscal year 2007 constant  dollars. For purposes of estimating State\u2019s costs, we assumed numbers of  travelers to remain constant, as State officials told us and State  documentation stated that its goal is to accommodate changes in visa  demand and avoid disruptions of travel to the United States. In addition,  we performed uncertainty analyses on cost models we developed for each  scenario, using a Monte Carlo simulation tool called Crystal Ball to analyze  the effects of varying inputs and outputs of the modeled scenarios. Monte  Carlo simulation uses a random number generator to simulate the possible  variance of designated inputs, such as estimates of the number of  additional Foreign Service officers needed in the VWP elimination  scenario, and calculates the subsequent possible ranges of the outputs.  This allowed us to try multiple hypothetical scenarios with our  spreadsheet cost model values. We used the results of these analyses to  provide a probability value for our point estimates, as well as to provide a  range of cost estimates for these scenarios. In addition to these activities,  we undertook methodologies specific to each of the three objectives,  which are described below.", "To determine how program elimination in particular would affect the  demand for visas, and how changes in demand would affect the resources  State needs and the amount of visa fee revenue that State receives, we  analyzed CBP data on the number of travelers to the United States from  each VWP country annually from 2001 to 2007, and reviewed State\u2019s data  from 2001 to 2007 on the numbers and types of visas issued in each VWP  country. We used 2001 to 2007 data from the number of travelers to the  United States from each VWP country, rather than the number of travelers  coming to the United States under the program. We did not use data on the  number of travelers coming to the United States under the program  because (1) data from 2001 to 2007 on the number of travelers coming to  the United States under the program were not available; (2) available data  from 2004 to 2007 averaged 12.5 million travelers, a difference of less than  1 percent from the 12.6 million calculated using the number of travelers to  the United States from each VWP country; and (3) we could not  independently calculate the number of travelers coming to the United  States under the program by subtracting the number of visas issued in  each country annually, because not all of those people who received visas  necessarily traveled in that year. We also reviewed data State provided on  the current number of Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service national  staff involved in visa processing in each VWP country. We analyzed  information provided by State on the number of visas that could be  expected to be processed by a Foreign Service officer and the number of  Foreign Service national staff that could be expected to support Foreign  Service officers. We also analyzed State\u2019s rough order estimates of the  number of new facilities that could be needed in the event of program  elimination. Consular Affairs projected the possible number of facilities  that could be needed based on information on the conditions of existing  consular space in these countries, as well as assumptions of the number of  people that would be seeking visas if the program were eliminated, and the  subsequent increases in Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service  national staff necessary to accommodate the new visa demand. OBO  officials said Consular Affairs\u2019s rough order estimate was generally  realistic, based on the potential increases in staffing that could be needed  in the event of program elimination and the capacity of buildings to absorb  those new staff. However, both Consular Affairs and OBO officials agreed  that it was impossible to predict the exact number of facilities that would  be needed. We met with officials in Consular Affairs, OBO, and at  embassies in three VWP countries\u2014Japan, France, and Spain\u2014to  determine the extent that embassy officials expected increases in visa  demand and the number of additional staff and facilities that would be  needed to meet those increases in those countries and to confirm  information that we had collected from State officials in Washington. We  selected U.S. embassies in Japan, France, and Spain for field work for  several reasons. First, we selected these embassies because they are in  VWP countries with high numbers of people traveling to the United States  each year. Specifically, Japan represents the VWP country with the  second-largest number of travelers to the United States each year, while  France represents the fourth-largest number, and Spain the eighth.  Further, of the countries we visited, differences in the sizes of traveler  volumes provided us with information on differences in the extent of  potential impacts among VWP posts in the event of program elimination.  Second, we selected these countries for purposes of assessing the  different potential aspects of program elimination for countries in  different regions of the world. Lastly, we selected these countries because,  in the case of France and Spain, there have been terrorist plots or attacks  in those countries in recent years, contrasting with Japan, where this has  not been the case. We met with officials in Consular Affairs and OBO and  with officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Resource Management and the Office of  Rightsizing to gain data for constructing our cost estimates on the staffing  and facilities that would be needed to support increases in visa demand in  VWP countries. Using the data provided by State and DHS, we created cost  models to estimate the costs and savings due to changes in the number of  consular and overseas buildings operations personnel; the construction,  leasing, and operations and sustainment of consular facilities; and visa  application fee revenue. For this scenario, we estimated two sets of  nonrecurring cost elements: costs for the construction of new consular  facilities, and the costs for the temporary staffing increase to manage the  construction of those facilities. Also, we estimated four sets of recurring  cost elements: costs of additional consular personnel, costs to operate and  sustain new consular facilities, costs to lease consular facilities until the  completion of new construction, and visa application fee revenue. We then  performed the uncertainty analysis described above to generate cost  estimate ranges for each of the scenarios. To determine the extent to  which State had prepared for the possibility of program elimination, we  reviewed State\u2019s Performance Plan for the Bureau of Consular Affairs to  determine State\u2019s goals and objectives regarding visa issuance, as well as  any planning that State had done. We also reviewed standards for internal  controls in the federal government, including those addressing the  importance of identifying risks to achieving program goals and planning  ways to mitigate those risks in order to continue to meet program  objectives.", "To assess how program expansion in particular would affect the demand  for visas, and how changes in demand would affect State\u2019s resource need  and the amount of visa fees that State receives, we analyzed CBP data on  the number of travelers to the United States from each Road Map country  annually from 2001 to 2007. We also reviewed data that State provided on  the number of Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service national staff  involved in visa processing in each Road Map country. We met with  officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs, OBO, and at embassies in  four Road Map countries\u2014South Korea, Greece, Czech Republic, and  Hungary\u2014to determine the extent to which embassy officials expected  decreases in visa demand, the number of staff that could potentially be  freed and any associated costs or savings, and the number of facilities, if  any, that could either be sold or where the embassy could relinquish lease  commitments. We selected U.S. embassies in these countries for several  reasons. First, these countries represent four of the seven highest visa- issuing Road Map countries. The U.S. embassy in Seoul processes by far  the most visas in the Road Map countries, while the embassies in Athens,  Prague, and Budapest, while much smaller, process among the highest  number of the remaining 12 Road Map countries. In addition, we selected  these countries for purposes of assessing the different potential aspects of  program expansion for countries in different regions of the world.  Consular Affairs provided data on the number of Foreign Service officers,  Foreign Service nationals, and visas processed in each Road Map country.  We used that data to estimate the number of Foreign Service officers that  could be moved to other posts from Road Map countries once they enter  the Visa Waiver Program, as well as the number of possible Foreign  Service national positions that could be terminated. We met with officials  in State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs, OBO, Bureau of Resource  Management, and the Office of Rightsizing to gain data for constructing  cost estimates on any costs and savings that may result regarding staffing  and facilities in Road Map countries. For the VWP expansion scenario, we  created cost models to estimate the costs and savings due to changes in  the number of consular personnel, ESTA development, initial and  recurring reviews by DHS of candidate countries\u2019 suitability for the  program, and visa application fee revenue. We reported on two sets of  nonrecurring cost elements: estimated costs for the termination and hiring  of Foreign Service nationals, and the cost of development of ESTA, as  provided by DHS. We estimated two sets of recurring cost elements: costs  of DHS\u2019s reviews of VWP countries, and visa application fee revenue. We  then performed the uncertainty analysis described above on these models  To assess how implementation of the new ESTA requirement in particular  would affect the demand for visas, and how changes in demand would  affect the resources State needs and the amount of visa fees that State  receives, we analyzed CBP data on the number of travelers to the United  States from each VWP country annually from 2001 to 2007, and reviewed  State\u2019s data from 2001 to 2007 on the numbers and types of visas issued in  each VWP country. We also reviewed data State provided on the number  of Foreign Service officer and Foreign Service national staff involved in  visa processing in each VWP country. We met with officials in Consular  Affairs and OBO and at embassies in three VWP countries\u2014Japan, France,  and Spain\u2014to determine the extent to which embassy officials expected  increases in visa demand and the number of additional staff and facilities  that could be needed to meet those increases. We selected these three  countries for our field work for similar reasons as the VWP elimination  scenario\u2014for reasons of size, geographical diversity, and recent history, or  lack thereof, of terrorist plots or attacks. We met with Consular Affairs  and OBO officials and with officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Resource  Management and the Office of Rightsizing to gain data for constructing our  cost estimates on the staffing and facilities that would be needed to  support increases in visa demand in VWP countries. We also reviewed  relevant law, including the August 2007 Implementing 9/11 Commission  Recommendations Act of 2007. For the five ESTA scenarios to  demonstrate the effects of different possible percentages of travelers  coming to U.S. embassies for visas, we created cost models to estimate the  costs and savings due to changes in the number of consular and overseas  buildings operations personnel and visa application fee revenue. We  estimated two recurring cost elements: costs of additional consular  personnel and visa application fee revenue. We then performed the  uncertainty analysis described above to generate cost estimate ranges for  each of the scenarios. To determine the extent to which State had  prepared for the effects of the implementation of ESTA, we reviewed the  fiscal year 2007 Consular Affairs Bureau Performance Plan to determine  State\u2019s goals and objectives regarding visa issuance, as well as any  planning that State had done. We also reviewed standards for internal  controls in the federal government, including those addressing the  importance of identifying risks to achieving program goals and planning  ways to mitigate those risks in order to continue to meet program  objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 to April 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

DHS has indicated that it will begin implementing ESTA in the summer  of 2008. As of May 1, 2008, State had not received data from DHS  indicating how many VWP travelers would likely not be approved for  travel by ESTA and would therefore need to obtain a visa in order to  travel to the United States. It is important that DHS provide data to  State that will help State (1) determine how ESTA will affect visa  demand and (2) formulate plans to meet the demand.  2.  Under ESTA there would be some foreign citizens whose ESTA  application would not be approved and would therefore be required to  obtain a visa, and some who would choose proactively to obtain a visa  for the increased flexibility and travel convenience that a visa could  offer. DHS and State need to develop estimates of the total possible  increase in visa demand due to both outcomes brought about by ESTA.  DHS and State have asserted that there are existing data that could be  helpful in developing these estimates. We agree. However, until DHS  determines which databases it plans to use for screening ESTA  applications, DHS officials told us they will not be able to determine  how many VWP travelers would likely not be approved for travel by  ESTA. In addition, DHS officials told us that it was unclear at this point  what testing, if any, DHS would do to determine how many foreign  citizens would choose to obtain a visa, rather than use ESTA.  3.  We believe that sharing of this type of information between DHS and  State is a first step toward implementing our recommendation that  DHS and State estimate how ESTA will affect visa demand in existing  VWP countries, but we believe much more needs to be done.  4.  We did not intend to suggest that DHS is not sharing information with  State. Our point is that DHS has not made a final decision on what  databases it will use to screen ESTA applications; as a result, neither  DHS nor State can estimate the number of VWP citizens who would  not be approved to travel under the program. Without this information,  it is difficult for State to plan for how it will meet changes in visa  demand.  5.  We do not believe that DHS should estimate the resources that State  would need to manage increased visa demand or how ESTA could  affect visa fee revenues collected by State as a result of the  implementation of ESTA. These are actions that State needs to take.", "However, State has not yet performed this analysis and planning  largely due to, according to State officials, the lack of information from  DHS on the number of foreign citizens whose ESTA application might  be rejected and might seek a visa from U.S. embassies.  6.  We agree that it is difficult to predict how many travelers would prefer  to apply for a visa instead of using ESTA. Consular officials in  Washington and overseas said that the number of travelers choosing to  do this could be significant. Some DHS, State, and embassy officials  suggested that an actual test or pilot use of ESTA in one or more  existing VWP countries could provide information on the number of  foreign citizens who choose to obtain a visa rather than use ESTA and  the number of foreign citizens whose ESTA applications are not  approved by ESTA. However, as noted previously, DHS told us it is  unclear what tests, if any, it will undertake to better understand  ESTA\u2019s impact, even though DHS stated it plans to implement ESTA in  the summer of 2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, John Brummet, Assistant  Director; J.
