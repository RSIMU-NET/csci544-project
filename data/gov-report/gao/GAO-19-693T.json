Four railroads reported reaching full implementation as of March 31, 2019, the same number in this stage at the end of 2018. However, many railroads remained in earlier stages of implementation, such as the 11 railroads that reported being in field testing.

As of March 31, 2019, 11 of the 31 host railroads that must have interoperable PTC systems reported that they had achieved interoperability with at least 1 of their tenant railroads. Collectively, 38 of the 227 unique host-tenant relationships that require interoperability have been completed (17 percent), according to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Most railroads reported to GAO that vendor and software issues were currently major or moderate challenges for PTC implementation. Over half of railroads also reported that interoperability was a major or moderate challenge, and can be complicated by software issues and coordinating host and tenant schedules, among other issues. For example, one railroad said that certain software functionality still had to be developed, tested, and implemented to address reliability issues and facilitate interoperability.", "FRA continues to provide assistance and support to railroads on PTC interoperabilty and the testing process, but workload challenges for the agency persist.

Over the years, we have periodically  reported and testified on railroads\u2019 progress implementing PTC, which  has been a complex and lengthy process, involving nearly all major rail  lines and almost every aspect of railroads\u2019 operations. Full  implementation includes but is not limited to equipment installation,  testing, interoperability, and system certification by the Federal Railroad  Administration (FRA). According to a 2018 National Transportation Safety  Board testimony, since the PTC mandate was enacted, 22 rail accidents it  investigated could have been prevented by PTC, including the December  2017 derailment of an Amtrak passenger train near DuPont, Washington,  that killed 3 passengers and injured 57 passengers and crewmembers.", "While railroads were required to implement PTC by December 31, 2018,  FRA was required under the statutory mandate to grant railroads an  extension up to December 31, 2020, if they met specific requirements and  requested an alternative schedule and sequence (i.e., an extension).  Four railroads reported that they had fully implemented PTC for all rail  operations on their own track by yearend 2018. FRA approved 36  railroads\u2019 requests for an extension. Consequently, while railroads have  installed all needed PTC equipment on locomotives and along tracks and  met some other statutory requirements, much work\u2014particularly with  respect to interoperability\u2014remains to fully implement PTC.

We analyzed the reports to  determine the extent to which each railroad has initiated different stages  of testing and different steps to achieve interoperability with other  railroads. To identify the implementation status of tenant-only railroads,  we categorized them based on the furthest stage of implementation their  host(s) railroads have reached. Based on our review of these data for  anomalies, outliers, or missing information and our previous assessment  of such quarterly reports for our March 2018 and September 2018  testimonies, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes of describing railroads\u2019 progress in PTC implementation. In  addition, we interviewed representatives from Amtrak, two freight  railroads, and five commuter railroads, selected to ensure variation in  PTC implementation status and number of tenant railroads. To describe  railroads\u2019 progress and FRA\u2019s plans to oversee PTC implementation, we  sent the 42 railroads a questionnaire to obtain information on their  implementation progress, including interoperability, as of May 31, 2019;  challenges to implementing PTC; and any guidance or assistance needed  from FRA.

These systems include the Interoperable  Electronic Train Management System (I-ETMS), the Advanced Civil  Speed Enforcement System II (ACSES), and Enhanced Automated Train  Control (E-ATC). While these PTC systems are functionally similar, the  technologies they use differ. For example, to determine a train\u2019s location,  ACSES and E-ATC rely on equipment embedded on the track while I- ETMS uses Global Positioning System information. ACSES and E-ATC  both supplement existing train control systems to provide all required PTC  functionality, while I-ETMS was designed as a new system to provide this  functionality.", "As noted above, testing is one of the many steps to achieving full  implementation.

We previously reported that these  safety plans have been up to 5,000 pages in length. Once FRA approves  a safety plan, the railroad receives system certification, which is required  for full implementation, and is then authorized to operate the PTC system  in revenue service. According to FRA officials, the FRA may impose  conditions to the PTC safety plan approval as necessary to ensure safety,  resulting in a conditional certification.", "Interoperability is achieved when the locomotives of any host railroad and  tenant railroad operating over the same track segment can successfully  communicate with and respond to the other railroad\u2019s PTC system,  allowing uninterrupted movements over property boundaries. For  example, when a locomotive enters another railroad\u2019s territory as a  tenant, it immediately needs information about the upcoming track\u2014such  as any temporary speed restrictions in place due to track work (see fig.  1).", "To achieve interoperability, railroads have to complete a series of steps  including (1) additional installation work (such as installing equipment on  a tenant railroad\u2019s locomotives) and scheduling (such as coordinating with  the relevant railroad to reach any needed agreements and identify dates  for testing), (2) laboratory testing, (3) field testing, and (4) RSD or  revenue service operations. Many railroads will complete much of the  implementation for their own PTC systems, such as starting RSD on  some or most of their track, before they begin to take steps to achieve  interoperability with other railroads. However, a railroad can take steps to  achieve interoperability with other railroads while simultaneously  completing field testing or other stages of testing on its own PTC system.", "FRA is responsible for overseeing railroads\u2019 implementation of PTC, and  the agency monitors progress and provides direct assistance to railroads  implementing PTC.

FRA also provides technical assistance to  railroads, addresses questions, and reviews and approves railroads\u2019  documentation, including test and safety plans. FRA has a national PTC  project manager, designated PTC specialists in the eight FRA regions,  and approximately a dozen engineers, test monitors, and other staff  responsible for overseeing technical aspects of implementation.

A railroad does not generally start work to achieve  interoperability with all the railroads it interoperates with at once,  according to FRA; instead a railroad will prioritize its interoperability work.  For example, representatives from one Class I railroad we interviewed  said it prioritized achieving interoperability in the following sequence: first  with commuter-railroad tenants given the need to ensure passenger  safety; second with other Class I railroads given the high total miles of  track they share; and finally with smaller Class III railroads.

As part of our ongoing work related to PTC, we  have reported that railroads have faced challenges associated with the  limited number of vendors that design PTC systems, provide the software  and hardware, and conduct testing. However, as representatives of half  of the railroads we interviewed emphasized, vendor and software issues  are more acute now because as the 2020 deadline nears, less time  remains to address these issues and associated delays. Software and vendor issues can be interrelated as a small pool of vendors develop and  update the software that supports railroads\u2019 PTC systems.  Representatives from several railroads and FRA specialists we  interviewed said that software issues routinely arise in lab testing, field  testing, and RSD that require vendor revisions before a railroad\u2019s PTC  implementation can continue. For example, representatives from one  railroad said that existing software defects affecting its PTC system must  be addressed and a new version of the software is needed before they  can start RSD. They added that they had no control over this process, as  they must rely on the vendor to provide reliable software. Representatives  from this railroad also noted that resolving software issues is often not  entirely within a railroad\u2019s control due to the need for vendor support, in  contrast to some earlier challenges leading up to the 2018 deadline,  where, for example, the railroad itself had more control as it was installing  equipment and could more clearly track progress.", "Moreover, the limited supply of vendors and high demand for services as  railroads work simultaneously to implement PTC by the 2020 deadline  continue to pose problems. For example, representatives from one  railroad said their vendor has consistently had issues meeting milestones  and delivering on its commitments. Representatives from a small railroad  said they had limited internal resources to implement PTC, making the  railroad\u2019s progress heavily reliant on its vendor. Representatives from two  other railroads and FRA officials also highlighted implementation delays  caused by recalls for some locomotive equipment, which has caused  additional work for railroads as well as the vendor. Specifically, the  equipment had to be removed, sent in for repair, and then re-installed.", "More than half of the railroads implementing PTC also responded to our  questionnaire that interoperability was a major or moderate challenge.  Railroads said that interoperability can be complicated by software issues  and coordinating host and tenant railroad schedules, when asked to  describe the biggest challenges to achieving interoperability. Fifteen railroads specifically mentioned software issues, and representatives from  several railroads noted that interoperability will require reliable software.  For example, one railroad reported that certain software functionality  remains to be developed, tested, and implemented to facilitate  interoperability and to address software reliability issues that have caused  system disruptions. Also, 14 railroads noted that scheduling time with  other railroads to begin interoperability testing can be cumbersome and  time consuming. For example, several railroads that we interviewed and  that responded to our questionnaire said that scheduling can be  complicated by whether other railroads have made enough progress on  their own PTC implementation to begin work on interoperability.", "According to FRA officials, interoperability challenges also differ across  PTC systems and geographic areas. Below, we use the Northeast  Corridor and the Chicago metropolitan area\u2014where most railroads are  implementing ACSES and I-ETMS, respectively\u2014to illustrate the  challenges faced in working to achieve interoperability.

In some cases,  railroads in the Northeast will be operating two different PTC systems  concurrently on the same track, which will add to the complexity of  interoperability, according to FRA. Examples of interoperability  challenges faced in the Northeast include:", "Software issues. PTC software presents particular challenges in the  Northeast because software is being supplied by multiple vendors and  has been developed to accommodate railroads\u2019 existing systems that  have different configurations. Therefore, according to FRA officials,  ACSES does not have a common set of requirements or  specifications. Also, even if two railroads use the same vendor for  their locomotive equipment or software, each railroad may use a  different version of software. In addition, representatives from two  railroads that operate in the Northeast told us they built different  software functionality into their PTC systems to accommodate their  own operations, so additional work is needed to resolve such  differences to achieve interoperability. In light of these software  issues, representatives from one industry association and one railroad  we interviewed said that Northeast Corridor railroads are discussing  creating a software management process to aid interoperability.", "Boundary issues. A train needs to seamlessly operate PTC when it  crosses the boundary between two railroads\u2019 territories, as previously  described. According to a rail industry association, as of June 2019,  there are about 20 boundaries on the Northeast Corridor where more  work is needed to ensure seamless operation. FRA officials and one  industry association said boundary issues are complex and time- consuming to resolve but not insurmountable. For example, FRA  officials said a railroad could install its own equipment such as  transponders and wayside devices across the boundary to create an  overlap between their system and that of the other railroad.", "Securing PTC wireless communication. FRA requires that PTC  wireless railroad communications be encrypted. However, a solution  that aims to encrypt all PTC wireless communication and data  transmittal among railroads operating ACSES in the Northeast is  currently in lab development. In August 2016, Amtrak received a grant  from FRA to create this solution for ACSES. Amtrak originally planned  to implement this solution in December 2018, but Amtrak has  experienced delays and currently estimates that it will implement the  solution by January 2020. However, Amtrak has reported several risks  that it will need to overcome to meet this implementation deadline.

The underlying problem is the memory  available on the locomotive equipment, which is needed to store its  railroad\u2019s track data, according to FRA and railroads we interviewed.  To be interoperable, the locomotive equipment also needs to store  and exchange multiple railroads\u2019 track data, causing the memory to fill  up very quickly. According to railroad representatives, memory  limitations for I-ETMS locomotive equipment prohibited railroads with  large track data files\u2014mainly the Class I freight railroads\u2014from being  able to interoperate. The vendor for this equipment has been working  on a software solution for this problem, and according to a few  railroads we interviewed, the vendor delivered an interim software  solution in March 2019 that allowed the four largest Class I railroads  to achieve interoperability. However, this software was delivered 7  months later than initially planned, and an additional software solution  is still needed to allow the locomotive equipment\u2019s memory to store  the data of all railroads operating I-ETMS, according to  representatives from two railroads and an industry association we  interviewed.", "Other technical issues. Railroads in the Chicago area conducted  modeling to help ensure that sufficient communications capacity (e.g.,  spectrum and radio capacity) would be available to support PTC  interoperability in the region. According to one industry association,  while actual PTC operations in the area are minimal right now relative  to full expected operations, railroads must continue to monitor the  communications capacity as more railroads progress with their own  PTC implementation and start to interoperate. For example, railroads  may have to re-engineer their radio networks, such as re-routing  certain communications through different radio towers and other  network connections, if issues are subsequently identified.", "Scheduling interoperability work with other railroads. Within the  Chicago area, the total number of railroads and the number of  railroads that have to be interoperable on a single line complicates  interoperability. Chicago is the busiest rail hub in North America and  handles one-fourth of the nation\u2019s freight rail traffic. Nearly 500 freight  trains and over 700 passenger trains travel through the area on tracks  owned by several different railroads every day. For example, one  commuter railroad, for one of its lines, operates over track owned by  four host railroads that alternates with its own track. Achieving  interoperability for this line will involve sequencing and scheduling  with multiple railroads to activate PTC along the entire line, including  across the numerous boundaries between different railroads\u2019  territories, according to representatives from that railroad. According  to one FRA specialist, work to achieve interoperability in the Chicago  area will ramp up in late 2019 or early 2020.

FRA held two similar  sessions in February and June 2019. Representatives from most of the  railroads we interviewed (six of eight) said they have been happy with the  communication with FRA, via these sessions as well as regular meetings  with FRA\u2019s PTC field specialists and other staff. For example,  representatives of two railroads said it was helpful to have the FRA  Administrator attend the sessions with railroads and talk directly to  railroad representatives.

Moreover, unlike the 2018 deadline, no additional extensions  are available beyond December 2020. In March 2018, we  recommended that FRA develop an approach to use the information it  gathers on railroads\u2019 PTC implementation progress to prioritize the  allocation of resources to address the greatest risk. FRA agreed with  this recommendation, and while FRA officials have described testing and  interoperability as areas of focus in 2018 and 2019, they have not  articulated or demonstrated how, within these broad areas, they are  monitoring risk and prioritizing resources. For instance, FRA plans to  meet with all 72 tenant railroads in over 30 meetings rather than use the  data it collects from host railroads to target this outreach. In addition,  while FRA will have to review dozens of new and resubmitted safety  plans in the coming months, FRA officials have not identified how they will  prioritize these reviews relative to other reviews (e.g., other  documentation that railroads submit as they continue testing on their own  systems and for interoperability).", "According to FRA, it has communicated to railroads in industry-wide  meetings that conditional certification for a PTC system is generally  sufficient to meet the statutory requirement for full implementation; FRA  noted this would only not be sufficient if a railroad\u2019s PTC system did not  otherwise meet the technical requirements in regulations and one or more  of the conditions related to such non-compliance. However,  representatives from two railroads we interviewed also said it was unclear  whether conditional certification would be enough for a railroad to comply  with the 2020 deadline, and uncertainty remains about which conditions  must be addressed to meet the statutory requirement for full  implementation.", "Related to system certification, representatives from three railroads and  one industry association we interviewed also said FRA still needed to  clarify how it would handle situations where a host or tenant railroad is not  fully implemented by the 2020 deadline. Although the FRA Administrator  has publicly said he will enforce the implementation deadline (which is  December 31, 2020, for most railroads) and recommend assessing the  maximum civil penalty against a railroad that did not meet its deadline,  FRA has not clarified if this would apply in situations where a host or  tenant relationship affects another railroad\u2019s implementation. We continue  to see value in FRA developing a risk-based approach to allocating its  limited resources and will continue to monitor FRA\u2019s actions on this  recommendation.", "Going forward, FRA will also need to transition to overseeing PTC as a  routine part of railroad operations after the 2020 deadline. Similarly,  railroads will need to transition from implementation\u2014largely done by  contractors\u2014to operating and maintaining their own PTC systems.  Several railroads, in response to our questionnaire, said that they  anticipate difficulties funding ongoing operations and maintenance as well  as managing software and other updates. Therefore, December 31, 2020,  represents not only the deadline for full PTC implementation but also a  point after which railroads and FRA will face a new operational and  oversight environment.", "Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and Members of the  Committee, this concludes my prepared statement.
