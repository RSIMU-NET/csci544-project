This requirement was expanded in Interior\u2019s fiscal year 1990 appropriations act, which provided for an independent certification that the reconciliation was as complete as possible. Until BIA undertook the trust fund account reconciliations in May 1991, the accounts\u2014some of which were 50 to 100 years old\u2014had never been reconciled. The reconciliation process was brought to a close during the fall of 1995, and, in January 1996, a report was issued to each tribe on the results associated with its accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In response to tribes\u2019 concerns that BIA had not consistently provided them with statements on their account balances, that their trust fund accounts had never been reconciled, and that BIA planned to contract with a third party for management of trust fund accounts, the Congress established the requirement in the Interior Department\u2019s fiscal year 1987 supplemental appropriations act that BIA reconcile trust fund accounts before they could be transferred to a third party. In Interior\u2019s fiscal year 1990 appropriations act, the Congress required that BIA reconcile the accounts to the earliest possible date. In a March 1990 decision interpreting this requirement, we concluded that \u201cCongress\u2019s evident purpose is to obtain, to the greatest extent possible, reliable baseline balances in the various accounts.\u201d", "In 1990, BIA decided to address the legislative requirement that it reconcile trust fund accounts by contracting for a reconstruction of historical transactions, to ensure that tribal and individual accounts were reconciled as accurately as possible back to the earliest possible date based on available records. In May 1991, BIA awarded a reconciliation contract valued at $12 million over a 5-year period to a major independent public accounting firm. Following a preliminary assessment of the feasibility of reconciling accounts to the earliest date possible, BIA\u2019s reconciliation contractor reported in March 1992 that records were available to research tribal accounts for fiscal years 1973 through 1992. BIA\u2019s contractor also reported that due to the level of effort and associated cost and the potential for missing documentation, it was not feasible to reconcile Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts for individual Indians. In addition, BIA determined that its contractor should use alternative procedures, rather than specific transaction testing, to verify tribal account balances where insufficient documents were available to reconstruct the accounting or where more efficient approaches were identified.", "In addition to requiring that the accounts be reconciled to the earliest possible date, Interior\u2019s fiscal year 1990 appropriations act required an independent certification that the reconciliation resulted in the most complete reconciliation possible. In September 1993, BIA awarded a certification contract for $1.2 million to another major independent accounting firm to verify that the reconciliation procedures were performed in accordance with the reconciliation contract. BIA terminated the certification contract as of November 30, 1995. As of February 14, 1996, BIA had obligated over $21 million for the 5-year reconciliation effort, including $18.3 million for reconciliation work and $2.8 million for certification work.", "The American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994 required the Secretary of the Interior to provide tribes with reconciled account statements as of September 30, 1995. To meet this requirement, BIA included reconciled account statements, which it prepared for fiscal years 1993 through 1995, in the reconciliation report package for each tribe. The act also requires the Secretary of the Interior to report to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the House Committee on Resources by May 31, 1996, (1) methodologies used to reconcile the accounts, (2) whether tribes accept or dispute their reconciled account balances, and (3) how the Secretary plans to resolve any disputes.", "BIA\u2019s Office of Trust Funds Management (OTFM) was responsible for carrying out the reconciliation and certification effort.

The balances in the trust fund accounts have accumulated primarily from payments of claims; oil, gas, and coal royalties; land use agreements; and investment income.

However, due to missing records, the contractor was not able to verify 32,901 of these transactions totaling $2.4 billion (gross). In addition, BIA was not able to determine the total amount of receipts and disbursements that should have been recorded and had no reconciliation procedure to address the completeness of the accounting records.", "BIA\u2019s contractor also specifically tested $21.3 billion, or 16 percent, of the investment transactions. According to BIA\u2019s Reconciliation Project Manager, in order to achieve efficiencies, BIA decided to verify investment activity by asking its contractor to perform alternative procedures to review interest yields. BIA performed related procedures to reconcile investment system balances and BIA\u2019s contractor identified deposit lag times (for information purposes only) on collections. However, the completeness of these procedures was also impacted by missing records.", "BIA\u2019s contractor reconciled 692 leases with collections greater than $25,000 and collections for 227 months for 213 timber sales contracts for certain tribes. BIA\u2019s contractor reported that $601 million, or 99 percent, of lease receipts tested were verified. However, this represented only 10.7 percent of the leases originally identified for testing. Because BIA did not know the universe of leases, it could not determine total lease revenue expected to be collected during a given period and, therefore, it could not reliably determine the percent of lease revenue that had been tested.", "Further, not all of the reconciliation procedures specified in BIA\u2019s reconciliation contract were performed and others could not be completed due to missing records, the lack of an audit trail through BIA\u2019s systems, and time and cost constraints. For example, BIA did not reconcile its subsidiary system to its general ledger and BIA could not complete the reconciliation of its Finance System (general ledger) transactions to Treasury records. Also, as stated earlier, because of the cost and level of effort and the potential lack of supporting documents, reconciliations of about 300,000 individual Indian accounts were not performed and no alternative procedures were developed.

We suggested that the usefulness of their report could be increased by clarifying technical terms so that the report would be more understandable to nonaccountants. We also suggested that BIA identify methodological changes addressed in contract modifications and issue papers and disclose scope limitations as part of the reconciliation report package. BIA\u2019s reconciliation contractor clarified technical language in the agreed-upon procedures report and stated the scope of the work performed. However, BIA did not disclose in the report package to tribes the procedures specified in the reconciliation contract which were not performed or could not be completed and the reasons. In addition, for the procedures which were performed, BIA did not fully disclose scope limitations or changes in methodologies, such as accounts and time periods that were not covered and alternative source documents used. While some scope limitations were discussed at the February 1996 National Meeting with tribes, BIA did not explain all methodological changes resulting from contract modifications and issue papers.", "BIA modified the reconciliation contract 29 times and approved approximately 140 issue papers\u2014including about 90 which addressed changes in tribal reconciliation scope and procedures. For example, issue papers determined that certain adjustments relating to transfers would be reflected as of their general ledger posting date rather than the date that the original transaction occurred. Using the general ledger posting date instead of the transaction date could impact tribal interest calculations. Other issue papers determined that certain procedures could not be performed for specific tribes due to missing records.", "We suggested that substantial changes in the scope or procedures as a result of contract modifications and issue papers be explained in the report package transmitted to the tribes. BIA considered providing issue papers to tribes on compact disk.

The reports included summary results for all tribes and specific results on each tribe\u2019s accounts. In addition, on March 8, 1996, OTFM issued reports to 112 tribes on their portions of multitribe judgment awards. These judgment awards resulted from claims against the federal government.

After the certification contract was awarded in September 1993, congressional committees and several tribes expressed concern about the objective of BIA\u2019s certification contract because BIA limited the scope of the certification contract to ensure only that the reconciliation effort was performed in accordance with the reconciliation contract. During the summer of 1995, Interior, OTFM, OMB, and the reconciliation and certification contractors\u2019 staff worked on modifying the certification contract to attempt to more fully explain each of the reconciliation procedures that the certification contractor was to verify.", "To meet the act\u2019s certification requirement, we suggested that the certification contract focus on the extent to which the reconciliation procedures resulted in as complete an accounting as possible. Interior and OTFM officials told us that they believed that the reconciliation procedures, as designed, provided reasonable assurance that the account balances were accurate and that contractor certification on this point was not needed. Therefore, the certification contract focused on verifying that the reconciliation procedures specified in the reconciliation contract had been performed and no independent assessment of completeness was required.", "In October 1995, the certification contractor estimated that it would require an additional 6 months and $1.2 million to complete the certification work. According to OTFM\u2019s Reconciliation Project Manager, only $600,000 was available to cover the additional work and it was not clear that the work could be completed in 6 months. As a result, Interior and BIA decided to terminate the certification effort as of November 30, 1995, and to obtain a status report from the contractor.", "Because the contract was terminated, BIA\u2019s certification contractor did not complete its verification that the procedures in the reconciliation contract and related issue papers were performed. The certification contractor issued a status letter on November 30, 1995, which communicated the certification contract scope, methodologies, and preliminary results of 30 segments of the reconciliation work, including specific transaction testing, investment analyses, systems reconciliations, and pilot tribe reconciliation work.

At the meeting, OTFM and reconciliation contractor officials summarized the reconciliation results and answered tribes\u2019 questions. Tribes raised questions about the (1) adequacy of the objectives and the scope of the reconciliation project, (2) effect of missing documents on the accuracy of the reconciled account balances, and (3) thoroughness of procedures used for testing the accuracy of recorded investment interest income.", "Also, tribal representatives said they were concerned that the reconciliation procedures did not provide the same level of assurance as an audit, that BIA rather than the reconciliation contractor had performed some portions of the reconciliation, and that the number of missing records further limited the assurance provided by the reconciliation results. In addition, tribal representatives said that the investment analyses did not reflect uninvested funds associated with deposit lag times. They were concerned that unearned interest associated with deposit lag times between BIA\u2019s receipt of funds and its deposit of the funds in a Treasury-designated federal depository bank could be significant.", "The Reconciliation Project Manager explained that while an audit could not be performed due to the number of missing records, the reconciliation contractor performed agreed-upon procedures to attempt to verify account balances. He said that the results of the procedures performed were presented in the auditor\u2019s agreed-upon procedures report to each tribe, which was prepared in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards. OTFM\u2019s Director said that OTFM will consider having an independent review of the reconciliation work that BIA performed.", "The Reconciliation Project Manager explained that the investment analysis was a review of actual investment earnings and, therefore, it did not consider the effect of undeposited receipts or whether the funds earned maximum interest for secured investments. He also explained that for the pro forma analysis, interest was calculated at the Benchmark rate for \u201cuninvested funds\u201d in BIA\u2019s cash pool that earned interest at the Treasury overnight rate and comparisons were presented in the tribes\u2019 reports for information purposes.", "The Reconciliation Project Manager also said that while many actual collection dates to identify the extent of the deposit lag times were not known, tribes could estimate interest amounts for the deposit lag times by using the information provided in their reconciliation reports. In October and November 1990, during discussions between ITMA and BIA on the reconciliation procedures to be performed, ITMA requested that the reconciliation contract identify deposit lag times because it believed that related unearned interest could be significant. BIA agreed to identify the lag times as a reconciliation procedure; however, BIA did not agree to propose adjustments to pay the lost interest. Because the law requires the Secretary of the Interior to invest and pay interest on tribal funds, ITMA stated that if BIA did not propose interest adjustments related to the deposit lag times, this information should be available for settlement negotiations. According to the Reconciliation Project Manager, the deposit lag times provided in the reconciliation reports can be used by tribes in any settlement discussions with the government.", "Tribes stated that they would need significant time to review their reconciliation reports and the supporting documents. OTFM\u2019s Reconciliation Project Manager said that tribes could meet BIA\u2019s April 19, 1996, time frame for submitting acknowledgement forms to BIA on their response to the reconciliation results by indicating on that form their need for more time to review their reports. According to the Reconciliation Project Manager, BIA had anticipated that tribes may need more time to review their reconciliation reports. As a result, BIA\u2019s acknowledgement forms ask tribes to indicate (1) the need for additional time to review the reported results and account statements, (2) the account balances they accept as reconciled, and (3) the account balances they dispute.", "According to the Reconciliation Project Manager, OTFM had received acknowledgement forms as of April 16, 1996, from 21 of the 269 tribes that had received a report on their reconciliation results. Of these acknowledgements, 12 tribes indicated that they needed more time, 8 tribes requested individual meetings, and 1 tribe accepted the account balances as reconciled. The Reconciliation Project Manager told us that if a tribe accepts the reconciled account balances as correct before it attends a regional meeting, OTFM will follow up to ensure that the tribe\u2019s response reflected a clear understanding of the reconciliation reports and results.

However, BIA\u2019s reconciliation contractor was not able to complete the fiscal years 1990 and 1991 Finance System reconciliations in time to include them in the January 1996 report package due to differences in the way that BIA and Treasury summarize the tribal trust account activity, which made the reconciliation between their systems difficult. For example, BIA\u2019s SF-224, Statement of Transactions Report to Treasury, did not provide sufficient detail to distinguish tribal accounts from other fund accounts. As a result, tremendous effort was needed to reconstruct tribal account transactions from the source documents for fiscal years prior to 1992.
