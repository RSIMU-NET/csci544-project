As shown in the figure below, the program substantially met best practices for ensuring the estimate was comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible.", "The B61-12 LEP's program cost estimate differs from an estimate prepared by another NNSA office independent of the program primarily because the program used different methods and assumptions than the independent office. The program developed its estimate by compiling cost and schedule estimates for activities at each of the NNSA contractor sites participating in the LEP. In contrast, the independent office evaluated program activities completed to date and applied a historical model to estimate costs and durations for remaining activities. NNSA management met with officials from both offices to reconcile the estimates but did not document the rationale for adopting the program estimate unchanged. GAO recommended in a January 2018 report that NNSA document and justify such decisions, in part because GAO's prior work has shown that independent cost estimates historically are higher than programs' cost estimates because the team conducting the independent estimate is more objective and less prone to accept optimistic assumptions. In response to the January 2018 report, NNSA agreed to establish a protocol to document management decisions on significant variances between program and independent cost estimates, but it has not yet provided evidence that it has done so.", "NNSA and the Department of Defense (DOD) have identified and are managing risks that could complicate efforts to meet the LEP's fiscal year 2025 completion date.

Critical  components of these bombs are approaching the end of their operational  lives. To maintain the safety, security, and effectiveness of B61 bombs,  the Department of Energy\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA) and DOD are undertaking a life extension program (LEP) that will  result in a bomb known as the B61-12.

Most  recently, in February 2016, we reported positive steps, including that the  program had become the first LEP to develop and use an earned value  management system to monitor cost and schedule performance and that  it had developed a database to help monitor and manage program risks,  such as risks related to component design and procurement of parts.  Moreover, we found that the B61-12 LEP is the first NNSA defense  program to issue a cost estimate that integrates all participating NNSA  sites\u2019 costs into a single program cost estimate. In past LEPs, according  to an NNSA official, NNSA had not integrated its individual  site  contractors\u2019 cost estimates, which contributed to program costs being  underestimated. These improvements notwithstanding, we also reported  in February 2016 that the estimated cost and schedule of the B61-12 LEP  had changed significantly since the LEP\u2019s inception. Specifically, we  found that the cost estimate for the program had increased from an initial  rough estimate of about $4 billion at the time of our May 2011 report on  the LEP to about $8.9 billion at the time of our February 2016 report; the  latter estimate included about $7.3 billion for NNSA\u2019s portion of the work  and $1.6 billion for DOD\u2019s portion, which is separately funded. In October  2016, NNSA formalized its cost estimate in a classified baseline cost  report for the LEP at a higher figure of about $7.6 billion. The baseline  cost report also established an estimated program completion date of  fiscal year 2025. Concurrently with the development of the baseline cost  report, NNSA\u2019s Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation  completed an independent cost estimate for the program. The  independent cost estimate projected a higher cost of about $10 billion and  a later completion date of fiscal year 2027 for NNSA\u2019s work on the B61-12  LEP.", "Senate Report 113-44, accompanying S. 1197, a bill for the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, included a provision for  us to examine key elements of the B61-12 LEP and periodically review  the program as it passes through the phases of the process under which  NNSA and DOD jointly manage LEPs.

Specifically, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s October  2016 baseline cost report, which is the report through which NNSA  formally established its cost estimate for the B61-12 LEP. We also  reviewed documentation that NNSA site contractors participating in the  LEP provided to the B61-12 program office to assist it in compiling the  baseline cost report. This documentation included documents that  established the bases and assumptions for site contractors\u2019 contributions  to the cost estimate, documents that established the contractors\u2019 work  breakdown structures, and presentations on contractors\u2019 cost estimating  models. In addition, we visited and interviewed federal officials and  contractors at the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas; the Kansas City  National Security Campus in Kansas City, Missouri; and the B61-12  program office in Albuquerque,  New Mexico, where we also interviewed  contractors from Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. We  selected these sites because they are responsible for a range of design  and production activities being undertaken in the program. During these  site visits, we interviewed officials and contractors to discuss their cost  estimating methods, and we viewed classified and unclassified systems  and documents used in compiling the baseline cost report. GAO cost  estimation specialists then assessed this information against the best  practices for cost estimating found in GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide, which  GAO developed to establish a consistent methodology that can be used  across the federal government to develop, manage, and evaluate capital  program cost estimates.

In August 2017, NNSA issued a study documenting  lessons learned from difficulties it encountered in managing the W76-1  LEP. According to the study, prior to the W76-1 LEP, NNSA had not  undertaken full-scale weapon system design activities since the 1982  design of the W88 warhead. Among other findings, the lessons learned  study stressed the importance of using modern tools to validate and  manage an LEP\u2019s system and technical requirements to maintain cost,  schedule, and performance during all phases of the program. This finding  is consistent with our March 2009 findings that NNSA and DOD  established an unrealistic schedule for the W76-1 LEP, did not establish a  consistent cost baseline, and did not effectively manage technical risks in  the program. These problems resulted in delays, additional  expenditures, and difficulties tracking the cost of the program. Notably,  the program had to delay first production of the W76-1 from September  2007 to September 2008 when it encountered problems with the final test  batch of a key material, known as Fogbank.

The clearly defined  work breakdown structure also helped the B61-12 program office  manage the process of integrating each site contractor\u2019s estimate for  the cost of its activities into the overall program estimate. To more  fully incorporate the criteria for a comprehensive cost estimate, the  program would have had to take additional steps, such as including  the full life-cycle costs associated with the B61-12 weapon in the  estimate. Specifically, the estimate would have had to include costs  such as program costs incurred prior to phase 6.3, the cost of NNSA  federal program office personnel, components that are being shared  by different nuclear weapon programs (such as the weapon\u2019s radar),  and costs associated with maintenance of the B61-12 after the LEP  ends and the weapon enters the stockpile. In addition, the estimate  would have had to include an assessment of how the program would  be affected if key assumptions, such as the timing of the delivery of  the tail kit guidance assembly, did not hold true.

Use of such sources is consistent with the best  practice of grounding the estimates in a historical record of cost  estimating and actual experiences on other comparable programs. In  addition, the federal program office routinely reviews contract  performance reports from each of the B61-12 sites to track variances  between estimated and actual costs on a monthly basis. To more fully  incorporate the criteria for an accurate cost estimate, the program  would have had to use site estimates that were calculated in base- year dollars and then uniformly adjusted for inflation at the program  level, and clearly defined the method it used to determine inflation  indexes. Instead, all of the site contractors developed their cost  estimates in then-year dollars and applied varied inflation indexes.  Nevertheless, the program incorporated practices that substantially  met the criteria for an accurate cost estimate, which we believe  contributed to the program\u2019s estimate being reliable.", "Credible: Substantially met. The B61-12 LEP became the first LEP  to undergo a statutorily required independent cost estimate,  conducted by the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation.  Additionally,  a different NNSA office developed a third cost estimate  for the program to aid in the preparation of NNSA\u2019s budget materials.  Each of these three estimates used a different methodology. NNSA  used this third estimate to cross-check overall program costs.  Moreover, to assess risk and uncertainty in the program, most of the  site estimates we reviewed included a detailed, quantifiable risk  assessment for their portion of the overall program estimate. To more  fully incorporate the criteria for a credible cost estimate, the program\u2019s  sensitivity analysis would have had to more fully examine and  document cost impacts for the overall estimate and the individual site  estimates. Instead, according to NNSA officials, it focused primarily  on schedule and critical path analysis. Moreover, to more fully  incorporate the criteria for a credible cost estimate, the program would  have had to address risk correlation and the calculation of confidence  levels differently. In the program\u2019s analysis of risks and uncertainties  in the program, we found the program inconsistently examined  correlation among program risks. Specifically, according to NNSA  officials, to arrive at the 70 percent confidence level for the overall  program cost estimate, the program office added site-level cost  estimates together at the 50 percent and 70 percent confidence  levels. As noted in our cost guide, adding risk results for the  underlying estimates in this way results in an incorrect confidence  level for the overall estimate.

Once a program has developed a point estimate, the  program should compare it to an independent cost estimate, which gives  an objective measure of whether the program\u2019s point estimate is  reasonable.

According to B61-12 program officials, the program generally  developed its point estimate by using a \u201cbottom-up\u201d method formally  known as the \u201cengineering build-up\u201d cost estimating method. In using this  method, a program subdivides the work necessary to accomplish its  objectives into a work breakdown structure. The program then develops  estimates of costs at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure,  one piece at a time, and uses the sum of the pieces to form the overall  estimate. To develop its cost estimate, the B61-12 program office  required all participating NNSA site contractors to prepare and submit  their own cost estimates for the work to be performed on the LEP and  provided instructions on what data to provide to the program office. For  example, these instructions specified that all sites must apply a bottom-up  estimating approach that includes detailed quantities and integrated  resource-loaded schedules for all work breakdown structure elements  under their management. The program office then compiled the site- provided information in a database to arrive at a total program cost. The  program office also aggregated schedule information from the sites,  which maintain detailed resource-loaded integrated site schedules, to  develop an NNSA Integrated Master Schedule. As we previously noted,  the program office estimated in October 2016, based on this process, that  NNSA\u2019s portion of work on the B61-12 LEP would cost $7.6 billion and  that the LEP would be completed in fiscal year 2025, with a first  production unit date of March 2020.", "In contrast, to develop the independent cost estimate, the Office of Cost  Estimating and Program Evaluation used an estimating method that  employed data on the B61-12 LEP\u2019s actual performance, coupled with  historical information from the W76-1 LEP for stages of the phase 6.X  process that the B61-12 LEP had not yet reached. Specifically, the office  gathered data on 1,600 activities in the NNSA Integrated Master  Schedule for the LEP. The office tracked these 1,600 activities from  August 2014 through March 2016 by evaluating data from successive  versions of the NNSA Integrated  Master Schedule, which the B61-12  program office updates monthly based on actual program performance to  date. In a memo summarizing the office\u2019s independent cost estimate, the  office stated that the program\u2019s task completion rate lagged the baseline plan. The office concluded that the LEP\u2019s first production unit date would  occur 2 years after the March 2020 target date unless the program took  measures to reduce the LEP\u2019s scope by removing tasks, delaying  activities until after the first production unit date, or relaxing requirements  to accommodate less mature components than originally planned. The  office also concluded, based on the program\u2019s spending rate of  approximately $45 million per month, that pre-first production unit costs  would increase by about $1 billion over the program\u2019s estimate. To  estimate the cost and schedule of the program after the first production  unit date, the office used both B61-12 LEP actuals and historical  information from the W76-1 LEP, comparing W76-1 funding levels to B61- 12 spending levels. On the basis of its analysis, the office concluded that  full-scale production of the B61-12 would cost approximately $1 billion  more than the program office estimated. All told, the independent cost  estimate projected that the B61-12 LEP would cost approximately $10.0  billion and take about 2 years longer\u2014with a projected completion date in  fiscal year 2027\u2014barring changes to the program\u2019s scope.", "The B61-12 program office and the Office of Cost Estimating and  Program Evaluation also have differences of opinion regarding the  continued validity of the August 2014 schedule performance data and its  relevance to the independent cost estimate. According to B61-12 program  officials, the information in the NNSA Integrated Master Schedule  improved and changed after the Office of Cost Estimating and Program  Evaluation gathered initial schedule performance data in August 2014  and used this information as a starting point to evaluate the program\u2019s  performance. These issues include the following:", "The officials described the data available to the Office of Cost  Estimating and Program Evaluation in August 2014 as tentative,  saying that the program can now use the NNSA Integrated Master  Schedule to track performance at a more detailed level.", "According to B61-12 program officials, the program made important  decisions that affected components on the program schedule\u2019s critical  path at the time the August 2014 schedule performance data were  gathered. Subsequent to establishing the baseline, for example, the  program office restructured the path to first production unit for high- explosives components, correcting errors that had been captured in  the August 2014 data and changing to a more streamlined approach  to qualify high-explosives components from legacy material. This  decision affected the program\u2019s critical path to first production unit,  moving the completion date earlier.", "The program undertook schedule recovery efforts that eased  schedule constraints affecting other program elements that were on  the critical path at the time of the August 2014 data.", "As a result of these factors, B61-12 program officials said that the entire  baseline schedule that the Office of Cost Estimating and Program  Evaluation analyzed appeared more problematic than the updated  schedule and that the entirety of the independent cost estimate was  thrown off by the obsolete August 2014 data.", "Officials from the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation told  us they disagree with the B61-12 program office\u2019s assessment of the  independent cost estimate schedule analysis. These officials said that  they understand that the schedule baseline is continuously changing but  that the independent cost estimate schedule analysis is not dependent on  a particular baseline. Rather, they said that the analysis is based on  actual schedule performance for the 1,600 activities that represent the  scope required to achieve the design maturity and that the program office  specified in August 2014 as needed to reach the first production unit  (phase 6.5) milestone.", "Officials from the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation said  that although they will not formally assess the B61-12 LEP\u2019s schedule  again until the end of phase 6.4 of the program, their informal analysis of  NNSA Integrated Master Schedule data as of February 2017 still showed  the same rate of activity completion that underpinned the office\u2019s  independent cost estimate. At some point, according to these officials, the  program will have to double or even triple its rate of activity completion to  finish the LEP on schedule, which will increase cost. In contrast, B61-12  program officials stated that, given the improved quality of the program\u2019s  integrated master schedule data, they expect that the independent cost  estimate that the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation  prepares at the end of phase 6.4 of the LEP will be closer to the  program\u2019s estimate than to the October 2016 independent cost estimate.", "Program officials also said that the program\u2019s performance to date  supports their position that the program cost estimate is accurate.", "The positions of the two offices also differ regarding the B61-12  program\u2019s ability to accelerate work in the production stages of the LEP to  ensure that the LEP meets its completion date. B61-12 program officials  stated that they have options other than to complete tasks sequentially  and at a steady rate, so they do not expect the \u201cstraight-line\u201d level of  productivity assumed in the independent cost estimate analysis to occur.  For example, some parts do not have to be built in a particular sequence.  Instead, program officials said, the production agencies can build different  lots of components when they are ready, so technologies that are ready  earlier than others can be moved to production in the war reserve lot  while other components remain in earlier stages. They also said that the  program would not maintain an even spending rate of $45 million per  month, as suggested in the independent cost estimate. Rather, they  noted, the program\u2019s spending rate is currently $55 million a month, and  the program plans for it to rise to $65 million per month as the current  production engineering phase of the LEP draws to a close and the  production agencies accelerate their activities. These factors  notwithstanding, one Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation  official observed that activities in the later stages of an LEP remain  complex and carry risks. The official cited the history of the challenges  that led to the delay of first production of the W76-1, cited earlier in this  report, and said that the B61-12 program faces the added challenges of  having to integrate with several delivery aircraft and of having more  electronic components than the W76-1. As noted in our cost estimating guide, studies have shown limited opportunity for getting a delayed  program back on track after it is more than 15 percent to 20 percent  complete."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Officials Met to Reconcile the Program\u2019s Cost Estimate and the Independent Cost Estimate but Did Not Document the Rationale for Adopting the Program\u2019s Estimate Unchanged", "paragraphs": ["Cost estimating best practices specify that a program cost estimate and  an independent cost estimate should be reconciled and that differences  between them should be examined and discussed to achieve  understanding of overall program risk. Officials from NNSA, including  from the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation and the B61- 12 program office, told us that they held several discussions in 2016  regarding the differences between the program estimate and the  independent cost estimate. These included a meeting with the second- highest ranking official in NNSA\u2014the principal deputy administrator\u2014 during which the respective offices presented their estimates and  explained the methods used to produce them. After these meetings, the  principal deputy administrator and the NNSA Administrator agreed to  approve the program estimate unchanged.", "According to B61-12 program officials, the program adapted some of its  practices as a result of their interactions with the Office of Cost Estimating  and Program Evaluation. For example, officials said that they changed  the program\u2019s procedure for baseline changes to ensure consistency  across the participating sites. The program also began to conduct  baseline execution index analyses, as the Office of Cost Estimating and  Program Evaluation recommended. Baseline execution index analyses  track a program\u2019s execution of tasks to date by monitoring the percentage  of activities that a program has completed early or on time and that have  a baseline for completion within the month the analysis is conducted.  According to program officials, similar to a schedule performance index in  an earned value management system, the baseline execution index gives  an alternate cumulative measure that gives a program an opportunity to  improve as it proceeds.", "However, B61-12 program officials said that they did not document the  rationale for adopting the program cost estimate without making changes  informed by the independent cost estimate. They told us that any attempt  to combine the results of the two estimates would have been difficult,  considering the significant differences between the program\u2019s cost  estimating model and the Office of Cost Estimating and Program  Evaluation\u2019s model. We recommended in a January 2018 report that  NNSA should establish a requirement for its management to document  and justify key decisions based on a reconciliation of LEP cost estimates  with the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation\u2019s independent  cost estimates. We concluded in the report that without a requirement  for its management to document and justify key decisions based on a  reconciliation of program cost estimates with the Office of Cost Estimating  and Program Evaluation\u2019s independent cost estimates, NNSA may not  have assurance that the independent cost estimates are being  appropriately incorporated into the LEP decision-making process,  potentially decreasing the reliability  of program cost estimates. Our prior  work has shown that, in general, because the independent cost estimate  team is outside the acquisition chain, is not associated with the program,  and has nothing at stake with regard to program outcome or funding  decisions, its estimate is usually considered more accurate than the  program\u2019s internal estimate. In addition, our prior work has shown that  independent cost estimates are historically higher than program office  cost estimates because the team conducting the independent cost  estimate is more objective and less prone to accept optimistic  assumptions. However, we have also found that because independent  cost estimates are typically higher than program office cost estimates, in  some cases management may choose to ignore them because the  estimates are too high. NNSA agreed with our January 2018  recommendation, stating that by March 2018, it would establish a protocol  to document management decisions regarding significant variances  between LEP cost estimates and the independent cost estimates  produced by the Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation.  However, NNSA has not provided evidence that it has done so.

According  to program officials and the Program Joint Risk Management Plan, this  process calls for each program element in NNSA or the Air Force to be  responsible for identifying and managing risks at the lowest level  possible. After the program element reviews and documents a risk, it then  reviews the risk to determine its applicability to be considered a joint  risk\u2014that is, a risk that has the potential to affect any of the top-level  program milestones or the program\u2019s ability to successfully meet system  performance requirements.

NNSA and DOD program officials said that the program\u2019s risk  management process has resulted in the resolution of about three- quarters of the identified high risks on the joint risk list.

Program officials said that to  provide a 90-day schedule buffer and add flexibility to the program\u2019s  schedule in the event of unexpected difficulties, the program has planned  to reach phase 6.5 in December 2019, ahead of the phase 6.5 date of  March 2020 that is reported in the Selected Acquisition Reports.  However, other officials told us that it is too soon to say whether the  program can manage the identified risks, or other unidentified risks, to  prevent delays in a program that has relatively little schedule margin.

According to the officials, the  B61-12 program needs to complete more than 60 flight tests over a 3- year period to meet this deadline. Completing the tests entails actively  coordinating with the Air Force organizations that manage the various  aircraft that will carry the B61-12 weapon: the B-2 bomber and the F-15,  F-16, F-35, and PA-200 fighters. According to B61-12 program officials,  aircraft may not be available when needed for the planned flight testing.  This risk is of particular concern for B-2 bombers, they said, because only  one B-2 test unit is available and it is in heavy demand for other Air Force  purposes. Program officials characterized the flight test schedule as  aggressive and ambitious, but feasible, and told us the program has  managed the risks caused by the tight testing timeframes by coordinating  with the responsible organizations and consolidating tests to minimize the  amount of time required on each type of aircraft. Further, when aircraft  are not available as planned, program officials said they can revise the  sequence of tests. For instance, they accommodated the unavailability  of  a B-2 test asset on a planned test date by moving up a test date on the F- 16. This schedule adjustment avoided a ripple effect of delays on the  overall testing schedule, according to Air Force officials. The video in  figure 6 shows an F-16 dropping an inert B61-12 bomb during a flight test  on March 14, 2017.", "NNSA and DOD have identified and taken steps to manage risks related  to finalizing the weapon\u2019s design and coordinating the procurement and  delivery of components.

Officials told us some components of the  bomb and tail kit assembly are on the program\u2019s list of joint risks.  They said that their use of the joint risk management process calls  management attention to potentially  serious risks and helps the  program to manage these risks as early and as continually as  possible. For example, NNSA officials said that when technical risks  arose in designing one classified component on the program\u2019s critical  path\u2014potentially affecting the design schedule\u2014they augmented the  design team with additional scientists in an effort to ensure that the  component would be completed in time to support the production  schedule. Similarly, to manage design risks related to the exacting  specifications for certain components, Kansas City National Security  Campus is working to develop sufficiently precise gages to measure  the required specifications during production.", "Late design changes from design agencies provided to the  production agencies. NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan identified late changes to  component design as a risk facing the B61-12 program and other  LEPs. Contractor officials we interviewed from the Kansas City  National Security Campus and the Pantex Plant said that late  changes to weapon design requirements from the Sandia and Los  Alamos design agencies could create schedule problems for  establishing production processes at the production sites. Kansas City  National Security Campus officials expressed concerns that some  component requirements continue to change\u2014some arising from  testing results\u2014which creates a tension between improving the  design and stabilizing production requirements and processes. Pantex  officials also told us about a potentially significant production delay if  late design changes require Pantex to get new production tools or  testers. Late design changes could occur as scientists at the design  agencies analyze test results. Flight tests, for example, produce a  volume of information. Officials at the federal program office in  Albuquerque said that 4 test flights on the B-2, conducted in July  2017, produced 4 to 6 hours\u2019 worth of data per flight. Officials at both  the Pantex and Kansas City sites said they have developed  management strategies to provide some flexibility in their production  schedules, such as speeding production by having staff work longer  shifts. Moreover,  because of lessons learned from prior LEPs, officials  at both sites told us that coordination between production sites and  design agencies has significantly improved over past practices\u2014 specifically, by having ongoing engagement that started earlier in the  weapon development process. For instance, Pantex officials told us  that they hold monthly meetings with design agencies to discuss  design changes. A Pantex official told us that, as a result of  addressing production concerns early, design requirements  developed at the design agencies are less likely to result in  unanticipated production problems.", "Vendor risks associated with procuring various bomb  components. According to NNSA officials we interviewed, some  bomb components are procured through single commercial vendors,  in small lots, or are unusual. Kansas City National Security Campus  officials told us that they had to replace one vendor that could no  longer provide a certain material and that they generally risk losing  potential or existing vendors because vendors prefer contracts for  larger volumes of components than NNSA needs for the B61-12  bomb. In addition, unique materials for the bomb include certain  components with specific compositions of rubber and plastics.  Officials at the Kansas City National Security Campus said that they  have encountered difficulties with getting rubber and plastic  components from vendors that consistently meet composition  specifications or with sustaining vendors\u2019 interest in producing small  batches of precision-manufactured components. In one such instance,  they said they improved incentives and communication with a vendor  to avoid losing a source for a key component. The officials said they  also contract with smaller vendors when larger vendors may not be  interested in the size of the contract NNSA offers.", "Delays in delivery of components from other production sites to  Pantex for full bomb assembly. NNSA and Pantex officials told us  that Pantex, which will assemble the full B61-12 bomb, depends on  the other production sites delivering the components in a timely  manner. NNSA production sites are scheduled to provide components  to Pantex 120 days before the first production unit date. Pantex and  NNSA officials have identified some schedule flexibility  for assembling  the first production unit at Pantex, depending on which components  have delayed deliveries. Specifically, if the delayed components are  those needed later in the assembly process, such as the bomb\u2019s nose  assembly, Pantex could stay on schedule by assembling other  delivered components until the delayed components are needed.  Delivery of other components, such as detonators, is more time- sensitive, and it is essential that these be delivered on time for  assembly to proceed as planned, according to Pantex officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA and DOD Have Taken Steps to Identify and Help Manage Risks outside the Program\u2019s Direct Control", "paragraphs": ["According to program officials, certain risks that may have a bearing on  the B61-12 LEP or that may affect the fielding of the weapon lie in areas  outside the program\u2019s direct control. Nevertheless, program managers  have taken steps to coordinate with other responsible parties to help  address these risks. For example, two of the three delivery aircraft  designated as system 2 aircraft\u2014the F-35 and the B-2\u2014have not yet  completed development and procurement of operational flight program  software that will enable the aircraft to deliver the B61-12 with the  enhanced accuracy offered by the tail kit assembly, a key feature of the  LEP. B61-12 program officials told us that the program offices  responsible for each of these aircraft must manage the development and  procurement of the operational flight program software. To help inform the  software development process, the B61-12 program provided the F-35  and B-2 program offices with information about the weapon\u2019s interface  with the airplane, including information from flight tests performed on an  earlier version of the F-35, according to program officials. NNSA and  DOD officials characterized B-2 development related to the B61-12 as  significantly more advanced than F-35 development. Specifically, Air  Force officials said that a developmental version of the B-2 operational  flight program software was fielded and certified in 2017 and would  undergo final weapon system demonstration flight tests in October 2019  and nuclear design certification in June 2020. By contrast, they said that  the F-35 software will not be ready for nuclear design certification until  January 2023, after the B61-12 program\u2019s first production unit date. The  F-35 program office will be responsible for funding tests and aircraft- weapon integration activities, according to the Air Force officials. Because  of the need to defer some flight tests until the software for the B-2 and F- 35 aircraft is ready, only one of the three system 2 delivery aircraft has  undergone testing of the B61-12 bomb\u2019s capabilities in its system 2  setting: the F-15E, on which NNSA and DOD conducted the first system 2  tests of the B61-12 in August 2017.", "Other risks outside the program\u2019s direct control concern nuclear  certification and the NATO mission.
