For example, DOD's 2018 preliminary assessment of extreme weather and climate effects at installations was based on the installations' reported past experiences with extreme weather rather than an analysis of future vulnerabilities based on climate projections. Fifteen of the 23 installations GAO visited or contacted had considered some extreme weather and climate change effects in their plans as required by DOD guidance, but 8 had not. For example, Fort Irwin, California, worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve stormwater drainage after intense flash flooding caused significant damage to base infrastructure. By contrast, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, did not include such considerations in its plans, although it is located in an area subject to tropical storms and where further sea level rise is anticipated.", "GAO also found that most of the installations had not used climate projections, because they lack guidance on how to incorporate projections into their master plans. Not assessing risks or using climate projections in installation planning may expose DOD facilities to greater-than-anticipated damage or degradation as a result of extreme weather or climate-related effects.", "Eleven of the 23 installations we reviewed had designed one or more individual facilities projects to increase the resilience of the facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects. However, project designs generally did not consider climate projections, according to installation officials. These officials told us that DOD lacks guidance on how to use climate projections that involve multiple future scenarios and different time periods. Until DOD updates its facilities design standards to require installations to consider climate projections in project designs, identify authoritative sources for them to use, and provide guidance on how to use projections, installation project designers may continue to exclude consideration of climate projections from facilities project designs, potentially making investments that are planned without consideration of climate-related risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making eight recommendations, including that the military departments work together to update master planning criteria to require an assessment of extreme weather and climate change risks and to incorporate DOD guidance on the use of climate projections into facilities design standards.

Since 2010, DOD has  identified climate change as a threat to its operations and installations  and stated that the department needs to adapt its infrastructure to the  risks posed by climate change.

These  costs are projected to increase as extreme weather events become more  frequent and intense as a result of climate change\u2014as observed and  projected by the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. According to the  U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2019s Fourth National Climate  Assessment, the effects of climate change are already being felt in the  United States and are projected to intensify in the future. These effects  will include increases in the incidence of extreme high temperatures,  heavy precipitation events, high tide flooding events along the coastline,  and forest fires in the western continental United States and Alaska. The  assumption that current and future climate conditions will resemble those  of the recent past is no longer valid, according to the report. For example,  sea levels are expected to continue to rise along almost all U.S.  coastlines.", "We and others, such as the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine, have therefore recommended enhancing  climate resilience as one strategy to help limit the federal government\u2019s  fiscal exposure. Enhancing climate resilience means being able to plan  and prepare for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to  climate-related impacts, such as those identified by the U.S. Global  Change Research Program in the 2018 Fourth National Climate  Assessment. Examples of resilience measures to protect infrastructure  include raising river or coastal dikes to reduce the risks to infrastructure  from sea level rise, building higher bridges, and increasing the capacity of  stormwater systems. Enhancing climate resilience can add additional  costs up front, but could also reduce potential future costs incurred as a  result of damage from climate-related events.", "As a result of the significant risks posed by climate change, in February  2013, we placed Limiting the Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by  Better Managing Climate Change Risks on our High-Risk List.

We made two recommendations, including that the  Executive Office of the President develop a set of authoritative climate  change projections for use in federal decision making, but as of May  2018, the Executive Office of the President had yet to take action in  response. In 2016 we reported that improved federal coordination could  facilitate the use of forward-looking climate information in facilities design  standards and building codes, the technical guidelines that promote the  safety, reliability, productivity, and efficiency of infrastructure. We made  one recommendation\u2014that the Director of the National Institute of  Standards and Technology at the Department of Commerce convene an  ongoing government-wide effort to provide the best available forward- looking climate information to standards-developing organizations for  consideration in design standards and building codes.

Multiple future scenarios allow for planners and  engineers to see a range of possible conditions that could occur at  various points in time.

Risk assessment is the  identification and analysis of risks related to achieving defined objectives  in order to form a basis for designing responses to these risks. Our prior  work has shown that assessing risks includes assessing both the  likelihood of an event occurring and the effect the event would have.  Agency leaders and subject matter experts should assess each risk by  assigning the likelihood of the event\u2019s occurrence and the potential effect  if the event occurs.", "Despite a DOD directive requiring that the military departments assess  and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, DOD has not  required in the Unified Facilities Criteria standard that guides master  planning that installations assess risks posed by extreme weather and  climate change effects as part of their master plans or develop plans to  address identified risks. Officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment acknowledged that the Unified Facilities Criteria  standard on master planning does not explicitly require a risk assessment  specifically for extreme weather or climate change as part of the master  planning process.

We recommended, among other things, that DOD provide  further direction on planning actions to account for climate change,  including information about changes in applicable building codes and  design standards and the projected effects of climate change on individual installations. DOD concurred but as of January 2019 had not  fully implemented this recommendation, as noted previously. In  December 2018, an official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment stated that DOD plans to develop a policy on  the use of sea level rise projections by some time in 2019 and eventually  to incorporate these projections into the Unified Facilities Criteria.  However, DOD has no current time table for incorporating guidance on  the use of other types of climate projections into its Unified Facilities  Criteria. The official stated that the department is working toward  eventually incorporating the use of other types of climate projections into  guidance but that these types of projections would have to be vetted by  DOD subject matter experts and approved prior to adoption.

Until November 2018, DOD\u2019s Unified Facilities  Criteria on master planning stated that changes in climate conditions are  to be determined from reliable and authorized sources of existing data but  that to anticipate conditions during the design life of existing or planned  new facilities and infrastructure, installations could also consider climate  projections from reliable and authorized sources, such as, among others,  the U.S. Global Change Research Office and the National Climate  Assessment. In November 2018, in response to a statutory requirement in  the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2019, DOD updated the Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning to  specify that climate projections from reliable and authorized sources,  such the U.S. Global Change Research Office and the National Climate  Assessment, shall be considered and incorporated into military  construction designs and modifications. DOD guidance states that the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment  provides guidance and direction on relevant technologies, engineering  standards, tools, development and use of scenarios, and other  approaches to enable prudent climate change adaptation and resilience.

The absence of guidance has  hindered the ability of some installations to effectively apply the best  available climate projections to their installation master planning. If they  do not use climate projections in their master plans, installations risk  failing to plan for changing climate and weather conditions and, as a  result, could expose their facilities to greater risk of damage or  degradation from extreme weather events and climate change effects.
