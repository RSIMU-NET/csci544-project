Consistent with GAO's prior reporting, the Act advanced the deadline for employers filing Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) with the Social Security Administration to January 31, allowing IRS to verify information reported on tax returns (such as wages and withholding) before issuing refunds, a process IRS calls W-2 systemic verification. As of February 17, 2017, IRS received over 214 million W-2 forms (a 125 percent increase over the same time last year). The Act also required IRS to hold refunds until February 15 for taxpayers claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) to provide time to use W-2 data to verify returns. Although IRS applied the verification process to all returns, preliminary data suggest the following:", "For returns where the taxpayer claimed the EITC or ACTC, IRS verified the wage information for over 35 percent of these returns before February 15. Moreover, the refund hold allowed IRS time to verify returns when it received more W-2 data, resulting in approximately $863 million in additional refunds being identified as potentially fraudulent. However, since not all W-2 data were available before February 15, IRS was unable to verify wage information for over 58 percent (7.7 million) of tax returns with refunds claiming the EITC or ACTC for a total of $38.1 billion.", "IRS did not hold returns that did not claim the EITC or ACTC because it was not required to do so, although those returns were subject to systemic verification and other checks. Preliminary data show that IRS verified wages reported on 8.6 million (41 percent) returns that did not claim the EITC or ACTC before February 15. However, IRS was unable to verify wage information reported on over 58 percent (12.3 million) of tax returns claiming $28.1 billion in refunds, because not all W-2 data were available.", "Several issues contributed to delays in availability of W-2 information. IRS processes W-2 electronic data weekly rather than when received due to the age of its computer system, resulting in a lag between when IRS has the data and can use it. In addition, some employers can request and be granted 30-day filing extensions and some file paper W-2s, which take longer to process. IRS continues to analyze the W-2 systemic verification process and its outcomes.", "IRS's telephone wait times and level of service\u2014those seeking live assistance and receiving it\u2014improved in the 2017 filing season compared to prior years. Average wait time decreased from 9.7 to 6.8 minutes compared to last year, and telephone level of service was more than 77 percent compared to 74 percent. Further, IRS reduced the number of written correspondence that is late, or \u201coverage,\u201d compared to prior years.

As we have reported, IRS has been confronted with the  ongoing problems of improper payments and IDT refund fraud over the  past several years. IDT refund fraud occurs when a fraudster obtains an  individual\u2019s Social Security number, date of birth, or other personally  identifiable information, and uses it to file a fraudulent tax return seeking a  refund. IRS estimates that at least $14.59 billion in IDT tax refund fraud  was attempted in calendar year 2015\u2014of which it prevented at least  $12.35 billion (85 percent)\u2014but at least $2.24 billion (15 percent) was  paid.", "We previously reported that the wage information that employers report  on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2), had not been available to  IRS until after it issued most refunds. With earlier access to W-2 data,  IRS could use this information to verify taxpayers\u2019 returns and identify  discrepancies before issuing billions of dollars in fraudulent refunds. Such  verification could also provide benefits for other IRS enforcement  programs such as preventing some Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  improper payments. Consistent with our prior reporting, in an effort to  address these issues, in 2015, Congress enacted the Protecting  Americans from Tax Hikes Act (the Act), which included provisions that  took effect this year. The Act required employers to submit W-2s to the  Social Security Administration (SSA) by January 31, which is about 1 to 2  months earlier than in prior years. SSA then provides W-2 data to IRS for  verifying employee wage and withholding data on tax returns. The Act  also required IRS to hold refunds for all taxpayers claiming the EITC or  Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) until February 15. Now that IRS has  earlier access to W-2 information, IRS is using it in a process it calls W-2  systemic verification.", "My statement today describes IRS\u2019s (1) implementation of early W-2  verification in accordance with the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes  Act and SSA\u2019s role in providing W-2 information to IRS, and (2)  performance in providing telephone and other service and processing  individual income tax returns during the 2017 filing season compared to  its performance in prior years.", "My statement is based on our review of data and documents describing  the implementation of IRS\u2019s systemic verification of W-2 data and  summarizing IRS\u2019s performance on the 2017 filing season to date.

Under this model, rather than holding  refunds until completing all compliance checks, IRS issued refunds after  conducting selected reviews. Since IRS did not receive most employer- reported W-2 data until late in the filing season, IRS did not begin  matching that data to tax returns until July, following the tax season.  However, with the Act\u2019s new reporting deadline, as of February 17, 2017,  IRS received over 214 million W-2 forms from SSA, an increase of 125  percent from the same time last year (see fig. 1).", "For the 2017 filing season, IRS used the W-2 data it had available to  verify wages and withholding reported on all tax returns during initial  processing.

Moreover, the refund  hold allowed IRS time to check returns using its systemic verification  when it received more W-2 data. For example, IRS reported it  reprocessed about 1 million returns during the hold period as more  data became available. As a result, IRS said it identified  approximately 162,000 returns claiming about $863 million in refunds  as potentially fraudulent.

There were three reasons for this delay:  1.  IRS received electronic W-2 data from SSA daily, but because IRS is  using older technology in this instance (a legacy system), it could only  load the data weekly. For EITC/ACTC returns, the law provided an  approximate 2-week delay between the W-2 due date (January 31)  and the refund release date (February 15), to allow time for IRS to  load the data and verify wage information on the returns before  releasing the refunds.  2.  Some W-2 data were delayed past February 15 because employers  requested extensions or missed the new deadline. This year, IRS  allowed employers a one-time 30-day, non-automatic extension to file  W-2 data if the deadline would cause undue hardship that would also  prevent the employer from furnishing the W-2s to employees by  January 31 (such as if a flood damaged the documentation and  equipment needed to file). This is a change from prior years in which  employers could request one 30-day extension from either the due  date on the last day of February (if filing on paper) or last day of  March (if filing electronically).  3.  While SSA begins receiving W-2 forms on paper in December, it did  not begin to transmit these data to IRS until March 2017. SSA officials  reported that they cannot report the number of employers who filed  paper W-2s until they complete transcribing those forms for tax year  2016. As of February 15, SSA estimated that it had approximately  17.4 million paper W-2s. As of March 31, 2017, SSA had processed  and transmitted to IRS about 3.8 million of these.

IRS\u2019s fraud filters did not select these returns for further  review; however, the W-2 systemic verification process did because IRS  received the W-2 data before it would have released the refunds on  February 15.", "IRS officials also reported a decrease in the number of IDT cases this  filing season compared to last year. Through February 28, 2017, the  number of new cases decreased by 51 percent compared to the same  time last year (from 63,102 to 30,850).

IRS is continuing to review its verification process before  determining what steps it needs to take, if any, to improve its fraud  selection filters.", "IRS officials stated that they are confident that IRS did not systematically  release EITC/ACTC refunds covered by the new hold requirement  prematurely. IRS said its pre-filing season testing confirmed that the  holds would work as intended, and that it conducted individual reviews of  EITC/ACTC cases in which data indicated that a refund may have been  released early. IRS identified nine such cases, but the payouts occurred  after February 15. IRS is considering a number of scenarios that may  require legislative action, including adjusting the timing of holding refunds  it has not yet verified, and releasing refunds for wages it has verified.", "One concern that officials noted about the refund hold was the potential  effect on the economy. According to IRS officials, in consultation with  Treasury, IRS opted not to hold all refunds until February 15. Although  IRS has authority to hold these refunds, officials explained that doing so  would have too great of an effect on the economy on top of the refunds  they were required to hold by law. For example, there could be impacts  to business models of large retailers that rely on the cycle of federal  income tax refund distribution, especially in communities with lower- income taxpayers, according to IRS officials. Even a short delay in a one- time cash infusion, especially if it represents a significant portion of some  taxpayers\u2019 income, can cause them to delay paying bills or making  important spending decisions. In addition, IRS officials said that the surge  in refunds released February 15 could have had a significant impact on  check-cashing businesses and retailers and the amount of cash required  on hand to pay refunds to taxpayers. For EITC/ACTC returns, IRS  estimated the effect on the economy to be about $60 to $64 billion in total  refunds that IRS would not release to taxpayers until February 15. If IRS  also held non-EITC/ACTC returns, it estimated those refund amounts  would affect the economy by an additional $40 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Improved Telephone Customer Service, Experienced Few Disruptions Processing Returns, and Added an Online Application While Suspending or Discontinuing Others", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Telephone Service Improved in the 2017 Filing Season", "paragraphs": ["While implementing tax law changes, it is important that IRS ensures  timely and quality service.

IRS also  revised its business case template in 2014 for new online services to  include, among other things, a discussion of costs, benefits, and risks  of future projects, consistent with our April 2013 recommendation.  However, we reviewed IRS documentation and found that the  business case contained some of the information we recommended,  such as high-level time frames, but was missing other information,  such as the benefits and costs of the project. Further, it is unclear how  IRS plans to use the business case to prioritize future projects. IRS  told us it implemented a new process for online investments that  requires details on expected benefits and costs to be reviewed by the  senior executives for prioritization and follow-up. As of March 2017,  IRS has not provided additional documentation concerning this  process.
