These decisions may involve selecting specific existing measures for CMS to use, stopping the use of some measures, or identifying new measures to be developed.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 contains a provision for GAO to review CMS's quality measurement activities. For this report, GAO (1) assessed the information CMS maintains on funding of health care quality measurement activities, and (2) described and assessed how CMS makes decisions to develop and to use quality measures. GAO analyzed CMS funding data for 2009 through 2018 and data on CMS quality measurement selections for 2014 through 2018.

CMS officials said they maintained such available funding to ensure there were no gaps in funding for future years. However, CMS officials also told GAO that the information it maintains does not identify all of the funding the agency has obligated for quality measurement activities. Further, it does not identify the extent to which this funding has supported CMS's quality measurement strategic objectives, such as reducing the reporting burden placed on providers by CMS's quality measures. With more complete and detailed information, CMS could better assess how well its funding supports its quality measurement objectives.", "CMS takes different approaches for deciding which quality measures to develop and to use. However, CMS lacks assurance that the quality measures it chooses address its quality measurement strategic objectives. This is because CMS does not have procedures to ensure systematic assessments of quality measures under consideration against each of its quality measurement strategic objectives, which increases the risk that the quality measures it selects will not help the agency achieve those objectives as effectively as possible. These procedures, such as using a tool or standard methodology to systematically assess each measure under consideration, could help CMS better achieve its objectives. In addition, CMS has not developed or implemented performance indicators for each of its quality measurement strategic objectives. Establishing these indicators and using them to evaluate its progress towards achieving its objectives would enable CMS to determine whether its quality measurement efforts are sufficient or changes are warranted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) maintain more complete and detailed information on its funding for quality measurement activities, (2) establish procedures to systematically assess measures under consideration based on CMS's quality measurement strategic objectives, and (3) develop and use performance indicators to evaluate progress in achieving its objectives.

This often involves measuring the  performance of physicians and other providers to hold them accountable  for the health care they deliver and to adjust their payments accordingly.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses a range of  quality measures to assess the care furnished by Medicare providers.  For example, CMS collects data to measure the rates at which a  hospital\u2019s patients acquire certain infections while receiving care. CMS  also funds the development of new measures when it determines they are  needed. Quality measures used in Medicare can also be used by private  payers, so CMS\u2019s decisions to select quality measures or develop new  ones have a major influence over what is known about the quality of care  provided to patients, and over how health care providers are paid. For  example, in fiscal year 2019, CMS\u2019s Hospital Value-based Purchasing  program was expected to adjust approximately $1.9 billion in Medicare  Part A payments to hospitals\u2014shifting payments from hospitals that  scored lower on CMS\u2019s quality measures to hospitals that scored higher.", "Providers and others have questioned some of the measures CMS has  chosen to use in Medicare. For example, some providers and other  stakeholders believe that many of the measures that CMS uses are not  good indicators of the quality of care that patients receive. Similarly,  providers and other stakeholders believe they must devote too many  financial and other resources on reporting the data required for many of  these quality measures.", "In recent years, CMS has taken steps intended to improve its process for  developing and selecting quality measures. Since 2011, CMS has  incorporated a formal process to obtain stakeholder input into its annual  review of the quality measures it uses for Medicare. In addition, in 2017,  CMS began its Meaningful Measures Initiative, which set strategic  objectives to guide its development and use of quality measures. These  objectives include focusing on developing and using the quality measures  that are most likely to produce substantial improvement in health care and  reducing provider burden associated with reporting information on the  measures.", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required CMS to report annually on a  comprehensive plan for its quality measurement activities, as well as on  funding for these activities. The Act also included a provision for us to  examine CMS\u2019s funding and planning for its quality measurement  activities. In this report we  1.  assess the information that CMS maintains on its funding of health  care quality measurement activities, and  2.  describe and assess how CMS makes decisions to develop and to  use quality measures in Medicare to promote its quality measurement  strategic objectives.", "To assess the information CMS maintains on its funding of health care  quality measurement activities, we reviewed CMS summaries of Medicare  appropriations and spending for fiscal years 2009 through 2018 and  planning documents for future spending provided by CMS, as well as  information for those years drawn from CMS\u2019s central funding database,  the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS).  We also examined CMS documents that describe the procedures CMS  follows in entering and checking these data, explain the content of the  information recorded in HIGLAS, and indicate how CMS officials use the  data for planning and conducting quality measurement activities. In  addition, we interviewed CMS officials about the strengths and limitations  of these data as well as how they are used by CMS officials in conducting  quality measurement activities. We assessed the available information on  funding against federal internal control standards to use complete and  accurate information to achieve agency objectives. We also assessed  the reliability of the HIGLAS data by reviewing relevant documentation  provided by CMS, checking the data extracts for missing information and  inconsistencies, and interviewing CMS officials. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.", "To describe and assess how CMS makes decisions to develop and to use  quality measures in Medicare, we reviewed CMS guidance and other  documentation related to developing new measures and selecting the  measures for CMS to use. Because CMS contracts with outside  organizations to perform some of these activities, we also reviewed CMS  contract documents, such as task orders and statements of work for its  contractors. We interviewed CMS officials and officials from CMS  contractors regarding their roles in the process. We compared CMS\u2019s  procedures for making decisions on measures to develop and to use  against federal internal control standards, including those related to  control activities. We also analyzed data for 2014 through 2018 from  CMS\u2019s Issue Tracking System, which CMS uses to keep track of quality  measures under consideration for selection in one or more of its quality  programs. To assess the reliability of the Issue Tracking System data, we  reviewed data documentation, checked the data for missing information  and obvious errors, and asked CMS officials about any data issues we  identified.

Some of these programs, such as the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting  program, are pay-for-reporting programs, in which providers may receive  higher payments if they report their performance on the quality measures  used in the programs. Others, such as the Hospital Value-based  Purchasing program, are pay-for-performance programs, in which the  level of providers\u2019 performance on the quality measures affects the  amount of the payment they receive.

According to CMS estimates, it can  take 2 years or more to complete all of these steps. As part of this  process, CMS encourages entities that develop measures to submit them  to the National Quality Forum (NQF), a nonprofit organization that  evaluates and endorses measures\u2014that is, determines which measures  should be recognized as the best available for a given aspect of care.  NQF has endorsed over 700 quality measures.", "In addition, NQF plays a major role in CMS\u2019s process for determining  which measures to use in its Medicare quality programs.

CMS officials told us that at present,  when they need to obtain a higher level of detail about funding for quality  measurement activities, they do not use HIGLAS and instead typically  conduct a manual review of any available underlying documentation, such  as documents related to individual contracts. For example, in order to  respond to a statutory requirement to report on its spending to develop  certain quality measures for physicians, CMS officials told us they needed  to review a set of individual contracts associated with those measures.   CMS officials noted that this process is often laborious and that the  content of available documents may not enable them to obtain all the  desired funding information for the specific quality measurement activities  in question.

All  but one of the eight appropriations that specifically authorize spending for  quality measurement activities are available indefinitely. Five of these  appropriations funded quality measurement activities under sections 1890  and 1890A of the SSA. In the case of these five appropriations, with the  exception of fiscal year 2009, CMS had unobligated balances each year  that were larger than or similar to the total amount the agency had  obligated from those appropriations that year (see figure 1).

CMS officials said that in general, they chose to use the  available quality measurement funds conservatively to ensure there were  no gaps in funding to carry out their statutory responsibilities, in view of  uncertainty about the availability and timing of funding in future years.  They also said that they took into account the total amount of  appropriated funds\u2014including unobligated balances\u2014in developing the  scope and duration of quality measurement activities. The officials noted  that it often takes more than one year to implement these activities, in  order to gather information, select contractors, or solicit and award grant  applications. Regarding the level of unobligated balances to be carried  over from one fiscal year to the next, CMS officials told us that they work  to obligate all appropriations in accordance with statutory requirements,  and do not have thresholds for maximum unobligated balances.", "Maintaining large unobligated balances means that CMS is retaining  funds for future quality measurement activities rather than using them for  current quality measurement activities. One example of how such choices  can affect the scope and timing of CMS\u2019s quality measurement activities  was the outcome of a CMS competition for cooperative agreements,  announced in March 2018, to develop new clinician quality measures to  address identified measurement gaps. Drawing on funds from the  appropriation dedicated to developing, improving, updating, or expanding  new clinician quality measures (MACRA 102) that were available for use  until 2022, CMS set a maximum amount for the awards of $30 million  over three years. CMS officials determined that the $30 million ceiling  meant that there was adequate funding for seven awardees, while CMS  indicated that additional applicants scored well on CMS\u2019s selection criteria  and addressed areas of need. For fiscal year 2018, MACRA 102 had an  unobligated balance of $42 million, with an additional $15 million  appropriation in place for fiscal year 2019.

CMS makes preliminary decisions on which of these measures  to use in its quality programs, and it publishes this selection of measures  in its annual Measures under Consideration list (MUC). The MUC list then  undergoes public review by multiple stakeholders. After this review, CMS  chooses which measures to include in the formal rulemaking processes  that ultimately determine which measures are added to its quality  programs. See table 3.", "To make decisions on which measures to include in the MUC list, CMS  officials review the submissions. According to CMS, officials from each  Medicare quality program, referred to as quality program leads,  separately review each measure submitted for use in that program.

Minimizing provider burden is one of CMS\u2019s strategic objectives,  and, according to CMS officials, it represents a priority communicated by  the CMS administrator. For more information about CMS\u2019s measure  selection decisions for its annual MUC list in 2014 through 2018, see  appendix III.", "CMS officials also make decisions annually about which existing  measures CMS will remove from its Medicare quality programs.  According to CMS officials, the process for deciding which measures to  remove is an ongoing, iterative process, and discussions on which  measures to remove generally occur in parallel with discussions for  selecting measures, with discussions on both measure selection and  removal coming to a conclusion in the drafting of the annual proposed  and final rules for each program. For measures that are being used in its  quality programs, CMS relies on measure developers to monitor the  performance of their measures based on principles defined in CMS\u2019s  Blueprint. According to the Blueprint, information from developers\u2019 monitoring efforts, including recommendations from technical experts,  should be conveyed to and evaluated by CMS officials. CMS officials told  us that their decisions to remove measures often take into account the  recommendations made by technical experts. In addition, CMS has  promulgated through federal rulemaking eight factors for determining  whether to remove existing measures from its Medicare quality programs,  some of which reflect its quality measurement strategic objectives. CMS  officials also said that in deciding to remove measures from CMS quality  programs in 2018 they, in part, considered an assessment of the costs of  reporting measures relative to the benefit of continued use of the  measures. CMS decisions to remove measures have been included in  notices of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, which allows for  public comment and further consideration before issuance of final rules to  that effect.", "In addition to making decisions on the selection and removal of  measures, CMS officials also make decisions regarding which new  measures to develop. Our review of CMS contract documents, including  task orders, indicates that CMS typically awards multiple year contracts to  conduct ongoing assessments of quality measures and to develop  measures for specific Medicare quality programs, such as inpatient  psychiatric facilities or post-acute care providers. Those task orders often  call on contractors to convene technical expert panels and conduct  additional analyses to assess what measures are currently available for  use and what gaps exist in available measures. CMS officials told us they  review these reports and provide informal feedback to the contractors.  CMS also establishes parameters that guide these efforts. For example,  in its 2016 Measure Development Plan for Medicare\u2019s new physician  payment system, after soliciting public input, CMS designated six medical  specialty areas in which to focus its measure development efforts, and  subsequently added five more specialties on which to focus the work of  its contractors.

The rationale for selecting each measure is provided as a  summary of the peer-reviewed evidence of the impact that use of the  measure will have on clinical care. In addition, CMS maintains an internal  tracking system, which assembles the information that measure  developers provide about the measures they submit to CMS. This system  includes some information related to CMS\u2019s quality measurement  strategic objectives, such as the meaningful measures high-impact area  the measure is intended to address.", "While these steps provide some information about the linkages between  certain quality measures and some of CMS\u2019s quality measurement  strategic objectives, CMS lacks procedures to ensure systematic  assessment of each quality measure against each of its eight quality  measurement strategic objectives. For example, while CMS has  implemented the Measure Review Template to consolidate some  information on measures, the template does not provide procedures for  systematically assessing how each measure will help CMS achieve all  eight of its quality measurement strategic objectives. The Quality  Measure Index\u2014currently under development\u2014has the potential to be  used in a systematic assessment of each measure, but according to CMS  officials, as of March 2019 the agency had not yet determined how it  planned to use this tool once its testing was complete.", "Furthermore, CMS lacks procedures to ensure a systematic assessment  of whether the collective set of measures it decides to develop or use will  help CMS achieve each of the objectives, which could help determine the  extent to which each of the objectives is being effectively addressed. The  limited assessments across measures that CMS officials said they  perform do not consider whether each of CMS\u2019s objectives is being  addressed. For example, one of CMS\u2019s eight quality measurement  strategic objectives directs CMS to address 19 high-impact measure  areas. CMS officials told us that, for each quality program, they look at  whether measures generally address the high-impact measure areas, but  gaps in these areas remain to be filled. In 2018, there were no measures  used in CMS quality programs that addressed the high-impact area  \u201cequity of care\u201d and 13 of 17 Medicare quality programs had no measures  that addressed the \u201ccommunity engagement\u201d area. Measure developers  did not submit measures to CMS that addressed these areas, and CMS  did not identify specific initiatives to address them. CMS officials told us,  however, that CMS supports discussions of key methodological  considerations for collecting and analyzing measure data that could help  enable future development of these measures.", "Last, CMS lacks procedures for documenting the consistent application of  those systematic assessments. Federal internal control standards  indicate the importance of documenting decisions to support achieving  agency objectives. Specifically, CMS does not document, either in its  public reporting or internal tracking system, how each measure it decides  to use is expected to promote each of its eight quality measurement  strategic objectives. For decisions on developing new measures, the  agency records less information. For example, CMS does not maintain a  consolidated list of decisions to initiate the development of new quality  measures across the various Medicare quality programs. CMS officials  also told us that they generally do not maintain documentation of  discussions on how or why they selected one measure for development  over another. If CMS develops procedures to consider the effect of each  of its quality measurement decisions on each of its quality measurement  strategic objectives, then documentation of these procedures would help  to show that they are implemented consistently.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  design and implement internal control activities, such as tools and  documentation of decisions, to support the agency in achieving its  objectives. Without procedures that ensure that its quality measures fully  address its strategic objectives, CMS increases the risk that the  measures it decides to develop and use will not help the agency achieve  its quality measurement strategic objectives as effectively as possible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Not Established Performance Indicators to Determine Its Overall Progress in Achieving Its Quality Measurement Strategic Objectives", "paragraphs": ["CMS has not developed and implemented performance indicators that  would be needed to determine if it is making progress in meeting its  quality measurement strategic objectives. Establishing these indicators  and using them to evaluate its progress towards meeting each of its  quality measurement strategic objectives would enable CMS to determine  whether its quality measurement efforts are sufficient or whether changes  in these efforts are needed. According to federal internal control  standards, after agencies establish objectives, they should establish a set  of performance indicators and use them to assess their effectiveness in  achieving their objectives and identify improvements in their work, as  needed. However, CMS has not established performance indicators for its  strategic objectives that would provide a basis for determining its  progress towards achieving these objectives. Such performance  indicators would relate to each of CMS\u2019s quality measurement strategic  objectives and provide information on interim progress toward achieving  these objectives. For example, CMS could establish one or more  indicators of its progress toward addressing the 19 high-impact measure  areas that safeguard public health, and an indicator of providers\u2019 reporting  burden for quality measurement to see if it showed an overall reduction.", "CMS officials told us that they assess the impact of the agency\u2019s quality  measurement activities by reviewing changes over time in health care  providers\u2019 reported performance on selected quality measures. However,  these measures are for providers\u2019 quality of care, and are not indicators  designed to determine the agency\u2019s progress in achieving its eight  strategic objectives for quality measurement. Specifically, CMS has  completed the National Impact Assessment of Quality Measures report  every 3 years since 2012. These reports focus on trends in the  performance of health care providers on a number of specific quality  measures. Such analyses do not evaluate CMS\u2019s performance in  developing and choosing to use measures that promote its quality  measurement strategic objectives.", "CMS has convened the Meaningful Measurement and Improvement  Affinity Group, a workgroup of CMS officials involved in quality  measurement. This workgroup\u2019s stated mission is to champion the  Meaningful Measures Initiative and facilitate its implementation across the  agency. CMS officials told us that the workgroup has begun to discuss  potential ways to evaluate the agency\u2019s progress in achieving the eight  strategic objectives laid out in the Meaningful Measures Initiative.
