Even with this progress, significant actions remain to be completed.", "Chief Information Officer (CIO) responsibilities . Laws such as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and related guidance assigned 35 key IT management responsibilities to CIOs to help address longstanding challenges. However, in August 2018, GAO reported that none of the 24 selected agencies had policies that fully addressed the role of their CIO, as called for by laws and guidance. GAO recommended that OMB and each of the 24 agencies take actions to improve the effectiveness of CIOs' implementation of their responsibilities. As of November 2018, none of the 27 recommendations had been implemented.", "IT contract approval . According to FITARA, covered agencies' CIOs are required to review and approve IT contracts. Nevertheless, in January 2018, GAO reported that most of the CIOs at 22 covered agencies were not adequately involved in reviewing billions of dollars of IT acquisitions. Consequently, GAO made 39 recommendations to improve CIO oversight over these acquisitions. As of November 2018, 27 of the recommendations had not been addressed.", "Consolidating data centers . OMB launched an initiative in 2010 to reduce data centers. According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts have resulted in approximately $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2018. Even so, additional work remains. GAO has made 160 recommendations to OMB and agencies to improve the reporting of related cost savings and to achieve optimization targets. However, as of November 2018, 47 of the recommendations had not been fully addressed.", "Managing software licenses . Effective management of software licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In May 2014, GAO reported that better management of licenses was needed to achieve savings, and made 135 recommendations to improve such management. As of December 2018, 27 of the recommendations had not been implemented.", "Improving the security of federal IT systems . While the government has acted to protect federal information systems, agencies need to improve security programs, cyber capabilities, and the protection of personally identifiable information. The approximately 3,000 recommendations that GAO has made to agencies since 2010 were aimed at improving the security of federal systems and information.

Among other things, the guidance  required agencies to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize  existing facilities, improve their security posture, and achieve cost  savings.", "According to agencies, data center consolidation and optimization efforts  have resulted in approximately $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2018.   However, additional work remains to fully carry out the initiative.  Specifically, in a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through  May 2018, we noted that, while data center consolidation could potentially  save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in  several areas, including agencies\u2019 data center consolidation plans, data  center optimization, and OMB\u2019s tracking and reporting on related cost  savings. In these reports, we made a total of 160 recommendations to  OMB and 24 agencies to improve the execution and oversight of the  initiative. Most agencies and OMB agreed with our recommendations or  had no comments. As of November 2018, 47 of these 160  recommendations remained unimplemented.", "In addition, in a draft report on data center optimization that we have  provided to the agencies for comment and plan to issue in early 2019, our  preliminary results indicate that agencies continued to report mixed  progress toward achieving OMB\u2019s goals for closing data centers and  realizing the associated savings by September 2018. Specifically, as of  August 2018, over half of the agencies reported that they had met, or  planned to meet, all of their OMB-assigned closure goals for tiered data  centers by the deadline. However, 6 agencies reported that they did not  plan to meet their goals for tiered data centers. In addition, as of August  2018, 11 agencies reported that they had already met the goal for closing  60 percent of their non-tiered centers, 3 agencies reported that they  planned to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year 2018, and 9 agencies  reported that they did not plan to meet the goal by the end of fiscal year  2018.", "In all, the 24 agencies reported a total of 6,250 data center closures as of  August 2018, which represented about half of the total reported number  of federal data centers. In addition, the agencies reported 1,009 planned  closures by the end of fiscal year 2018, with an additional 191 closures  planned through fiscal year 2023, for a total of 1,200 further closures.", "Further, in August 2018, 22 agencies reported that they had achieved  $1.94 billion in cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018, while 2  agencies reported that they had not achieved any savings. In addition to  that amount, 21 agencies identified a further $0.42 billion in planned  savings through fiscal year 2018\u2014for a total of $2.36 billion in planned  cost savings from fiscal years 2016 through 2018.

Federal agencies  engage in thousands of software licensing agreements annually. The  objective of software license management is to manage, control, and  protect an organization\u2019s software assets. Effective management of these  licenses can help avoid purchasing too many licenses, which can result in  unused software, as well as too few licenses, which can result in  noncompliance with license terms and cause the imposition of additional  fees.", "As part of its PortfolioStat initiative, OMB has developed a policy that  addresses software licenses. This policy requires agencies to conduct an  annual, agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses.", "In May 2014, we reported on federal agencies\u2019 management of software  licenses and determined that better management was needed to achieve  significant savings government-wide. Of the 24 selected agencies we  reviewed, only 2 had comprehensive policies that included the  establishment of clear roles and central oversight authority for managing  enterprise software license agreements, among other things. Of the  remaining 22 agencies, 18 had policies that were not comprehensive, and  4 had not developed any policies.", "Further, we found that only 2 of the 24 selected agencies had established  comprehensive software license inventories, a leading practice that would  help them to adequately manage their software licenses. The inadequate  implementation of this and other leading practices in software license  management was partially due to weaknesses in agencies\u2019 policies. As a  result, we concluded that agencies\u2019 oversight of software license  spending was limited or lacking, thus potentially leading to missed  savings. However, the potential savings could be significant considering  that, in fiscal year 2012, 1 major federal agency reported saving  approximately $181 million by consolidating its enterprise license  agreements, even when its oversight process was ad hoc.", "Accordingly, we recommended that OMB issue a directive to help guide  agencies in managing software licenses. We also made 135  recommendations to the 24 agencies to improve their policies and  practices for managing licenses. Among other things, we recommended  that the agencies regularly track and maintain a comprehensive inventory  of software licenses and analyze the inventory to identify opportunities to  reduce costs and better inform investment decision making.", "Most agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.

For example, in order  to address the challenge of securing federal systems and information, we  identified 3 actions that the agencies should take: (1) improve  implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives, (2) address  weaknesses in federal information security programs, and (3) enhance  the federal response to cyber incidents.

The evaluations also are to capture maturity model  ratings for their respective agencies. Toward this end, in fiscal year 2017,  the inspector general community, in partnership with OMB and DHS,  finalized a 3-year effort to create a maturity model for FISMA metrics. The  maturity model aligns with the five function areas in the NIST Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (Cybersecurity  Framework): identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.
