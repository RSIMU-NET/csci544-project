Given USPS\u2019s poor financial condition, in 2009 GAO identified USPS\u2019s financial viability as a high-risk area, a designation it retains today.", "GAO was asked to explore issues related the transformation of USPS and potential implications for stakeholders. This report (1) examines major challenges facing USPS, (2) identifies how selected domestic businesses and foreign posts reportedly have addressed serious challenges, (3) examines critical foundational elements of USPS\u2019s current business model, and (4) identifies key previously issued GAO matters for congressional consideration regarding USPS and actions taken in response.", "GAO reviewed its prior reports and related matters for congressional consideration, analyzed laws and regulations, and assessed USPS documents on financial and operational performance. It also reviewed reports by the USPS Office of Inspector General, the Postal Regulatory Commission, and other selected groups such as the 2018 Task Force on the United States Postal Service.", "To identify how domestic businesses and foreign posts addressed similar serious challenges, GAO selected for review (1) six domestic organizations in the airline, automobile, and railroad industries and (2) five foreign posts in five countries\u2014Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The businesses and countries had characteristics similar to USPS, such as large unionized work forces, and had reportedly made significant changes to their business models. For each of these businesses and countries, GAO analyzed public reports on financial and operational performance, as well as institutional structure and requirements. GAO also interviewed government and postal officials from three selected countries and officials from the National Audit Offices of two of the selected countries. Because questions were raised regarding the application of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to USPS, GAO also requested the National Bankruptcy Conference to assess whether USPS could use bankruptcy or other restructuring processes.", "To examine critical USPS business model elements, GAO reviewed its prior reports and reports from numerous other organizations, and obtained the views of stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since GAO's 2009 high-risk designation, the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) financial viability has progressively worsened due to declining mail volume, increased employee compensation and benefit costs, and increased unfunded liabilities and debt. First-Class Mail volume has declined 44 percent since fiscal year 2006. Additionally, employee compensation and benefits costs have been increasing. Although USPS's work force declined from about 786,000 in fiscal year 2007 to about 617,000 in fiscal year 2013, USPS's work force increased to about 630,000 in fiscal year 2019. Finally, total unfunded liabilities and debt continue their steady upward trend (see figure).", "To address these challenges, USPS has taken a variety of actions such as providing increased self-service options and reducing facility hours. Statutory requirements, however, limit USPS's ability to make changes in areas such as certain service offerings, pricing, and its employee compensation and benefits.", "In confronting similar types of challenges that are facing USPS, GAO selected large domestic businesses (companies) and foreign postal entities (widely known as \u201cforeign posts\u201d) that have seen significant change in foundational elements of their business models. Specifically, according to GAO's analysis of publicly available reports and interviews of cognizant officials, these organizations have had major changes in services and products, financial self-sustainment, and institutional structure:", "Companies and foreign posts have modified services and products to focus on profitable offerings, and two countries\u2019 posts reduced postal service levels. For example, New Zealand Post reduced its mail delivery\u2019s frequency from 5 to 3 days per week in urban areas.", "Companies have reduced their workforce, infrastructure, and operational costs, and some accepted government financial assistance to help remain financially viable. Cost reduction has also been a priority for all countries\u2019 posts, especially in compensation and benefits, while three countries\u2019 governments provided financial assistance to their posts.", "Four of the selected companies declared bankruptcy leading to restructured corporations; some merged with other companies to increase their revenues. Two countries privatized their posts, and three others restructured their posts from government departments into government-owned corporations.", "Regarding USPS, reassessing its business model should start with the level of required postal services. For example, delivery is USPS\u2019s most costly operation; USPS officials estimate annual savings of $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion if delivery of mail were reduced to 5 days rather than 6 days per week. Second, USPS is to function as a financially self-sustaining entity; however, it does not. A reassessment could include determining whether some of USPS\u2019s costs and liabilities should be borne by taxpayers. Third, alternative institutional structures for USPS range from a federal agency to a private company. A bankruptcy proceeding is not an effective or appropriate means to address the issues associated with a potential USPS restructuring, according to the National Bankruptcy Conference.", "Prior GAO reports have included suggestions for Congress to address USPS\u2019s financial viability. For example, GAO\u2019s 2010 report identified strategies to reduce compensation, benefits, and operational costs. GAO stated that Congress, among other things, consider all options available to reduce costs. While bills in this area were introduced and in some cases passed congressional committees, legislation was not enacted. In 2018, GAO reported that the financial outlook for the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund was poor\u2014the Office of Personnel Management forecasted the fund would be depleted by 2030 if USPS continued not making payments into it. Legislation has not been enacted to place postal retiree health benefits on a more sustainable financial footing. Postal reform legislation has not taken place in part because of the difficulty in obtaining compromise among various stakeholders with divergent views (see figure below). However, since GAO\u2019s 2010 report, USPS\u2019s financial condition has significantly worsened raising fundamental questions about key elements of USPS\u2019s business model.

We also selected foreign  posts in five industrialized countries that made changes during the same  time period. We selected these five countries based on prior work that  identified them as having made changes to adapt to the changing use of  mail; diverse characteristics, including the extent of privatization of their  postal operators and geography with both urban and rural areas; and the  availability of information in English. We reviewed and summarized key  findings of public reports on the financial and operational performance as  well as institutional structure and requirements of the selected domestic  businesses and the selected countries\u2019 postal operators. Our review  included private company reports filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), annual reports by the private companies and foreign  posts, reports by GAO and the Congressional Research Service (CRS),  books, and academic articles, among other sources. We also conducted  site visits to France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to interview  government officials and representatives of foreign posts, a labor union, a  private-sector mail delivery company, postal economists, and two former  chief executives of foreign posts, about the changes to postal operations  in their countries. We did not conduct interviews with representatives of  the selected domestic businesses.", "To identify the key issues for consideration involved in transformation, we  reviewed our prior work and reports from the USPS OIG and others on  different options. We used information on how our selected domestic  industries and foreign posts made significant changes to provide  examples of how different aspects of USPS\u2019s business model could  change and their potential effects on USPS\u2019s stakeholders. We also  interviewed representatives from three postal labor unions, a mailer group  that represents commercial mailers, and four third-party experts on postal  policy regarding their views on how USPS can change and the potential  effects of such a transformation on mailers, postal employees,  ratepayers, and competitors. We selected the mailer group and the third- party experts based on our prior work and their differing positions on  USPS reform.

NBC is a non-partisan,  non-profit organization formed in the 1940s and today consists of  approximately 60 lawyers, law professors, and bankruptcy judges who  are leading experts in bankruptcy law. NBC\u2019s primary purpose is to advise  Congress on the operation of bankruptcy and related laws and on any  proposed changes to those laws. NBC provided a report on whether  USPS could use the Code or other restructuring processes to address its  financial obligations and achieve a sustainable business model.

USPS is a key part of the mailing  industry, and over time, it has become both a competitor and partner to  private companies that also operate in the broader mail and delivery  industries. For example, although United Parcel Service (UPS) and  FedEx both pay USPS to deliver packages that they enter into USPS\u2019s  system at local post offices where carriers pick up their mail, they also  compete with USPS for end-to-end package delivery business, such as  moving packages from the retailer to the purchaser. Similarly, FedEx is  USPS\u2019s largest contractor, providing air transportation for Priority Mail  Express (formerly Express Mail), Priority Mail, and First-Class Mail. UPS  is also one of USPS\u2019s largest contractors, providing long-distance mail  transportation.", "Over the years, legislation has changed key aspects of the business  model used to provide the nation\u2019s postal services. Until 1970, the federal  government provided postal services via the U.S. Post Office Department,  a government agency that received annual appropriations from  Congress. At that time, Congress was involved in many aspects of the department\u2019s operations, such as selecting postmasters and setting  postal rates and wages. In addition, the President controlled the hiring  and firing of Postmasters General, as it was a cabinet-level position. By  the late 1960s, the department had several major problems including  financial losses, management problems, service breakdowns, and low  productivity. Because key postal business decisions were made by  Congress through the legislative process, postal management had limited  ability to plan and finance department operations and capital investments  in accordance with postal needs.", "In order to improve and modernize postal services, the Postal  Reorganization Act (PRA) was enacted in 1970 and replaced the U.S.  Post Office Department with USPS, an independent establishment of the  executive branch of the government of the United States. Congress  designed USPS to be a self-sustaining, business-like entity headed by a  Board of Governors that would cover its operating costs primarily with  revenues generated through the sales of postage and postal-related  products and services.", "However, by the early 2000s, USPS faced a bleak financial outlook that  put its mission of providing universal postal service at risk, according to  the 2003 Presidential Commission on the United States Postal Service.  The Commission evaluated USPS\u2019s business model and concluded that  USPS must have greater flexibility to operate in a business-like fashion,  but that this latitude required enhanced transparency to enable effective  management and congressional oversight. The Postal Accountability and  Enhancement Act (PAEA) was enacted in 2006. PAEA provided USPS  additional pricing flexibility for mail products, but with provisions for  increased transparency, oversight, and accountability, among other  things.", "Specifically, PAEA gave USPS broader latitude to change postal rates in  a more streamlined process that included review by the newly created  Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC). The PRC, which replaced the  former Postal Rate Commission, is an independent establishment of the  executive branch responsible for regulating USPS. PRC is required to  make annual determinations of USPS\u2019s compliance with mail delivery  standards and postal rate requirements.

The long-term decline of First-Class Mail  volume, which USPS has stated was exacerbated by the Great  Recession and expects to continue for the foreseeable future, has  fundamental implications for USPS\u2019s business model because First-Class  Mail is USPS\u2019s most profitable class of mail. USPS Marketing Mail\u2014 which comprises most other mail volume\u2014declined 27 percent from fiscal  year 2007 to fiscal year 2019, in part due to electronic advertising  alternatives. The volume of USPS competitive products more than tripled  since fiscal year 2007. This volume, however, began to decline in the  second half of fiscal year 2019 due to growing competition for package  delivery.", "USPS has taken steps to right size its operations in response to declining  mail volumes. For example, in both 2009 and 2011, USPS announced  plans to close several thousand USPS retail facilities. However, due to  stakeholder opposition\u2014including from members of Congress, postal  unions, and local communities, among others\u2014USPS instead closed a  few hundred retail facilities. USPS also expanded the alternative options  for customers to access retail postal products and services outside of  USPS-operated postal facilities\u2014such as self-service kiosks and  partnerships with other retailers such as contract postal units. According  to USPS, as a compromise effort to right size the retail network and due  in part to USPS\u2019s efforts to expand retail alternatives, USPS began  reducing retail hours at selected post offices in 2012, ultimately  decreasing retail hours at approximately 13,000 post offices. Another  major cost-cutting effort was its 2011 Network Rationalization Initiative, a  multi-part plan to consolidate its mail processing network. USPS  consolidated more than 160 mail processing facilities, but did not fully  implement this initiative following opposition from various stakeholders.", "In addition to stakeholder opposition to changing postal services, federal  laws also factor into USPS\u2019s limited ability to respond to declining mail  volumes. For example, federal laws define the level of postal services  USPS is to provide, postal products, and pricing.", "Postal services to be provided: USPS has limited ability to make  changes in the postal services it provides. Specifically, USPS is  required to provide 6-days-a-week delivery and to operate postal  facilities across the country. Federal law requires USPS to provide  the maximum degree of effective and regular postal services to rural  areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self- sustaining. Federal law also limits USPS\u2019s ability to close retail  facilities. For example, USPS cannot close a small post office solely  because it is unprofitable. As of the end of fiscal year 2019, there  were approximately 34,600 postal retail outlets nationwide, including  approximately 31,300 USPS-managed post offices, branches, and  stations, and, as we recently reported, USPS\u2019s analysis showed that  about 36 percent of its retail facilities were unprofitable in fiscal year  2018.", "Postal products and pricing: USPS\u2019s pricing flexibility is limited by a  price cap on market-dominant products that generally limits rate  increases for these products to a common measure of inflation. Each  competitive product is required to cover its attributable costs;  competitive products collectively are required to recover their  attributable costs; and competitive products collectively are required  to cover a PRC-specified minimum of USPS\u2019s institutional costs.

Similarly, as we previously reported,  recent trends show total work hours increased from a combination of new  hiring and increased work hours for current employees. Specifically, we  reported that from fiscal years 2014 through 2018, work hours increased  by 5.4 percent. The number of work hours associated with higher costs\u2014 overtime and penalty overtime\u2014have also been increasing. According  to USPS, total compensation and benefits costs increased by almost $1  billion in fiscal year 2019 alone.", "USPS has implemented changes to help control employee compensation  and benefits costs, including lowering pay for new career employees and  increasing use of non-career employees. For example, as we previously  reported, starting about 10 years ago, USPS\u2019s collective bargaining  agreements have included the ability to hire up to 20 percent of the  workforce as non-career employees. Non-career employees are less  costly because they generally have lower pay rates and are not entitled to  the full federal benefits received by career employees. According to  USPS officials, non-career employees are also \u201cmore flexible\u201d because  there are fewer restrictions on their tasks and schedules. We recently  reported that our analysis estimated that USPS likely saved about $6.6  billion from fiscal years 2016 through 2018 from increased use of non- career employees. USPS has recognized trade-offs in increasing the  use of non-career employees in entry-level positions, such as a high  turnover rate, as would be expected for almost any entry-level position in  the private sector.", "With respect to benefits costs for current postal employees, we have  recently reported that USPS has also achieved savings by gradually  decreasing its contribution percentage for employee health insurance  premiums over the past decade, with corresponding increases in the  contribution percentage paid by employees. These changes were  negotiated with the four major postal labor unions and were included in  successive collective bargaining agreements, each of which covered a  multi-year period. We found that the reduction in USPS health insurance  contributions generated estimated savings of about $1.4 billion for fiscal  years 2016 through 2018.", "A number of restrictions limit USPS\u2019s ability to control employee  compensation and benefits costs. As we recently reported, USPS  compensation and benefits costs\u2014which represent about three-fourths of  its total costs\u2014are driven by a mix of USPS contracts and policies,  including collective bargaining agreements negotiated with unions  representing 92 percent of USPS employees, and statutory requirements  governing USPS employee pay and benefits. When USPS and its  unions are unable to agree, the parties are required to enter into binding  arbitration by a third-party panel. USPS\u2019s collective bargaining  agreements with these labor unions, some of which were established  through binding arbitration, have established salary increases and cost- of-living adjustments and, as mentioned above, have also capped the  number of non-career employees at approximately 20 percent of the  number of employees covered by the agreements. Federal law requires  USPS to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  (FEHBP), which covers current employees and retirees, as well as federal  pension and workers\u2019 compensation programs.

In doing so, USPS cited its precarious financial condition and the need to cover current and  anticipated costs and any contingencies. It has not paid $55.4 billion in  required payments for funding these benefits through fiscal year 2019,  including $47.2 billion in missed funding payments for retiree health  benefits since fiscal year 2010, and $8.2 billion for funding pension  benefits since fiscal year 2014.

USPS is  required to prefund its share of health benefits for its retirees.

Specifically,  The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and  Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) agreed to cuts in  compensation for the automakers\u2019 employees to levels paid by GM  and Ford\u2019s competitors. UAW also agreed to move retiree health care  benefits into a private Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association  (VEBA) for current and former UAW-represented employees in  2007; the VEBA took over health benefits for retirees starting in 2010.  The automakers also closed defined benefit pension plans to new  participants and moved to defined contribution pension plans for  eligible new employees.", "Railroads: The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 was enacted to improve the  financial stability of the railroad system. Subsequently, railroads  improved their financial health through, among other things, cost  reduction measures such as reducing their workforce through layoffs  and federal buyouts agreed to by unions, and abandoned or sold off  unprofitable rail lines to reduce infrastructure and operating costs.  Overall railroad employment fell greatly as railroads consolidated,  reduced service, and changed work rules. For example, Conrail  reduced its workforce from about 82,000 employees in 1977 to about  21,000 in 1996.

Therefore, the bankruptcy proceeding was initiated to liquidate the  railroad to meet the demands of its creditors. Faced with the potential  cessation of railroad service for an entire section of the country, the  federal government created Conrail to take over and operate specified  portions of Penn Central as well as several other bankrupt railroads in  the Northeast United States.

For example, according to New Zealand Post officials, in response  to reduced mail volume, New Zealand Post reduced its required  frequency of mail delivery in urban areas from 5 to 3 days while  maintaining 5-day delivery in rural areas with the stated goal of ensuring  that postal service remained viable without government subsidization.  Australia Post revised the service standards it provided for delivery of  letter mail in 2016, resulting in slower delivery of some mail.", "In addition, the main pricing changes have involved price increases for all  mail, as well as the introduction of discounted postal rates for letter mail  entered at processing facilities that generally were closer to the final  destination of the mail. For example, Royal Mail raised postal rates above  the rate of inflation after relaxation of its price cap.

Because postal operations are labor-intensive, actions to address  workforce costs were particularly important to improving financial results.  These often went hand in hand with outsourcing, network restructuring,  reductions in service levels to better align service with demand, and other  changes to increase productivity and achieve cost savings. The  governments and the postal operators of selected countries also  considered the effects on stakeholders when making postal reform  decisions.

In France, La Poste officials  told us that La Poste likewise transitioned its workforce in the 1990s  from civil servants to private employees and ended recruitment of civil  servants in 2000. They also said that this transition provided La Poste  with a more flexible workforce and reduced its pension liability.  Australia Post closed its defined benefit pension plan to new  employees in 2012, while Royal Mail is transitioning to a defined  contribution pension plan that it introduced in 2018. Royal Mail and  New Zealand Post also have reduced the size of their workforce in  recent years.", "Infrastructure: Some selected foreign posts consolidated their mail  processing networks to reduce costs.

At the same time, some minimized this disruption by  expanding retail access through alternatives such as Internet sales  and partnerships with retail businesses such as grocery stores or  pharmacies.

Deutsche Post, Post Office Limited in the United  Kingdom, La Poste, Australia Post, and New Zealand Post have  outsourced or franchised most of their postal retail functions to private  nonpostal operators. For example, Deutsche Post franchised its  postal retail outlets to local businesses to not only reduce expenses,  but also increase the availability of postal retail services nationwide by  putting retail counters in stores that were open longer than traditional  post offices. Deutsche Post representatives stated that while there  was some initial resistance to these changes, these concerns abated  after a few months as customers realized they received better service  and longer hours. The representatives also said the number of retail  outlets has increased in recent years in response to increased  demand for e-commerce package returns. La Poste has a substantial  and growing proportion of retail facilities operated by private providers  (in partnership with small shops, especially in rural areas) or co- located in local government-owned buildings (in partnership with local  town halls in rural areas). In addition, Australia Post combined its  letter and parcel delivery networks in 2018 to obtain efficiencies.", "Productivity: All of the postal operators in the selected countries took  actions to enhance productivity, such as improving automation of mail  processing, modernizing and streamlining operations, and changing  work processes. For example, Deutsche Post officials stated they had  streamlined their parcel sorting process and went from 140 parcel  sorting centers in 1990 to 34 in 2019. Deutsche Post officials stated  that this streamlining improved service performance for parcels;  previously, most parcels were delivered within 3 or 4 days; by 2019,  93 percent of parcels were delivered within 1 day.

We and others\u2014such as USPS, PRC, and USPS OIG\u2014have called for a  fundamental reexamination of what postal services the nation needs now  and may need in the future. In particular, we have testified that USPS\u2019s  growing financial difficulties, combined with changing demand for postal  services, have provided Congress with an opportunity to examine and  potentially redefine what postal services should be provided on a  universal basis and how they should be provided.", "As mentioned above, there are numerous federal laws and requirements  related to the provision of universal postal service. For example, 6-day  delivery has long been required by annual USPS appropriations acts.  Over the past decade, legislation has been introduced, and USPS and  others have proposed reducing the frequency of delivery. However, no  legislation has been enacted that would allow USPS to reduce delivery  frequency.", "There is also no consensus on the level of postal services the nation  needs. Changes in service levels face opposition from some  stakeholders, such as labor unions, affected communities, and the  general public. Currently, legislation has been introduced that supports  the preservation of both 6-day and door-to-door delivery for addresses  that have it, and some mailer groups support one or both of these  positions. Representatives from postal labor unions we spoke with  stated that universal postal service is appropriate as currently defined and  could be expanded to provide more products and services. Stakeholders  have also expressed differing views on whether the frequency of delivery  should be reduced to help USPS address its financial problems. USPS  and PRC have estimated that eliminating Saturday delivery would reduce  USPS\u2019s costs but also would likely affect mail volume sent by business  mailers, although USPS and PRC disagreed on the degree to which it  would do so. USPS estimated that it could save $1.4 billion to $1.8  billion a year by reducing the frequency of mail delivery to 5 days while  maintaining 7-day package delivery. To put these potential savings into  context, delivery is USPS\u2019s most costly operation. We reported, however,  that USPS would face challenges in, among other things, how efficiently  USPS would absorb the additional volume delivered in the remaining  delivery days and its potential effect on mail volume. We also described  potential trade-offs, such as possibly reducing the demand and value of  USPS products if customers are not getting their delivery needs met.", "Further, key postal stakeholders hold opposing views on many other  options that have been proposed. For example, to raise revenues, USPS  and some postal labor unions favor eliminating or raising the price cap on  market-dominant products, which would enable USPS to raise rates more  than the rate of inflation but would require changing the current regulatory  system.

If a reassessment concluded that USPS  should be fully self-sustaining, past legislative proposals that would  change elements of USPS\u2019s costs and revenues may be worth  congressional consideration. Stakeholders, however, have not reached  a consensus on any of these proposals and none has been enacted.", "Another avenue is to focus on reducing costs. As we have also reported,  compensation and benefits costs, which comprise about three-quarters of  USPS\u2019s operating costs, are driven by a mix of USPS contracts and  policies, including collective bargaining agreements negotiated with  unions representing 92 percent of USPS employees and statutory  requirements governing USPS employee pay and benefits. USPS  compensation and benefits costs for its active employees increased by  almost $1 billion in fiscal year 2019 despite a slight decrease in the size  of the workforce and declining workload from reduced mail volume.", "While USPS has been able to make some reductions in pay and benefits,  its ability to control compensation costs is significantly inhibited by the  collective bargaining process, which results in binding arbitration if an  impasse is reached. According to USPS, all negotiations take place  against the backdrop of binding arbitration (and the arbitrators have  historically been reluctant to deviate from the status quo), resulting in only  incremental changes. We have long supported changing the laws  regarding collective bargaining to require that USPS\u2019s financial condition  be considered in binding arbitration. We have also reported that the  collective bargaining structure, which was established many years ago,  should be reexamined considering the dramatic changes in USPS\u2019s  competitive environment and rising personnel costs that have contributed  to USPS\u2019s losses.", "Multiple bills have been proposed changing the process and/or criteria for  collective bargaining to a different standard. The 2018 report from the  Task Force on the United States Postal System recommended that  collective bargaining over compensation should be eliminated for postal  employees. While eliminating or revising the collective bargaining  process could potentially provide USPS greater flexibility in employee  pay, there would be trade-offs. For example, we recently found that the  potential annual cost savings associated with USPS implementing cuts  for all current employee pay by 1 percent would be about $321 million; a  10 percent cut would potentially save $3.2 billion. However, we also  reported that while USPS could reduce its compensation costs through  efforts such as reducing mail delivery frequency, USPS would face  challenges in realizing these savings, such as the extent to which  workhours could be reduced. Furthermore, these savings could be offset  by other factors including service or morale issues.", "With respect to benefits, we recently reported on a wide range of possible  changes that would reduce or limit costs for postal retiree health benefits,  nearly all of which would require a legislative change. Some approaches  would shift costs to the federal government; some would reduce benefits  or increase costs to postal retirees or employees; and some approaches  would change how benefits are funded. Similar types of legislative  changes could be considered with respect to postal pension benefits.", "In addition, if Congress decides that USPS should be financially self- sustaining but makes no changes to improve USPS\u2019s financial condition,  USPS will be unable to address unfunded liabilities for postal retiree  health and pension benefits, an inability that could eventually translate  into higher costs for future postal ratepayers.

Thus, there may be a tension between  attempting to fulfill public service missions while operating in an efficient,  business-like and financially self-sustaining manner. USPS officials told  us that as an entity of the federal government, its primary purpose is the  achievement of its statutory universal service mission, and it has no  incentive to seek to maximize profits at the expense of achieving its public  service mission over the long term.", "Therefore, according to USPS, if it were maintained as an independent  establishment of the executive branch or converted into a more typical  government agency, it could continue to prioritize this public service  mission. Additionally, there is widespread support for USPS\u2019s institutional  status as an independent establishment of the executive branch.  Congressional resolutions have been introduced stating that \u201cCongress  should take all appropriate measures to ensure that the United States  Postal Service remains an independent establishment of the Federal  Government and is not subject to privatization.\u201d Likewise, all four of the  largest USPS unions, both of its management organizations, and a  number of mailer groups and mailers support keeping USPS an  independent establishment of the executive branch.", "Nonetheless, considering the depth of USPS\u2019s financial problems and its  poor financial outlook, now may be an appropriate time for Congress to  reconsider what institutional structure will be most appropriate for USPS  in the 21st century. However, any substantial change to USPS\u2019s  institutional status would require changing federal law. Based on our past  work and options identified by USPS and others, Congress has a range of  options it could consider in reassessing USPS\u2019s structure (see table 1).", "The potential advantages and disadvantages of placing USPS into  alternative institutional structures for USPS have long been debated.  Several options have been discussed:", "USPS could revert to a traditional federal agency. USPS and its  governance would be more consistent with other federal activities that  are dependent on federal appropriations provided through the annual  appropriations process. Many postal stakeholders, however, do not  support such a change. For example, USPS told us that if it became a  typical government agency reliant on federal appropriations to fill any  operating gap, the political constraints that typically apply to  government agencies could reduce USPS\u2019s adaptability. Furthermore,  changing USPS to a typical government agency could reduce its  incentives to increase revenues or reduce costs in response to  changing communication technologies and patterns. Consistent with  this point, the 1968 presidential commission found that when it  operated as a federal agency, the former U.S. Post Office Department  had a lack of innovation, cost-control, and capital investment with  major managerial decisions made through the legislative process.  These and other issues led to persistent operational deficits, low  productivity, and poor mail service.", "USPS could remain an independent establishment of the federal  government with additional authority\u2014relative to the status quo\u2014over  certain aspects of its business model. For example, USPS could be  provided more flexibility to raise postal rates, introduce new nonpostal  products, and make various changes to reduce its costs such as  reducing the frequency of delivery or further consolidating its retail,  transportation, and processing networks. USPS has long advocated  for additional flexibility under its current institutional structure\u2014such  as to eliminate the price cap on market-dominant products and have  greater flexibility to offer nonpostal products. Representatives from  postal unions also stated that USPS should be provided additional  flexibility, such as to expand into nonpostal products, which some  representatives stated could help preserve its public service mission  to provide universal postal services. Consensus does not, however,  exist as to what flexibility should be given to USPS. For example,  some mailer groups favor keeping the price cap unchanged, stating  the cap is sufficient and provides incentives for increased efficiency.", "In addition, some stakeholders have supported further limiting USPS\u2019s  flexibility to reduce service standards, close retail outlets, or  consolidate processing facilities, while other stakeholders noted that  greater flexibilities in these areas would reduce USPS\u2019s costs and  enhance its efficiency.", "If USPS were to become a government-owned corporation or a  government-sponsored enterprise, USPS could be incentivized to  increase efficiency as a federally chartered entity providing a public  service with a predominantly business nature. For example, three of  the four third-party experts we spoke with stated that USPS should  retain its current mission of universal postal service but become more  like a private company with greater freedom to operate in a business- like manner. The new structure could promote greater incentives  toward cost control and financial success. Government-owned  corporations are federally chartered entities that provide a public  service with a predominantly business nature. These corporations can  have a board of directors that is appointed by the President.  Government-sponsored enterprises are federally chartered entities  that are privately owned and, typically, have a board of directors  appointed by private sector owners.", "If USPS were to be a private company it would become accountable  to the shareholders of that company. USPS told us that as a private  company, its primary incentive could be to maximize profits and that,  in USPS\u2019s view, private shareholders would be most focused on  short-term financial outcomes. Thus, any such design of a private  USPS would need to balance its profit motive with the nation\u2019s needs  for universal postal service and the affordability of that service. For  example, while Royal Mail is a private corporation owned by  shareholders, the government of the United Kingdom still mandates 6- day delivery for letter mail (and 5-day delivery for packages) with  specified delivery standards, and some mail types are subject to price  controls. In addition, the United Kingdom monitors the provision of  universal postal service and can take enforcement actions regarding  regulatory conditions and competition law. Similarly, Germany has  legal instruments to enforce the provision of universal postal services,  although according to German government officials these instruments  have not been used.", "Although some of the domestic businesses we examined reduced their  costs through bankruptcy, this is likely not an option for USPS. As  detailed in its report (see appendix I), National Bankruptcy Conference  (NBC) found that USPS is not eligible to become a \u201cdebtor\u201d under  chapters 11 or 9 of the current Bankruptcy Code. According to NBC, a  court likely would deem USPS to be a \u201cgovernmental unit\u201d\u2014meaning it  could not file for relief under chapter 11\u2014and a court would deem USPS  not to be a \u201cmunicipality\u201d\u2014meaning it could not file for relief under  chapter 9. Therefore, legislation amending the Code would be required to  make USPS eligible for relief.", "According to NBC, however, even if the Bankruptcy Code were amended  to allow USPS to file as a chapter 11 or 9 debtor, the Code would still not  currently authorize a bankruptcy court to discharge the ongoing statutory  obligations that have led to USPS\u2019s current financial situation, and  amending the Code to authorize such court action could raise  constitutional (separation of powers) concerns. Moreover, NBC noted the  bankruptcy process is designed to address obligations that have already  accrued, not to override or amend statutes that apply to a debtor\u2019s post- bankruptcy operations and obligations. In NBC\u2019s opinion, because  USPS\u2019s pension and health care obligations are imposed by statute  instead of by contract as in most bankruptcy reorganization proceedings,  the bankruptcy process is not an effective or appropriate mechanism to  address USPS\u2019s obligations or potential transformation. NBC thus  concluded that \u201calthough the bankruptcy process and bankruptcy tools  raise interesting ideas for restructuring USPS\u2019s existing and future  obligations\u2026all roads for doing so lead back to Congress.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Any changes that Congress makes to USPS\u2019s business model will take  time to implement and will need to be reevaluated as market conditions  evolve. We have reported that fully implementing major transformations of  government agencies can take years, and we also found that to be the  case for the selected domestic businesses and foreign posts noted in this  report, regardless of the changes needed. For example, railroads in the  Northeast, airlines, and automakers took many years to implement a  series of changes to their businesses. It took Germany more than a  decade to fully liberalize and then privatize its postal operator, and the  United Kingdom\u2019s effort to privatize its postal operator took about 5 years.  All of these organizations continue to adapt as they address ongoing  challenges in a changing and highly competitive business environment.  For example, GM recently stated that years after exiting bankruptcy and  restoring profitability, it is closing some factories and focusing on  developing electric and self-driving cars. Several freight railroads facing  a downturn in freight traffic have also decided to run longer trains less  frequently to reduce labor costs and increase efficiencies.", "Similarly, changes in the use of postal services will continue for the  foreseeable future, necessitating continued adaptation. Some of the  countries we selected are anticipating the need to be prepared for  possible future changes. For example:  In August 2019, German government officials said they would  consider reducing postal delivery frequency from 6 to 5 days a week  as part of an ongoing review to adapt Germany\u2019s 20-year old postal  law to changing market conditions and customer demands.", "In the United Kingdom, the postal regulator assessed postal users\u2019  needs in 2020 in light of the changes in the postal market and to  prepare for its regulatory review, which is to be concluded by 2022.", "A 2018 consultant\u2019s report to the European Union (EU) recommended  that the EU relax its universal service obligations to accommodate  future changes in the postal market. The EU is currently studying  how postal users\u2019 needs are changing to determine if it needs to  change its framework to allow member states to change their  definitions of universal service obligations.", "In November 2019, the Australian government ordered a review of  Australia Post\u2019s long-term strategy to operate as a sustainable postal  service provider, considering market conditions such as e-commerce,  the regulatory environment and changes in business and consumer  service needs.", "The government of New Zealand is scheduled to revise its  memorandum of understanding with New Zealand Post defining  universal service obligations by 2021."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Calls for Congressional Action to Address USPS\u2019s Solvency Remain Unaddressed", "paragraphs": ["PAEA required GAO to evaluate strategies and options for the long-term  structural and operational reform of USPS by December 2011. As  USPS continued to face financial challenges, we accelerated this  evaluation, which we issued in April 2010. However, we found that  USPS\u2019s business model, which was to provide universal postal service  through self-supporting, business-like operations as an independent  establishment of the executive branch, was not viable due to USPS\u2019s  inability to reduce costs sufficiently to respond to continuing declines in  mail volume and revenue. In particular, we identified strategies to reduce  compensation and benefit costs, reduce other operations and network  costs, improve efficiency, and generate revenues through product and  pricing flexibility. We also stated that while USPS may be able to improve  its financial viability if it took more aggressive action to reduce costs, it  was unlikely that those actions alone would fully resolve USPS\u2019s  problems unless Congress also took action.", "Therefore, we stated that Congress should consider, among other things,  any and all options available to reduce USPS\u2019s costs. While bills on these  issues were introduced and in some cases passed congressional  committees, postal reform legislation to address these considerations has  not been enacted. In addition, in our most recent update to our High Risk  List in 2019, we reiterated the basic elements of our 2010 matter for  congressional consideration by stating that Congress should consider  various options to better align USPS\u2019s costs with its revenues. We stated  that Congress should consider addressing constraints and legal  restrictions that limit USPS\u2019s ability to reduce costs and improve efficiency  through considering a comprehensive package of legislative actions. To  date, such a legislative package has not been enacted.", "Furthermore, we reported in 2018 that the financial outlook for the Postal  Service\u2019s Retiree Health Benefits Fund was poor, as USPS had not made  any payments into it since 2010. OPM then forecasted the fund would  be depleted by 2030 if USPS continued to not make payments.

Absent congressional action on critical foundational  elements of the USPS business model, USPS\u2019s mission and financial  solvency are increasingly in peril. USPS\u2019s growing difficulties to provide  universal postal service in a financially self-sustaining matter provide  Congress with the need to consider fundamental reform of the entire  framework of postal services in the United States. In so doing, we  continue to believe that as we stated in 2010, Congress should consider  any and all available options. Comprehensive postal reform has not taken  place in part because of the difficulty in obtaining compromise among  various stakeholders with divergent views. Comprehensive, effective, and  successful reform cannot occur until there is leadership and clarity  around: what services should be provided, whether USPS is to be fully financially self-sustaining or the extent of  federal financial support, and what institutional structure best supports these changes.", "Congressional leadership is critical in transforming USPS because  consensus on policy decisions involving value judgments, trade-offs, and  effects on postal stakeholders will be difficult to achieve. In addressing  these issues, while all stakeholders\u2019 interests should be understood and  taken into consideration, the fundamental needs of the nation must take  precedence.

USPS noted that the recent COVID-19 pandemic has both  highlighted USPS\u2019s essential role in the nation\u2019s infrastructure and has  caused a significant and sudden decline in mail volume, leading to a  short-term liquidity crisis. USPS stated that while action by Congress is  critical to ensure its ability to operate in the short-term, its financial  situation has long been unsustainable due to statutory and regulatory  structures that limit their ability to increase revenues and decrease costs.  USPS noted that these changes require Congress to adopt reforms to  secure USPS\u2019s long-term financial viability. In addition, USPS concurred  with the National Bankruptcy Conference\u2019s legal analysis that Federal  bankruptcy laws do not apply to USPS and that all roads for USPS  restructuring lead back to Congress.", "USPS generally agreed with our third matter, stating that determining the  institutional structure could logically be a part of a comprehensive  congressional examination of its business model. USPS stated that it  does not believe that corporatization or privatization would unlock new  efficiency potential in USPS and that sustainable postal service does not  hinge on the provider\u2019s institutional form. However, as we and USPS  have stated, its current legal and regulatory structure does not provide  flexibility in some key areas. While our report states that a corporate or  privatized institutional structure could provide both the flexibility and a  greater incentive to operate in a more business-like manner than USPS\u2019s  current structure, we also recognize there are advantages and  disadvantages to any institutional structure. As a result, we are not  recommending any particular institutional structure for USPS, but are  urging that Congress identify what institutional structure could best deliver  the level of postal services at the level of financial sustainability that  Congress determines.", "In its response, PRC agreed with all of our matters for congressional  consideration. Particularly, PRC noted that the matter to reassess and  determine the level of universal postal service the nation requires must be  addressed as soon as possible. The PRC noted that given USPS\u2019s  severe and worsening financial situation (even before the impacts of the  current pandemic crisis), a clear and specific definition of universal postal  service and how that obligation can be funded must be provided. The  PRC stated that Congress may want to consider mandating that PRC  define and update the universal service definition by regulation.", "Both USPS and PRC provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Postmaster General, the Chairman of PRC, and other  interested parties.
