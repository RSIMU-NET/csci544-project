While EM contracts authorize fees (i.e., profits) to motivate management contractors to high-quality performance, subpar performance in the areas of controlling costs and meeting schedules has repeatedly occurred. For example, a 1996 study commissioned by EM found that while cost and schedule performance had improved since 1993, cost overruns on EM projects still ranged from 30 percent to 50 percent.More broadly, in November 1996, we found that, of 15 major system acquisitions completed by the Department of Energy (DOE) from 1980 through 1996, the projects cost an average of 63 percent more than the original cost estimates and were completed an average of 71 months late.More recently, DOE\u2019s Inspector General found a number of problems with the implementation of performance incentives in management contracts, including DOE having paid incentives for work that was not completed by the required performance date, for work done before performance measures were established, and for work that was not done at all.", "EM\u2019s privatization program is one aspect of DOE\u2019s Department-wide effort that began in 1994 to reform the Department\u2019s contracting practices, including an increased emphasis on the use of performance incentives and fixed-price contracts. EM\u2019s privatization approach currently has two key elements. First, privatization uses fixed-price contracts under which the contractor is paid a fixed amount for acceptable goods and services regardless of the costs the contractor incurs. Second, privatization contractors are expected to provide private financing for the construction of facilities, if needed, to produce the final product EM is buying. The privatization program receives a separate appropriation to cover the capital investment portion of these contracts. However, in the event the contract is terminated by the government before completion, the privatization funding will be used to reimburse the contractor for its capital investment. If the contract is continued through completion, the privatization funding will be used to repay the capital investment as acceptable goods or services are provided. Although this is the current approach to privatization, according to DOE officials, EM\u2019s privatization program will continue to evolve over time as DOE learns more through evaluating actual business proposals.", "The privatization program was first funded in fiscal year (FY) 1997, when the Congress appropriated $330 million to support five projects, including the Tank Waste Remediation System at Hanford (see table 1 below). In FY 1998, the Congress provided an additional $200 million for one existing project and four new projects, including Spent Nuclear Fuel projects at Savannah River and at Idaho, a transportation project at Carlsbad, and a waste disposal project at Oak Ridge. In addition, the Congress provided $31.7 million in FY 1998 through the Defense Facilities Closure Projects account for two smaller privatization projects at EM\u2019s Fernald Environmental Management Project in Ohio. The FY 1999 budget request includes about $517 million to continue work on ongoing privatization projects at Hanford, Idaho, and Oak Ridge, and one new transportation project administered by the Carlsbad Area Office.", "In 1997, we reported problems with DOE\u2019s FY 1997 and FY 1998 privatization budget requests. These included estimated costs for projects that did not always include all relevant costs, such as those that would be incurred by the sites\u2019 management contractors to support privatized projects. In addition, funding for some projects was not needed when requested. For example, although funds were requested for FY 1998, we found that the Power Burst Facility at Idaho would not be ready for deactivation until FY 1999. In addition, in computing cost savings, EM did not always compare projects of comparable scope, as in the case of the Savannah River M-Area Mixed Waste Tank Remediation project. Finally, in its fiscal year 1997 budget request, EM cited the Idaho Pit 9 project as a successful privatization on the basis of its placement of a fixed-price contract. However, we found that, since the contract was let, the project has fallen significantly behind schedule and that EM and its management contractor are involved in a disagreement with the fixed-price subcontractor over a number of performance issues. The future course, including the ultimate cost, of this project is uncertain until these disagreements have been formally resolved.", "These early problems with implementing the privatization program have led to concern in the Congress about whether privatization, as defined by EM, is appropriate for large, capital-intensive projects. These concerns led the Congress to deny a substantial portion of EM\u2019s FY 1998 privatization budget request and to require EM to submit detailed reports analyzing privatization contracts for a 30-day congressional review before incurring any additional contractual obligations. Specifically, DOE cannot (1) enter into a new privatization contract, (2) exercise authorization to proceed with a privatization contract, or (3) extend a privatization contract by more than 1 year without providing the Congress an opportunity to review the proposed action."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, asked us to review EM\u2019s privatization program.

During our site visits, we gathered information on cleanup projects formally proposed for privatization. We also reviewed a judgmentally selected group of cleanup projects that used an alternative to the traditional method of having the management contractor perform the work on a cost-reimbursement basis, such as the use of various forms of fixed-price and cost-reimbursement incentive contracts. In addition, to determine what factors DOE considers in selecting the type of contract for cleanup projects, we interviewed the privatization coordinators, contracting staff, and project management staff at each of the sites. At DOE headquarters, we also interviewed officials from (1) EM\u2019s Office of Program Integration, (2) DOE\u2019s Contract Reform and Privatization Project Office, and (3) DOE\u2019s Office of Procurement and Assistance Management. We researched the Federal Acquisition Regulation for information on the various types of contracts, their major features, and criteria for selecting which type of contract to use. Finally, we interviewed officials from the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Environmental Division.", "To identify alternative financing approaches for EM\u2019s privatization contracts, we interviewed officials of companies currently participating in privatization projects and representatives of financial consulting firms that help clients secure capital for environmental and construction projects. We also discussed project financing issues with the DOE headquarters and field staff listed above and searched relevant financial literature to gather background on issues such as private firms\u2019 capital structures and estimation of financing costs. Finally, we constructed a model using actual data from the contract for the Idaho Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project. We used the model to determine the comparative costs of financing under several scenarios. We received assistance in the modeling effort from our Office of the Chief Economist.", "To evaluate how alternative financing and contracting approaches might affect budget scoring of EM\u2019s privatization projects, we analyzed the scoring guidelines in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-11.

For example, the regulation finds that fixed-price contracts are appropriate when projects are well-defined, uncertainties can be allocated between the parties, and sufficient price information and/or multiple competing bidders are available to help determine a fair and reasonable price for the work. In addition, EM\u2019s projects place special demands on both EM and the contractor which must be considered when selecting the contracting strategy that will be most cost-effective. For example, contracts for EM\u2019s projects must consider the need to indemnify contractors for accidents involving nuclear materials. Over the past few years, EM has had some success with fixed-price cleanup contracts; however, experiences in Idaho and Oak Ridge illustrate that fixed-price contracting is not appropriate for every cleanup project."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Factors to Consider When Selecting Fixed-Price Contracts", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Acquisition Regulation finds that fixed-price contracting is the preferred type of contract for government acquisitions when certain conditions are met. In general, a fixed-price contract provides the most incentive for the contractor to perform efficiently and to exercise cost control. The risk of cost overruns from poor performance is generally borne by the contractor, which helps to protect the government\u2019s interest. In addition, most fixed-price contracts are awarded through an open competition process that helps the government determine a fair price for the work. The conditions most conducive to using fixed-price contracts include the following: a clearly defined scope of work; low probability of major changes to work scope or conditions to avoid costly renegotiation of price; existence of proven technologies that can be applied with no more than sufficient price information and/or multiple competing bidders to aid in determining a fair price for the work, that is, a price that minimizes the cost to the government while providing a fair profit to the contractor; easily verifiable performance measures to facilitate monitoring progress toward project completion; and thorough analysis of risks and appropriate allocation or sharing of risks so that the party best able to manage each risk is responsible for addressing it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EM Has Used Fixed-Price Contracts Successfully", "paragraphs": ["When the conditions discussed above have been present, EM has used several varieties of fixed-price contracts to help ensure cost-effective cleanup. For example, Idaho and Hanford have used fixed-price contracts for laundry services for items such as contaminated workers\u2019 uniforms. DOE has estimated the savings from the Idaho contract at $3 million to $8 million over the next 10 years, and savings from the Hanford contract are estimated to be about $4.5 million per year. Hanford also contracted for the treatment of 24,000 to 26,000 gallons of tri-butyl phosphate wastes on a fixed-price contract at a total savings of about $1.5 million. At Savannah River, the M-Area Mixed Waste Tank Remediation project was privatized in 1993. While the contractor has experienced some technical problems, the contractor expects to successfully complete waste treatment operations under the terms of the original contract. EM estimates this contract will save a total of $19 million to 28 million. Finally, at Idaho the fixed-price contract for low-level waste treatment has a unit cost of about one-half that of the on-site facility that formerly performed this work.", "While EM\u2019s focus in pursuing fixed-price contracts has been on saving money, fixed-price contracts can incorporate incentives that accommodate other goals. For example, Oak Ridge used an incentive to reduce the amount of waste created in its contract for the cleanup of the St. Louis North County site of the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. If the contractor shipped less waste, primarily soil, to the designated disposal site than estimated in the contract, DOE avoided the costs of waste disposal. As an incentive for the contractor to minimize waste shipments, DOE split the value of those savings with the contractor. Similarly, the contracts for the Oak Ridge Broad Spectrum Low-Level Mixed Waste Treatment are planned to include incentives for minimizing the volume of waste to be disposed of or stored after treatment.", "If a fixed-price contract does not appear to be cost-effective, other contracting methods may offer similar benefits. One such alternative is the use of incentives in cost-reimbursement contracts to motivate the contractor to achieve better cost control and performance. For example, Oak Ridge and its management contractor agreed to cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts for several cleanup projects. While the contractor\u2019s costs were covered, the only way for the contractor to earn a fee or profit on the work was to meet or improve on cost and schedule targets. Under this contract, if the contractor missed the targets by specified amounts, the fee earned could be a negative amount, that is, a loss. The first of these incentive projects was for the demolition of a powerhouse complex on the K-25 site. The project was completed 6 months ahead of schedule and $5 million under target cost. Under another cost-plus-incentive-fee contract for the demolition of cooling towers on the K-25 site, the contractor completed the project 2 months ahead of schedule and more than $5 million under target cost, partly by finding an innovative way to dispose of contaminated water that had accumulated in the basins under the cooling towers. (See app. I for further discussion of alternative contract types and illustrative examples of EM\u2019s cleanup contracts using them.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Factors Beyond the Contract Type Need to Be Considered", "paragraphs": ["When contracting for cleanup, EM must also consider additional factors that occur because of the unique characteristics of cleanup projects and the special conditions pertaining to working in the DOE complex. These factors include several types of risks that must be shared or allocated between EM and the contractor, the unique aspects of each project, and the availability of personnel to properly manage fixed-price procurements and projects.", "Risks must be identified and addressed in the contract so that each party\u2019s responsibilities are clearly defined. Some risks, such as the possibility of changes in environmental regulations during a project\u2019s lifetime, third-party liability and insurance, environmental indemnification, construction cost and schedule changes, interest rate fluctuations, material cost escalation, lack of sufficient appropriations to support the original schedule, and termination for convenience of the government, are not unique to EM\u2019s cleanup projects but must still be considered in estimating the contract price. Other risks, such as indemnification for accidents involving nuclear materials, working with EM\u2019s stakeholders, and addressing the concerns of unionized workers at EM sites, generally are not found outside of the DOE complex. There are also risks inherent in cleanup projects, such as determining whether the existing waste characterization data are sufficient to support technology selection or design, and how new or existing treatment technologies will perform on a specific waste stream. EM also faces risks such as pre-existing site conditions and paying contractors for idle facilities if, for example, EM or the management contractor fails to deliver waste for treatment as specified in the contract.", "EM\u2019s 1997 Privatization Project Team Staffing Report states that \u201cmplementing privatization will require the modification of the Department\u2019s traditional project management practices.\u201d When compared to starting cleanup projects using management contractors, EM officials acknowledge that using fixed-price contracts requires additional project definition and planning before and during the procurement process. Under management contracts, EM managers could make changes as the project progressed without explicit recognition of the costs of those changes. While fixed-price contracts can help to reduce costs and improve performance when used properly, the cost of any changes to work scope must be negotiated with the contractor, potentially raising the price of the contract. In recognition of that fact, EM\u2019s Privatization Management Planrequires that privatization contracts contain a clause limiting who can direct the contractor to make changes that could affect the scope (and, implicitly, the price) of the contract. Not all EM managers are comfortable using fixed-price contracts because of this limited flexibility to make changes after the contract is awarded.", "Using fixed-price contracts requires that employees have a different skill mix than EM has needed in the past to manage cleanup projects through its management contracts. The Project Team Staffing report also highlighted some areas in which EM managers will need new or strengthened skills to effectively implement the program. For example, the report notes that privatization procurements require more effort in the early stages of procurement development and more staffing in contract administration and monitoring. The report also recognizes that EM project teams have not traditionally had all of the skills\u2014such as those associated with corporate budgeting, capital market analysis, financing of employee benefit programs, and hands-on experience developing complex schedules and project management plans\u2014needed to ensure that privatization procurements and contracts are fully executable. Consequently, some project managers and procurement staff may need additional training to use fixed-price contracts to full advantage. One step DOE has taken to address these new demands on its staff is to require that all privatization procurement requests for proposals and contracts be sent to headquarters for review and concurrence by functional experts, staff in the Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, and other key officials before they are issued. In addition, EM management is working with the field offices to develop a new training curriculum to provide project managers and procurement staff with additional skills so that they can better recognize when to use fixed-price contracts.", "Our work has repeatedly highlighted continuing problems with DOE\u2019s management of projects and contracts. In November 1996, we reported that lack of sufficient DOE personnel with the appropriate skills to oversee contractors\u2019 operations was one of the key factors underlying the cost overruns and schedule slippages DOE has experienced in major systems acquisitions. In March 1997, we reported that a key cleanup project at EM\u2019s Fernald, Ohio, site has experienced significant delay and cost growth because DOE did not assign a sufficient number of staff with the proper skills to the project. Finally, as we discuss in detail in the next section, Idaho has experienced problems with the Pit 9 cleanup, which DOE chose to privatize, in part, because of the lack of in-house expertise in large remediation projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Fixed Price Contracts DOEs Not Guarantee That EM Will Achieve the Cost Reduction and Performance Anticipated", "paragraphs": ["Without careful attention to devising the right type of contract, the unique aspects of cleanup projects, and proper management oversight, EM may not get the cost reduction and performance it anticipates from using fixed-price contracts. As we noted in our recent report on DOE\u2019s estimates of potential savings from privatizing cleanup projects, DOE\u2019s use of fixed-price contracts has not always been an effective method to minimize cost growth on projects. EM contracted with a consulting firm, which issued a report in November 1993 and an update in April 1996, to review EM\u2019s performance on cleanup projects performed under both cost-reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. The report found that EM\u2019s costs for environmental work were substantially higher than private industry\u2019s. In 1993, it found that growth from estimated to actual costs on a sample of 65 projects with fixed-price contracts was almost 75 percent. In the 1996 update, it reported that EM\u2019s projects typically cost 25 percent to 40 percent more than similar projects in the private sector. While it found that EM\u2019s cost performance had improved since the 1993 review, EM was still experiencing cost growth in the range of 30 percent to 50 percent over original estimates. It concluded that this cost growth has occurred primarily because projects were poorly defined, leading to change orders after the contracts were signed.", "In 1994, Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company, the management contractor at Idaho, awarded a fixed-price subcontract to Lockheed Martin Advanced Environmental Systems (LMAES) for the cleanup of Pit 9. Pit 9 is about one acre in size and contains various wastes ranging from contaminated rags to plutonium-contaminated sludge. The cleanup was expected to cost about $200 million and to be completed in 1999. DOE chose a fixed-price approach for the Pit 9 project because Department officials believed a fixed price would help limit the project\u2019s total cost and provide an incentive for contractors to use efficient practices in carrying out the project by shifting the risk of nonperformance to the contractors. During the early stages of the procurement process, concerns arose about the appropriateness of a fixed-price approach given the uncertainty about the contents of the pit. Nevertheless, senior DOE officials decided that this approach was warranted, given the high costs and the inefficient performance the Department had experienced with cost-reimbursement contracts, private industry\u2019s expressed interest in performing the cleanup using a fixed-price arrangement, and the potential benefits of the approach.", "However, in March 1997, when the subcontractor estimated that project completion would be 26 months behind schedule, LMAES requested an equitable adjustment and conversion of the contract type to cost reimbursement. LMAES claims that DOE failed to properly describe the contents of the pit and that DOE and its management contractor have interfered with the contractor\u2019s operations, preventing it from meeting its contractual commitments. DOE and the management contractor at Idaho disagree with LMAES\u2019 claims and claim, in their turn, that the contractor failed to properly manage the project. LMAES has requested a total of $257 million for costs through June 1997, $78 million more than the project was expected to cost, but the waste retrieval and processing facilities are not ready and no wastes have been retrieved or processed. As of May 1998, these issues remain unresolved and the project remains stalled.", "In Oak Ridge, a multiphase cleanup project was discontinued after the first phase because the treatment system proposed by the contractor was too expensive and treatment was determined not to be necessary. The management contractor, Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, attempted to contract with multiple firms for the first phase of the West End Treatment Facility project to design a treatment process for a fixed payment. However, they discovered that because the project required each contractor to be able to perform several different types of activities\u2014such as removing sludge from storage tanks, transferring the waste to a treatment facility, and treating the waste\u2014only one firm submitted a responsive bid. Ultimately, the management contractor recommended to EM that the second phase procurement for waste treatment be canceled, but because only one contract had been let, and that contractor had invested more than the fixed amount, EM ended up paying a negotiated equitable adjustment that more than doubled the cost of the first phase contract from $400,000 to about $900,000. In retrospect, EM and management contractor officials told us that they should have reconsidered the project when only one responsive bid was received and determined why they did not receive the level of competition they were expecting. The lack of competition in the procurement for the first phase of this project ultimately led to increased costs when the later phases of the project were canceled.", "Another project at Idaho for the long-term storage of damaged fuel from the Three Mile Island reactor has been delayed and the fixed-price contract has been modified 12 times. The Idaho project managers stated that a fixed-price contract would probably not have been chosen for this project if they had known that a change from DOE regulation to Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulation would be made and that the condition of temporarily stored fuel was different from what was expected at the time the contract was awarded. In this instance, the delays and contract modifications have added about $4 million (or 33 percent) to the cost of the project, raising the cost from $12 million to $16 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternative Financing Approaches Exist for EM\u2019s Privatization Program", "paragraphs": ["EM\u2019s privatization program relies on private financing of construction costs to create a performance incentive for the contractor to construct a successful facility.

They are likely to hire various consultants to review all aspects of the contractor\u2019s plans to ensure that the project is feasible, which provides assurance that the likelihood of contractor failure is minimized. In addition, if the contractor does fail to complete the project for some reason, this oversight provides further assurance to the lenders that they could take over the project, bring in another contractor to complete it, and recoup their investment.", "While fixed-price contracting is believed to provide some greater control over price, EM believes that private financing is key to ensuring that the project is successful. With only a fixed-price contract and no private financing at stake, EM is concerned that it will have little recourse against a contractor that does not deliver as promised. EM\u2019s concern stems from the fact that contractors that have expressed an interest in large cleanup projects have indicated that they will form separate subsidiaries to perform the contract, using a commonly employed approach known as limited liability companies, that are heavily debt-financed and have few assets of their own. Without appropriate warranties from the parent company, the use of these limited liability companies can financially and legally isolate the project from the parent companies and limit the parent companies\u2019 liability for contract performance.

Finally, with total government financing, no private financing costs are incurred because contractors are paid as costs are incurred.", "While government financing of construction costs would appear to be the most attractive option, under this approach the government is assuming a much greater level of performance risk than it would face under a private financing option. This risk includes the risk that the facility the government finances will not be completed successfully or that the facility will experience significant cost growth. The potential costs associated with these risks could offset\u2014or more than offset\u2014any potential benefits of lower-cost government financing. On the basis of DOE\u2019s past experience with major government financed projects, including EM\u2019s projects, these risks are real. For example, we found that between 1980 and 1996, 31 of DOE\u2019s 80 major system acquisitions were terminated prior to completion after the government had expended over $10 billion, in part, as the result of weaknesses in DOE\u2019s contractor management. In addition, for the 15 projects that were completed, final costs exceeded original estimates by an average of 63 percent. However, it is difficult to determine how much of the costs attributable to these risks could have been reduced through the use of more private financing.", "We found that termination and/or cost growth of projects is the result of a variety of factors\u2014some of which may be affected by the choice of financing. For example, the risk of cost growth because of a flawed system of incentives for contractors may be reduced by private financing that provides better incentives to perform. However, other factors contributing to risk may not be dependent on the financing choice. For example, changes in work scope could result in terminations or cost growth under any financing approach. As a result, it is difficult to quantify the degree of performance risk borne by the government as government involvement in financing increases. This uncertainty is represented in figure 3.1 by a potential range of additional performance risk assumed by the government with increased levels of government financing.", "The options that lie between total private financing and total government financing attempt to strike a balance in the trade-off between the cost of financing and the cost of added performance risk. The cost of added performance risk to the government is difficult to quantify, but it must be considered in weighing any decision to reduce private-sector risk (thereby increasing government risk) by lowering financing costs.", "The consideration of added risk costs has been recognized in the government\u2019s policy on the guarantee of debt. If EM were to pursue an option whereby it would guarantee debt, EM would have to estimate and obtain funding for the subsidy cost of providing that debt guarantee. Thus, assuming a 100-percent debt guarantee, costs would include construction costs ($244.6 million), contractor financing costs ($104.1 million), and an estimated subsidy cost. That subsidy cost would largely consist of an estimate of the risk that a contractor might default on its debt obligations. While the estimate of the subsidy cost is difficult, the risk of default could be high for a complex facility that typifies some of EM\u2019s cleanup projects. If the subsidy cost estimate is higher than $33.8 million, then according to our model, this option would be more expensive than total private financing.", "The consideration of added risk costs must also be recognized for other financing alternatives to private financing. Using our model, under a performance-based partial-payment plan whereby EM pays 80 percent of construction costs, EM has placed at risk $195.7 million in payments (80 percent of the $244.6 million in construction costs) over the 5 years of construction. This risk must be weighed against the 20 percent of construction costs plus the financing costs that the private contractor has at stake over the construction period and an initial period of operations. If the private contractor does not perform, it will lose its $48.9 million in construction costs (20 percent of the $244.6 million in construction costs) plus as much as $62.7 million in finance costs. In weighing this type of option, EM will have to consider whether the amount of private-sector investment at risk is enough to ensure that the contractor is motivated to deliver a facility that works as designed without significant cost growth.", "The consideration of the cost of added risk under a progress payment option is similar to the partial payment aspect of the option discussed above. If the facility does not work, EM may not regain its $195.7 million. However, under a progress payment option, the contractor would be paid for its construction costs and financing costs after the facility is successfully completed, thereby avoiding financing costs over the operations period. Thus, the government is assuming some added risk that the facility may not operate as promised over the first 5 years of operations. Unlike the performance-based option, the contractor will have no investment at stake whose recoupment is dependent upon successful operations. In considering this type of option, EM will have to consider whether the payback (or amortization) of the contractor\u2019s costs over the first 5 years of operations is necessary to ensure that the contractor has delivered an effective plant.

This ownership is a positive benefit of government financing that addresses monopoly concerns about private ownership of cleanup facilities. For example, if the private sector owns a facility whose construction costs are paid for after an initial period of operations, it could place the private sector in a monopolistic position for the remainder of the potential operating period. The government may be at a disadvantage in negotiating prices for waste treatment in the future because there will be no other facilities available to compete.
