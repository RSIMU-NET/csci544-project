Requirements in statutes or executive directives were sometimes the impetus for reviews, but agencies more often conducted these retrospective reviews based on their own discretionary authorities. Agencies reported that discretionary reviews more often generated actions, such as amending regulations or changes to guidance. GAO also found that multiple factors, such as data limitations and lack of transparency, impeded agencies' reviews. GAO made 7 recommendations in 2007 to improve the effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews. Among GAO's recommendations were: minimum standards for documenting and reporting completed review results; including public input as a factor in regulatory review decisions; and consideration of how agencies will measure the performance of new regulations. In 2011 and 2012, the administration issued new directives to agencies on how they should plan and conduct analyses of existing regulations that addressed each of GAO's recommendations.", "By executive order, the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reviews draft proposed and final rules from executive agencies, other than independent regulatory agencies. Among the purposes of these reviews are ensuring that regulations are consistent with applicable law and the President's priorities and that decisions made by one agency do not conflict with the policies or actions taken or planned by another. Both OIRA and executive agencies are also required to disclose certain information about the review process. In 2003 and 2009, GAO found that the OIRA regulatory review process often resulted in changes to agencies' rules, but the transparency and documentation of the review process could be improved. GAO made 12 recommendations to OMB about the review process. For example, GAO recommended that OMB provide guidance to agencies regarding documentation of the reasons for an agency's withdrawal of a draft rule from OIRA review and the source or impetus of changes made to rules. OMB to date has implemented only 1 of those 12 recommendations\u2014to clarify information posted about the topic and participants in meetings with outside parties on rules under review. GAO believes that its past recommendations still have merit and would improve the transparency of the OIRA review process.", "GAO's recent work continues to highlight progress in facilitating transparency and public participation as well as room for improvement. In 2012, GAO found that agencies often requested comments when issuing major rules without a notice of proposed rulemaking but missed an opportunity to improve those rules because they did not always respond to the comments. GAO's 2013 review of international regulatory cooperation also found opportunities to better facilitate public participation in these activities. GAO also found that effective international regulatory cooperation requires interagency coordination and effective collaboration with federal agency officials' foreign counterparts. Agency officials stated that they cooperate with their foreign counterparts (1) because they are operating in an increasingly global environment and many products that agencies regulate originate overseas and (2) in an effort to gain efficiencies\u2014for example, by sharing resources or avoiding duplicative work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the federal rulemaking process,  focusing in particular, at your request, on agencies\u2019 efforts to  retrospectively review their existing rules and the regulatory review  process coordinated through the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).", "Federal regulation is a basic tool of government.

Agencies reported that the main  purpose of most of their reviews was to examine the effectiveness of the  implementation of regulations. We found that the agencies had conducted  more retrospective reviews, and a greater variety of these reviews (such  as ones examining the efficiency and effectiveness of regulations and  others identifying opportunities to reduce regulatory burdens) than was  readily apparent, especially to the public. Reviews mandated by  requirements in statutes or executive orders and related OMB  memorandums were sometimes the impetus for reviews, but agencies  more often exercised their own discretionary authorities to review  regulations. As a result of these reviews, agencies amended regulations,  changed guidance and related documents, decided to conduct additional  studies, and confirmed that existing rules achieved the intended results.  Agencies noted that discretionary reviews generated additional action  more often than mandatory reviews, which most often resulted in no  changes.", "We also found that agencies, to varying extents, were developing written  procedures, processes, and standards to guide how they select which  rules to review, analyze those rules, and report the results. Multiple  factors helped or impeded the conduct and usefulness of retrospective  reviews. Agencies identified time and resources as the most critical  barriers, but also cited factors such as data limitations and overlapping or  duplicative review requirements. Nonfederal parties also identified a lack  of transparency in agency review processes as a barrier and said they  were rarely aware of the agencies\u2019 reviews. We made seven  recommendations for executive action in the 2007 report to improve the  effectiveness and transparency of retrospective regulatory reviews.  Among the elements that we recommended incorporating in policies,  procedures, or guidance were: minimum standards for documenting and  reporting completed review results; inclusion of public input as a factor in  regulatory review decisions; and consideration of how agencies will  measure the performance of new regulations.", "OMB took actions that addressed our recommendations which, if  effectively implemented, will improve the transparency, credibility, and  effectiveness of agencies\u2019 retrospective review efforts. For example, in  2011 and 2012, the administration issued new directives to agencies on  how they should plan and conduct analyses of existing regulations,  among other subjects, that addressed each of our prior  recommendations. Collectively, they directed executive agencies and  encouraged independent regulatory agencies to develop and implement  plans to periodically review existing significant regulations. OMB\u2019s  guidance on the 2011 and 2012 executive orders advised agencies to  identify in their final plans specific reforms and initiatives that will  significantly reduce existing regulatory burdens and promote economic  growth and job creation.", "We are currently completing a report at the request of Senators Ron  Johnson and Mark Warner concerning agencies\u2019 retrospective regulatory  analyses under the 2011 and 2012 executive orders.

Unfortunately, as I will detail below, to date, OIRA has  implemented only 1 of our 12 most recent recommendations on this  process.", "A brief explanation of OIRA\u2019s review process provides helpful context for  understanding why these findings and recommendations remain relevant  today. Centralized presidential reviews of agency\u2019s regulations have a  long history and can be traced back to a program established by  President Nixon in 1971. President Reagan\u2019s Executive Order 12291 in  1981 expanded the scope of presidential reviews of rulemakings and  delegated responsibility for this review function to OIRA. President  Clinton\u2019s issuance of Executive Order 12866 in 1993 established the  current process and requirements regarding reviews of covered agencies\u2019  draft proposed and final rules. More recently, in 2011, President Obama  issued Executive Order 13563, which supplemented and reaffirmed the  principles, structures, and definitions governing contemporary regulatory  review established in the 1993 executive order. The basic procedures and  requirements for the regulatory review process today follow the provisions  of that 1993 executive order. This practice of centralized regulatory  reviews is now well established as part of the rulemaking process,  although it continues to attract some controversy and criticism.", "In essence, OIRA is responsible for the coordinated review of agencies\u2019  draft proposed and final rules to ensure that regulations are consistent  with applicable law, the President\u2019s priorities, and the principles set forth  in executive orders. OIRA is also to ensure that decisions made by one  agency do not conflict with the policies or actions taken or planned by  another agency. Executive agencies, except for independent regulatory  agencies, are required to submit their significant regulatory actions to  OIRA for review. OIRA is generally required to complete its review within  90 days after an agency formally submits a draft regulation. The review  process can be summarized as follows:", "OIRA reviews agencies\u2019 draft rules at both the proposed and final  stages of rulemaking. In each phase, the rulemaking agency submits  a regulatory review package to OIRA (consisting of the rule, any  supporting materials, and a transmittal form) and OIRA initiates a  review.", "During the review process, OIRA analyzes the draft rule in light of  executive order principles and discusses the package with staff and  officials at the rulemaking agency, as well as with other agencies with  which interagency coordination will be necessary. In the course of that  process, the draft rule that is submitted by the agency often changes.  In some cases, agencies withdraw the draft rule from OIRA during the  review period and the rule may or may not be subsequently  resubmitted to OIRA.", "At the end of the review period, OIRA either concludes that the draft  rule is consistent with the principles of the executive order (which  occurs in the vast majority of cases) or returns the rule to the agency  \u201cfor further consideration.\u201d", "If a draft rule that was determined to be consistent with the executive  order has been modified in the course of the review, the rule is coded  in the OIRA database as \u201cconsistent with change\u201d (regardless of the  source or extent of the change). If no changes have been made to the  draft rule during the review, the rule is coded as \u201cconsistent without  change.\u201d OIRA only codes rules as \u201cconsistent without change\u201d if they  are exactly the same at the end of the review period as the original  submission. Even editorial changes made at the rulemaking agency\u2019s  initiative can cause a rule to be coded \u201cconsistent with change.\u201d", "Executive Order 12866 also contains several transparency provisions that  require both OIRA and agencies to disclose certain information about the  OIRA review process. For example, the order requires OIRA to disclose  information about communications between OIRA and persons not  employed by the executive branch pertinent to rules under OIRA\u2019s review  and, if OIRA returns a rule to the issuing agency for reconsideration, the  executive order requires OIRA to provide a written explanation for the  return. If a rule is withdrawn from OIRA review, however, the order has no  requirement for OIRA or the regulatory agency to provide a written  explanation. After the rule has been published in the Federal Register or  otherwise issued to the public, the regulatory agency publishing the rule is  required to make available to the public the information provided to OIRA in  accordance with the executive order;  identify for the public, in a complete, clear, and simple manner, the  substantive changes between the draft submitted to OIRA and the  action subsequently announced; and  identify for the public those changes in the regulatory action that were  made at the suggestion or recommendation of OIRA.", "These transparency requirements and documentation are not simply a  matter of administrative paperwork. Agencies\u2019 documentation of the OIRA  review process and its outcomes become part of the regulatory docket for  each rulemaking. The docket publicly documents the support and basis  for decisions made about the substance of the rule, thus serving as a  source of information for decision makers, the general public, and for  purposes of potential judicial review.", "Since the issuance of Executive Order 12866, Congress has periodically  asked us to examine the implementation of the OIRA regulatory review  process. Multiple products we issued from 1996 through 2009  consistently found that the OIRA regulatory review process often resulted  in changes to agencies\u2019 rules but the transparency and documentation of  the review process could be improved. For example, in 2003, we  examined 85 rules from nine health, safety, or environmental agencies  that had been changed, returned or withdrawn as a result of the OIRA  review process. We found that the OIRA review process had significantly  affected 25 of those 85 rules. While almost all returned rules were from  the Department of Transportation, the rules that were most often  significantly changed were from the Environmental Protection Agency.  OIRA\u2019s suggestions appeared to have at least some effect on almost all  of the 25 rules\u2019 potential costs and benefits or the agencies\u2019 estimates of  those costs and benefits. The agencies\u2019 docket files did not always  provide clear and complete documentation of the changes made during  OIRA\u2019s review or at OIRA\u2019s suggestion, as required by the executive  order, though a few agencies exhibited exemplary transparency practices.", "In 2009, we again found that OIRA\u2019s reviews of agencies\u2019 draft rules often  resulted in changes. Of our 12 case-study rules subject to OIRA review,  10 reviews resulted in changes, about half of which included changes to  the regulatory text. Agencies used various methods to document OIRA\u2019s  reviews and these methods generally met disclosure requirements.  However, we found that agencies could improve the transparency of this  documentation. In particular, agencies did not always clearly attribute  changes made at the suggestion of OIRA. Additionally, agencies\u2019  interpretations were not necessarily consistent regarding what constitutes  a substantive change that should be documented to comply with the  executive order transparency requirements. Both of these issues had  been identified in our earlier work.", "In our 2003 and 2009 reports, we made a total of 12 recommendations to  OMB about the review process under Executive Order 12866 (see  appendix I for a list of the recommendations). In 2003 we made 8  recommendations targeting several aspects of the OIRA review process  that remained unclear and where improvements could allow the public to  better understand the effects of OIRA\u2019s review. For example, these  aspects included addressing a lack of documentation requirements  regarding (1) staff-level exchanges during the review process, (2) the  reasons for withdrawal of a rule, or (3) the source or impetus of changes  made to rules. In 2009, based on similar findings, we made 4 additional  recommendations that OMB provide guidance to agencies to improve  transparency and documentation of the OIRA review process. OMB  generally agreed with the 4 recommendations in our 2009 report, but  disagreed with 7 of the 8 recommendations in our 2003 report.", "OIRA to date has implemented only 1 of those 12 recommendations\u2014to  more clearly indicate in the posted information which regulatory action  was being discussed and the affiliations of participants when meeting with  outside parties regarding draft rules under OIRA review. We believe that  our past recommendations still have merit and, if acted upon, would  improve the transparency of the OIRA review process. For example,  regarding our recommendation that the Administrator of OIRA should  establish procedures whereby either OIRA or the agencies disclose the  reasons why rules are withdrawn from OIRA review, we note that OIRA\u2019s  records on the outcomes of regulatory reviews indicate many more  withdrawals, which currently require no explanation, than returns, which  do require explanations.", "Importantly, other organizations have raised concerns about the  timeliness of OIRA regulatory reviews. In particular, the Administrative  Conference of the United States (ACUS) issued a report and adopted a  statement in December 2013 on improving the timeliness of OIRA\u2019s  regulatory review process. ACUS noted an increase in average review  times since 2011, including many reviews that extended well past the  limits established in Executive Order 12866, while also acknowledging  that OIRA had recently made progress in addressing the backlog. ACUS  offered a set of principles for improving the timeliness of review and the  transparency concerning the causes for delays, such as that OIRA  should, whenever possible, adhere to the timeliness provisions of  Executive Order 12866 and, if unable to complete the review of an  agency\u2019s draft rule within a reasonable time\u2014but in no event beyond 180  days after submission\u2014should inform the public as to the reasons for the  delay or return the rule to the submitting agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Opportunities Exist to Facilitate Congressional Oversight and Public Participation in the Rulemaking Process", "paragraphs": ["Our recent work has continued to highlight both progress made in  facilitating transparency, oversight, and public participation in regulatory  actions as well as room for improvement. Improvements made in  transparency of the rulemaking process benefit not only the public but  also congressional oversight. In 2012, we reviewed a generalizable  random sample of 1,338 final rules published during calendar years 2003  through 2010 to provide information on the frequency, reasons for, and  potential effects of agencies issuing final rules without a notice of  proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Before issuing a final rule, agencies are  generally required to publish an NPRM in the Federal Register. Agencies  must then respond to public comments when issuing final rules. However,  agencies may use exceptions in certain circumstances to forgo this  NPRM process to expedite rulemaking. For example, agencies may use  the good cause exception when they find that notice and comment  procedures are \u201cimpracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public  interest.\u201d We found that agencies frequently cited the good cause  exception and other statutory exceptions to publish final rules without  NPRMs. Agencies did not publish an NPRM for about 35 percent of major  rules and about 44 percent of nonmajor rules published from 2003  through 2010.", "We found that agencies, though not required, often requested comments  on major final rules issued without an NPRM, but they did not always  respond to the comments received. For example, we found that  agencies requested comments on 77 of the 123 major rules issued  without an NPRM in our sample. The agencies did not issue a follow-up  rule or respond to comments on 26 of these 77. This is a missed  opportunity, because we found that, when agencies did respond to public  comments, they often made changes to improve the rules. Each of these  26 rules is economically significant and some of these rules have an  effect of one billion dollars a year or more. To better balance the benefits  of expedited rulemaking procedures with the benefits of public comments  that are typically part of regular notice-and-comment rulemakings, and  improve the quality and transparency of rulemaking records, we  recommended that OMB, in consultation with ACUS, issue guidance to  encourage agencies to respond to comments on final major rules, for  which the agency has discretion, that are issued without a prior notice of  proposed rulemaking. OMB stated that it did not believe it necessary to  issue guidance on the topic at that time and has not, to date, taken any  action to implement our recommendation. We continue to believe that the  recommendation has merit and urge OMB to reconsider its prior position.", "In our 2013 review of international regulatory cooperation we again found  opportunities to better facilitate public participation in regulatory activities.  In that report, we noted the growing importance of considering regulations  in an international context. Agency officials stated that they cooperate  with their foreign counterparts (1) because they are operating in an  increasingly global environment and many products that agencies  regulate originate overseas and (2) in an effort to gain efficiencies\u2014for  example, by sharing resources or avoiding duplicative work.", "Agencies\u2019 efforts to cooperate on regulatory programs may also facilitate  trade and support the competitiveness of U.S. business. Agency officials  we interviewed said that stakeholder involvement is important and  nonfederal stakeholders are uniquely positioned to identify and call  attention to unnecessary differences among U.S. regulations and those of  its trading partners. However, stakeholders we spoke with, such as  academics, organizations representing businesses, and consumer  advocacy groups, said it can be challenging for them to provide input into  agencies\u2019 international regulatory cooperation activities because of the  required resources and the difficulty of becoming aware of such activities.", "In addition to effective collaboration with affected nonfederal  stakeholders, effective international regulatory cooperation requires  interagency coordination and effective collaboration with federal agency  officials\u2019 foreign counterparts. In an environment of constrained resources  it is even more important for agencies to share knowledge on the effective  implementation of international regulatory cooperation.", "We recommended that the Regulatory Working Group, a forum chaired  by the OIRA Administrator to assist agencies in identifying and analyzing  important regulatory issues, establish one or more mechanisms to  facilitate staff level collaboration on international regulatory cooperation  issues and include independent regulatory agencies. Such a mechanism  could be addressed as part of forthcoming guidance on Executive Order  13609. This May 2012 executive order on promoting international  regulatory cooperation was intended to provide high-level support and  direction for U.S. agencies\u2019 international regulatory cooperation efforts.  The executive order directed agencies to consider addressing  unnecessary differences in existing regulations and describes processes  to help avoid regulatory divergence in the future.
