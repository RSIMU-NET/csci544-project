It is also imperative that they maintain good stewardship over the billions of dollars invested in their inventory. GAO reviewed the Navy's management of secondary inventory and determined (1) the extent to which on-hand and on-order secondary inventory reflected the amount needed to support current requirements and (2) causes for the Navy's having secondary inventory in excess of current requirements or, conversely, for having inventory deficits. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed Navy secondary inventory data (spare parts such as aircraft and ship engines and their components and accessories) from fiscal years 2004 through 2007."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the 4-year period GAOexamined, the Navy had significantly more inventory than was needed to support current requirements. The Navy also experienced some inventory deficits, though to a far lesser extent. GAO's analysis of inventory data identified an annual average of about $18.7 billion of Navy secondary inventory for fiscal years 2004 to 2007, of which about $7.5 billion (40 percent) exceeded current requirements. About half of the $7.5 billion of inventory exceeding current requirements was retained to meet anticipated future demands, and the remainder was retained for other reasons or identified as potential excess. Based on Navy demand forecasts, inventory that exceeded current requirements was sufficient to satisfy several years, or even decades, of anticipated supply needs. Also, a large proportion of items that exceeded current requirements had no projected demand. The Navy also had an annual average of about $570 million of inventory deficits over this 4-year period. Some items experienced persistent deficits for the 4 years covered in GAO's review. Navy inventory did not align with current requirements over this 4-year period because (1) the Navy has not established the cost efficiency of its inventory management, (2) its demand forecasting effectiveness is limited and requirements for items may change frequently after purchase decisions are made, and (3) it has not adjusted certain inventory management practices in response to the unpredictability in demand. As a result, the Navy had billions of dollars in excess inventory against current requirements each year. DOD's supply chain management regulation requires the military services to take several steps to provide for effective and efficient end-to-end materiel support. For example, the regulation directs the components to size secondary item inventories to minimize DOD investment while providing the inventory needed. However, while the Navy has performance measures related to meeting warfighter needs, it lacks metrics and targets for tracking and assessing the cost efficiency of its inventory management. In addition, although Navy managers most frequently attributed the accumulation and retention of inventory exceeding current requirements to changes in demand, the Navy has not systematically evaluated the effectiveness of its demand forecasting. Problems with demand forecasting that contribute to excess inventory include incomplete and inaccurate data and a lack of communication and coordination among key personnel. Finally, the Navy has not adjusted certain management practices--in areas such as initial provisioning, modifying purchase decisions for inventory that is on order and not yet in its possession, and retention--to provide flexibility for responding to changes in demand. First, initial provisioning of spare parts based on engineering estimates can result in the purchase of unneeded stock when these estimates prove to be inaccurate. Second, the Navy's management practices for on-order items limit flexibility in modifying purchase decisions in cases where demand has changed. Third, although prior studies have identified weaknesses in inventory retention practices, the Navy has not implemented recommended corrective actions. Also, the Navy's designation of new chief and deputy chief management officer positions provides an opportunity for enhanced oversight of inventory management improvement efforts. Strengthening the Navy's inventory management--while maintaining high levels of supply availability and meeting warfighter needs--could reduce support costs and free up funds for other needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The military services and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) procure and  manage large supplies of spare parts to keep military equipment operating.  At a time when U.S. military forces and their equipment are in high  demand, it is critical that the services and DLA effectively and efficiently  manage the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) secondary inventory to  ensure that the warfighter is supplied with the right items at the right time.  Because the military services and DLA face challenges in competing for  resources at a time when the nation faces an increasingly constrained  fiscal environment, it is also imperative that they have good stewardship  over the billions of dollars invested in their inventory. DOD reported that  the total value of its secondary inventory as of September 30, 2007, was  about $82.6 billion. Since 1990, we have identified DOD inventory  management as a high-risk area due to ineffective and inefficient inventory  management practices and procedures and to excessively high levels of  inventory beyond what is needed to support current requirements. These  high levels extend to both on-hand and on-order inventory. Inventory in  DOD\u2019s possession is considered to be on hand. Inventory not in DOD\u2019s  possession but for which contracts have been awarded or funds have been  obligated is considered to be on order.", "In response to your request that we review DOD components\u2019 secondary  inventory, this report addresses the management of the Navy\u2019s secondary  inventory.

We determined the total number of  items that had more or less than enough inventory to satisfy current  requirements, and for each of these items also determined the number and  value of parts that were either in excess of or less than needed to satisfy  current requirements. In presenting the value of inventory in this report,  we converted then-year dollars to constant fiscal year 2007 dollars using  DOD Operations and Maintenance price deflators. To determine the  primary causes for the Navy having inventory in excess of current  requirements or having inventory deficits, we selected a random  probability sample of inventory items that met these conditions and sent  surveys to Navy inventory personnel who are responsible for item  management. Because we used a random probability sample, the results of  our survey analysis statistically weight up to represent the population of  all Navy items that met our selection criteria. To gain additional  understanding about the management of secondary inventory, we  interviewed numerous Navy inventory personnel and discussed 70 items in  more detail. Appendix I provides further information on our scope and  methodology.

To ensure efficient and  effective supply chain management, the regulation also calls for the use of  metrics to evaluate the performance and cost of supply chain operations.  These metrics should, among other things, monitor the efficient use of  DOD resources and provide a means to assess costs versus benefits of  supply chain operations. However, the regulation does not prescribe  specific cost metrics and goals for the services to use to track and assess  the efficiency of their inventory management practices.", "According to Navy officials, they have processes and controls for  efficiently managing secondary inventory. For example, they use a  requirements-setting process for determining secondary items necessary  to meet performance goals, while evaluating the trade-offs between the  requirements and acceptable risk of being out of stock. They also compare  requirements to available assets and identify funding needed during the  next 2-year budget period. After budget approval, they use a supply   demand review process and repair workload forecasting to initiate  procurements and plan repairs throughout the year. The supply demand  reviews enable them to determine significant requirement changes and  recommend additional procurement or termination of existing  procurements. They also stated that the semiannual stratification review  acts as a check and balance. They noted that Navy item managers are  required to meet goals that ensure that the Navy does not unnecessarily  build inventories but rather balances the costs for terminating a contract  against that of initiating a new contract in the near future. They said they  are confident that these processes and controls work because the Navy is  able to meet required performance goals at budgeted costs.", "Moreover, the Navy uses metrics to track and assess performance toward  meeting inventory support goals. These include metrics showing supply  material availability and customer wait time. For example, the Navy  tracks the extent to which it is meeting supply material availability goals\u2014 which are set at 85 percent (except for nuclear propulsion-related  material, which has a goal of 95 percent)\u2014as well as average customer  wait time. Recent data show that the Navy generally meets or almost  meets these goals, although we did not independently verify these  performance data during our review. The Navy also measures financial  performance by the extent to which budgeted amounts are obligated and  net sales plans are achieved. In this way inventory managers may be  accountable for goals related to supply material availability and customer  wait time, as well as budget performance.", "The Navy, however, has not established metrics and goals for determining  whether it is meeting its performance goals at least cost. For example, it  has not established a metric related to its cost efficiency in meeting the  supply material availability goal. The overall secondary inventory data we  analyzed show that the Navy carried about $1.66 in inventory for every $1  in requirements to meet its supply material availability goal during the 4- year period of fiscal years 2004 through 2007. Such a metric, in  combination with other cost metrics and established goals, could give the  Navy the capability to track trends and assess progress toward achieving  greater cost efficiency. Because cost metrics and goals have not been  established, Navy managers are not held accountable and lack incentives  for achieving efficient supply support. Measuring performance goals such  as supply material availability and average customer wait time without  also tracking cost metrics encourages higher levels of inventory.

Regarding a deficit, for example, one respondent said they are working  with a sole source vendor and the estimated shipping date slipped.", "In follow-up discussions Navy managers confirmed that changes in  demand were the main cause of inventory exceeding current requirements  or inventory deficits. In some cases, they attributed these changes to  incomplete or inaccurate demand data, owing to a lack of communication  among the various key participants in the demand-forecasting process. In  several cases, they cited poor communications with other service  components that were generating the demand. The following cases  illustrate challenges Navy managers face in predicting demands for items:    An example of an item in excess due to demand changes was the  blades used in the F404 engine that goes into the Navy\u2019s F-18 model  A/D aircraft. The Navy had 13,852 of these parts valued at $3.6 million  as excess to current requirements. The next higher assembly is now on  a contract under which the contractor supplies the item, so the demand  for the blades disappeared. Thus, the Navy\u2019s anticipated demand for  these parts never materialized. In commenting on our draft report, the  Navy stated that all 13,852 parts were being offered to the contractor in  return for a cost reduction on the contract.", "Another example of an item with inventory excess to current  requirements was a special cable assembly also used on the Navy\u2019s F- 18 model A/D aircraft\u2019s forward-looking infrared radar.

Navy managers said they actively manage items that  are in high demand, costly, or identified for other reasons; the remaining  items often require less attention. They said that Navy policy allows for  automated procurements of all items costing less than $50,000. In the  aviation community, these buys represented an average of about 52  percent of the total buys and 7 percent of the total value of procurements  between fiscal years 2005 and 2007.

They cited problems,  including a lack of communication and coordination among key personnel.  For example, they said that the nuclear propulsion community is better  coordinated because the engineers, contract managers, and inventory  managers are collocated and work closely with program officials,  maintenance locations, and contractors. However, for aviation and  maritime support equipment such as mobile generators or test equipment,  a variety of issues have made demands more difficult to predict. For  example, support equipment is used on multiple platforms, needs periodic  calibration, and may have more obsolescence issues. They observed that  having timely, complete, and reliable data, as well as coordinated  communications among contract, maintenance, program, inventory, and  contractor officials and other suppliers, can improve demand data  predictability.", "While the Navy recognizes that unpredictable demand is a driving factor in  the lack of alignment between inventory and current requirements, it has  not systematically evaluated why its demand-based forecasts fluctuate,  why demands across the Navy inventory are decreasing, and how demand  fluctuations vary among item manager groups or across items. The Navy  does not formally track the accuracy of its demand forecasts or what can  be done to improve them. Navy officials also said that many Navy  secondary inventory items require long production lead times, rendering  orders for these items more vulnerable to inaccuracy due to demand  fluctuations. In addition, they said that while they could improve demand  forecasting, this would increase administrative support costs and would  not be affordable across the Navy supply system.

However, they said these estimates often prove to be  inaccurate. For example, configuration changes may be made to the  system or parts may last longer or shorter than initially estimated. As a  result, some items that are purchased based on the initial provisioning  estimates are ultimately not needed to meet requirements. For example:    One item, a sonar set used on the Los Angeles Class submarine, had  nine parts in inventory of which seven (valued at $69,314) were  identified as excess to current requirements.

In our follow-up discussions with 10 Navy aviation  managers who had on-order inventory that exceeded current  requirements, none of the items involved a termination action. In one  example involving a holdback bar assembly, the Navy had 31 on-order  parts valued at $103,124 that exceeded current requirements. Although  items are reviewed at least quarterly for termination, managers took no  action on this item because of the established protection level. Also,  managers had been informed that some of these items might potentially be  needed for use in Iraq.", "While cancellation of on-order inventory can reduce purchases of  unneeded inventory in response to changes in demand, a relatively small  proportion of the Navy\u2019s total inventory exceeding requirements is on  order compared to the amount that is already on hand.

The Navy\u2019s  inventory retention policy calls for an economic retention level to ensure  that an item is available for a specified number of years. Economic  retention formulas are applied to inventory items based in part on program  status. For example, in a steady program the Navy wants a minimum of  three items to be available for economic retention for 8 years. Different  formulas would apply to secondary inventory associated with increasing  or declining programs. According to Navy managers, they annually review  the program status of inventory items to ensure correct economic  retention formulas are applied to each.", "Additionally, the Navy has contingency retention requirements to preclude  disposal of assets that might be needed for future nonrecurring demand,  such as outfitting or planned maintenance actions; items used primarily in  wartime which have limited use in peacetime; and future foreign military  sales. The Navy policy also directs that material normally not be disposed  of within 7 years of its material support date with some exceptions, to  prevent premature disposal decisions based on initial provisioning  forecasts.

DOD then tasked LMI to repeat the analysis for the  other components and to address the retention of materiel in the DOD  supply system. LMI reported in July 2007 that the question of retaining or  disposing of inventory is subject to demand uncertainties. It found that  the DOD regulation correctly defines the economics of retention and the  need to use economic analysis and up-to-date cost factors when deciding  what to retain. Among other things, LMI linked retention practices with  demand forecasting and called for components to use additional  techniques for more accurately determining the probability of future  demand or repurchase. For example, it called on the services to determine  whether an item with no recent demand history is still part of a weapon  system configuration and said that items with extended periods of no  demand should be candidates for item reduction. LMI also recommended  augmenting traditional demand forecast accuracy metrics with a measure  of bias to identify the potential for overforecasting, and adjust forecasting  methods accordingly. It noted that some forecast methods have a  tendency for positive bias, with the result that forecasts are too high more  often than they are too low. This leads to inflated inventory levels,  especially for low-demand items which can be harder to sell than high- demand items. LMI called for monitoring demand forecasting methods to  identify bias which can lead to overinvestment in inventory.", "We found no evidence that the Navy had taken these actions. On the basis  of our review, we believe they could strengthen the management of the  Navy\u2019s secondary inventory. For example, although the Navy continues to  have a substantial amount of inventory each year for which it shows no  projected demand (about 85,700 unique items valued at over $1.9 billion in  fiscal year 2007), data have not been developed to show whether these  items are still part of a current weapon system configuration, have had  extended periods of no demand, and should be candidates for item  reduction.", "In addition, the Navy could not document that it has conducted required  annual reviews to validate its retention decision practices.

Taking steps to reduce the levels of inventory exceeding requirements  could help to ensure that DOD is meeting supply performance goals at  least cost. The Navy lacks metrics and goals for tracking and assessing  cost efficiency along with supply availability, customer wait time, and  other supply performance metrics and goals. Among other things, cost- efficiency metrics and goals could provide a basis for effective  management and oversight of inventory reduction efforts. Much of the  inventory that exceeded current requirements or had inventory deficits  resulted from inaccurate demand forecasts, which the Navy attributed to  unpredictability of demand. However, the Navy has not systematically  evaluated and addressed demand unpredictability or adjusted certain  inventory management practices to enhance flexibility in adapting to  fluctuations in demand. In the absence of such actions, the Navy will likely  continue to purchase and retain items that it does not need and then spend  additional resources to handle and store these items. Finally, since  inventory management is part of the Navy\u2019s broader business operations  and transformation, it is reasonable to expect the newly established chief  management officer and deputy chief management officer to exercise  some level of oversight of the Navy\u2019s inventory management improvement  efforts.

Upon completion of the data validation process, we  revalued the Navy\u2019s secondary inventory items identified in its budget  stratification summary reports because these reports value useable items  and items in need of repair at the same rate, and do not take into account  the cost of repairing broken items.

However, if more inventory is on hand or on order than  is needed to satisfy its requirements, the Navy does not consider the  inventory beyond current requirements to be unneeded. Instead, the Navy  uses this inventory to satisfy future demands over a 2-year period,  economic retention requirements, and contingency retention  requirements. Only after applying inventory to satisfy these additional  requirements would the Navy consider that it has more inventory than is  needed and consider this inventory for potential reutilization or disposal.  We do not agree with the Navy\u2019s practice of not identifying inventory used  to satisfy these additional requirements as excess because it overstates the  amount of inventory needed to be on hand or on order by billions of  dollars. The Navy\u2019s requirements determination process does not consider  these additional requirements when it calculates the necessary amount of  on-hand and on-order inventory, which means that if the Navy did not have  enough inventory on hand or on order to satisfy these additional  requirements, the requirements determination process would not result in  additional inventory being purchased to satisfy these requirements.", "We consider the Navy to have inventory deficits if levels of on-hand  inventory are insufficient to meet the reorder level, which the Navy defines  as the level of on-hand assets at the time an order must be placed to  achieve the acceptable stock-out risk. Normally, item managers place an  order for the number of parts below the reorder level, plus an economic  order quantity. However, due to variation in acquisition lead times, these  parts may not be delivered when they are needed. We did not include the  procurement cycle (economic order quantity) requirement when  calculating inventory deficits, because this requirement defines the  maximum level of on-hand or on-order inventory that may be above the  reorder level, and does not define a minimum level of on-hand inventory.  For comparison purposes with the excess inventory, we calculated the  amount of inventory that the Navy would have to acquire to meet  acquisition lead time and economic order quantity in order to achieve  current operating requirements for these items where there was a deficit.", "To determine the extent to which the Navy\u2019s on-hand and on-order  secondary inventory reflects the amount of inventory needed to support  requirements, we reviewed DOD and Navy inventory management policies,  past GAO products on DOD and Navy inventory management practices for  secondary inventory items, and other related documentation.

We revised the survey accordingly based on  findings from the pretests.", "We e-mailed this electronic survey to specific Navy managers in charge of  sampled unique aviation and maritime items at the Navy\u2019s Inventory  Control Point locations in Philadelphia and Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  We conducted this survey from May 2008 through July 2008. To estimate  the frequency of reasons for inventory not needed to meet requirements  and inventory deficits, we drew a stratified random probability sample of  424 unique items\u2014353 unique items with on-hand inventory not needed to  support current requirements, 31 unique items with on-order inventory not  needed to support current requirements, and 40 unique items with  inventory deficits\u2014from a study population of 126,331 items (112,567 with  inventory not needed to meet current requirements and 13,764 with  inventory deficits). These categories identified a combined value of $6.8  billion of inventory not needed to meet current requirements. All of these  items met our criteria to be included in our study population of items not  needed to meet current requirements. Additionally, based on our analysis  of the stratification data, all of the 13,764 unique items with inventory  deficits, valued at $462 million, met our criteria to be included in our  inventory deficit study population. We stratified using the scheme shown  in table 9, dividing the on-hand and on-order excess into 3 substratum  each by the amount of supply on hand and stratifying within Philadelphia  and Mechanicsburg. With the inclusion of a stratum for inventory deficit  items within each office, our sample contained 14 total strata. The  divisions of the population, sample, and respondents across the strata, as  well as the number of responses by stratum, are also shown in table 9.", "We sent 424 electronic surveys\u2014one for each item in the sample\u2014to the  Navy managers identified as being responsible for these items. Inventory  control for three of the items in our sample had recently been transferred  to the Defense Logistics Agency, so we treated these cases as out of scope.  We did not receive completed data collection instruments for 3 of the  remaining items in our sample. We received 418 usable responses to our  surveys, providing a total response rate of 98.6 percent. Each sampled item  was subsequently weighted in the final analysis to represent all the  members of the target population.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample of unique items is only one of a large number of samples that  we might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results in 95 percent confidence intervals. These are intervals  that would contain the actual population values for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident  that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true  values in the study population. All percentage estimates from our sample  have margins of error (that is, widths of confidence intervals) of plus or  minus 5 percentage points or less, at the 95 percent confidence level  unless otherwise noted.", "In addition to sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors.  For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the  data are entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce unwanted  variability into the survey results. We took steps in the development of the  survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these  nonsampling errors. We reviewed each survey to identify unusual,  incomplete, or inconsistent responses and followed up with item  management specialists by telephone to clarify those responses. In  addition, we performed computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and  other indicators of errors and had a second independent reviewer for the  data analysis to further minimize such error.", "To determine reasons for the types of answers given in the surveys, we  held additional on-site interviews with Navy inventory managers on 70 of  the items in our sample. We chose an equal number of aviation and  maritime items based on the highest value of inventory to identify 10 each  from on-hand, on-order, and deficits. We also held follow-up discussions  on 10 other items where we found that demand had been increasing, yet  there were excess parts; or conversely where demand had been  decreasing, yet there was an inventory deficit. These cases were atypical  because, according to Navy managers, demand increases would likely lead  to deficits, and, conversely, demand decreases would likely lead to  increases in inventory excess to requirements. These included 5 aviation  items and 5 maritime items based on the pattern of demand forecasts we  observed for these items from fiscal year 2004 through 2007. During these  discussions we obtained additional detailed comments and documentation  related to demand, demand forecasting, acquisitions, terminations, and  retention and disposal actions.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2007 to December  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. On the basis of information  obtained from the Navy on the reliability of its inventory management  systems\u2019 data, and the survey results and our follow-up analysis, we  believe that the data used in this report were sufficiently reliable for  reporting purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Thomas Gosling, Assistant  Director; Carl Barden; Lionel C.
