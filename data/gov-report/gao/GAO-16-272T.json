For example, given DOD's plans to increase F-35 funding by billions of dollars over the next 5 years, GAO recommended that DOD conduct a comprehensive affordability analysis of the program's procurement plan. DOD maintains that it accomplishes this through its annual budget process; however, without a more thorough and complete analysis, DOD may not fully understand the affordability implications of increasing funding at the planned rates.", "Medicare Program Payment Policy: On GAO's High Risk List since 1990 due in part to its complexity and susceptibility to mismanagement, GAO has made many recommendations to improve Medicare, including improving the accuracy of the adjustment made for differences in diagnostic coding practices between Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Fee-For-Service. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) could better account for additional beneficiary characteristics, such as residential location, and use more current and refined data in determining MA payments. GAO made this recommendation because of shortcomings in CMS's adjustment, which resulted in excess payments to MA plans totaling an estimated $3.2 billion to $5.1 billion over a 3-year period from 2010 through 2012.", "GAO continuously engages with executive branch agencies to ensure recommendations are implemented.

This poses significant affordability  challenges as other major programs\u2014including the KC-46A Tanker,  the DDG 51 Destroyer, and the Ohio-class submarine replacement\u2014 will vie for significant funding commitments at that time. Accordingly,  we recommended that DOD conduct a comprehensive affordability  analysis of the F-35 program\u2019s procurement plan that reflects various  assumptions about future technical progress and funding availability.  DOD agreed with our recommendation, although it maintains it  accomplishes this through its annual budget process.

Given the growth in  managed care and its increasing share of Medicaid expenditures, the  lack of a comprehensive program integrity strategy for managed care  leaves a growing portion of Medicaid funds at risk. We recommended  that CMS increase its oversight of Medicaid managed care program  integrity. Specifically, we recommended that CMS provide audit  support and guidance to states, and hold them accountable for closer  scrutiny of managed care payments. CMS has proposed major new  guidance related to Medicaid managed care and this guidance  includes provisions that would be relevant to this recommendation.", "Supplemental Security Income (SSI)", "The Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) SSI program provides cash  benefits to eligible low-income individuals with disabilities, including  children. In December 2014, SSA paid more than $860 million to about  1.3 million disabled children, the majority of whom received benefits due  to a mental impairment.", "SSA is required to periodically conduct reviews to determine if children  are still eligible for payments, but in June 2012 we found that more than  24,000 continuing disability reviews (CDRs) for children with mental  impairments were overdue by 6 or more years, including over 6,000  CDRs for children who were expected to medically improve within 6 to 18  months of their initial determination. We also identified several cases  which exceeded their scheduled review date by 13 years or more. When  CDRs are not conducted as scheduled, the potential for improper  payments increases as some recipients receive benefits for which they  are no longer eligible. SSA attributes delays in performing CDRs to  resource limitations and other factors; SSA also generally gives lower  priority to conducting CDRs for children receiving SSI. In 2012, we  recommended that SSA eliminate the existing CDR backlog for children  with impairments who are likely to improve and regularly conduct reviews  for this group.", "In each year since our audit, SSA has increased its number of reviews  and officials said that with sustained, predictable funding, SSA will  continue to work toward eliminating this backlog. In April 2015, we  estimated that if this recommendation were implemented, SSA could  potentially save $3.1 billion over 5 years, based on our analysis of fiscal  year 2011 data. When reviews are not conducted as scheduled, the  government is at risk of billions of dollars in overpayments.", "Since 2009, we have designated the reform of the U.S. financial  regulatory system as high-risk. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street  Reform and Consumer Protection Act created the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) to identify and address threats to the stability  of the U.S. financial system and Office of Financial Research (OFR) to  support FSOC and Congress by providing financial research and data.", "In 2012, we reported that FSOC and OFR face challenges in achieving  their missions to identify risks and respond to emerging threats to  financial stability, and that some efforts may be duplicative because  multiple FSOC members, such as the Federal Reserve, also have  ongoing efforts to monitor threats to financial stability. We  recommended FSOC and OFR clarify responsibility for implementing  requirements to monitor threats to financial stability across FSOC and  OFR, including FSOC members and member agencies. In response,  Treasury questioned the need for FSOC and OFR to clarify these  responsibilities and as of October 2015, FSOC staff said formal  distinctions are not needed because FSOC and OFR work well together.  However, we maintain that more specific actions are still needed, as our  past work has shown that without clearly delineating and coordinating  roles and responsibilities, there can be duplication of efforts, confusion,  and regulatory gaps.", "The security of federal cyber security has been on our High-Risk List  since 1997. Nineteen of 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial  Officers Act (CFO Act agencies) declared cybersecurity as a significant  deficiency or material weakness for fiscal year 2014. In addition, most of  the 24 agencies continue to have weaknesses in key controls such as  those for limiting, preventing, and detecting inappropriate access to  computer resources and managing the configurations of software and  hardware.", "Since 2010, we have made approximately 2,000 recommendations in this  area. Executive branch agencies have taken steps to address them, but  about 840 recommendations remain outstanding. For example, we  recommended that OMB (1) address agency cyber incident response  practices in its oversight of agency information security programs, and (2)  collaborate with stakeholders to enhance reporting guidance for the  inspector general community. OMB did not comment on the first  recommendation and generally concurred with the second one, stating  that it was working with stakeholders to improve the reporting process.  Implementing these and other outstanding recommendations will enable  federal agencies to better respond to cyberattacks and data breaches and  will provide for more consistent and useful reporting to Congress.", "Safety of the Food Supply  On our High-Risk List since 2007, the fragmented federal food safety  system has caused inconsistent oversight, ineffective coordination, and  inefficient use of resources. While agencies and Congress have taken  some steps to improve federal food safety oversight, several key  recommendations remain unimplemented. For example, in September  2014, we found that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which is  responsible for ensuring the safety of poultry products, had not developed  performance measures for all poultry products, such as ground chicken,  to determine whether poultry processing plants are meeting the agency\u2019s  goals for protecting human health. Ensuring the safety of poultry  products is particularly important because poultry products contaminated  with pathogens cause more deaths than any other commodity;  specifically, Salmonella and Campylobacter cause more than 2 million  human illnesses per year. We recommended that performance measures  be developed to help reduce illnesses caused by Salmonella and  Campylobacter contamination for certain types of chicken and turkey.  USDA agreed with our recommendations and noted it is taking steps  toward implementing them; however, measures and targets have yet to  be established. In the absence of such measures and targets,  performance information is not being publicly reported, limiting  transparency, oversight, and accountability.", "In the 2013 duplication and cost savings annual report, we reported that  federal agencies could achieve significant cost savings annually by  expanding and improving their use of strategic sourcing\u2014a contracting  process that moves away from numerous individual procurement actions  to a broader aggregated approach. For example, DOD, DHS, VA, and the  Department of Energy accounted for 80 percent of the $537 billion in  federal procurement spending in fiscal year 2011, but reported managing  about 5 percent, or $25.8 billion, through strategic sourcing efforts. In  contrast, leading commercial firms leverage buying power by strategically  managing 90 percent of their spending\u2014achieving annual savings of 10  percent or more. While strategic sourcing may not be suitable for all  procurement spending, we reported that a reduction of 1 percent from  procurement spending at the largest agencies at that time would equate  to over $4 billion in savings annually\u2014an opportunity also noted in the  House Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2016.", "OMB has made progress on improving strategic sourcing efforts across  the federal government by issuing guidance on calculating savings for  government-wide strategic sourcing contracts.  In December 2014 it  issued a memorandum on category management that, among other  things, identifies federal spending categories suitable for strategic  sourcing. These categories cover some of the government\u2019s largest  spending categories, including information technology and professional  services, which, according to OMB, accounted for $277 billion in fiscal  year 2013 procurements. While these are important first steps, until OMB  sets government-wide goals and establishes metrics, the government  may miss opportunities for billions in cost savings through strategic  sourcing.", "In December 2014, we recommended that DHS develop a plan to better  control and reduce the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s  (FEMA) administrative costs for major disasters. FEMA has begun efforts  to develop an integrated plan to control and reduce administrative costs  for major disaster declarations. However, until FEMA meets its targets  for controlling administrative costs, these costs could continue to increase  federal expenditures by millions of dollars. We also recommended that  FEMA develop a methodology to better assess a jurisdiction capability to  respond to and recover from a disaster without federal assistance.  FEMA has submitted a report to Congress outlining various options that it  could take to implement our recommendation. However, without an  accurate assessment of jurisdiction capabilities to respond to and recover  from a disaster, FEMA runs the risk of recommending to the President  that federal disaster assistance be awarded without considering a  jurisdiction\u2019s response and recovery capabilities or its fiscal capacity.", "In recent years, we identified a number of recommendations for improving  a variety of the DHS border security programs and operations. For  example, we recommended that DHS enhance the U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) oversight of the Student and Exchange  Visitor Program. DHS has begun to take steps to address our  recommendations, such as working to re-certify schools eligible to admit  foreign students. To fully address the recommendations, DHS needs to  complete its recertification process and take any necessary compliance  actions to help ensure that schools approved to admit foreign students  are consistently following program requirements and to better position  ICE to identify and mitigate fraud and other risks in the program. We also  recommended that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) improve  the acquisition management of the Arizona Border Surveillance  Technology Plan to better ensure the reliability of its planning documents,  such as schedules and cost estimates; inform future decision-making  about technology deployments; and assess the effectiveness of deployed  technologies. CBP is working toward addressing these recommendations.", "Mission-critical skills gaps in such occupations as cybersecurity and  acquisition pose a high-risk to the nation: whether within specific federal  agencies or across the federal workforce, they impede federal agencies  ability to cost-effectively serve the public and achieve results. Addressing  complex challenges, such as disaster response, national and homeland  security, and rapidly evolving technology and privacy security issues,  requires a high-quality federal workforce able to work seamlessly with  other agencies, levels of government, and across sectors. On our High- Risk List since 2011, we have reported on human capital strategies which  will help agencies meet their mission in an era of constrained resources.  We made several recommendations that collectively will strengthen  agencies\u2019 leadership commitment and capacity to address skills gaps.  OPM agreed with these recommendations, which included the following:", "Strengthening OPM\u2019s coordination and leadership of government- wide human capital issues, in part by developing a government-wide  human capital strategic plan that would establish priorities, time  frames, responsibilities, and metrics to better align the efforts of  members of the federal human capital community;", "Exploring the feasibility of expanded use of enterprise or \u201cwhole of  government\u201d solutions to address shared human capital issues\u2014such  as workforce planning tools and lessons learned that would help build  the capacity of agencies to address skills gaps; and", "Reviewing the extent to which new capabilities are needed to promote  agile talent management\u2014including developing or sharing tools and  resources to help identify skills gaps and mechanisms for increasing  staff mobility within and across agencies.", "In response, OPM is considering a multi-phase human capital strategy  designed to, among other things, institutionalize processes for identifying  and addressing government-wide and agency skills gaps and emphasize  the use of workforce data and analytic tools.", "Our work has also identified a number of opportunities for the government  to reduce costs and increase revenue collections through congressional  action, including the following examples:", "Social Security Offsets. In our 2011 annual duplication and cost  savings report, we reported that the SSA needs data from state and  local governments on retirees who receive pensions from employment  not covered under Social Security to better enforce offsets and ensure  benefit fairness. In particular, SSA needs this information to fairly and  accurately apply the Government Pension Offset, which generally  applies to spouse and survivor benefits, and the Windfall Elimination  Provision, which applies to retired worker benefits. The Social  Security\u2019s Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination  Provision attempt to take noncovered employment into account when  calculating Social Security benefits. While information on receipt of  pensions from noncovered employment is available for federal  pension benefits from the federal Office of Personnel Management, it  is not available to SSA for many state and local pension benefits.", "We suggested that Congress give the IRS the authority to collect the  information that SSA needs on government pension income to  administer the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and Windfall  Elimination Provision (WEP) accurately and fairly. The President\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2016 Budget submission re-proposed legislation that  would require state and local governments to provide information on  their noncovered pension payments to SSA so that the agency can  apply the GPO and WEP. The proposal includes funds for  administrative expenses, with a portion available to states to develop  a mechanism to provide this information. Providing information on the  receipt of state and local noncovered pension benefits to SSA could  help the agency more accurately and fairly administer the  Government Pension Offset and Windfall Elimination Provision and  could result in an estimated $2.4 billion in savings over 10 years,  according to CBO, if enforced both retrospectively and prospectively.  If Social Security only enforced the offsets prospectively, the overall  savings still would be less.", "Paid Preparer Regulation. Establishing requirements for paid tax  return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax returns they  prepare. Oregon began regulating preparers in the 1970s and  requires testing among other requirements. In August 2008, we found  that the odds that a return filed by an Oregon paid preparer was  accurate were 72 percent higher than the odds for a comparable  return filed by a paid preparer in the rest of the country. In August  2014, IRS reported that 68 percent of all tax returns claiming the EITC  in tax years 2006 and 2007 were prepared by paid tax preparers\u2014 most of whom were not subject to any IRS regulation\u2014and that from  43 to 50 percent of the returns overclaimed the credit. Similarly, in  our undercover visits in 2014 to randomly selected tax preparers, a  sample that cannot be generalized, we found errors in EITC claims  and non-Form W-2 income reporting (for example, cash tips) resulting  in significant overstatement of refunds. Establishing requirements  for paid tax return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax  returns they prepare. In 2014, we suggested Congress consider  granting IRS the authority to regulate paid tax preparers, if it agrees  that significant paid preparer errors exist. Multiple bills have been  introduced which, if enacted, would regulate paid preparers.", "Math error authority. IRS has the authority to correct calculation  errors and check for other obvious noncompliance such as claims  above income and credit limits. Treasury has proposed expanding  IRS\u2019s \u201cmath error\u201d authority to \u201ccorrectible error\u201d authority to permit it  to correct errors in cases where information provided by the taxpayer  does not match information in government databases, among other  things. Expanding such authority\u2014which we have suggested  Congress consider with appropriate safeguards\u2014could help IRS  correct additional errors and avoid burdensome audits and taxpayer  penalties.

For  example, when conducting our recent review of the IRS Whistleblower  program, we identified some errors in awards payments IRS sent to  whistleblowers. IRS took immediate action and reviewed all of its 17  closed high-dollar cases and found additional problems, which it resolved  by providing affected whistleblowers with corrected award payments.", "Figure 3 highlights the mechanisms we use to emphasize our  recommendations.", "Agency Review and Comment. We provide executive branch agency  officials with an opportunity to review and comment on a draft of our  report, including the recommendations, before it is issued.

This  process has been in place for over 40 years. I believe it is time to  examine how well it is addressing Congress\u2019s needs, especially in the  current budget environment. We will report the results of this examination  to the committee.", "Outreach to Agencies. At least once a year we reach out to agencies to  determine the extent to which they have implemented our  recommendations and if benefits can be attributed to our work.

We maintain attention on these  issues through our biennial reports to Congress on high-risk issues and  our annual reports on duplication and cost savings.", "Monitoring areas of high-risk and fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication. As part of our high-risk initiative, we have met with OMB\u2019s  Deputy Director for Management and with top agency officials to discuss  progress in addressing individual high-risk areas. Such efforts are critical  to tracking progress, pinpointing improvement opportunities, and  resolving high-risk issues.", "To further progress on outstanding duplication and cost savings  recommendations, we regularly engage with OMB and recently identified  a list of key issues where OMB attention could be instrumental in  furthering progress on recommendations that involve multiple agencies or  government-wide improvements. We also monitor the progress executive  branch agencies and Congress have made in addressing the over 500  actions identified in our 2011 through 2015 annual reports.

The act, among other things, designates  Program Management Improvement Officers at agencies and establishes  an interagency council to make recommendations to OMB based on  GAO\u2019s high-risk work. In addition, the act would have GAO review the  effectiveness of these program and project management improvements  outlined in the bill. In November 2015, the bill passed the Senate, and a  related bill H.R. 2144 Program Management Improvement and  Accountability Act of 2015 has been referred to the House Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform.", "Identifying priority recommendations. In 2015, we undertook an effort  to call attention to unimplemented recommendations that we believe  warrant priority attention by the Secretary or agency heads at key  departments and agencies.

Officials noted that they are now tracking open  recommendations using a dashboard that includes quarterly targets  for closing recommendations. To facilitate CMS\u2019s efforts to close our  recommendations, we agreed to hold regular meetings to discuss the  status of our recommendations and what remains to be done to close  them.  In response to our letter to GSA, the Administrator committed to  continuing to work with us to address the priority recommendations in  advance of our next high-risk update in February 2017.

Congress  plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our  recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce desired  results. In addition to reporting on the status of recommendations to  Congress, we engage with Congress on strategies for further addressing  our recommendations. These strategies include incorporating our  recommendations into legislation. For example, our improper payments  work informed the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery  Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA), the latest in a series of laws  Congress passed to address improper payments.", "We also recommend agencies assess the need for legislation and report  their findings to Congress. For example, we recommended that IRS fully  assess the costs and benefits of accelerating Form W-2 deadlines to  provide information needed for Congress to deliberate the merits of  making such a significant change, which we previously reported could  help improve problems associated with identity theft tax fraud and Earned  Income Tax Credit improper payments. In September 2015, IRS  provided us a report on the potential costs and benefits of accelerating  the Form W-2 deadlines, which concluded that the federal government  could potentially protect billions of dollars in net revenue by using W-2  information to detect identity theft refund fraud before issuing refunds. We  requested additional information on certain costs and benefits not detailed  in the report. The Senate Committee on Finance held a hearing on  improper payments and the tax gap in October 2015, which further  brought attention to this issue.", "Additionally, Congress can use its budget, appropriations, and oversight  processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our  recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress  can hold hearings, withhold funds, or take other actions to provide  incentives for the agencies to act. This strategy can be useful when  agencies disagree or have a limited response to our recommendations.  For example, Congress took such steps after we reported in 2012 that  DOD\u2019s approach to acquiring combat uniforms was fragmented,  potentially resulting in increased risk on the battlefield and lost  opportunities to save millions of dollars. A provision in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 established as policy that  the Secretary of Defense shall eliminate the development and fielding of  service-specific combat and camouflage utility uniforms in order to adopt  and field common uniforms for specific environments to be used by all  members of the armed forces. Because of this legislation, the Army  chose not to introduce a new family of camouflage uniforms into its  inventory, avoiding about $4.2 billion in costs over 5 years. Congressional  use of our work sends an unmistakable message to agencies that  Congress considers these issues a priority.", "In conclusion, as the fiscal pressures facing the government continue, so  too does the need for executive branch agencies and Congress to  improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs and  activities.
