Recognizing these problems, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has launched several initiatives to improve the oversight and management of IT investments. GAO was asked to identify (1) federal IT investments that were or are being successfully acquired and (2) the critical factors that led to the successful acquisition of these investments. To do this, GAO interviewed agency officials from selected federal departments responsible for each investment. In commenting on a draft of GAO's report, three departments generally agreed with the report.

Department officials identified nine common factors that were critical to the success of three or more of the seven investments: (1) Program officials were actively engaged with stakeholders; (2) Program staff had the necessary knowledge and skills; (3) Senior department and agency executives supported the programs; (4) End users and stakeholders were involved in the development of requirements; (5) End users participated in testing of system functionality prior to formal end user acceptance testing; (6) Government and contractor staff were stable and consistent; (7) Program staff prioritized requirements; (8) Program officials maintained regular communication with the prime contractor; and (9) Programs received sufficient funding. Officials from all seven investments cited active engagement with program stakeholders as a critical factor to the success of those investments. Agency officials stated that stakeholders regularly attended program management office sponsored meetings; were working members of integrated project teams; and were notified of problems and concerns as soon as possible. Implementation of these critical factors will not necessarily ensure that federal agencies will successfully acquire IT systems because many different factors contribute to successful acquisitions. Nonetheless, these critical factors support OMB's objective of improving the management of large-scale IT acquisitions across the federal government, and wide dissemination of these factors could complement OMB's efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Planned federal information technology (IT) spending has now risen to at  least $81 billion for fiscal year 2012.

Identify the critical factors that led to the successful acquisition of  these investments.", "To address our first objective, we interviewed the chief information  officers (CIO) and other acquisition and procurement officials from  selected departments in order to identify one mission-critical, major IT  investment that was, preferably, operational, and that best achieved its  cost, schedule, scope, and performance goals.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed officials responsible for  each investment and asked them what critical factors led to the  investment\u2019s success. We then categorized the critical success factors  and totaled the number of times each factor was mentioned by the  department and agency officials. In order to identify common critical  success factors, we generalized critical success factors that were  mentioned by three or more investments.

For example, the Software Engineering Institute  (SEI) has developed highly regarded and widely used guidance on best  practices such as requirements development and management, risk  management, configuration management, validation and verification, and  project monitoring and control. In the federal government, GAO\u2019s own  research in IT management best practices led to the development of the  Information Technology Investment Management (ITIM) Framework,  which describes essential and complementary IT investment  management disciplines, such as oversight of system development and  acquisition management, and organizes them into a set of critical  processes for successful investments.", "Congress has also enacted legislation that reflects IT management best  practices. For example, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which was  informed by GAO best practice recommendations, requires federal  agencies to focus more on the results they have achieved through IT  investments, while concurrently improving their IT acquisition processes.  Specifically, the act requires agency heads to implement a process to  maximize the value of the agency\u2019s IT investments and assess, manage,  and evaluate the risks of its IT acquisitions. Further, the act establishes  chief information officers (CIO) to advise and assist agency heads in  carrying out these responsibilities. The act also requires OMB to  encourage agencies to develop and use best practices in IT acquisition.", "Additionally, the E-Government Act of 2002 established a CIO Council,  which is led by the Federal CIO, to be the principal interagency forum for  improving agency practices related to the development, acquisition, and  management of information resources, including sharing best practices.  Consistent with this mandate, the CIO Council established a Management  Best Practices Committee in order to serve as a focal point for promoting  IT best practices within the federal government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Work Has Identified IT Acquisition Management Weaknesses, Cost Increases, and Schedule Delays on Troubled Investments", "paragraphs": ["We have often reported on a range of acquisition management  weaknesses facing federal IT investments\u2014including problems relating to  senior leadership, requirements management, and testing. For example,  for the investments described below, we have identified acquisition  weaknesses, and have reported on significant cost increases and  schedule delays. Additionally, each of these investments was ultimately  cancelled or significantly restructured as a result of agency reviews  conducted in response to acquisition weaknesses, cost increases, and  schedule delays.", "In June 2009, we reported that an executive committee for the  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  (NPOESS)\u2014a program jointly managed by the Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration\u2014lacked the membership and leadership needed to  effectively and efficiently oversee and direct the program.  Specifically, the Defense committee member with acquisition authority  did not attend committee meetings and sometimes contradicted the  committee\u2019s decisions. Further, the committee did not track its action  items to closure, and many of the committee\u2019s decisions did not  achieve desired outcomes. To address these issues, we  recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the key committee  member to attend and participate in committee meetings. Additionally,  we recommended that the heads of the agencies that participate in  the committee direct the committee members to track action items to  closure, and identify the desired outcomes associated with each of the  committee\u2019s actions.", "Further, we reported that the launch date for an NPOESS  demonstration satellite had been delayed by over 5 years and the cost  estimate for the program had more than doubled\u2014from $6.5 billion to  about $15 billion. In February 2010, a presidential task force  decided to disband NPOESS and, instead, have the agencies  undertake separate acquisitions.  \uf0b7  Since 2007, we have reported on a range of acquisition weaknesses  facing the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Secure Border  Initiative Network\u2014also known as SBInet. For example, in January  2010, we reported that DHS had not effectively managed key aspects  of the SBInet testing program such as defining test plans and  procedures in accordance with important elements of relevant  guidance. In light of these weaknesses, we made recommendations  to DHS related to the content, review, and approval of test planning  documentation.", "In May 2010, we reported that the final acceptance of the first two  SBInet deployments had slipped from November 2009 and March  2010 to September 2010 and November 2010, respectively, and that  the cost-effectiveness of the system had not been justified. We  concluded that DHS had not yet demonstrated that the considerable  time and money being invested to acquire and develop SBInet was a  wise and prudent use of limited resources. The Secretary of  Homeland Security ordered a departmentwide assessment of the  SBInet program; the Secretary\u2019s decision was motivated in part by  continuing delays in the development and deployment of SBInet  capabilities and concerns that the SBInet system had not been  adequately justified by a quantitative assessment of cost and benefits.  Based on the results of the assessment, in January 2011, the DHS  Secretary decided to end SBInet as originally conceived.", "In May 2010, we reported that after spending $127 million over 9  years on an outpatient scheduling system, the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) has not implemented any of the planned  system\u2019s capabilities and is essentially starting over. After  determining that the system could not be deployed, the department  terminated the contract and ended the program in September 2009.  We concluded that the department\u2019s efforts to successfully complete  the system had been hindered by weaknesses in several key project  management disciplines and a lack of effective oversight that, if not  addressed, could undermine the department\u2019s second effort to replace  the scheduling system. We recommended that the department take  action to improve key processes, including acquisition management,  requirements management, system testing, implementation of earned  value management, risk management, and program oversight.", "In June 2011, we reported that end users were not sufficiently  involved in defining requirements for the Federal Emergency  Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program\u2019s  insurance policy and claims management system. After conducting  an assessment of the program prompted by problems identified in end  user testing, FEMA leadership cancelled the system because it failed  to meet end user expectations. This decision forced the agency to  continue to rely on an outdated system that is neither effective nor  efficient. In order to avoid the root causes of this program\u2019s failure, we  recommended that for future related modernization attempts, DHS  should ensure that key stakeholders are adequately involved in  requirements development and management.", "Additionally, we have previously reported on investments in need of  management attention across the federal government. For example, in  April 2011, we reported on the visibility into federal IT investments  provided by the IT Dashboard\u2014a publicly available website that displays  detailed information on federal agencies\u2019 major IT investments, including  assessments of actual performance against cost and schedule targets  (referred to as ratings) for approximately 800 major federal IT  investments. Specifically, we reported that, as of March 2011, the  Dashboard provided visibility into over 300 IT investments, totaling almost  $20 billion, in need of management attention.

According to  OMB officials, agency CIOs are required to update each major investment  in the IT Dashboard with a rating based on the CIO\u2019s evaluation of certain  aspects of the investment, such as risk management, requirements  management, contractor oversight, and human capital. According to  OMB, these data are intended to provide a near real-time perspective of  the performance of these investments, as well as a historical perspective.  Further, the public display of these data is intended to allow OMB,  congressional and other oversight bodies, and the general public to hold  government agencies accountable for results and progress.", "In January 2010, the Federal CIO began leading TechStat sessions\u2014 reviews of selected IT investments between OMB and agency  leadership\u2014to increase accountability and transparency and improve  performance. OMB has identified factors that may result in an investment  being selected for a TechStat session, such as\u2014but not limited to\u2014 evidence of (1) poor performance; (2) duplication with other systems or  projects; (3) unmitigated risks; and (4) misalignment with policies and  best practices.", "OMB officials stated that as of June 30, 2011, 63 TechStat sessions had  been held with federal agencies. According to OMB, these sessions  enabled the government to improve or terminate IT investments that were  experiencing performance problems. For example, in June 2010, the  Federal CIO led a TechStat on the National Archives and Records  Administration\u2019s (NARA) Electronic Records Archives investment that  resulted in six corrective actions, including halting fiscal year 2012  development funding pending the completion of a strategic plan. Similarly,  in January 2011, we reported that NARA had not been positioned to  identify potential cost and schedule problems early, and had not been  able to take timely actions to correct problems, delays, and cost increases  on this system acquisition program. Moreover, we estimated that the  program would likely overrun costs by between $205 and $405 million if  the agency completed the program as originally designed. We made  multiple recommendations to the Archivist of the United States, including  establishing a comprehensive plan for all remaining work, improving the  accuracy of key performance reports, and engaging executive leadership  in correcting negative performance trends.", "Drawing on the visibility into federal IT investments provided by the IT  Dashboard and TechStat sessions, in December 2010, OMB issued a  plan to reform IT management throughout the federal government over an  18-month time frame.

According to OMB officials, they have taken several actions pursuant to  this plan. For example, pursuant to Action Item Number 10\u2014development  of an IT best practices collaboration platform\u2014in April 2011 the CIO  Council launched an IT best practices collaboration website. According  to OMB, this portal provides federal program managers with access to a  searchable database of program management best practices in order to  promote interagency collaboration and real-time problem solving related  to IT programs. The portal contains links to case studies by federal  agencies demonstrating the use of best practices in managing large-scale  IT systems.

The Decennial  Response Integration System (DRIS) provided a system for collecting and  integrating census responses from forms and telephone interviews.  Specifically, DRIS integrated the following three primary functions:  \uf0b7  Paper data capture: Processed paper census questionnaires sent by  mail from respondents. The system sorted the questionnaires and  captured data from them, which were turned into electronic data.  \uf0b7  Telephone questionnaire assistance: Provided respondents with  assistance in understanding their questionnaire, and captured  responses for forms completed over the phone.

These nine critical success factors are  consistent with leading industry practices for IT acquisitions. Table 2  shows the nine factors, and examples of how agencies implemented  them are discussed below.", "Officials from all seven selected investments cited active engagement  with program stakeholders\u2014individuals or groups (including, in some  cases, end users) with an interest in the success of the acquisition\u2014as a  critical factor to the success of those investments. Agency officials stated  that stakeholders, among other things, reviewed contractor proposals  during the procurement process, regularly attended program  management office sponsored meetings, were working members of  integrated project teams, and were notified of problems and concerns  as soon as possible. For example:  \uf0b7  Census officials stated that the DRIS stakeholders were members of  the integrated project team. Their responsibilities as members of the  team included involvement in requirements development, participation  in peer reviews of contractual deliverables, and review of contractor  proposals.", "IRS officials told us that consistent and open communication with  internal and external stakeholders has been critical to the success of  CADE 2. For example, IRS officials told us that they regularly report  progress made on CADE 2, as well as risk information on the program  to oversight bodies, IRS executives, and IRS internal stakeholders.", "In addition, officials from two investments noted that actively engaging  with stakeholders created transparency and trust, and increased the  support from the stakeholders. For example, NNSA officials noted that  notifying MOMentum stakeholders of potential issues as soon as they  were identified helped to foster transparency and trust; this included  getting stakeholders\u2019 approval to use a cost- and schedule-tracking  approach that was not the agency\u2019s policy, but which ultimately saved the  program money and time. Additionally, CBP officials noted that  communication with the WHTI stakeholders was greatly enhanced by the  use of a consistent message that described, for example, the goals of the  program, deployment plans, privacy implications of the Radio Frequency  Identification infrastructure, and impact of the program on select groups  crossing the border, including U.S. and Canadian children and Native  Americans. CBP officials stated that this standardization created a  consistent, unified vision and ensured that the message stayed on  course.", "Consistent with this factor, relevant guidance calls for programs to  coordinate and collaborate with stakeholders in order to address their  concerns and ensure that they fulfill their commitments.

For example:  IRS officials stated that the Treasury Secretary utilized his critical  position pay authority to hire executives for CADE 2 who had  demonstrated success in managing large-scale transformation efforts  in accordance with best practices. Specifically, IRS officials stated that  the CADE 2 program manager was previously responsible for the  design, development, and implementation of several major global  information technology solutions for a major corporation.  \uf0b7  CBP officials explained that a factor critical to the success of the  acquisition was that almost every member of the team working on  WHTI had a good understanding of acquisitions\u2014some even held  acquisition certifications\u2014in addition to their understanding of  program management. According to those officials, these skills  contributed to effective program oversight of the WHTI contractors  through all phases of the acquisition, not just during contract award.", "Additionally, officials from three of the seven investments also cited the  use of subject matter experts\u2019 knowledge in their cognizant areas as a  contributing factor to their programs\u2019 successes. For example, VA officials  stated that the OHRS program relied extensively on the subject matter  experts\u2019 occupational health experience\u2014treating them as part of the  development team and including them in decision making. Two  investments in our sample even went one step further\u2014by selecting the  program manager from the end user organization as opposed to an  individual with an IT background. For example, NNSA officials stated that  they used a project manager from the end user organization as opposed  to an individual from the department\u2019s information technology office. This  individual had decades of experience managing shop floor control  systems. As a result, he was well aware of how the work on the shop floor  is done and focused on safely delivering the necessary functional  requirements to the end user.", "Leading guidance also recognizes that programs should ensure that  program staffs acquire the knowledge and skills needed to perform the  project.
