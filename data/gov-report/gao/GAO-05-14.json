Before 1999, HUD relied largely on the states' licensing processes to ensure that appraisers were qualified, but the states' minimum licensing standards did not specifically include proficiency in HUD's appraisal requirements. HUD's 1999 guidance requires appraisers to, among other things, pass an examination on HUD appraisal methods and reporting. Further, a 2003 regulation provides for, among other things, removing from the roster appraisers whose licenses have been suspended or revoked. However, HUD has limited quality control over the approval process, limiting the department's assurance that its criteria are being effectively implemented. HUD has adopted an oversight approach that focuses on appraisers it believes pose risks to FHA's mortgage insurance fund, but certain weaknesses exist in its implementation. HUD's guidance calls for its homeownership centers (HOCs)--which are largely responsible for appraiser oversight--to develop quarterly targeting lists of appraisers for review based on certain criteria, or risk factors. The primary factor is the rate of defaults in certain loans associated with the appraiser; others include large numbers of appraisals as well as appraisals for loans made under one of HUD's programs known to be at higher risk of fraud and abuse. However, the HOCs do not maintain a permanent record of the data used to identify the targeted appraisers--even though HUD's automated system would enable them to--which limits HUD's ability to verify that those targeted were those that met the criteria and to determine the effectiveness of its targeting criteria in reducing risk to the mortgage insurance fund. GAO found that during fiscal year 2003 and the first half of fiscal year 2004 the HOCs generally reviewed the appraisers they identified as high risk and targeted for review. However, they reviewed fewer appraisals for each targeted appraiser than HUD's guidance prescribes: on average, about 5.6 appraisals instead of the 10 called for. GAO also found that HOC staff did not routinely visit appraised properties to verify the work of contractors whoconduct field reviews of selected appraisers. To facilitate enforcement actions against appraisers, HUD expanded the HOCs' authority to sanction appraisers and developed a new appraisal scoring system. According to HUD, the number of actions taken to remove appraisers from its roster has increased from 25 at a cost of over $10 million in 1998 to 132 at a cost of under $300,000 in 2003. HUD also developed a tool that scores each appraiser on several appraisals, weighting the scores to capture violations that pose the greatest risk to FHA's mortgage insurance fund. According to HUD, this tool allows the department to sanction appraisers more consistently."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Incomplete or inaccurate real estate appraisals resulting in property  overvaluations could expose the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\u2014which  insured about 3.7 million single-family mortgage loans with a total value of  about $425 billion in fiscal years 2001 to 2003\u2014to greater financial risks.

HUD insures private lenders  against losses on mortgages for single-family homes\u2014which HUD defines  as structures with one to four dwelling units\u2014and plays a particularly large  role in certain market segments, including low-income borrowers and  first-time homebuyers. The loan amount that HUD can insure is based, in  part, on the appraised value of the home. The primary role of appraisals in  the loan underwriting process is to provide evidence that the collateral  value of the property is sufficient to avoid losses on loans if the borrower is  unable to repay the loan. If a borrower defaults and the lender  subsequently forecloses on the loan, the lender can file an insurance claim  with HUD for nearly all of its losses, including the unpaid balance of the  loan. After the claim is paid, the lender transfers the title of the home to  HUD, which is responsible for managing and selling the property. Most of  the mortgages are insured by FHA under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance  Fund. To cover claims for lenders\u2019 losses, FHA deposits insurance  premiums paid by borrowers into the fund, which, historically, has been  self-sufficient. Figure 1 shows the role appraisals play as part of the  home-buying process.", "As figure 1 indicates, the purpose of a HUD appraisal is to (1) determine the  property\u2019s eligibility for mortgage insurance on the basis of its condition  and location and (2) estimate the value of the property for mortgage  insurance purposes. In performing these tasks, the appraiser is required to  identify any readily observable deficiencies impairing the safety, sanitation,  structural soundness, and continued marketability of the property and to  assess the property\u2019s compliance with other minimum standards and  requirements.", "HUD maintains a roster of appraisers who have satisfied the requirements  to be certified to perform HUD appraisals. Lenders underwriting mortgages  to be insured by HUD must select one of the approximately 26,000  appraisers listed on the appraiser roster to prepare an appraisal of the  mortgaged property. In fiscal year 2003, appraisers listed on HUD\u2019s roster  performed 902,118 appraisals for the purposes of HUD mortgage insurance.", "HUD\u2019s oversight of appraisers who appraise properties with mortgages  insured by HUD is the responsibility of the Processing and Underwriting  Divisions at the four homeownership centers (HOCs).

Figure 2 below shows the distribution of  appraisers throughout the HOCs, each of which is responsible for a  multistate region.

Starting in fiscal year 2000,  HUD\u2019s Real Estate Assessment Center assumed the responsibility of  performing these field reviews for the HOCs and used an automated  system\u2014the Single Family Appraiser Subsystem\u2014to review the quality of  appraisals and identify those that were poorly prepared.

In 1999, we reported  that HUD\u2019s guidance called for random reviews of 10 percent of all  appraisals. HUD modified this approach and now targets for review  appraisers who are associated with known risks to FHA\u2019s mortgage  insurance fund, including those associated with a large number of  defaulted loans, those who perform a large volume of appraisals, and those  who appraise properties for loans with characteristics that are associated  with high default and claim rates, including loans made under the 203(k)  rehabilitation program, loans with nonprofit mortgagors, and loans for  properties with multiple (three to four) units. HUD\u2019s new approach is  intended to identify poorly performing appraisers rather than poorly  prepared appraisals. The goal of this approach is to remove from the  appraiser roster appraisers who have not complied with HUD requirements  and therefore pose a risk to FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance fund, disqualifying  them from doing business with HUD.", "The \u201cearly default rate\u201d is the primary factor that HUD uses to identify  poorly performing appraisers. On a quarterly basis, each HOC first  identifies appraisers with the highest percentage of early defaults over the  last 12-month period. Early defaults are defined as those that occur within  12 months of loan origination and represent a delinquency\u2014which occurs  when the borrower is unable to honor the mortgage obligation\u2014of 90 days  or greater. Each HOC next identifies, from the pool of appraisers  associated with high early default rates, those appraisers who performed  10 or more appraisals and who performed appraisals for five or more  defaulted mortgages. To do this, HUD uses its Neighborhood Watch Early  Warning System\u2014a Web-based software application that displays loan  performance data for lenders and appraisers by loan types and geographic  areas using FHA-insured single-family loan information\u2014which was  enhanced to include summary and loan level appraiser data to enable the  targeting of appraisers for review. The system not only helps HUD target  appraisers associated with a high rate of early defaults but also provides  HUD the ability to identify and analyze patterns\u2014by appraiser, geographic  area, or originating lender\u2014in loans that go into early default.", "According to HUD\u2019s guidance, each HOC must develop a target list of  appraisers to be reviewed based on the targeting criteria. They also must  review at least 30 appraisers each quarter, but these do not necessarily  need to be pulled from the target lists. In addition to selecting appraisers  using the targeting criteria, the HOCs also may review appraisers for other  reasons. For example, HOC officials informed us that they also include on  the targeting lists appraisers who have recently been sanctioned and have  completed their sanction period. The officials indicated that this helps  them to ensure that recently sanctioned appraisers have corrected their  relevant deficiencies and do not repeat past performance problems.  However, because this targeting criterion is not required, there is no  assurance that it will be used consistently. The HOCs may also review  appraisers based on complaints from homebuyers and referrals from other  HUD offices.", "To help identify appraisers to be placed on the target lists, HUD has  recently implemented a statistical risk-based appraiser-sampling algorithm.  This algorithm helps to identify appraisers for desk and field reviews,  focusing on those who are more likely to be associated with adverse  outcomes, including (1) early default of an FHA insured loan, (2) large  dollar amount of claims on the FHA mortgage insurance fund, or (3)  severity of the net dollar loss on the FHA mortgage insurance fund. The  algorithm also incorporates risk factors statistically related to these  adverse outcomes, including appraiser workload, performance in high-risk  programs, and geographical area. According to HUD, this enhanced and  automated targeting helps to ensure the efficient use of resources for field  reviews.", "Because the HOCs do not maintain a permanent record of the data used to  identify appraisers for review each quarter, we could not verify that the  appraisers they placed on their target lists were actually those that met  HUD\u2019s criteria. The HOCs maintain general information about the reasons  why appraisers are targeted for review, specifically labeling the reasons  appraisers are targeted as \u201chigh default rate,\u201d \u201chigh volume,\u201d or high-risk  loans or properties. However, they do not maintain specific early default  rate information for the appraisers targeted, even though early default rate  is the primary factor behind HUD\u2019s targeting approach. The Neighborhood  Watch Early Warning system allows HUD officials to maintain this  information. For example, HUD uses this system to target lenders  participating in its Single-Family Mortgage Insurance programs for review  and maintains targeted lenders\u2019 early default information. However,  according to HOC officials, once the appraiser target lists are created, the  HOCs do not maintain the targeted appraisers\u2019 early default information.  Without the specific default rate information, we were unable to determine  whether the HOCs reviewed those targeted appraisers who posed the  greatest risk based on high default rate. More importantly, in the absence of  this information, HUD is unable to monitor the HOCs to ensure that the  appropriate appraisers were targeted and reviewed based on its criteria  and may be unable to determine the effectiveness of its targeting criteria in  reducing risk to the mortgage insurance fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Reviewed Most Targeted Appraisers, but Reviews Were Not Always Complete", "paragraphs": ["Overall, the HOCs reviewed 730 (almost 78 percent) of the 936 appraisers  who were placed on the target lists during fiscal year 2003 and the first half  of fiscal year 2004.

Prior to receiving this expanded authority, the only  enforcement tool at the HOCs\u2019 disposal was issuance of limited denials of  participation. However, the HOCs needed to refer limited denials of  participation to headquarters, and the sanctions were only effective in the  particular HOC\u2019s jurisdiction for a year.

The tool provides the rater with a  systematic way of thoroughly examining the written appraisal and carrying  out the corresponding field review. Based on the desk and field review  data, the system yields a recommendation of removal, education, or notice  of deficiency. For example, questions associated with appraisal factors that  are considered to be of greater risk to the fund\u2014such as the accuracy of  market value of the property and characterization of repair  conditions\u2014receive a higher weight and automatically result in a removal  recommendation if the appraisal exceeds the maximum allowable points.", "The Appraisal Review Process tool allows HUD to review appraisers and  impose sanctions on them in a systematic way. In 1999, we reported that  HUD was not holding appraisers accountable for the quality of their  appraisals and that the primary reason for HUD\u2019s inability to pursue  enforcement actions against poorly performing appraisers was poor record  keeping. According to HUD officials, the Appraisal Review Process\u2019s  systematic approach to reviewing appraisers\u2019 work and maintaining  electronic records of appraisers\u2019 performance has helped the HOCs  maintain better documentation. The data manager at each HOC orders  cases for each of the targeted appraisers and assigns them to a desk  reviewer. Based on the results of the desk review, the desk reviewer can  decide that a field review for a particular appraisal is warranted or that no  further action is necessary. If a field review is warranted, the appraisal is  assigned to a contractor or HUD employee, who measures the quality and  accuracy of appraisers\u2019 performance in the completion of the  desk-reviewed appraisal and up to four other appraisals prepared by the  targeted appraiser and inputs the results electronically into the Appraisal  Review Process. Based on the desk and field review data, the system yields  a recommendation of removal, education, or notice of deficiency. A HUD  rater then looks at the field review score generated by the system, factors  in past performance and results from other appraisals, and recommends a  proposed action. The branch chief must concur before the appraiser is  notified of the action, at which point the appraiser has 20 days to appeal.

In July 2004, HUD issued a final rule clarifying  lenders\u2019 accountability for the quality of appraisals on properties securing  FHA-insured mortgages. Specifically, the rule provides that lenders who  submit appraisals that do not meet HUD requirements are subject to the  imposition of sanctions by the department. The rule applies to both  sponsor lenders, who underwrite loans, and loan correspondents, who  originate loans on behalf of sponsor lenders. HUD believes these changes  will help ensure better compliance with appraisal standards and ensure  that homebuyers receive an accurate statement of appraised value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The importance of accurate appraisals to HUD\u2019s Single-Family Mortgage  Insurance programs underscores the need for effective appraiser oversight.  HUD relies on appraisals to ensure that the billions of dollars in mortgage  loans it insures annually accurately reflect the value of the homes being  mortgaged. Since our April 1999 report, HUD has taken a number of steps  designed to ensure the qualifications of appraisers on its roster; improve  the efficiency and effectiveness of its oversight, specifically by revising its  guidance to focus on appraisers (rather than appraisals) and incorporating  a risk-based monitoring approach; and facilitate enforcement actions by  empowering HOCs and developing a scoring system to promote  consistency. However, certain weaknesses in implementing these  initiatives limit their ability to (1) lower HUD\u2019s risk of insuring properties  that are overvalued and (2) minimize potential losses to FHA\u2019s mortgage  insurance fund. Thus, opportunities exist to enhance HUD\u2019s appraiser  approval and monitoring efforts.", "HUD\u2019s process for verifying that appraisers meet all relevant criteria when  applying for placement on its roster lacks effective quality control. An  effective control process is essential for HUD to systematically assure and  demonstrate that all eligibility criteria are verified with respect to  appraisers applying for placement on the roster so they can perform  appraisals in connection with HUD\u2019s Single-Family Mortgage Insurance  programs.", "Further, while HUD\u2019s guidance specifies criteria for targeting appraisers  based on a set of known risk factors, it does not require the HOCs to target  for review appraisers who have been recently sanctioned, even though the  HOCs sometimes do so in order to ensure that the problem for which the  appraiser was sanctioned has been resolved. Requiring this criterion for  targeting appraisers for review could help assure that sanctioned  appraisers will not repeat past performance problems. Similarly, HUD does  not require that the HOCs maintain historical information, particularly data  on the associated default rates of loans, used to target and select appraisers  for review. Without this information, HUD cannot demonstrate that the  appropriate appraisers are being systematically targeted and reviewed  based on its criteria and may be unable to determine the effectiveness of its  targeting criteria in reducing risk to the mortgage insurance fund.", "HUD rarely verifies the work of its field review contractors through on-site  evaluations, weakening the department\u2019s ability to ensure that contracted  work is actually performed and to accurately assess the quality of the  appraisals used to support the loans the department insures. While it  entails costs, on-site monitoring is an essential part of any monitoring  process and is an important way to verify that work is actually being  conducted and to accurately assess the quality of appraisals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the financial risks assumed by HUD and to further enhance its  oversight of appraisers participating in HUD\u2019s Single-Family Mortgage  Insurance programs, we recommend that the Secretary of HUD direct the  Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner to  institute reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the  appraiser roster to ensure that applicants\u2019 conformance to eligibility  criteria is verified;  consider a requirement to include, when targeting appraisers for review,  those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period in  order to ensure that these appraisers have corrected their relevant  deficiencies;  maintain the historical information, particularly early loan default  information, used to target appraisers for review in order to ensure that  the HOCs target and review appraisers based on the criteria in HUD  guidance; and  implement a cost-effective field review contractor oversight process  that includes on-site monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HUD for its review and comment. In  written comments from HUD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Housing\u2013Federal  Housing Commissioner, HUD agreed with three of our four  recommendations, but disagreed with our presentation of its  accomplishments as well as some of our findings. The full text of HUD\u2019s  comments appears in appendix II.", "HUD agreed with three of our recommendations. Specifically, it agreed to  consider a requirement to include, when targeting appraisers for review,  those appraisers who have recently completed a sanction period. Also, the  department agreed to modify its system to archive quarterly reports in  response to our recommendation that it maintain the historical information  used to target appraisers for review. Further, it agreed to consider  implementing a cost-effective field review contractor oversight process  that includes on-site monitoring.", "However, HUD disagreed with our recommendation that it institute  reasonable controls on the process of placing appraisers on the appraiser  roster. HUD commented that our report inaccurately stated that HUD does  not document all verifications of appraisers\u2019 eligibility for the roster and  has limited quality control over the approval process, noting that the  department has a paper record of the application review process whereby  each applicant\u2019s eligibility is verified and documented. HUD also noted that  we did not review its paper records of the application review process. We  modified the report to clarify that our primary concern was quality control,  in general, and not solely documentation. We did not review the paper files  because it was not our objective to test whether or not specific  verifications had been performed, but rather to examine the overall  verification and documentation procedures HUD relies on to ensure that  appraisers meet its criteria. In doing so we observed a control weakness  and we modified the report to clarify this weakness. Specifically, a HUD  official conducts quality control reviews over a random sample of the  approving employees\u2019 work, but not on a routine basis. Also, HUD does not  document these quality control reviews and could not provide evidence  that they were performed. At a meeting to discuss the results of our review,  HUD\u2019s acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single-Family Housing and the  Director of the Office of Single-Family Program Development agreed that  they do not systematically document that all of the verifications have been  conducted and explained that they are developing a contract to establish a  system that will track these verifications. They also indicated that they are  planning to develop and implement a quality control plan for the appraiser  approval process. We modified the recommendation to emphasize that  HUD should institute reasonable quality controls on the process of placing  appraisers on the appraiser roster.", "HUD commented that while we acknowledged that it implemented policy  and procedural changes, we did not recognize the significance of these  changes, and that it is appropriate and necessary for our report to clearly  present and highlight these significant achievements. While we agree that  HUD has made significant improvements, our objectives concern HUD\u2019s  appraiser oversight as it currently exists, regardless of past weaknesses.  Nevertheless, we noted a number of specific improvements in the draft  report. Specifically, we noted that the number of removal actions taken by  the department has increased, while the number of field reviews and the  cost to the agency have decreased, as represented in table 1. With respect  to HUD\u2019s adoption of a new risk-based approach for monitoring appraisers,  we reported that HUD\u2019s process for monitoring appraisers is risk based and  that HUD modified its approach to target for review appraisers who are  associated with known risks to FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance fund. In addition,  we reported that the department issued guidance that required appraisers  to, among other things, pass an examination on HUD appraisal methods  and reporting. We also noted that HUD issued several rules and mortgagee  letters to strengthen its oversight and control of appraisers and improve  appraisal quality.", "HUD also disagreed with the accuracy of some of our findings. Specifically,  HUD characterized as inaccurate our statement that in the absence of  historical early default rate information, the department may be unable to  determine the effectiveness of its appraiser targeting criteria in reducing  risk to the mortgage insurance fund. HUD explained that its system directly  targets the appraisers that pose the greatest risk to the fund. We concur  that HUD\u2019s process is designed to so target, and our draft characterized the  approach as risk based and described the specific criteria HUD\u2019s process  calls for to target appraisers for review. However, because the HOCs do not  maintain a permanent record of the data showing which appraisers met the  criteria in each quarter, we could not verify that the appraisers the HOCs  placed on their target lists were actually those that met HUD\u2019s criteria.  Similarly, without these records, HUD is unable to determine whether the  HOCs reviewed those appraisers who met the criteria. In turn, this limits  HUD\u2019s ability to determine, over time, the effectiveness of its targeting  criteria in reducing risk to the mortgage insurance fund. HUD went on to  say that FHA would modify its system to archive quarterly reports in order  to maintain the historical targeting records.", "In addition, HUD disagreed that it conducted limited oversight of field  review contractors and that such efforts are affected by limited travel  resources. HUD explained that it conducts a 100 percent review of  contractors\u2019 work and that the HOCs do not conduct on-site reviews  (which may require travel resources) because the 100 percent review  method serves as an appropriate and effective risk-control measure. As we  noted in our report, HUD\u2019s guidance states that on-site monitoring reviews  by HUD staff are essential for high-risk program participants to the extent  practicable. Further, HOC officials told us that they are constrained by  limited travel resources and so are not able to make on-site visits to  properties. At a meeting to discuss the results of our review, HUD\u2019s acting  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single-Family Housing and the Director of  the Office of Single-Family Program Development agreed that contract  oversight is important but indicated that it is often not cost efficient to send  employees on site to review contractors\u2019 work because many of the  department\u2019s contractors are responsible for reviewing only a few  properties. However, as we reported in our draft, these officials indicated  that they are planning to develop a cost-efficient oversight mechanism.", "Finally, HUD disagreed with our conclusion that weaknesses in  implementing its appraiser oversight initiatives limit the department\u2019s  ability to (1) lower its risk of insuring properties that are overvalued and  (2) minimize potential losses to FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance fund. HUD also  stated that our recommendations would not affect FHA\u2019s risk. As we stated  in the draft report, we did not attempt to estimate the impact that HUD\u2019s  appraiser oversight has on the financial health of FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance  fund. While we agree that HUD\u2019s new targeting methodology is intended to  reduce risks to FHA, our concern is whether the methodology is operating  as intended. Our recommendations relate to the implementation of  processes that are directed at controlling and minimizing risk and we  continue to believe that opportunities exist to enhance HUD\u2019s appraiser  approval and monitoring.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of HUD.

We  reviewed HUD\u2019s risk-based targeting guidance and obtained data for fiscal  year 2003 through the first half of fiscal year 2004 from each of the HOCs.  We then compared each of the HOCs\u2019 appraiser target lists to their desk and  field review lists to determine the number of targeted appraisers that were  actually reviewed.
