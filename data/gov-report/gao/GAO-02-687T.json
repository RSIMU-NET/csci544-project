These concerns have been underscored by reports of long-standing vulnerabilities, including weak controls over building access.", "As you requested, today I will discuss commercially available security technologies that can be deployed to protect these facilities, ranging from turnstiles, to smart cards, to biometric systems. While many of these technologies can provide highly effective technical controls, the overall security of a federal building will hinge on establishing robust risk management processes and implementing the three integral concepts of a holistic security process: protection, detection, and reaction.", "First I will provide an overview of the technologies that provide protection, detection, and reaction capabilities against the most prevalent threats. I will describe the characteristics and capabilities of each of these technologies and summarize their effectiveness, as well as their maturity and other performance factors to be considered in implementing them. While not endorsing any product, I will also identify vendors and costs. Finally, I will discuss the considerable technical challenges and user acceptance issues still ahead in their implementation.", "In conducting our review, we interviewed officials at federal agencies responsible for the physical security of their buildings, including the General Service Administration\u2019s (GSA) Federal Protective Service, the Defense Protective Service, the U.S. Capitol Police, and GAO\u2019s own Office of Safety and Security. To understand the availability and effectiveness of newer security technologies, we also met with officials from GSA\u2019s General Products Center and technologists from the National Institute of Justice\u2019s Office of Science and Technology, the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) Biometrics Management Office, and the Biometrics Foundation. We coordinated with the Security Industry Association and its advisory councils that represent the different security industries within the scope of our work. They provided us with valuable information and contacts. We attended the Biometric Consortium Conference and the International Security Conference and Exposition, where newer technologies were demonstrated and where we discussed aspects of the technologies with industry representatives. We also discussed the results of several of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s biometric prototype initiatives with program managers. To familiarize ourselves with available security products, we also conducted an extensive literature search and obtained and perused technical studies performed by independent organizations and compared their results with vendor-provided information. We selected the vendors listed in the attachments to this testimony based on factors such as market share, assessment studies, and availability of equipment on the GSA schedule. We obtained equipment prices from vendors and GSA schedules. Finally, we relied on previous GAO work on physical building security. We performed our audit work from February through April 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["It is the federal government\u2019s responsibility to assure the physical protection of its facilities and the safety of employees and visitors of those federal buildings. GSA, through its Public Building Service (PBS) is the primary property manager for the federal government, owning or leasing 39 percent of the federal government\u2019s office space. Approximately one million federal employees, millions of visitors, and thousands of children and their day-care providers enter these facilities each day. Within PBS, the Federal Protective Service is responsible for the security of most GSA- managed buildings.", "Over thirty other executive branch agencies, including DoD and the departments of State, Veterans Affairs, and Transportation, have some level of authority to purchase, own, or lease office space or buildings. These agencies are responsible for the security of their own sites. The U.S. Secret Service is in charge of the security of the White House and other executive office buildings. The U.S. Capitol Police secures the Capitol complex, which includes the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings. The marshal of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court Police tend to the security of the Supreme Court.

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, aroused governmentwide concern about the physical security of federal buildings. One day after the bombing, then President Clinton directed Justice to assess the vulnerability of all federal office buildings in the United States, particularly to acts of terrorism and other forms of violence. Justice led a working group in developing a report that established governmentwide minimum standards for security at all federal facilities. Also in 1995, the president directed executive departments and agencies to upgrade the security of their facilities to the extent feasible based on the report\u2019s recommendations, giving GSA this responsibility for the buildings it controls. Among the minimum standards for buildings of a higher risk level specified by the Justice report are security technologies, including closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras, intrusion detection systems with central monitoring capability, and metal detectors and x-ray machines to screen people and their belongings at entrances to federal buildings.", "In June 1998, we testified on GSA\u2019s efforts to improve federal building security. We reported that although GSA had made progress implementing security upgrades in its buildings, it did not have the valid data needed to assess the extent to which completed upgrades had helped to increase security or reduce vulnerability to the greatest threats to federal office buildings. We also expressed concerns about whether all GSA buildings had been evaluated for security needs. We recommended that GSA correct the data in its tracking and accounting systems, ensure that all GSA buildings were evaluated, and develop program goals, measures, and evaluations to better manage its security enhancement program. In October 1999 we again testified on GSA\u2019s efforts. During this review, we found that the accuracy of GSA\u2019s security upgrade tracking system had improved and that almost all of its buildings had been evaluated for security needs.", "However, a review we performed in April and May 2000 exposed a significant security vulnerability in the access controls at many government buildings. Posing as law enforcement officers, we gained access to 18 federal facilities, where we reached the offices of 15 cabinet secretaries or agency heads. Our briefcases were not searched for weapons or explosives.", "As mentioned previously, last September\u2019s terrorist attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon have focused even greater security concerns about federal buildings. Such concerns have prompted agency officials to create a more stringent security environment at their facilities. For example, the Federal Emergency Management Administration recently informed GSA officials that it was canceling plans to move its national headquarters and 1,000 workers to the Potomac Center redevelopment near the waterfront in Washington, D.C. Citing security concerns about the new building, the agency backed out of a 10-year lease.", "Despite a show of increased security, it remains uncertain whether effective countermeasures have actually been implemented. For example, reporters who visited a number of government agencies in late October demonstrated that, without thorough screening, nonemployees could easily gain access to freely wander the buildings.", "Since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the federal government has already spent more than $1.2 billion on increased security measures for the federal government\u2019s office space. Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, increased resources have been appropriated for this purpose. Specifically, on September 18, 2001, President Bush signed the Fiscal Year 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 107- 38), appropriating $40 billion to respond to the terrorist attacks. The act provides funding to cover the physical protection of government facilities and employee security. On September 21, 2001, the president allocated $8.6 million from this appropriation to GSA\u2019s Federal Buildings Fund to provide increased security for federal buildings. On October 17, 2001, the president requested that Congress increase the total to $200.5 million for the Federal Building Fund for additional security services at federal buildings. The president\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget requests that $367 million be made available from the Federal Building Fund to fund costs associated with implementing security improvements to federal buildings.", "On March 21, 2002, the Bush administration asked Congress for an additional $27.1 billion in emergency funding for fiscal year 2002 for needs stemming from the September 11th terrorist attacks, $5.5 billion of which were for domestic security. Some of these requested funds will most likely be invested in technologies to enhance building security. It will be important to ensure that the technologies that these funds are spent on are effective."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Risk Management is the Foundation of", "paragraphs": ["The approach to good security is fundamentally similar regardless of the assets being protected. As GAO has previously reported for homeland security and information systems security, applying risk management principles can provide a sound foundation for effective security whether the assets are information, operations, people, or federal facilities. These principles, which have been followed by members of the intelligence and defense community for many years, can be reduced to five basic steps that help to determine responses to five essential questions.", "Because of the vast differences in types of federal facilities and the variety of risks associated with each of them, there is obviously no single approach to security that will work ideally for all buildings. Therefore, following these basic risk management steps is fundamental to determining security priorities and implementing appropriate solutions.", "The first step in risk management is to identify assets that must be protected and the impact of their potential loss. Included among the assets of federal facilities are the physical safety and peace of mind of the occupants, the value of the structure itself, and the importance of the mission of the organization housed in the facility. The symbolic value of certain landmark federal facilities and monuments must also be considered in the assessment.", "Who Are My Adversaries?", "The second step is to identify and characterize the threat to these assets. Is the threat, for example, that unauthorized individuals can gain access to the building to commit some crime, or that an authorized yet disgruntled employee intent on causing harm to fellow employees or the facility can get in, or, still more menacing, that a terrorist will introduce a chemical/biological agent or even a nuclear device into the building?", "The intent and capability of an adversary are the principal criteria for establishing the degree of threat to these assets. The terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, the Oklahoma City bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995, the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998, and last year\u2019s September 11th terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center leave no doubt as to the existence of adversaries intent on causing the maximum harm. And, as these events have tragically demonstrated, our adversaries certainly have the capability. Moreover, more recent information gathered by intelligence and law enforcement agencies have led government officials to believe that both foreign and domestic terrorist groups continue to pose threats to the security of our nation\u2019s infrastructure, including our public buildings.", "How Am I Vulnerable?", "Step three involves identifying and characterizing vulnerabilities that would allow identified threats to be realized. In other words, what weaknesses can allow a security breach? For a facility, weaknesses could include vulnerabilities in the physical layout of the building, its security systems, and processes. For example, the lack of a standoff distance between vehicle access and the building itself, which would allow an adversary to detonate a car or truck bomb within a dangerous distance of the building, is an example of a vulnerability in the perimeter security of a building. Or, it might be that an antiquated and labor-intensive access control system in combination with an inadequate security staff create weaknesses in security systems and processes that allow entrance to a building.", "What Are My Priorities?", "In the fourth step, risk must be assessed and priorities determined for protecting assets. Risk assessment examines the potential for the loss of or damage to an asset. Risk levels are established by assessing the impact of the loss or damage, threats to the asset, and vulnerabilities. For example, the risk of loss of human life due to poor access controls on weekends, when fewer people are working in the building, is lower than on weekdays during standard working hours.", "What Can I Do?", "The final step is to identify countermeasures to reduce or eliminate risks. In doing so, the advantages and benefits of these countermeasures must also be weighed against their disadvantages and costs.", "Many security technologies were developed in a research environment. However, in a real-world environment, some degree of security must be traded off against operational and safety considerations. Extreme security countermeasures cannot be implemented if they could disrupt operations or adversely affect the safety of the occupants of a building. For example, an access control system that uses draconian methods to screen employees at public entrances would be inappropriate except in buildings at the highest risk level because it would cause maximum inconvenience to large numbers of building occupants at peak traffic hours. Moreover, an access control system cannot be so rigid that it impedes the safe exit of a building\u2019s occupants during emergencies, such as a fire. In all cases, an acceptable balance between security and these competing factors must be reached, which can only be decided by the building\u2019s occupants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protection, Detection, and Reaction are Integral Security Concepts", "paragraphs": ["Countermeasures identified through the risk management process support the three integral concepts of a holistic security program: protection, detection, and reaction. Protection provides countermeasures such as policies, procedures, and technical controls to defend against attacks on the assets being protected. Detection monitors for potential breakdowns in protective mechanisms that could result in security breaches. Reaction, which requires human involvement, responds to detected breaches to thwart attacks before damage can be done. Because absolute protection is impossible to achieve, a security program that does not also incorporate detection and reaction is incomplete.", "To be effective, all three concepts must be elements of a cycle that work together continuously. To illustrate, suppose that the protection of a side door of a federal building is provided by a lock, which is wired to an intrusion detection sensor, which triggers an alarm to alert a guard to initiate a reaction. If someone picks the lock, thereby tripping an alarm, and a guard is monitoring the detection system in real time, she or he will detect the incident and can react to contain the intrusion and apprehend the intruder before damage is done. However, if no guard is monitoring the intrusion detection systems to react to the intrusion, the process breaks down and the security of the building may be compromised. In other words, technologies that implement the concepts of protection and detection cannot alone safeguard a building. An effective human reaction is essential to the security process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Myriad Commercially Available Security Technologies Support Security Concepts", "paragraphs": ["Myriad security technologies, at various stages of commercial development, support the security concepts of protection, detection, and reaction.

Detection systems look for dangerous objects and agents on persons, their belongings, and their vehicles at a building\u2019s entry points. Intrusion detection systems monitor for security incursions throughout a building to alert security staff to react to investigate and contain the intrusion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access Control Systems", "paragraphs": ["The first line of security within a federal building is to channel all access through entry control points where identity verification devices can be used for screening.

Accordingly, they range from automatic readers of special identification cards (something you have), to keypad entry devices that generally require a pin number or password (something you know), to more sophisticated systems that use biometrics (something you are) to verify the identity of persons seeking to enter a facility. More secure access control systems use a combination of several of these approaches at the same time for additional security.", "Technologies used by identity verification devices include the basic bar code or magnetic strip for card-swipe readers, similar to those used for credit cards, cards that use radio frequency signals and need only be passed within close proximity to a reader to identify the card holder, and smart cards that can contain biometric identifiers. Keypad entry devices are often used in combination with cards and card readers. Newer access control systems that use biometric technologies to verify the identity of individuals can significantly increase building security.", "The term biometrics covers a wide range of technologies used to verify identity by measuring and analyzing human characteristics. Identifiable physiological characteristics include fingerprints, retinas and irises, and hand and facial geometry. Identifiable behavioral characteristics are speech and signature. Biometrics theoretically represent a very effective security approach because biometric characteristics are distinct to each individual and, unlike identification cards and pin numbers or passwords, they cannot be easily lost, stolen, or guessed.", "Biometric systems first capture samples of an individual\u2019s unique characteristic that are then averaged to create a digital representation of the characteristic, known as a template. This template is stored and used to determine if the characteristic of the individual captured by the identity verification device at the entry control point matches the stored template of that individual\u2019s characteristic. Templates can be stored within the device itself, in a centralized database, or on an access card.", "Until recently, in addition to being very expensive, the performance of most biometric technologies had unreliable accuracy. However, prices have significantly decreased and, after years of research, the technology has recently improved considerably. Today biometric devices that read fingerprints and hand geometry have been operationally deployed and proven to be affordable and reliable. Nevertheless, other biometric technologies are not as mature and still tend to falsely reject authorized persons or falsely accept unauthorized persons. These reliability weaknesses will have to be overcome before their use can be widespread. User acceptance is also an issue with biometric technologies in that some individuals find them difficult, if not impossible, to use. Still other individuals resist biometrics in general because they perceive them as intrusive and infringing on their right to privacy.", "Once a person is authenticated, access control systems are designed to electronically allow passage through some barrier. Building access barriers can range from such conspicuous physical structures as revolving doors to all but transparent optical turnstiles that generate an alarm when an unauthorized individual attempts to pass.", "Table 1 provides a high-level description of access control technologies that can be deployed to protect federal facilities.

More sensitive and ergonomic handheld detector wands are also now commercially available to perform thorough and rapid follow-up screens.", "As individuals proceed through the metal detector, their carried items can be passed through an x-ray system, which scans the items to obtain an image of the contents. Low-energy x-ray systems are also currently being tested to screen individuals for hidden weapons and explosives. However, performance, privacy, and health issues associated with this technology will have to be overcome before it can be widely deployed.

Security personnel swab the surface of a person\u2019s belongings at entry control points to check for concealed explosives. The swab is then placed into the detection device, which tests for the presence of explosive traces. Portal explosive detection systems and systems that detect large vehicles carrying bombs are now commercially available, but the technology has not yet been widely deployed.

Security personnel can use this technology to monitor activity throughout a building, in particular at entryways, exits, stairwells, and other areas that are susceptible to intrusion. CCTV technology is mature, practical, and reasonably priced. Moreover, it is highly cost efficient because one person can monitor several areas on different screens at the same time from one central location. However, experiments have shown that relying on security staff to detect incidents by constantly monitoring scenes from the camera in real time is ineffective. Because watching camera screens is both boring and mesmerizing, the attention of most individuals has degenerated to well below acceptable levels after only 20 minutes of viewing. This is particularly true if staff are watching multiple monitors simultaneously. A more practical application of CCTV is to interface the CCTV system with electronic intrusion detection technologies, which alert security staff to potential incidents requiring monitoring.", "Electronic intrusion detectors are designed to identify penetrations into buildings through vulnerable perimeter barriers such as doors, windows, roofs, and walls. These systems use highly sensitive sensors that can detect an unauthorized entry or attempted entry through the phenomena of motion, vibrations, heat, or sound. Examples are technologies that detect motion through breaks in a transmitted infrared light beam and heat emitted from a warm object, such as a human body.", "When an intrusion is sensed, a control panel to which the sensors are connected transmits a signal to a central response area, which is continually monitored by security personnel. The sensor-detected incident will alert security personnel of the incident and where it is occurring so that personnel will know what monitor to pay attention to. By interfacing these technologies, security personnel can initially assess sensor-detected security events before determining how to react appropriately.

To illustrate this point, let us examine the following scenario: an organization has policies in place to mitigate the risk of an outsider committing a harmful act against its employees. One policy states that entry to the building is restricted to authorized personnel and another that no weapons may be brought into the building. An access control system implements the first policy by requiring that people wishing to enter present a smart card with a biometric that matches the stored biometric of the authorized person. A detection system implements the second policy by requiring people to pass through a metal detection portal and their belongings to be scanned by an x-ray machine. These procedures ensure compliance with the policies. However, to be effective, security personnel must enforce the policies by following the prescribed procedures. If security personnel allow exceptions to these procedures, they are failing to enforce compliance with the policies. Just as damaging is the lack of effective security processes. For example, if there are no processes in place to handle the entry of employees who have forgotten their identity access cards, a vulnerability may be created that could be exploited by adversaries.", "Breaches in security resulting from human error are more likely to occur if personnel do not understand the risks and the policies that are put in place to mitigate them. Training is essential to successfully implementing policies by ensuring that personnel exercise good judgment in following security procedures. In addition, having the best available security technology cannot ensure protection if people have not been trained in how to use it properly. Training is particularly essential if the technology requires personnel to master certain knowledge and skills to operate it. For example, x-ray inspection systems rely heavily on the operator to detect concealed objects in the generated x-ray images.

As always, it is important to keep in mind the adage of \u201cbuyer beware\u201d when making procurement decisions. There are publicly available resources that provide assessment guidance regarding security products. For example, the National Institute of Justice has evaluated a number of security products over the past few years and can serve as a valuable resource to federal agencies for making purchasing decisions.", "Also bear in mind that lesser technological solutions sometimes may be more effective and less costly than more advanced technologies. Dogs, for example, are an effective and time-proven tool for detecting concealed explosives. The dogs currently used by DoD, for example, can detect nine different types of explosive materials.

Therefore, systems are configured to verify the identity of users if the match exceeds an acceptable threshold.", "The effectiveness of biometric systems is characterized by two error statistics: false rejection rates (FRRs) and false acceptance rates (FARs). For each FRR there is a corresponding FAR. A false reject occurs when a system rejects a valid identity; a false accept occurs when a system incorrectly accepts an identity. If biometric systems were perfect, both error rates would be zero. However, all biometric technologies suffer FRRs and FARs that vary according to the individual technology and its stage of development.", "Because biometric access control systems are not capable of verifying identities with 100 percent accuracy, trade-offs must be considered during the final step of the risk management process when deciding on the appropriate level of security to establish. These trade-offs have to balance acceptable risk levels with the disadvantages of user inconvenience. For example, perfect security would require denying access to everyone. Conversely, granting access to everyone would result in denying access to no one. Obviously neither of these extremes is reasonable, and access control systems must operate somewhere between the two. How much risk one is willing to accommodate is the overriding factor in adjusting the threshold, which translates into determining the acceptable FAR. The tighter the security required, the lower the tolerable FAR.", "Vendors of biometric systems are currently claiming that false accepts occur once out of every 100,000 attempted entries and that the FRR is about 2 to 3 percent.

Since cameras vary in size, light sensitivity, resolution, type and power, it is essential to understand the target area before procuring a camera.

Just how important proper lighting is is reflected in the Defense Protective Service\u2019s having installed 98 percent of their CCTV cameras in well-lit areas.", "While CCTV can be used to supplement and reinforce security staff, using CCTV as an active surveillance tool is often not effective. Studies have shown that because monitoring video screens is both boring and mesmerizing, the attention span of a person watching and assessing a CCTV monitor degrades below acceptable levels after 20 minutes. CCTV is more effective when used, for example, at control points to actively allow or disallow individuals through a particular door on the basis of the security staff\u2019s recognition of the CCTV image of the individual.", "Most CCTV systems have all their connected cameras record continuously. The result is an abundance of video material that must be manually reviewed if an incident that cannot be narrowed down to a particular time is being investigated.

Detection is usually reported by an intrusion sensor and announced by an alarm (typically to a central response area). The intrusion alarm must then be followed by an assessment to determine the proper response. CCTV is typically used in internal assessments to determine the validity of the alarm.", "A variety of technologies have been developed for the detection of intrusions: Line sensors use cables that are either placed above ground or buried in the ground. When positioned just outside a building wall, they can detect both prowlers and tunneling activity. Some lines are sensitive to magnetic or electric disturbances that are transmitted through the ground to the sensing elements, while others respond to changes in pressure from an intruder\u2019s footstep or vehicle.", "Video motion detectors transform the viewing-only ability of CCTV cameras into a tracking and alarm system. By monitoring the video signals, the sensors detect changes caused by the movement of an object within the video\u2019s field of view. Sometimes only a portion of the total field of view is monitored for motion. The size of the moving object or its speed (for example, blowing debris or a flying bird) can sometimes be used to distinguish a person from other objects in motion.", "Balanced magnetic switches are an extension of the conventional magnetic switch used on doors and windows in a home security system and are widely used to indicate whether a door is open or closed.", "Conventional magnetic switches can be defeated by placing a steel plate or magnet over the switch, allowing the door to be opened while keeping the switch closed. Balanced magnetic switches activate an alarm if this defeat tactic is used.", "Sonic and vibration sensors detect intrusion indicators such as the sound and movements of breaking glass or wood at windows and walls. Because they are typically used in rooms during timeframes when legitimate access is not expected, these sensors can also be used to detect the motion of a person walking into or within a designated area. While changes in sound waves are typically detected by sonic sensors, vibrations are typically detected by the use of microwave radiation or infrared (IR) light (both of which are invisible to the naked eye). Microwave sensors generate a detection zone by sending out a continuous field of microwave energy. Intruders entering the detection zone cause a change in this field, triggering an alarm. IR technology operates in two methods: 1.  Active IR sensors inject infrared rays into the environment to detect changes. They generate an alarm when the IR light beam (similar to that used in a TV remote controller) is broken. Multiple active IR beams are often used at gates and doors to create a web of rays that make the system more impenetrable. 2.  Passive IR sensors, also known as pyroelectric sensors, operate on the fact that all humans (and animals) generate IR radiation according to their body temperatures. Humans, having a skin temperature of around 93F, generate IR energy with a wavelength between 9 and 10 micrometers. Passive IR sensors are therefore typically set to detect a range of 7 to 14 micrometers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Sensor technology has been relied on for many years as an effective countermeasure to security breaches. However, this technology is susceptible to nuisance alarms or false alarms not caused by intruders.

Some vibration sensors should not be mounted directly on window glass, as the mounting adhesive may not be designed to withstand long exposures to heat, cold, and condensation.
