As requested, GAO reviewed issues related to Army Industrial Operations\u0092 carryover. GAO\u0092s objectives were to determine whether, and to what extent, Army Industrial Operations\u0092 (1) actual carryover exceeded allowable carryover for fiscal years 2006 through 2012; (2) budget information on carryover approximated actual information for fiscal years 2006 through 2012, and if not, whether the Army took actions to align the two; and (3) carryover increased during fiscal years 2011 and 2012 and causes for the carryover. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant carryover guidance, analyzed carryover and related data for Industrial Operations, and interviewed Army officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2006 through 2012, Army's Industrial Operations' actual carryover was under the allowable amounts in 5 of the 7 fiscal years. However, carryover more than doubled during that period, reaching a high of $5.8 billion in fiscal year 2011. Army officials stated that fiscal year 2011 was an abnormal year because Industrial Operations (1) received more orders than it had ever received--$7.5 billion in new orders--and (2) implemented a system called the Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) that changed the business rules for recognizing revenue and therefore resulted in carryover being higher than it would have been under the prior system. Army officials anticipate carryover decreasing in fiscal year 2013. According to the Army fiscal year 2014 budget, the Army expects carryover to be under $4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013.", "The Army's budget estimates for carryover were less than the actual carryover amounts each year beginning in fiscal year 2006--at least $1.1 billion each year. GAO's analysis showed that the actual amounts of carryover exceeded budgeted amounts primarily because (1) the Army underestimated new orders to be received from customers for all 7 years reviewed, particularly with respect to procurement funded orders, and (2) for fiscal year 2011, Industrial Operations performed over $1 billion less work than budgeted because Army officials were unaware of the impact that LMP would have on revenue when developing the fiscal year 2011 budget. The Army is taking actions intended to better align the customers' budgets with Industrial Operations' budgets.", "Industrial Operations' carryover grew significantly in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 to represent about 12.7 and 9.5 months of work, respectively. GAO found three causes for the carryover: (1) the scope of requested work was not well defined, (2) parts were not available to perform the work, and (3) revenue recognition business rules were changed as part of the implementation of LMP. The Army formed a working group in April 2012 that identified actions to help reduce carryover. However, these actions have not been implemented and no timetable for implementation has been set."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to the Department of Defense (DOD) that are aimed at implementing the planned actions identified by the Army's working group to improve the budgeting and management of carryover.

We analyzed carryover beginning with  fiscal year 2006 because the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2006 budget reported a  consolidation of the Army Working Capital Fund\u2019s (AWCF) depot  maintenance and ordnance activity groups into a consolidated Industrial  Operations activity group, making a comparison to prior fiscal years  difficult. We met with responsible officials from the Army to obtain their  views on the causes for variances between actual carryover and (1) the  allowable amount and (2) budgeted carryover. We also met with these  officials to discuss actions the Army has taken and is taking to reduce the  amount of carryover. Further, we identified and analyzed any adjustments  made by the Army that increased the allowable carryover amounts or  reduced the amount of carryover.

Further, to  corroborate the information provided by these officials, we selected eight  weapon system workloads with high dollar amounts of fiscal year 2011  carryover from four Army depots. The carryover associated with these  workloads represented about 35 percent of Industrial Operations\u2019  carryover for fiscal year 2011 and was one of the top five workloads with  carryover at each of the four depots. We obtained and analyzed orders  and amendments associated with these workloads and discussed the  information in these documents with the depots to determine the causes  for the carryover. Additionally, we discussed and obtained documentation  on the actions the Army is taking to better manage and reduce carryover.

Customers,  such as the Army, use appropriated funds (including operation and  maintenance or procurement appropriations) to finance orders placed  with Industrial Operations. Industrial Operations provides the Army an in- house industrial capability to (1) conduct depot-level maintenance, repair,  and upgrade; (2) produce munitions and large-caliber weapons; and   (3) store, maintain, and demilitarize material for DOD. Industrial  Operations comprises 13 government-owned and operated installation  activities, each with unique core competencies. These include five  maintenance depots (Anniston, Alabama; Corpus Christi, Texas;  Letterkenny, Pennsylvania; Red River, Texas; and Tobyhanna,  Pennsylvania), three arsenals (Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Rock Island, Illinois;  and Watervliet, New York), two munitions production facilities (Crane,  Indiana, and McAlester, Oklahoma), and three storage sites (Blue Grass,  Kentucky; Sierra, California; and Tooele, Utah).

Too little carryover could result in some personnel not  having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year. On the other  hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds  from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the work until well  into the next fiscal year.

The point in time when revenue is recognized is important  because when an Industrial Operations activity performs work it earns  revenue and the carryover is reduced. Prior to the implementation of  LMP, the Army activities recognized revenue on parts and material when  the activities received the items and assigned them to orders. This  procedure led, in some cases, to Industrial Operations activities buying  material or spare parts and recognizing revenue and reducing carryover  before the parts and material were actually used in repairing weapon  systems.

In the  meantime, work essentially stopped on the new build program in July  and August 2012 because of the lack of sufficient containers to  complete 13 of the 17 modules on the fiscal year 2011 orders and 6  modules on the fiscal year 2012 orders. Without the containers, the  depot could not complete work on the fiscal years 2011 and 2012  orders and reduce carryover on the orders. The depot carried over  $79 million into fiscal year 2013 associated with the fiscal year 2011  and 2012 new build orders. A photo of a Force Provider is shown in  figure 5.", "The work that Red River and Letterkenny performed on the HMMWV in  fiscal years 2011 and 2012 outpaced the ability of the supply chain to  provide the parts. In June 2011, Red River and Letterkenny accepted  orders to overhaul 7,971 HMMWVs. At the end of fiscal year 2011, the  amount of the orders was $839 million, and of that amount, $837 million  carried over into fiscal year 2012. In order to perform the work on these  vehicles, Letterkenny had to reestablish its production line since it was  previously shut down because of the lack of HMMWV work. Further, both  depots had to hire contractor personnel to staff the production line and  establish a supply chain so that the depots could obtain the parts to  perform the work. Both depots encountered problems with obtaining  sufficient quantities of parts, such as doors, gunner protection kits,  windshields, turret bearings, and half shafts, to perform the work. This  parts problem was exacerbated at Red River when the depot went to a  double shift on disassembling and assembling HMMWVs in April 2012.  As a result of the parts shortage, at the end of fiscal year 2012, Red River  and Letterkenny completed 767 of the vehicles ordered in fiscal year  2011. In addition, the depots assembled another 4,254 vehicles but the  vehicles were missing parts. The depots carried over $356 million of  these orders into fiscal year 2013. A photo of a HMMWV is shown in  figure 6.", "As discussed previously, the implementation of LMP changed the  revenue recognition business rules and resulted in increased carryover in  fiscal years 2011 and 2012. The point in time when revenue is recognized  is important because when an Army Industrial Operations activity  performs work, it earns revenue, thereby reducing carryover. As  discussed earlier, the Army implemented LMP at two Industrial  Operations activities in fiscal year 2009 and 10 Industrial Operations  activities in fiscal year 2011. While the Army could not determine the  extent of the change on Industrial Operations\u2019 carryover resulting from  implementation of LMP, officials at Army headquarters, LCMCs, and the  depots stated that they believed carryover increased because of the  change in revenue recognition rules.", "For example, Corpus Christi reported in fiscal year 2011 that it accepted  orders totaling about $455 million to repair and upgrade 57 Black Hawk  helicopters. The established repair process time for the UH-60L Black  Hawk averaged approximately 1 year in fiscal year 2011. The change in  the business rules for recognizing revenue on parts and material because  of the implementation of LMP in May 2009 caused revenue on the fiscal  year 2011 orders to be recognized, or earned, in fiscal year 2012. Prior to  the implementation of LMP, the depot\u2019s business rules recognized  revenue on parts and material on the Black Hawk when they were turned  into the supply system during the disassembly process and replacement  parts were requisitioned and received\u2014usually within the first 90 days.  Under LMP, revenue for parts and material is not recognized until parts  and material are brought to the assembly area for installation on the  aircraft. Final assembly of the aircraft occurs about 266 days after  acceptance of the orders. As a result, at least in part due to the change in  revenue recognition rules under LMP, at the end of fiscal year 2011,  Corpus Christi documentation showed that it carried over into the next  fiscal year $425 million associated with these orders\u201493 percent of the  order amounts. A photo of a Black Hawk helicopter is shown in figure 7.", "Because of the size of the carryover at the end of fiscal year 2011, the  Army recognized that it needed to improve its management of carryover,  and in April 2012, the Army formed a working group. The working group  identified, among other things, that it was the Army Industrial Operations  activities\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they have the necessary resources  for performing the work. The working group identified the following six  elements that the Industrial Operations activities should review when  receiving orders for work to be performed:", "Skilled labor. Are there adequate labor hours available with the  required skills to execute the work?", "Parts. Is there sufficient stock on hand or in the supply pipeline to  complete the program schedule on time?", "Tools and equipment. Are all required special tools, fixtures, jigs, and  stands on hand or being acquired?", "Process. Is there approved technical data, including a defined scope  of work, documented processes, and internal process capacity,  available to complete the work?", "Requirements. Is there an understanding of the total Army  requirements as well as the required depot production for the  workload after considering back orders, average monthly demand,  potential surge requirements, and alternate source of repair?", "Funding. Is there available funding and rate of required funding to  support production?", "Further, the working group determined that if the Industrial Operations  activities determine that they do not have the capability to perform any of  the six elements, the activities should be required to send orders to their  management for review and approval. Also, for any areas for which  resources are not available, the activities should be required to develop a  plan on how they will resolve the issue, such as obtaining parts that are  not in the supply system.", "To convey the working group\u2019s results, the Army plans to issue two policy  memos during fiscal year 2013. According to Army officials and  documentation we reviewed, one policy memo will address (1) the  LCMCs\u2019 and activities\u2019 responsibilities for acceptance of orders and  performing the work (regardless of the appropriation funding the orders)  and (2) the six elements discussed above. The second policy memo will  address orders funded with procurement appropriations. According to  Army officials, this second policy memo will discuss various aspects of  procurement-funded orders, including different types of work such as pilot  programs, prototypes, fabrication, and data requirements. According to  the Army, this action should result in a better alignment of the work to the  customer delivery schedule and prevent the acceptance of workloads that  are not executable in a specific fiscal year. We agree that these actions  are needed for orders placed with Industrial Operations. If properly  implemented, the Army\u2019s actions should help address our concerns that  (1) the scope of work was not well defined and (2) parts were not  available to perform the work. However, the Army has not issued the  planned policy memos. The memos should contain specific timetables for  implementing their planned actions and establish procedures to include  steps to be followed by Industrial Operations in evaluating orders  received from customers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The work that Army Industrial Operations performs supports combat  readiness by restoring equipment to a level of combat capability  commensurate with a unit\u2019s future mission. Reliable budgeted information  on Industrial Operations, including carryover information, is essential for  Congress and DOD to perform their oversight responsibilities, including  reviewing and making well-informed decisions on Industrial Operations  budgets. The Army reported in its budgets to Congress that Industrial  Operations\u2019 adjusted carryover was under the allowable amount at the  end of fiscal years 2011 and 2012. However, budget estimates for  carryover were consistently less than the actual amounts each year from  fiscal years 2006 through 2012 primarily because of Industrial Operations  underestimating new orders from customers, particularly procurement- funded orders. Budget estimates could be improved by addressing the  major factors that caused variations between budgeted and actual  amounts, including improved communication between customers and  Industrial Operations. The Army recognized that it needed to improve the  budgeting and management of carryover and formed a working group in  April 2012.

We  analyzed carryover beginning with fiscal year 2006 because the Army\u2019s  fiscal year 2006 budget reported a consolidation of the Army Working  Capital Fund\u2019s depot maintenance and ordnance activity groups into  Industrial Operations, making a comparison to prior fiscal years difficult.  We met with responsible officials from Army headquarters and Army  Materiel Command (AMC) to obtain their views on the causes for  variances between actual carryover and the allowable amount. Further,  we identified and analyzed any adjustments made by the Army that  increased the allowable carryover amounts or reduced the amount of  carryover. We reviewed the Department of Defense\u2019s guidance for  exceptions to the carryover policy and discussed any exceptions with  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (OUSD) (Comptroller) and Army  headquarters officials to obtain explanations for the exceptions.", "To determine whether, and to what extent, Army Industrial Operations\u2019  budget information on carryover from fiscal years 2006 through 2012  approximated actual information, and if not, whether the Army took  actions to align the two, we obtained and analyzed Industrial Operations  reports that contained information on budgeted and reported actual new  orders, revenue, and actual carryover data for fiscal years 2006 through  2012. We also analyzed the new order data by the appropriations  financing the orders to determine whether there were variances by  appropriations for budgeted and reported actual new order amounts for  the 7-year period. We met with responsible officials from Army  headquarters and AMC to obtain their views on causes for variances  between budgeted and reported actual new order, revenue, and carryover  amounts.

We also performed walk-throughs of  the Army\u2019s Anniston, Corpus Christi, Letterkenny, and Red River depots\u2019  operations to observe the work being performed by the depots and  discussed with officials causes for workload carrying over from one fiscal  year to the next. Further, to corroborate the information provided by  Industrial Operations officials, we selected eight weapon system  workloads with high dollar amounts of fiscal year 2011 carryover from four  Army depots. The carryover associated with these workloads represented  about 35 percent of Industrial Operations\u2019 total carryover at the end of  fiscal year 2011 and was one of the top five workloads with carryover at  each depot. We followed up on the status of carryover on these eight  workloads at the end of fiscal year 2012. We obtained and analyzed  orders and amendments associated with these workloads and discussed  the information in these documents with the depots to determine the  causes for the carryover. We discussed the carryover information on  these workloads with officials in the program management offices at the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology) to determine their roles and responsibilities in providing  orders to the depots and their impact on carryover. We also discussed  and obtained documentation on the actions the Army is taking to better  manage and reduce carryover.", "We obtained the financial and logistical data in this report from official  budget documents and the Army\u2019s logistical system. To assess the  reliability of the data, we (1) reviewed and analyzed the factors used in  calculating carryover for the completeness of the elements included in the  calculation, (2) interviewed Army officials knowledgeable about the  carryover data, (3) reviewed GAO reports on depot maintenance  activities, and (4) reviewed customer orders submitted to Industrial  Operations to determine whether they were adequately supported by  documentation. In reviewing these orders, we obtained the status of the  carryover at the end of the fiscal year. We also reviewed the  Commander\u2019s Critical Item Reports for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 that  provide information on inventory items (spare parts) needed by the  depots.
