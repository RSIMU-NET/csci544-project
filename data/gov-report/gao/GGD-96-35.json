Although the report that follows offers suggestions from a certain viewpoint, it does not resolve this question: Should new HRM approaches that are based largely on private sector experience and that, thus far, have been applied to a relatively limited extent in the public sector now be adapted to the federal civil service? The answer may hinge on the similarities and differences between private sector and public sector realities and, ultimately, on what sort of civil service will best serve the American people. This is a policy judgment that rightfully belongs to Congress.", "As Congress deliberates these policy issues, there are some key concepts that it may find useful to keep in mind. If Congress wishes to change the civil service system, it will need to articulate the principles and goals that form the basis for the changes. It will need to set measurable expectations by which to evaluate agencies\u2019 adherence to these systemwide principles and goals.

The necessity to improve performance in the face of steady or declining resources has led some organizations, both here and in other countries, to make radical changes in the way they manage people.", "These organizations have begun changing both their traditional organizational structures and the approaches they have taken to managing their employees. In place of centralized, hierarchical, rule-based systems, they are creating decentralized, flatter, more flexible arrangements. And in place of highly detailed rules to manage their employees, they are relying increasingly on a well-defined mission, a clearly articulated vision, and a coherent organizational culture to form the foundation for the key business systems and processes they use to ensure the successful outcome of their operations. Recognizing that people are central to any organization\u2019s success, these organizations give their managers greater prerogatives to manage and their employees greater opportunities to participate in the decisions that affect them and their work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background: Learning From Others\u2019 Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Senator William V.

To respond to this request, on April 12 and 13, 1995, we convened a 2-day symposium of 32 leaders from public and private sector organizations who discussed their approaches toward managing people\u2014the principles they employ, the changes they have made, and the lessons they have learned. Our focus on \u201cmanaging people\u201d rather than on \u201cpersonnel administration\u201d allowed for discussion of broader and more innovative management approaches and for accommodating ideas from such fields as organization theory, public administration, quality improvement, budgeting, and information resource management.", "Twelve of the symposium participants were presenters and 20 were panelists.

The report includes our analysis of some of the implications of these principles for civil service reform, but we express no opinions or recommendations. Rather, our goal in reporting on the symposium was to reflect as accurately as possible the common threads that constituted the participants\u2019 lessons learned and to point out some of the implications should Congress consider applying these lessons to the civil service. The participants themselves were not asked to reach consensus or even to comment on every issue. Nor did they, as a group, offer recommendations for civil service reform. Many of them emphasized that management approaches that prove effective in some organizations may not work in others.", "We gave the symposium participants an opportunity to comment on the contents of this report and incorporated their views."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eight Principles for Managing People", "paragraphs": ["According to many of the symposium participants, the demand for faster, cheaper, and better service delivery has led their organizations to develop new and more flexible ways of managing people. On the basis of the symposium proceedings, GAO discerned eight interrelated principles common to these organizations: 1. Value people as assets rather than as costs. Recognize that people are crucial to organizational success. Establish a clear organizational mission and treat employees as partners in accomplishing that mission. Invest in them. Encourage them to contribute ideas and allow them to make decisions. Expect them to support the organization\u2019s mission and vision, and reward them for doing so. Treat them with respect and fairness. Even when downsizing is necessary, emphasize fairness and help prepare them for a \u201csoft landing.\u201d 2. Emphasize mission, vision, and organizational culture.  Articulate a clear organizational mission to which employees can contribute and a vision to which they can aspire. Build a strong organizational culture calling for high standards of performance and personal behavior. Use mission, vision, and culture as the underpinnings for rational business systems and processes that ensure the successful outcome of operations. 3. Hold managers responsible for achieving results instead of imposing rigid, process-oriented rules and standards. Give managers the authority to manage their people flexibly and innovatively so they can focus on achieving results rather than doing things \u201cby the book.\u201d Hold them accountable for outcomes and for furthering the mission and vision of the organization rather than for adhering to a set of minutely defined procedures. 4. Choose an organizational structure appropriate to the organization rather than trying to make \u201cone size fit all.\u201d  Design the organization so that its structure supports its mission and takes into account its present and future needs. Use different organizational models as appropriate. The current trend is toward flat, flexible, team-oriented organizational structures, but no single design works best for all organizations. 5. Instead of isolating the \u201cpersonnel function\u201d organizationally, integrate HRM into the mission of the organization. Tie the organization\u2019s HRM functions into its mission, vision, and culture. Make HRM functions an integral part of the organization\u2019s business activities by decentralizing and deregulating them. 6. Treat continuous learning as an investment in success rather than as a cost to be minimized. Invest in training and professional development to meet changing customer needs, keep skills up to date, and develop new personal and organizational competencies. 7. Pursue an integrated rather than an ad hoc approach to information management.  Develop the integrated information management systems that will ensure individual and unit accountability, open channels for continuous improvement, and encourage and reward accurate measurements of progress, performance, and customer satisfaction. 8. Provide sustained leadership that recognizes change as a permanent condition, not a one-time event. In a continuously changing environment, effective organizations adapt continuously, not crisis-by-crisis. Invest the time and resources necessary to accommodate constant change. Obtain the commitment of everyone involved. Communicate a coherent set of principles to guide the organization over time. \u201cFirst, we identified the human resource management issues that were of major concern, and then pulled them together into an integrated framework that needed to be addressed.\u201d", "It follows, then, that the eight principles emerging from the symposium are overlapping and interdependent and should be read as a coherent, overall approach to managing people in high-performance organizations. Some symposium presenters noted, for example, that valuing people is a central tenet of their organizations\u2019 mission and vision statements. Representatives of Xerox, Herman Miller, Federal Express, and AT&T said that while managers in each of these organizations are expected to manage for results, \u201cresults\u201d involves more than the \u201cbottom line\u201d; their managers are rewarded no less for how well they support their companies\u2019 values than for how well they help them make money. Some participants noted that in their organizations, performance management, career development programs, and pay and promotions standards are all tied to organizational mission, vision, and culture. In short, these organizations treat effective HRM and effective business practices as inseparable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Eight Principles\u2019 Implications for the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["Many of the ideas raised at the symposium are potentially relevant to transforming the civil service. Indeed, some of the principles emerging at the symposium are already being applied within specific agencies or programs. The participants pointed out, however, that some attitudinal or structural barriers exist within the federal government that could prevent these principles from being more widely accepted. Assuming these barriers were overcome, many of the principles could be put into practice without changing any laws. Other principles, if Congress chose to apply them, would require a further decentralization of the civil service system and could require some specific legislative changes, primarily to Title 5, United States Code (U.S.C.), which governs the civil service system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Similar Thinking Is Already Showing Up in the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["\u201cMany of the things we\u2019re doing now are right in line with the private sector. But federal agencies are such large and complex organizations that, in the course of day-to-day operations, we can lose sight of the fact that we are doing a lot of things right.\u201d", "Several participants noted that the goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) are consistent with the kind of thinking that emerged at the symposium, particularly as those goals relate to the importance of clarifying agency missions, focusing on results, and aligning systems to meet performance goals. For example, GPRA requires all federal agencies, by the end of fiscal year 1997, to develop 5-year strategic plans that include their missions and goals, as well as their strategies for achieving those goals through specific activities and management of people, information, and other resources. GPRA also calls for annual performance plans and reports that include attention to human resource needs and utilization.", "In addition, the administration\u2019s National Performance Review (NPR) has identified a number of federal HRM problems and offered 14 recommendations for change, many of them in keeping with the ideas brought forward at the symposium. Frank Thompson, executive director of the National Commission on the State and Local Public Service, said, \u201cA lot of the kinds of reviews that we\u2019ve been talking about here [at the symposium] have already been done, and there\u2019s a lot of consensus already out there that has been translated into specific legislative proposals.\u201d", "In recent years, a number of federal agencies have made substantive quality improvement efforts, some of which have won the Presidential Quality Award (the federal sector equivalent of the Malcolm Baldrige Award for private sector excellence). Other agencies are trying new HRM approaches while serving as NPR reinvention labs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers Exist to Putting Some of These Principles Into Practice", "paragraphs": ["Some symposium participants agreed that in the federal government, a number of barriers do exist to the sort of thinking embodied in the eight principles for managing people. Some of these barriers arise out of long-standing attitudes about the limitations that have been placed on agency officials\u2019 HRM prerogatives or about the basic ways in which people ought to be managed. Other barriers, they said, arise out of the difficulty federal agencies commonly experience in arriving at a consensus on their missions or in sustaining the committed, long-term leadership needed to accomplish them.", "One attitudinal barrier, according to some participants, stems from agency officials\u2019 belief in their own powerlessness\u2014from a sense, as Marilyn Hay, director of labor relations at the Treasury Board of Canada, portrayed it, that they are at the mercy of those who created or oversee the system and cannot hope to change it. The agencies themselves can be the source of this belief. Former U.S. Forest Service chief Dale Robertson cited a pilot study that found 70 percent of the performance barriers that workers identified involved agency policies and practices. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t Congress,\u201d Robertson said the report concluded. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t OPM. It wasn\u2019t anybody else but us at the Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service.\u201d \u201c it takes us, on average, 70 days to fill a job vacancy, and that the process involves 94 separate steps. Through reengineering, we\u2019re taking that down to 15 days, and we\u2019re doing so by cutting out all kinds of things including ones we were never required to do in the first place.\u201d \u201cWe were brought up short repeatedly when our teams started talking about the constraints they were facing\u2014the things they assumed OPM would never let us do. And the OPM people said, \u2018That is not a requirement of OPM. You do not have to continue doing that\u2019.\u201d \u201cthe assumptions on which all of our systems were built: that managers need to be controlled, that none of them have any judgment, that managers and employees alike will cheat the system if you let them. The traditional attitude is that the organization could be run a lot better if you could do it without any people at all. So very naturally, what grew up were a lot of rules to constrain and control people, and what we\u2019re trying to do now is free them up, turn that around.\u201d", "Although several of the participants pointed out that successful organizations define their missions clearly and coherently, participants also noted that the task of doing so is a different one for federal agencies than for private companies. Companies define their own lines of business, adjusting as appropriate for the sake of efficiency and profitability; set their own goals in such areas as quality, service delivery, and profit; and are accountable to shareholders. Federal agencies, on the other hand, are shaped by a more political environment in which missions, measures of success, and layers of accountability are frequently ambiguous. Reaching political consensus on agency goals or on the means of achieving them is often difficult and may include rationales that would not be followed in the business world. As Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, the goal of achieving efficiency in federal agencies may be \u201can insufficiently broad concept\u201d when so many other factors come into play. \u201cOne of the common themes we have heard at this symposium is that organizations that have undergone change successfully have done so under sustained, committed, visionary leadership. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t get that from political appointees, but their half life is relatively short. In the Australian experience, and in Canada\u2019s as well, one of the marked differences has been that career civil servants can rise to levels as high as those of policymakers. They can deal effectively and over sustained periods with issues that aren\u2019t necessarily policy issues, but service delivery issues. Here in the United States, the political appointees have to handle both.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some of the Eight Principles Could Be Applied Without Changing Current Law", "paragraphs": ["Several participants said that many of the eight principles and related ideas and practices discussed at the symposium could be implemented in the federal civil service, and that this could be done without changing current law.", "Our analysis suggests this is largely true. For example, current law does not prohibit agencies from creating mission or vision statements, from developing strategic planning and performance measurement processes, or from aligning most human resource activities with their organizational missions and core values. Agencies are not prohibited from setting up performance management systems that assess and reward employee performance in light of organizational goals and values. Agency managers are free to make continuous learning a guiding principle, and they have a variety of formal and informal actions at their disposal to establish trust, respect, and fairness in the workplace. \u201cNinety percent of what private firms are doing could be done in the federal government today\u2014and be done within existing laws and regulations. The only problem is it\u2019s tougher\u2014it\u2019s a bureaucratic battle. It takes persistence. You have to do it in the face of a lot of interference and a lot of second-guessing.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Further Implementing the Eight Principles Would Require Further Decentralizing the Civil Service System", "paragraphs": ["One of the eight principles for managing people that emerged from the symposium was that eliminating the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach is a key to creating structures and practices best suited to specific organizations and their missions. Within the context of civil service reform, this would require further decentralizing a system in which the \u201csingle employer\u201d model now holds true for slightly more than half of the government\u2019s employees. The rationales behind the single employer model are threefold: achieving pay equity across the government, reducing competition among agencies for employees, and gaining efficiency and savings through economies of scale. But some symposium participants considered this approach a barrier to the creation of high-performance organizations for three reasons: it puts constraints on innovation and flexibility; it transfers the real responsibility for managing people from agency managers to agency personnel staff and OPM; and it ignores the differences among federal agencies in their missions, cultures, sizes, and other characteristics. \u201cBasically, the principles and values were that we should have an apolitical public service, that we should continue to have merit-based staffing, that we should maintain high standards of honesty and integrity among public servants, that there should be a very strong focus on efficiency and results, and that  should continue to be accountable to the government of the day while it maintains the capacity to provide it with high quality advice.\u201d", "If Congress should decide to comprehensively decentralize the civil service, it could do so by revising Title 5 to articulate guiding values and principles but omit detailed rules of implementation. Each agency might then be allowed to determine how best to implement the guiding values and principles while doing so in the context of its own mission and circumstances. The variety of HRM approaches that might then emerge across government could be reviewed periodically by the various agencies\u2019 congressional oversight committees, by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, and/or by the central personnel entities. Several symposium participants made the point that this approach would be in keeping with the intent of GPRA\u2014that in consultation with Congress, each agency could determine the best means of linking its HRM practices to its performance and results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Applicability Issue", "paragraphs": ["In considering the various HRM approaches raised at the symposium and elsewhere, Congress will be dealing with complex policy issues that are fundamental to the current civil service system. One of the core issues is whether the government wants to view its employees in the same manner as private sector organizations do theirs. Should the government, for example, move away from the concept of guaranteed job security? It is clear that in addressing issues such as these, Congress would need to consider the principles distilled from the symposium within the overall context of a basic, unified policy vision, rather than on an ad hoc basis. It is equally clear that any fundamental reversal of traditional concepts would inevitably require political and value judgments from Congress.", "These judgments will require consideration of the fundamental differences that exist between private and public sector entities\u2014differences that go beyond the simple question of whether one or the other does or does not operate for profit. There is, for example, a basic difference in roles, the government taking on duties (such as defense) that are prescribed by the Constitution, and taking actions in the public interest that the private sector is neither empowered nor equipped to take (such as securities regulation, environmental protection, and food and drug safety assurance).", "There are differences in the nature of accountability as well: private sector firms are disciplined by the marketplace and must meet the fundamental test of financial viability. Government, on the other hand, must meet social, political, or even moral expectations that may or may not coincide with economic efficiencies. Further, a company can choose the business it wishes to pursue and then answer to its stockholders for the choices made, but government is accountable to varied constituencies and often must retain programs because they have strong support from one interest or another.", "In addition, those who run private sector organizations often can deliberate in private and reach decisions quickly. Government decisionmakers operate in a fishbowl, often with legal requirements for open deliberations and public involvement that make the decisionmaking process lengthy and inevitably subject to compromise. The decisionmakers themselves\u2014within or across branches of government\u2014are often numerous and at odds with one another. And because the leadership of executive agencies changes frequently, succession planning of the sort frequently found in the private sector is rare in government.", "From our many years of work on civil service and management issues, we have identified certain key criteria that would be useful in helping Congress consider its policy judgments within a basic, unified vision, rather than on an ad hoc basis. For example, a proper balance must be struck between flexibility\u2014both at the agency and individual levels\u2014and accountability for actions and outcomes. An integrated approach is necessary, including systemwide principles and goals and measurable expectations by which to evaluate agency and individual adherence to these principles and goals. Rational, mission-based systems and processes must be included to help people work effectively, and information systems must be put in place to give managers the information necessary to track progress and make informed decisions. Effective leadership within the agencies and continuing oversight from Congress will be needed to help determine if new approaches to managing the federal workforce are, in fact, improvements over the old. \u201cCivil service reform is not an end in itself. It\u2019s the means to an end. Eventually, you\u2019re going to need to say, \u2018Here are the characteristics that a high-performing organization, public or private, needs to embody if it is to accomplish the mission that has been set out for it. And here\u2019s the kind of civil service that contributes to that model. As the organizations represented here have done, you\u2019re going to need to look 10 or 15 years downstream, and then begin to sketch out a framework that will work best in the federal workplace today and in the years to come\u2019.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transforming the Civil Service Will Be a Major Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Making and maintaining the necessary workforce investments will pose a considerable challenge to civil service reformers, particularly in a period of fiscal constraint and government downsizing.

Our patents had run out and competition was fierce. In 1982, David Kearns, who had just become chairman, was giving a speech in a tent outside our Webster manufacturing facility in Rochester, New York. Next to the tent they\u2019d lined up 54 trailer trucks full of defective equipment that had been returned by Xerox customers. Mr. Kearns was trying to get the message across about quality. People kept looking at the trucks and mulling this over. Finally, one of the people from the manufacturing line\u2014a fellow named Frank Enos\u2014 said, \u2018Sorry, Mr. Chairman, but why didn\u2019t you ask us about all this? We knew we were making faulty equipment, but you guys were in such a rush to bring in a buck, you sent it out anyway. If you had only asked us, we would have told you\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe chairman, to his credit, called Frank Enos back the next day.

We were now responsible for all things related to the staff, including recruitment and selection, systems of pay and remuneration, and hiring and firing people.\u201d \u201cThere were worries at the start that this would lead to some sort of blow-out of basic salaries, as the independent agencies somehow competed against each other and revved up the price they would be willing to pay for people\u2019s labor. But it hasn\u2019t worked that way, and I think that\u2019s partly because, although the centralized control has been removed, we chief executives still have strong incentives to make sure we control our budgets. We actually now tend to work in a more cooperative way with other government departments than we might have done in the past. I think it has created far better incentives for good management and organization. Almost universally, I think, people would say it\u2019s been a success.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 4: Choose an Organizational Structure Appropriate to the Organization, Rather Than Trying to Make \u201cOne Size Fit All\u201d", "paragraphs": ["Several presenters explained that their organizations have designed new structures to fit their particular missions and circumstances. Some of the reasons, they said, for moving to more flexible and adaptive organizational structures have been to (1) reduce the time it takes to get a product or service to the customer; (2) respond more quickly to changes in the environment, including new technology; (3) cut costs; (4) improve communication and information flow; and (5) make better use of employees\u2019 skills, ideas, and creativity. \u201cOur department used to be structured along the same specialized lines as traditional personnel offices, with branches of recruitment, placement, employee relations, training, and so forth, with branch chiefs and technicians and secretaries assigned to those branches. That system served us well enough, but over the years we found we had to make it more flexible. So we took out a level of supervision\u2014the branch chief level\u2014and we collapsed the organization into two self-directed work teams. The professional teams are fully cross-trained in all human resource functions and offer one-stop shopping to a set of customers. All the work comes into one place, the team members decide how it will get done, and the team manages its resources to see the job through.\u201d \u201cWe had 18 people in our office when we started this transformation 10 years ago, and now we do just as much work\u2014probably a lot more work and more effectively\u2014with 9 people. We attribute that to the reengineering of work, the elimination of the mid-manager level of supervision, and the reduction of hand-offs from one branch to another. We\u2019ve eliminated the overhead costs associated with the extra layer of supervision and shortened cycle time by eliminating hand-offs.\u201d \u201cElsewhere in the city government, we have gone more and more to self-directed work teams, organizing work around the customer and omitting layers of supervision. We have about 200 employees now in various teams. We came up with a pay philosophy that was adopted by our city council, which provides for an array of awards and incentives that pay high performers above market. For people in self-directed teams, we have a model for pay based on results, demonstrated skills, what the group accomplishes collectively, customer satisfaction ratings, and budget performance.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 5: Instead of Isolating the \u201cPersonnel Function\u201d Organizationally, Integrate HRM Into the Mission of the Organization", "paragraphs": ["Where this principle has been implemented, HRM practices are aligned with organizational goals and objectives and are designed to reinforce organizational culture and enhance change efforts. In some cases, to achieve this integration of people management with business goals, new roles and responsibilities have been established for human resource professionals and line managers alike. Some presenters portrayed the new role of human resource professionals in their organizations as more consultative and collaborative than in the past. Among the companies represented at the symposium, vice presidents for human resources have become part of the senior management teams, ensuring that \u201cpeople management\u201d is linked to corporate goals and objectives. \u201cIn 1991, facing adverse economic conditions, IBM looked to Human Resources to help reduce costs. At first, cutting costs was seen primarily as a head-count equation. However, we soon realized that what we really needed was to deliver satisfactory services to the company at a fair price, so that human resources would not be seen as a burden on the cost of doing business. To do this, we needed to develop a new model for delivering human resources services.\u201d \u201cThis new model, WorkForce Solutions (WFS), was created in May 1992. WFS developed a marketplace perspective, establishing a customer-driven focus in which services are based on business needs and performance is measured by customer satisfaction. It uses technology and work process reengineering to deliver quality services at low prices. We organized ourselves around processes, not functions, and have developed customer-oriented services. Technology-enabled service centers provide technology interface, human resource expert systems, case management, work flow management, and customer satisfaction assessment. Employees and managers have access to human resource information through an on-line voice-response system and smart computers.\u201d \u201cInitially, 450 Human Resources staff remained in the line organizations to serve in a strategic \u2018advise and counsel\u2019 capacity. The remaining 1,700 Human Resources staff members were transferred into WFS.\u201d \u201cThis has not been an easy journey so far. WFS is now down to about 900 people. But all along, reducing the size of the staff was something that had to be done. The system now in operation efficiently serves a customer base of over 700,000 IBM employees, dependents, and retirees (down less than 10 percent from 1992 levels). Despite the fact that more than 28,000 calls are received each month, the average caller waits less than 30 seconds for service. Customer satisfaction is currently at over 89 percent.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 6: Treat Continuous Learning as an Investment in Success Rather Than as a Cost to Be Minimized", "paragraphs": ["The participants gave several reasons why their organizations invest in continuous learning for employees, among them: (1) developing the new skills needed for managing change; (2) developing the skills and modes of behavior needed in flatter, more participatory, customer-focused, results-oriented work environments; (3) maintaining marketable skills; and (4) teaching new skills to employees who are likely to leave due to downsizing, as well as to those who remain. \u201cWhen it comes to employee development, I think that many businesses have traditionally trained their people to be fairly passive. There is a learned response at work here: Employees believe that if they simply work hard, the system will take care of them. Someone will tap you on the shoulder, tell you what skills you need to develop, and promote you to the next level. I think we need to encourage people to play a far more active role in their own professional development.\u201d \u201cAt GM Powertrain, the system encourages people to take greater responsibility for their own learning. It\u2019s a system that was intentionally organized into components, so that employees could opt for whatever components made sense for them. The model is built around a feedback system that puts the employee at the center of the process. The employees determine their sources of feedback and are given a number of support mechanisms through which they can gather that information and do something with it. The employees themselves drive the process in terms of timing and need.\u201d \u201cEmployees are given a whole day for self-assessment, with the idea of tooling them up to represent themselves, instead of having the organization make assumptions about them regarding their needs for growth and development. Again, employees drive the process, because they know their values, their interests, their skills, and what turns them on at work.\u201d \u201cThe aim is to put people into jobs that are aligned with what they love to do. This, too, is a different model from that of traditional systems. Traditional systems conjure up a ledger in our minds of what we do well and what we don\u2019t do well, then put all the development efforts into what we don\u2019t do well. The return on investment is very small.\u201d \u201cThis new system, on the other hand, is based on what you do well, how we can take better advantage of that, and how we can give you more of that in your working life so you will love what you\u2019re doing and also be more productive. Clearly, there\u2019s a different set of assumptions being applied here than in traditional models.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 7: Pursue an Integrated Rather Than an Ad Hoc Approach to Information Management", "paragraphs": ["Several participants emphasized how crucial measurement is to results-oriented organizations. More things must be measured, they said, than the \u201cbottom line.\u201d They said results-oriented organizations must also track performance against mission-related goals in such areas as product quality, service delivery, and customer satisfaction. \u201cIf you remember two things from what I say, it will probably be technology and measurement. We have a strategy. We have a mission. But what keeps us focused and working on those issues of importance to us? Our corporate goals and our measurement thereof.\u201d \u201cIn 1988, our corporate goals came out, consisting of only three numbers. On the people side, we had our leadership average\u2014a measure of how well our employees say the management of Federal Express was providing leadership for the organization. There was one number. Then we had our service quality index\u2014a measure of the ten things our customers thought were most important. That was another number. And finally, there was our profit number, based on global pre-tax income. What was really exciting was the news that we had to reach our corporate goals for all three of these numbers, or there would not be a cent of incentive compensation for anyone in the company.\u201d \u201cOne strength of our information management system is that, with the exception of the leadership average\u2014which is an annual measure\u2014you can track these corporate goals in real time. You can measure your service at Federal Express on a daily basis. You can measure it companywide or you can measure it at any location in the company. You can measure how your profits are doing, you can track profit and loss, you can track against the budget. And you can tie all this to every management level in the company, to every employee. Our management-by-objective system aligns us with these goals, and it\u2019s tied as well to the incentive compensation system for our managers.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principle 8: Provide Sustained Leadership That Recognizes Change as a Permanent Condition, Not a One-Time Event", "paragraphs": ["One recurrent theme at the symposium was that change appears to be a permanent condition, and the successful organizations will be the ones that deal with it best. Some participants said that in a continuously changing environment, organizations must strike a balance between adhering to their visions and remaining flexible enough to adapt to new and demanding conditions. Two qualities were mentioned most often as crucial for organizations hoping to deal successfully with change: sustained, committed leadership and a long-term, strategic approach. \u201cListening at this symposium to these discussions about congressional and agency issues, I can assure you that we have had similar debates in Canada. Just as you have been, we are looking at how to become more effective and more efficient. And we, too, have a complex government agenda. We don\u2019t have any clear bottom lines by which to measure our success. We lack a political focus on public service renewal. We have a crisis orientation\u2014a lot of it driven by the media. We have this great sense of urgency, but we also have no money. We hear a lot of rhetoric about devolution, delegation, empowerment, and innovation, but we haven\u2019t removed the structural or systemic barriers to these things. And we have a high level of risk aversion.\u201d \u201cNot long ago, the directors of personnel in Canada\u2014as a community\u2014finally decided that somebody had to lead, that it wasn\u2019t good enough just to wait around for permission to act. Since we believed fundamentally in those core statements about people being essential to success, and that we simply have to pay greater attention to the business of managing them, we decided that we would have to be the ones to move the agenda forward as best we could. This was an interesting thing for us to try, because if ever there was a powerless group in the Canadian Government, it was the directors of personnel.\u201d \u201cFrom our perspective, we see the issue of people management as twofold. It\u2019s a matter of the interactive leadership issues\u2014the human dynamic, if you will\u2014and the structural, systemic issues\u2014how the business is done. Both ends have to be driven by core values and principles, with a focus on mission achievement\u2014mission being the business of a given department or agency. That mission has to be achieved affordably, and in a way that is resilient in the face of change.\u201d \u201cYou have to invest if you want to respond in new ways to change. It doesn\u2019t happen by accident, it doesn\u2019t happen on somebody else\u2019s agenda, and it doesn\u2019t happen for nothing. That means spending training dollars, supporting champions, getting barriers out of the way, and driving coherently toward a resilient organization that copes with change as a permanent reality. It\u2019s unreasonable, of course, to think that it\u2019s going to happen overnight. You\u2019re in for the long haul, and you need boundless patience and persistence.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Presenters and Panelists of the GAO Symposium on the Workforce of the Future", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Presenters", "paragraphs": ["Roger Blakeley, Chief Executive Department of Internal Affairs Government of New Zealand William F.
