However, these initiatives have had limited success. In 2008, OPM proposed a regulation requiring the use of an alternate federal employee identifier but withdrew it in 2010 because no such identifier was available. OMB required agencies to develop SSN reduction plans and requires annual reporting on agency SSN reduction efforts. SSA developed an online clearinghouse of best practices for reducing SSN use; however, it is no longer available online. Based on responses to GAO's questionnaire, the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act use SSNs for various purposes (see figure).", "All 24 CFO Act agencies developed SSN reduction plans and reported taking actions to curtail the use and display of SSNs. For example, the Department of Defense replaced SSNs, which previously appeared on its identification cards, with new identification numbers. Nevertheless, the agencies cited impediments to further reductions, including (1) statutes and regulations mandating SSN collection, (2) use of SSNs in necessary interactions with other federal entities, and (3) technological constraints of agency systems and processes.", "Further, poor planning by agencies and ineffective monitoring by OMB have also limited efforts to reduce SSN use. Lacking direction from OMB, many agencies' SSN reduction plans did not include key elements, such as time frames and performance indicators, calling into question their utility. In addition, OMB has not required agencies to maintain up-to-date inventories of their SSN holdings or provided criteria for determining \u201cunnecessary use and display,\u201d limiting agencies' ability to gauge progress. OMB also has not ensured that agencies update their progress in annual reports or established performance metrics to monitor agency efforts.

However, the Medicare  Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 subsequently required  CMS to remove SSNs from all Medicare cards and distribute  replacement cards with a new Medicare beneficiary identifier by April  2019. CMS officials stated that the agency plans to begin removing  SSNs from Medicare cards and replacing them with the new identifier  starting in April 2018.", "In 2015, the Department of Education\u2019s Federal Student Aid office  changed login procedures for students, parents, and borrowers, by  introducing a federal student aid username and password to be used  in place of previous login procedures that relied on a personal  identification number associated with the user\u2019s name, SSN, and date  of birth. Education officials from the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer  reported that, since being introduced, the usernames and passwords  have been used over 300 million times to log in to office systems,  greatly reducing the exposure of SSNs and other PII.", "Removing SSNs from Printed Forms and Other Physical Displays  Even when SSNs continue to be used as identifiers within internal  information systems, the 24 CFO Act agencies reported taking steps to  mask, truncate, or block the display of these numbers on paper forms,  correspondence, and computer screens. For example:  In 2001, SSA removed the full SSN from the Social Security  statement and the Social Security cost-of-living-adjustment notice and  replaced it with a beneficiary notice code. These two documents  represented approximately one-third of all SSA notices sent each  year, with approximately 150 million Social Security statements and  approximately 58 million cost-of-living-adjustment notices going out  each year, according to SSA. However, SSA still displays SSNs on  much of its correspondence. According to the SSA Office of the  Inspector General, about 66 percent of the 352 million notices sent to  individuals in 2015 included the individuals\u2019 full SSNs. SSA officials  from the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Budget, Finance,  Quality, and Management stated that they had plans to further reduce  SSNs on notices and would implement them as resources permit.", "IRS (a component of the Department of the Treasury) implemented a  system to replace or mask the SSN displayed on many notices and  letters sent to taxpayers. IRS officials in the office of Privacy,  Governmental Liaison and Disclosure stated that, as of 2017, they  had been able to update many notices and letters to either display a  barcode, or mask the SSN by displaying only the last four digits of the  number. According to the officials, these updates affected 50 million  notices in fiscal year 2015 and 47 million in fiscal year 2016.", "In 2007, the VA Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy eliminated  the use of SSNs on prescription bottles and mailing labels. VHA  officials stated that VHA uses the truncated SSN on many of its forms,  printouts, and surgical materials. In addition, according to the officials,  VHA discontinued printing the full SSN on health records that are  disclosed through the Release of Information process and removed or  truncated the SSN from patient appointment reminders in 2013.", "Filtering E-mail to Prevent Unencrypted Transmittal of SSNs  Officials from two agencies reported taking additional steps to reduce the  potential for SSNs to be compromised by screening e-mail traffic for the  numbers and blocking the numbers\u2019 transmittal. Specifically, the Bureau  of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce implemented a  filter on its e-mail system to block both incoming and outgoing -emails  containing SSNs. In addition, the Department of Justice upgraded its data  loss prevention capabilities to automatically block e-mail traffic to  external, nongovernment users when an SSN is detected either in the  body of an e-mail or in an e-mail attachment.", "Reviewing Ongoing Collection, Use, and Display of SSNs  Officials from the 24 CFO Act agencies generally stated that they use  their already existing information security and privacy management  processes and procedures to review ongoing collection, use, and display  of SSNs and to ensure that SSNs are protected when stored in agency  information systems. Specifically, agencies typically reported using  existing processes for developing and approving privacy impact  assessments to determine whether new collection, use, or display of  SSNs is necessary to achieve an agency mission. For example, CMS,  IRS, Department of Transportation, USDA, and VA officials all stated that  they use the privacy impact assessment or privacy risk analysis process  to confirm that planned collections of SSNs are appropriate and  authorized and to assess plans to mitigate the risks of such uses when  they are unavoidable.", "Officials from two of the agencies also reported setting restrictions on  access to SSNs and limiting the ability of staff to download and store  personal information covered by the Privacy Act, including SSNs, and on  the transmission or electronic transfer of such data. For example, CMS  officials stated that departmental policy requires encryption of all sensitive  data, including SSNs, which are transmitted outside of the hhs.gov  domain. VA likewise requires that full SSNs not be transmitted or stored  in electronic form unless the data are encrypted. Departmental policy also  requires VA components to assign access to data containing SSNs based  on need-to-know and least-privilege principles and to use only VA- approved portable electronic storage media to maintain and access  records that contain SSNs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Cited Challenges in Further Reducing SSN Collection and Use", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the 24 agencies stated that SSNs cannot be completely  eliminated from federal IT systems and records. In some cases, no other  identifier offers the same degree of universal awareness or applicability.  For example, VHA officials stated that they need to collect SSNs from  patients when they receive treatment because health standards require  unique identifying information to be verbally provided by patients for  verification purposes. According to VHA officials from the Information  Access and Privacy Office, the SSN is one of the few unique identifiers  that a patient can be expected to have memorized. Thus, eliminating its  use is not feasible. SSA officials noted that the Social Security program,  as authorized by law, uses the SSN as its primary identifier, and, thus,  much of its use within that agency cannot be reduced.", "Even when reductions are possible, challenges in implementing them can  be significant. All of the agencies we reviewed reported experiencing  such challenges. Three key challenges were frequently cited: (1) statutes  and regulations that mandate the collection of SSNs, (2) requirements for  using SSNs in interactions with other federal and external entities, and (3)  technological impediments to implementing changes in agency systems  and processes. Of the 24 agencies we reviewed, 15 reported to us that  they had experienced challenges as a result of statutes and regulations,  16 as a result of required interactions with other Federal and external  entities, and 14 as a result of technological limitations, as follows:", "Statutes and regulations require collection and use of SSNs. In their  questionnaire responses and follow-up correspondence with us,  officials from 15 agencies who were involved in their agencies\u2019 SSN  reduction efforts noted that they are limited in their ability to reduce  the collection of SSNs because many laws authorize or require such  collection. Examples of such laws are listed in table 1, and the officials  cited other laws as well. These laws often explicitly require agencies  to use SSNs to identify individuals who are engaged in transactions  with the government or who are receiving benefits disbursed by  federal agencies. For example, Commerce officials said they are  required by the Debt Collection Act of 1996 to collect SSNs for all  financial transactions, such as permit applications. Similarly,  Department of the Interior officials stated that several statutes require  the collection of SSNs for employment, payroll, tax reporting, benefits,  and other processes, including the Immigration Reform and Control  Act of 1986, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, and others.", "Interactions with other federal and external entities require use of the  SSN. In order for federal agencies to exchange information about  individuals with other entities, both within and outside the federal  government, they must be able to cite a unique, common identifier to  ensure that they are matching their information to the correct records  in the other entities\u2019 systems. The SSN is typically the only identifier  that government agencies and external partners have in common that  they can use to match their records. USDA\u2019s National Finance Center,  for example, uses SSNs to identify employees in its payroll processing  systems, and, thus, agencies that use the National Finance Center  must include SSNs in their payroll records. Further, other agencies  rely on SSNs as unique identifiers when performing other common  cross-agency functions, such as processing payments to or from  external entities, conducting background investigations, and  determining whether an individual has benefit coverage through  another agency. For example, an official from the Department of  Education stated that the Federal Student Aid program is required to  use a loan applicant\u2019s SSN for several key verification functions  before being able to process the loan, including with SSA to confirm  that the SSN provided is legitimate and that the applicant has  registered for the draft; with IRS to ensure the applicant is in good tax  standing; with HHS to verify the applicant is not delinquent with child  support; and with the Department of Homeland Security to verify the  applicant is not on the terrorist watch-list.", "Technological hurdles can slow replacement of SSNs in information  systems. In their questionnaire responses and follow-up  correspondence with us, officials from 14 agencies who were involved  in their agency SSN reduction efforts cited the complexity of making  required technological changes to their information systems as a  challenge to reducing the use, collection and display of SSNs. For  example, VA officials noted that key software applications and  electronic health record formats used in their legacy information  systems were developed over 30 years ago and would require  extensive system changes and software updates because SSNs are  the only identifier used by those systems. Likewise, Department of  Treasury officials stated that a majority of their systems had  technological limitations that kept them from masking the display of  SSNs. According to these officials, they send out \u201chundreds\u201d of  standard notices to individuals but have been able to mask the SSN  on only 110 non-payment notices, four payment notices, and 24  automated collection system notices, due to technological limitations.  Likewise, although the IRS has been able to mask SSNs on notices  that contain barcodes, its current payment processing system is  unable to read such barcodes. As a result, the full SSN remains on  display on the majority of IRS payment processing notices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poor Planning and Ineffective Monitoring by OMB Have Also Limited the Extent of Agency Reduction Efforts", "paragraphs": ["SSN reduction efforts in the federal government have also been limited by  more readily addressable shortcomings. Lacking direction from OMB,  many agencies\u2019 reduction plans did not include key elements, such as  timeframes and performance indicators, calling into question the plans\u2019  utility. In addition, OMB has not required agencies to maintain up-to-date  inventories of SSN collections and has not established criteria for  determining when SSN use or display is \u201cunnecessary,\u201d leading to  inconsistent definitions across the agencies. Finally, OMB has not  ensured that agencies have all submitted up-to-date status reports and  has not established performance measures to monitor agency efforts.", "Agency SSN Reduction Plans Lacked Key Elements, Limiting Their  Usefulness  As previously mentioned, in May 2007, OMB issued a memorandum  requiring agencies to develop plans to eliminate the unnecessary  collection and use of SSNs, an objective that was to be accomplished  within 18 months. OMB did not set requirements for agencies on  creating effective plans to eliminate the unnecessary collection and use of  SSNs. However, other federal laws and guidance have established key  elements that performance plans generally should contain. For example,  GPRAMA established criteria for effective performance plans, including  specific measures to assess performance. Our prior work on developing  performance plans identifies additional elements of effective plans, as  does OMB\u2019s guidance on budget preparation. Several key elements of  an effective performance plan that were consistently referenced across  these sources include:", "Performance goals and indicators: Plans should include tangible and  measurable goals against which actual achievement can be  compared. Performance indicators should be defined to measure  outcomes achieved versus goals.", "Measurable activities: Plans should define discrete events, major  deliverables, or phases of work that are to be completed toward the  plan\u2019s goals.", "Timelines for completion: Plans should include a timeline for each  goal to be completed that can be used to gauge program  performance.", "Roles and responsibilities: Plans should include a description of the  roles and responsibilities of agency officials responsible for the  achievement of each performance goal.", "The majority of plans originally submitted to OMB by the 24 CFO Act  agencies lacked key elements of effective performance plans. For  example, only two agencies (the Departments of Commerce and  Education) developed a plan that addressed all four key elements. Three  agencies\u2019 plans did not fully address any of the key elements, nine plans  addressed between one and two of the elements, and the remaining 10  plans addressed three of the elements. Table 2 shows the key elements  addressed in each agency\u2019s plan.", "Across the 24 agencies, the most frequently met criterion was  establishing measurable SSN reduction activities and the least frequently  met was the development of overall performance goals. For example:", "Performance goals and indicators: Three agencies established  performance goals and indicators to measure progress in their SSN  reductions plan. For example, the Department of Education  established a goal of eliminating unnecessary SSN use by 5 percent  by the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.", "Measurable activities: Twenty agencies established specific  measurable activities in their SSN reduction plans. For example,  HHS\u2019s activities included categorizing SSN collections as mandatory  or discretionary, developing guidance for review of SSN use,  scheduling all 2009-2010 information collections for SSN review, and  reviewing expiring 2008 information collections for SSN use. Similarly,  the Department of Commerce\u2019s planned activities included eliminating  the use of SSNs within four economic surveys at the Census Bureau,  the EZ Tracker Training System, and in building access systems at  four major facilities.", "Timelines for completion: Sixteen agencies provided a timeline for  completion. For example, the Department of the Interior set  completion dates for its major SSN reduction activities, such as  establishing an information reduction team by October 12, 2007 and  obligating the team to complete all tasks, including updating system of  record notices, and enacting component reduction activities, by  December 31, 2007.", "Roles and responsibilities: Fourteen agencies identified roles and  responsibilities for reducing agency SSN collection, use, and display.  For example, USDA assigned responsibility for departmental  compliance with the requirements of OMB M-07-16 to its Chief  Information Officer. In addition, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development assigned responsibility for tracking progress of SSN  reduction activities to its Privacy Act Officer.", "Agency officials stated that because OMB did not set a specific  requirement that SSN reduction plans contain clearly defined  performance goals and indicators, measurable activities, timelines for  completion, or roles and responsibilities, they were not aware that they  should address these elements. Yet, without complete performance  plans, it is difficult to determine what overall progress agencies have  achieved in reducing the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs and the  concomitant risk of exposure to identity theft. Continued progress toward  reducing that risk is likely to remain difficult to measure until agencies  develop and implement effective plans.", "Not All Agencies Maintain an Up-to-Date Inventory of Their SSN  Collections  Developing a baseline inventory of systems that collect, use, and display  SSNs and ensuring that it is periodically updated can assist managers in  maintaining an awareness of the extent to which they collect and use  SSNs and their progress in eliminating unnecessary collection and use.  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that a baseline should be established to monitor progress towards an  objective. An accurate inventory provides a detailed description of an  agency\u2019s current state and helps to clarify what additional work remains to  be done to reach the agency\u2019s goal.", "Of the 24 CFO Act agencies, 22 reported having compiled an inventory of  systems and programs that collected SSNs at the time they developed  their original SSN reduction plans in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Of the  two agencies that reported not developing an initial inventory, one (U. S.  Agency for International Development) reported that it did not have a  comprehensive inventory of systems containing SSNs because it has no  visibility over unofficial programs and systems, especially those created  by overseas missions to address site-specific programmatic and  administrative requirements. The agency stated that it was undertaking  an effort to create such an inventory and that as part of that process it  intended to identify systems that collect and maintain SSNs. The agency  anticipated completing its inventory by the end of fiscal year 2017. The  other agency without an SSN inventory (Small Business Administration)  likewise stated that it was in the process of creating such an inventory,  but it did not provide details on when this effort began or when it was  expected to be completed.", "Of the 22 agencies that reported having developed an initial inventory, 18  stated that they had inventories that were up-to-date and complete.  However, the inventories of these agencies did not always identify which  systems contained SSNs. For example, DOD and SSA officials stated  that they maintain an inventory of systems containing PII but do not  always track which systems in the inventory contain SSNs.", "Beyond simply determining which systems contain SSNs, identifying the  approximate number of individual records containing SSNs would also be  a useful measure for agencies to understand the extent to which any  given system contains SSNs. However, agencies have not always  captured this information. Education officials, for example, noted that they  did not have figures for how many records within each of their student  loan systems contained SSNs. DOD, Interior, and State all have many  systems containing PII but no estimate of the number of records that  include SSNs within each of these systems.", "Of the 22 agencies that reported having developed an initial inventory, the  four remaining agencies stated that they did not have up-to-date  inventories of systems containing SSNs. Two of them (Energy and VA)  reported having efforts underway to correct or update their inventories.  Officials from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and  the National Science Foundation stated they faced technical difficulties  identifying systems, including contractor-operated systems that contain  SSNs.", "Part of the reason agencies do not have up-to-date inventories is that  OMB M-07-16 did not require agencies to develop an inventory or to  update the inventory periodically to measure reduction of SSN collection  and use. Nevertheless, OMB has recognized the value of maintaining an  accurate inventory and as part of the fiscal year 2016 FISMA submission  asked agencies to state whether they maintain a written inventory of the  collection and use of SSNs. OMB staff stressed that, despite these  instructions, they were not requiring agencies to maintain inventories of  systems that contain SSNs.", "However, OMB guidance does require agencies to maintain an inventory  of systems that \u201ccreate, collect, use, process, store, maintain,  disseminate, disclose, or dispose of PII.\u201d The OMB guidance states that  agencies are required to maintain that inventory in part to allow the  agency to reduce its PII to the minimum necessary.

Further, measurable  objectives should generally be free of bias and not require subjective  judgments to dominate their measurement.", "However, OMB M-07-16 did not provide clear criteria for determining what  would be an unnecessary collection or use of SSNs, leaving agencies to  develop their own interpretations. Of the 24 CFO Act agencies, 4 reported  that they had no definition of \u201cunnecessary collection and use.\u201d Of the  other 20 agencies, 7 reported that their definitions were not documented.  Officials from the 7 agencies with undocumented definitions stated that  the process of reviewing and identifying unnecessary uses of SSNs was  informal and relied on subjective judgments. For example:", "Other agency officials, including the Privacy Officer from the General  Services Administration, the Chief Information and Privacy Officer  from the National Science Foundation, and the Chief Privacy Officer  from the Small Business Administration, stated that the determination  of whether a specific collection or proposed use was necessary was  the decision of agency officials involved in various system reviews,  including privacy impact assessment review processes and system  authority-to-operate approvals.", "In contrast, officials from the Office of the Chief Privacy Officer of the  Department of Education stated that, while they had no written  definition of \u201cunnecessary collection and use,\u201d their departmental  policy was that SSNs could not be collected or used unless authorized  by law, regulation, or executive order, and/or necessary for a  documented agency purpose. Further, their policy required  documentation indicating that no reasonable alternative existed.", "Given the varying approaches that agencies have taken to determining  whether proposed or actual collections and uses of SSNs are necessary,  it is doubtful whether the goal of eliminating unnecessary collection and  use of SSNs is being implemented consistently across the federal  government. OMB has not subsequently provided criteria for determining  \u201cunnecessary collection and use\u201d of SSNs. OMB staff in the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs stated that they had not developed a  precise definition of \u201cunnecessary collection and use\u201d because the  circumstances of collection and use of SSNs varied across agencies.  However, developing guidance for agencies in the form of criteria for  making decisions about what types of collections and uses of SSNs are  unnecessary need not be narrowly prescriptive. Until such criteria are  established, agency efforts to reduce the unnecessary use of SSNs will  likely continue to vary, and, as a result, the risk of unnecessarily exposing  SSNs to identity theft may not be mitigated as thoroughly as it could be.", "Agencies Have Not Always Submitted Up-to-Date Status Reports to  OMB, and OMB Has Not Set Performance Measures to Monitor  Agency Efforts  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for  management to conduct activities to monitor and evaluate performance.

After reviewing the reduction plans that agencies submitted for  fiscal year 2008, OMB reported that the plans displayed varying levels of  detail and comprehensiveness and stated that agency reduction efforts  would require ongoing oversight. Subsequently, it required agencies to  report on their progress annually through their annual FISMA reports.", "However, OMB did not establish specific performance measures to  monitor implementation of agency reduction efforts. OMB\u2019s guidance  directed agencies to submit their most current documentation related to  their implementation plans and report on progress they had made in  eliminating unnecessary uses of SSNs. However, the guidance did not  ask for progress in achieving performance measures or targets that had  been identified in agency plans.", "Annual updates submitted by the 24 agencies from fiscal year 2013  through 2015 did not always include up-to-date information about agency  efforts and results achieved, making it difficult to monitor whether  progress had been made. For example, in each of its reports over this  period, the Department of State indicated that it had a review of over 100  systems underway, with little description of whether any progress had  been made. Similarly, the Department of Transportation stated in each of  its reports that privacy officials continue to work with departmental  components to justify, and as appropriate, reduce holdings of PII across  systems and business processes. However, none of the reports indicated  whether these efforts had been completed or what the results were. Small  Business Administration\u2019s updates for all three years consisted of the  same document, dated August 2013. OMB staff from the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs agreed that some agencies had  provided the same information year after year in their annual updates,  arguing that it was acceptable to do so if all reduction efforts had been  completed. However, this was not the case with any of the three  agencies, which all indicated that reduction efforts were still underway.", "Further, other than its initial review in 2008, OMB has only recently begun  monitoring agency efforts to reduce SSNs. Specifically, staff from the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reported that they performed  a review in 2015 and determined that agency efforts had been largely  successful. While they did not set specific criteria for measuring  performance, they noted that the agencies with the most robust and  mature SSN reduction efforts had developed inventories for their SSN  collections, defined unnecessary use, and established processes to  continue assessing whether SSN collections were necessary over time.  However, the OMB staff were unable to provide any documentation of  their review.", "In fiscal year 2016, OMB began asking agencies additional questions  about their reduction of SSNs. For example, questions were added to the  FISMA reporting metrics which require each agency to indicate whether it  has (1) compiled a written inventory of the agency\u2019s collection and use of  SSNs, (2) developed and implemented written policies or procedures to  ensure that any new collection or use of SSNs is necessary and remains  necessary over time, and (3) determined that any existing collection or  use of SSNs associated with agency websites, online forms, mobile  applications, and other digital services, is necessary and complies with  privacy and security requirements. OMB staff in the Office of Information  and Regulatory Affairs stated that they expect that the answers to these  questions will help inform future reviews of agency programs and will help  define metrics for use in future years.", "Thus, although OMB has taken steps to gather additional information  related to agency SSN reduction programs, its monitoring process is still  not based on performance measures that could be used to ensure  consistent and effective implementation of agency reduction efforts.

To identify challenges that  agencies experienced in implementing these efforts we interviewed  relevant officials at each of the 24 agencies.", "We obtained and analyzed additional information about SSN reduction  policies and activities from a selection of the 24 agencies included in this  review. To select these agencies, we identified major agencies in the  military, international, or security/national security area as well as  agencies that deliver benefits to the general public. Within these groups,  we selected the two agencies with the largest number of systems and  programs that use SSNs. We also selected the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) because it collects a large number of taxpayer SSNs and OPM  because it collects SSNs from all federal workers. This resulted in the  selection of six of the 24 agencies or components thereof: the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a component of the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS); the United States Department of  Agriculture (USDA); Army, a component of the Department of Defense  (DOD); the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); the IRS, a component of  the Department of the Treasury; and OPM.", "To obtain additional information on agency SSN use and efforts to reduce  the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs, we administered a  questionnaire to the 24 CFO Act agencies. After we drafted the  questionnaire, we consulted with GAO survey methodologists to ensure  the wording of our questions was objective. We also conducted pretests  to ensure that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2)  terminology was used correctly, (3) the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on agency officials, (4) the information could feasibly be  obtained, and (5) the questionnaire was comprehensive and unbiased.", "We chose to pretest the questionnaire with the Chief Privacy Officer at  the Department of Energy and with GAO\u2019s Record\u2019s Officer because of  their knowledge of SSN use and protection issues. We conducted the  pretests in person and made changes to the content and format of the  questionnaire after the pretests, based on the feedback we received. The  finalized questionnaire used for this study is reprinted in appendix II.", "We sent the questionnaire to all 24 CFO Act agencies by e-mail in an  attached PDF form that respondents could return electronically after  marking checkboxes or entering responses into open answer boxes.  Alternatively, respondents could return the questionnaire by mail after  printing the form and completing it by hand.", "We sent the questionnaire with an e-mail on July 25, 2016. Two weeks  later, we sent a reminder e-mail to each agency that had not responded.  We e-mailed or telephoned all respondents who had not returned the  questionnaire after 3 weeks and reminded them to participate. All  questionnaires were returned by August 22, 2016.", "Because this was not a sample questionnaire, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any questionnaire may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of  information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not  respond can introduce unwanted variability into the results. We took steps  in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing them  to minimize such nonsampling error. For example, survey specialists  designed the questionnaire in collaboration with GAO staff who had  subject matter expertise.", "Lastly, to identify specific examples of agency actions to reduce the  collection, use, and display of SSNs, we obtained additional information  from the six agencies or components that we selected for further review.  We obtained and analyzed additional documentation from these agencies  and held additional discussions with agency officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2016 to July 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Questionnaire Content", "paragraphs": ["To obtain more detailed information on agency SSN use and efforts to  reduce the unnecessary collection and use of SSNs, we administered a  questionnaire to the 24 agencies that we selected for review.
