For example, all have established telecommunications inventories, and most have established transition plans that include transition preparation tasks and time lines. However, other key practices are not being fully implemented at three agencies. For example, Commerce does not plan to clearly define all key transition roles and responsibilities, Homeland Security does not plan to identify local and regional points of contact, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does not plan to establish measures of success based on its transition objectives. With limited time available to finalize planning and begin transitions, agencies that do not address gaps in their planning or follow through on plans risk delaying their transitions and increase the likelihood of incurring unnecessary costs. As facilitator for all transition management activities, GSA has identified numerous common challenges that agencies face in making the transition to Networx, and it is taking action to resolve them. GSA uses various forums to identify these challenges, which include ensuring cooperation from incumbent contractors, defining agencies' responsibilities for information security during the transition, and the use of a transition inventory application developed by GSA. To resolve these challenges, GSA has, among other things, modified FTS2001 contracts to help ensure contractor cooperation, developed guidance to clarify information security responsibilities, and established support teams to assist agencies in using the inventory application developed by GSA. GSA's actions should reduce the likelihood that these challenges will hinder transition efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for ensuring  that federal agencies have access to the telecommunications services and  solutions that they need to meet mission requirements.

Currently, these  telecommunications contracts not only support agencies\u2019 basic telephony  needs, but also provide an acquisition vehicle for wireless and satellite  services, as well as managed network services and information technology  (IT) security services. In fiscal year 2007 alone, federal agencies spent  approximately $960 million on services acquired through the contracts  under GSA\u2019s current telecommunications program, known as FTS2001.

Agencies must now undertake the difficult task of transitioning their  telecommunications services to the Networx contracts. This transition will  involve more than 135 agencies, about 50 types of services, and thousands  of voice and data circuits.

Based on these  criteria, we selected the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce,  and Agriculture and the Small Business Administration, U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers, and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. We then obtained  and reviewed documentation (including strategic plans,  telecommunications inventories, and transition-related plans) and  interviewed officials from each of the selected agencies. We assessed this  agency information against sound telecommunications transition planning  practices that we identified in a report issued in 2006.

We also reported that transition delays  resulted in raised telecommunications costs. In total, an estimated $74  million in savings was lost due to delays in completing the transition to  FTS2001.", "Subsequently, the TWG, in conjunction with GSA, identified 27 lessons  learned from the previous transition.

We found that the collective effect of delays  encountered during this complex transition jeopardized the timely  achievement of FTS2001\u2019s program goals. Delays occurred for several  reasons. For example, delays occurred because agency efforts to order  services were impeded by the inability of GSA and the long-distance  contractors to rapidly add, through a contract modification process,  transition-critical services to the FTS2001 contracts. Other identified  reasons for transition delays included that agencies were slow to place  orders for transition services and that contractors had issues with staffing  and billing that impaired their efforts to support agencies\u2019 transition  activities.

Specifically, officials at the Department of Justice indicated  that they would not need additional financial resources, even though they  could not provide an analytical basis for their decision, and officials from  the Department of Energy believed that because the agency\u2019s transition  would be straightforward, identifying human capital needs would not be  necessary. We also reported that GSA had provided agencies with  guidance on performing some but not all of the sound transition planning  practices we identified.", "As a result, we recommended that  the Attorney General ensure that the Department of Justice\u2019s planning  efforts include an analysis of the extent to which current financial  resources would be sufficient to conduct an effective transition;  the Secretary of Energy ensure that the department\u2019s planning efforts  included identification of human capital resources needed to conduct  an effective transition; and  the Administrator of General Services, in working with the IMC,  develop and distribute guidance to ensure that our identified sound  practices for transition planning were used.", "In response, the three agencies took action or indicated that they planned  to take action to implement our recommendations.

However, as of April 1, 2008, it had not yet  done so. The Department of Energy provided a transition plan that  indicated that the need for human capital resources for the transition  would be dependent on the Networx contractor or contractors chosen;  once contractors were selected, the agency planned to re-examine its  human capital needs to ensure that adequate support would be provided  for transition execution. Finally, GSA provided guidance to agencies that  addresses our identified sound transition planning practices.", "In 2007, we reported on GSA\u2019s development of cost estimates for the  transition to Networx, stating that while it had adequate funding to  support its anticipated transition costs, it did not use sound analysis when  developing its estimate.

Two agencies, Agriculture and U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, indicated via e-mail that they had no comments.", "Officials from GSA, Commerce, and SBA generally agreed with our  findings:    The Acting Administrator of GSA concurred with the information  pertaining to GSA and expressed appreciation for our acknowledgment of  the actions the agency had taken.", "Commerce\u2019s Chief Information Officer indicated that the report provided a  fair assessment of the department\u2019s progress and status to date.", "A program manager in SBA\u2019s Office of Congressional and Legislative  Affairs indicated that SBA was satisfied with our findings regarding the  agency.", "NRC and the Department of Homeland Security partially agreed with our  report. NRC\u2019s Executive Director for Operations indicated that our report  generally reflects the issues surrounding agency preparedness for  transition. However, the official suggested that we remove our  recommendation that the Commission evaluate the costs and benefits of  new technology or alternatives because such an evaluation had been and  would be conducted as part of the agency\u2019s normal planning processes.  However, our recommendation remains because the Commission did not  perform this activity specifically for the transition to Networx. Performing  such an analysis would provide the Commission with the opportunity to  optimize its telecommunications services in the light of its present and  projected needs. The Executive Director also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated into our report as appropriate; our  assessment of these comments is contained in appendix IV.", "The Acting Director of Homeland Security\u2019s Departmental Audit Liaison  Office indicated partial agreement with our report. In particular, regarding  our recommendations that Homeland Security establish goals and  measures of success and perform a transition risk assessment, the  department agreed that a more structured communication of transition  objectives and a specific risk management process for transition would be  beneficial. However, this official indicated that the department disagreed  with five of our recommendations and with a finding regarding its  transition communications planning. The department\u2019s comments  reiterated information on actions that it had taken in these areas that it  considered to meet the goals of the sound practices. However, these  actions are already reflected in our assessment. The specific areas of  disagreement are as follows:    Regarding our recommendation that the department document its  processes for maintaining telecommunications inventories, the official  acknowledged that the department does not have a documented inventory  maintenance process, but stated that our observation was in conflict with  our finding that it had identified a complete telecommunications  inventory. The official added that the department has instructed its  components to maintain their inventories using a GSA tool and  documented GSA procedures. However, our finding that the department  had established an inventory for transition is not in conflict with the  recommendation. While the department had addressed one component of  this sound practice by establishing an inventory for transition, it had not  taken the necessary action to address the other component; it had not  documented the process to be used by its components for inventory  maintenance. Specifically, this sound practice component calls for a  documented inventory maintenance process to lessen the risk that  changes to the inventory during and after transition would not be  consistently and accurately captured.", "Regarding our recommendation that the department evaluate the costs  and benefits of new technology or alternatives to meeting its  telecommunications needs, the official indicated that this was in conflict  with our related finding that the department had aligned needs and  opportunities with its mission, long-term IT plans, and enterprise  architecture plans. The official added that its fair opportunity efforts will  include service and cost analyses. However, our recommendation is not in  conflict with the identified finding. Specifically, although the department\u2019s  transition plans addressed strategic needs, it had not performed an  analysis of costs and benefits of new technology or alternatives for  meeting those needs. Regarding decisions made during the fair  opportunity process, our recommendation refers to the sound transition  practice of performing a strategic analysis based on agencywide  telecommunications needs, with the results of this analysis being used to  shape the agency\u2019s transition management approach, transition plan  development, and allocation of resources. In contrast, the fair opportunity  process involves selecting a vendor for the agency\u2019s service orders; at that  point in the process, the agency should have already identified services to  order. Therefore, to be effective, an agency\u2019s evaluation of costs and  benefits of new technology and alternatives would need to take place  before the department\u2019s fair opportunity efforts.", "Regarding our recommendation that the department clearly define the  roles of asset management, legal expertise, human capital management,  and information security expertise, the official indicated that the  department can call upon these specialty disciplines as needed. However,  by taking this approach, Homeland Security risks encountering delays as  officials attempt to assign personnel in a time of need and bring them up to  date on transition progress and issues. Defining such roles at the outset, as  advocated by sound transition planning practices, would help avoid such  delays.", "Regarding our recommendation that the department identify local and  regional points of contact, the official stated that we had suggested that  the department should identify all personnel that might be involved in any  kind of telecommunication change and stated that such an effort would  include thousands of individuals across the department and all IT field  support personnel. Rather than contacting all these personnel, the Acting  Director indicated that the department had taken steps to alert key  managers at each component. However, this sound practice does not  involve identifying all personnel that might be involved in any  telecommunications change, but rather only identifying those contacts  that will be responsible for facilitating the transition. For example, a  contact is needed for each location where service is provided to facilitate  physical access to equipment during a transition. Homeland Security\u2019s  decision to not identify all contacts responsible for facilitating the  transition does not follow sound transition planning practices and  increases the risk that it will experience delays in providing the necessary  site access for vendors.", "Regarding our recommendation that the department identify human  capital resources needed to conduct an effective transition, the official  indicated the department did identify funding and staffing for transition  planning. However, our recommendation is that Homeland Security  determine human capital resources needed throughout the entire  transition effort\u2014not simply the planning effort.", "The official acknowledged that Homeland Security had not published a  Networx transition communications plan, but stated that the charter for its  transition work group defined essential communications and activities.  Our report indicates that the department has established lines of  communication in its charter, but as previously discussed, it had not  identified local and regional points of contact. Thus, the department\u2019s  communications planning is incomplete. If Homeland Security does not  identify all of its local points of contact before it begins transitioning  services, communication difficulties could produce delays in providing the  necessary site access for vendors.", "As agreed with your staff, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30  days from the report date.

Using FTS2001  billing data provided by GSA, we identified total charges for each agency  for fiscal year 2006. These totals ranged from over $145,000,000 to as low  as $28 for 127 separate entities. We then reduced the number of entities  under consideration to a more manageable number by identifying agencies  with total charges in excess of $1 million for fiscal year 2006. From this  group of agencies, we made a judgmental selection of six agencies that  were representative of (1) varying types of organization, including  executive departments, subagencies, and independent agencies;  (2) varying levels of attendance in the Transition Working Group, an  agency forum that is assisting GSA in its efforts to plan for the transition;  and (3) the entire range of agency charges in excess of $1 million. The  departments and agencies selected for review were the Department of  Homeland Security; Department of Commerce; U.S. Department of  Agriculture; Small Business Administration; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  a component of the Department of Defense; and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory  Commission.", "Because we judgmentally selected the agencies in our review, we cannot  conclude that our results represent the entire federal government\u2019s level of  preparation. However, the six cases studied illustrate various challenges  that agencies may face in planning for the transition to Networx.", "To determine the extent to which the selected agencies have made  adequate preparations for their upcoming transitions, we obtained and  reviewed agency documentation, including but not limited to strategic  plans, telecommunications inventories, and transition-related plans, and  interviewed agency officials. We then assessed this information against the  five sound transition planning practices identified in our prior report on  agency transition planning. These practices are (1) establish a  telecommunications inventory, (2) perform a strategic analysis of  telecommunications requirements, (3) establish a structured transition  management approach, (4) identify resources, and (5) develop a transition  plan. Each of these sound planning practices consists of various  components (for example, developing a transition plan consists of  (1) identifying and documenting objectives and measures of success;  (2) determining risks that could affect success; and (3) defining transition  preparation tasks and developing a time line for these tasks).", "Based on our assessment, we classified the status of agency transition  planning efforts to address each sound practice component as \u201cfully  implemented,\u201d if the agency has fully implemented the sound practice  component; \u201cplans to fully implement,\u201d if the agency has plans to fully  implement the component; or \u201cno plans to fully implement,\u201d if the agency  does not have plans to fully implement it. We discussed our assessments  with agency officials and made adjustments as appropriate.", "To evaluate one of the sound practices, establishing a telecommunications  inventory, we developed criteria to assess the extent to which agencies  had identified complete transition inventories. First, based on data  provided by GSA, we determined whether each agency had validated 90  percent or more of its inventory. Second, we administered a questionnaire  to determine whether each agency had adequate quality control  mechanisms in place to identify and maintain its inventory. If these two  criteria were met, we considered the inventory to be sufficient for a  telecommunications transition.", "To determine the actions that GSA is taking to identify and resolve  common transition challenges affecting agencies, we reviewed transition  guidance and other Networx documentation developed by GSA and the  Transition Working Group (TWG) of the Interagency Management Council  (IMC), including presentations, meeting minutes, projected time lines,  GSA\u2019s \u201cFair Opportunity and Statement of Work Guide,\u201d and the TWG\u2019s  \u201cNetworx Transition Guide (Pre-Award)\u201d; interviewed FTS2001 incumbent  vendors and Networx vendors (AT&T, Level3 Communications, Qwest,  Sprint, and Verizon Business) and the six agencies selected for review; and  interviewed GSA officials to identify challenges, guidance, and GSA  current and planned actions for the Networx transition.

The official stated that, as its requirements  mature, the agency will evaluate the Networx advanced offerings that  may prove beneficial. However, sound transition planning calls for  performing a cost benefit and analysis specifically for the agency\u2019s  transition effort as part of a strategic analysis that should be used to  shape the agency\u2019s transition management approach, transition plan  development, and allocation of resources. NRC has not performed this  activity for the transition.  3.  NRC\u2019s comment references our statement that it did not plan to  establish measures of success to assess progress toward its goals. NRC  indicated that it plans to use GSA-established measures related to  transition progress and identified various tracking tools. However,  NRC has not established agency-specific objectives for its transition  and, by limiting measures of success to those established by GSA, NRC  may lack information that could be used to track its progress in  achieving its own goals and to inform its own management decisions.  4.  We disagree with NRC\u2019s statement that the introduction of the Office  of Management and Budget\u2019s Trusted Internet Connection (TIC)  initiative should not be characterized as a transition issue.
