Medicaid, a federal- state health financing program for low-income and medically needy  individuals, is the nation\u2019s primary payer of LTSS. LTSS comprise a broad  range of health care, personal care, and supportive services to help  individuals with physical, developmental, or cognitive disabilities maintain  their quality of life. For example, LTSS can help individuals perform  routine daily activities, such as eating, dressing, bathing, and making  meals. Many individuals prefer to receive LTSS in home- and community- based settings, rather than receiving care in a nursing home or other  institutional setting, because it can help them maintain their  independence and participate in community life to the fullest extent  possible. LTSS delivered outside of institutional settings are known as  home- and community-based services (HCBS), and include adult day  care, personal care services, and services provided in assisted living.", "While state Medicaid programs are required to finance coverage for  beneficiary care in nursing homes, coverage for most HCBS is optional,  which creates incentives for Medicaid to deliver LTSS in institutional  settings.

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in  2010, created new options and provided additional funding for states to  make HCBS available to eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. In concert with  these efforts, the proportion of LTSS spending for HCBS has increased  nationwide. In fiscal year 2016, the most recent year of data available,  Medicaid spent an estimated $167 billion on LTSS. Of that amount, 57  percent\u2014or $94 billion\u2014was spent on HCBS. However, the extent to  which states cover HCBS in their Medicaid programs varies, as does the  proportion of LTSS spending used for HCBS; the proportion of Medicaid  LTSS spending on HCBS ranged from 27 percent to 81 percent among  states in 2016, a three-fold difference.", "States have a number of different options to provide Medicaid coverage  of HCBS. As a result, states vary in the structure of their HCBS programs.  States can provide certain types of HCBS under their state Medicaid  plans.

States may apply cost neutrality in the  aggregate across all waiver participants\u2014meaning that some individuals  can be more costly to serve in home- and community-based settings than  in an institution\u2014or individually, meaning that spending for each waiver  participant can be no more than what it would cost to serve the individual  in an institution. States also have the option to limit the number of  beneficiaries served under a 1915(c) waiver by establishing a predefined  enrollment cap.

Officials from these states told us the  ability to use managed care contracts to (1) set incentives aimed at  transitioning individuals from institutions to home- and community-based  settings and (2) increase oversight of providers were important factors in  choosing MLTSS to provide HCBS.", "Setting incentives for transitions. State officials told us that they  used contract incentives to shift services from nursing facilities to  community-based care in their MLTSS programs. Specifically,  Arizona and Florida used blended capitation rates, meaning that the  rate or amount the states pay MCOs to cover expected costs for each  LTSS beneficiary is the same for all beneficiaries regardless of  whether they are in a nursing home or in a home- and community- based setting. Because HCBS is generally less expensive than LTSS  delivered in institutional settings, blended rates can create a financial  advantage for the MCO to serve as many beneficiaries as possible in  home- and community-based settings. Three of the MCOs we spoke  with provided examples of how they have responded to these  incentives to provide HCBS. For example, an official from one MCO  told us that the MCO had created new positions for \u201ctransition  clinicians,\u201d registered nurses who use their medical knowledge to  systematically evaluate beneficiaries in an institution to determine if  they may be a candidate for transition to a community-based setting.  The official explained that after the transition clinician identifies a  potential candidate, the clinician will evaluate other factors, including  the candidate\u2019s current housing options and level of familial support,  in order to ensure that necessary resources are in place when the  beneficiary leaves the institution. In addition, the official said they  facilitated transitions by providing beneficiaries leaving nursing  facilities with a one-time $2,500 transition allowance that can be used  for expenses such as security or utility deposits, furniture, or new  resident fees at an assisted living facility.", "Oversight of MCOs. According to officials from Arizona and Florida,  the states chose to use MLTSS because it afforded better oversight of  providers and had the potential to improve patient outcomes.  Specifically, officials said that managing a limited number of MCOs,  who in turn have contracts with HCBS providers, allows for better  oversight and outcomes, and has led to service delivery  improvements, compared to paying providers on a fee-for-service  basis. For example, Florida officials explained that they recently  consolidated three smaller fee-for-service programs into their MLTSS  program. Prior to that consolidation, the three fee-for-service  programs provided HCBS to approximately 7,500 individuals with  AIDS, traumatic brain injury/spinal cord injury, and individuals with  cystic fibrosis. Officials said that they did not believe providers in  these smaller fee-for-service programs were providing good care,  based on service utilization analyses that showed some beneficiaries  were not accessing any services beyond one case management  service per month. Furthermore, the officials also told us that it was  harder to assess quality of care in the fee-for-service programs  compared to MLTSS. Officials said that now that these beneficiaries  receive care under the MLTSS waiver, there is more accountability  and improved quality of care.", "Representatives from aging and developmental disability professional  groups we interviewed said that states may also choose to implement  MLTSS programs to achieve greater budget predictability and control  costs. CMS\u2019s recent report on the growth of MLTSS also notes states\u2019  desire for improvements in quality of care and outcomes; increased  access to HCBS providers; and better care coordination, among other  factors. We have previously reported that although MLTSS can provide  states with the opportunity to enhance and encourage the provision of  HCBS, oversight at the state and federal levels is critical to ensure that  individuals with LTSS needs are able to obtain needed care in a timely  fashion. In addition, our prior work on MLTSS payment rates found that  five states\u2014including Arizona and Florida\u2014set clear financial incentives  in their MCO payment rates for greater use of community-based care,  while one state\u2019s rate structure included higher payments for beneficiaries  receiving institutional care. This state\u2019s rate structure could have created  an incentive for MCOs to move higher-cost beneficiaries from the  community to an institution. Additionally, we found that most of the states  reviewed for that prior work were not specifically linking payments with  MLTSS program goals such as beneficiary outcomes and that federal  oversight of states\u2019 MLTSS payment structures was limited. We made  several recommendations to improve CMS\u2019s oversight of states\u2019 payment  structures for MLTSS. CMS agreed with our recommendations and  reported actions it planned to take to address them.", "Officials from the three selected states that do not use MLTSS cited  various reasons for this, such as stakeholder opposition and state law  restrictions on enrolling individuals receiving LTSS in managed care. For  example, officials in Oregon explained that stakeholders objected to the  profit motive they assumed an MCO would have, which the stakeholders  believed would compromise quality of care and reduce beneficiaries\u2019  choice of providers.

In Mississippi, officials explained that as a result of a legal settlement in  2005, the state increased enrollment in certain HCBS programs. As a  result of the settlement, officials said that state case managers contacted  all 1,900 individuals who resided in institutions at the time to determine  their interest in living in a home- and community-based setting. Those  who expressed interest were evaluated to determine if they could live  outside an institution and whether adequate familial or other support was  available.

According to the officials, direct care workers can  typically earn more by working at a fast food restaurant. Officials from  Montana and Mississippi and officials from three of the MCOs said the  workforce shortages are often worse in rural or remote areas, where  travel across long distances is common. For example, the state officials  said that it can be hard to find a provider willing to drive a long distance  each way to work for only a few hours.", "To respond to these workforce issues, officials from Montana and  Mississippi and two MCOs reported offering higher payment rates to  providers. In 2017, the Montana legislature approved special funding to  raise the hourly wage for direct care workers providing care in certain  Medicaid HCBS programs in state fiscal year 2019. Officials from  Mississippi said that based on a study of provider reimbursement rates in  one of their HCBS waiver programs, the state raised payment rates for  agencies that employ direct care workers and other providers in 2017.  Officials said they hoped the increase would create an incentive to recruit  and develop providers in more rural areas. Officials from Arizona and  Montana and one MCO also mentioned that Medicaid\u2019s participant- directed options\u2014which allow beneficiaries to draw paid caregivers from  among their family members, friends, and neighbors\u2014had helped to  address HCBS workforce shortages. Arizona officials said that roughly  half of beneficiaries in its HCBS program who were receiving personal  care services got their care from family members, including spouses and  parents of adult children living in the home."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Serving HCBS Beneficiaries with Complex Needs", "paragraphs": ["Officials from four of the five selected states and all four MCOs we spoke  with said they faced challenges providing HCBS for beneficiaries with  complex medical or behavioral health needs. Officials we interviewed said  that complex medical conditions can be hard to accommodate in home-  and community-based settings. For example, officials from Mississippi  and one MCO mentioned difficulties finding appropriate placements for  individuals requiring ventilator services. State and MCO officials also  reported that complex conditions that affect beneficiaries\u2019 behavior, such  as co-occurring developmental disabilities and behavioral health  conditions, dementia, and traumatic brain injury can also create  challenges for providing HCBS, particularly when beneficiaries display  aggressive or other challenging behaviors. Officials from one MCO  explained that these beneficiaries\u2019 challenging behaviors can cause  friction between beneficiaries and their providers and make it harder for  beneficiaries to sustain good relationships with providers.", "Officials from the selected states and MCOs we interviewed said that they  have responded to the challenge of serving HCBS beneficiaries with  complex medical or behavioral health needs by (1) supporting the  development of locations in the community to serve individuals with  specific complex needs, (2) training providers, and (3) increasing care  coordination.", "Officials from one MCO said that they worked with nurses in the  community to support the development of adult foster homes as an  alternative to institutional care for beneficiaries who require ventilator  services. Similarly, Montana officials said they had reached out to  community partners, such as assisted living facility owners, to educate  them on what Medicaid can and cannot pay for in order to aid them in  developing multiple funding streams for specialized programs for  individuals with traumatic brain injury.", "Montana officials and officials from an MCO said they had offered  behavioral health training for providers; Montana offered a mental  health first aid class for providers, and MCO officials reported sending  behavioral health specialists into assisted living facilities to help train  staff on handling challenging behaviors in an effort to avoid  beneficiaries being moved out of the assisted living facility and into an  institutional setting.", "Regarding care coordination, Arizona officials reported that the state  is planning to offer beneficiaries with intellectual or developmental  disabilities the choice of a model of care that integrates medical care,  behavioral health care, and certain LTSS, under a single,  comprehensive managed care contract beginning in October 2019.  Officials from one MCO said this model of care will help better identify  needs and coordinate care, for example, for children with autism and  a co-occurring behavioral health condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Funding for HCBS Programs", "paragraphs": ["Officials from four selected states and officials from one of the MCOs in  the fifth state told us that limits on funding for HCBS programs were a  challenge, particularly in the context of the growing number of individuals  with LTSS needs.", "Officials from Mississippi said that lack of funding from the state  legislature had affected the enrollment of beneficiaries in certain  HCBS waivers. Specifically, officials said that the state was unable  to enroll as many beneficiaries in certain waivers as were approved by  CMS, and that only a limited number of beneficiaries had been added  to these programs for the past 2 or 3 years.", "Officials from one MCO in Arizona said that state budget constraints  had led to past reductions in the amount of certain HCBS, such as  respite care.", "Oregon officials said that the state experienced budgetary pressures  as a result of implementing its 1915(k) Community First Choice state  plan program, namely, that the increase in federal funding the state  received did not fully cover the increased cost of serving all eligible  beneficiaries as required under this option.", "Florida officials said that the state has experienced rapid growth in the  population with LTSS needs and that this growth, combined with  medical advances that prolong life and reduce attrition from waiver  programs, had contributed to a growing waiting list for HCBS.", "Officials who cited HCBS funding as a challenge said that they responded  to these challenges by, among other things, providing information to their  legislatures on the projected need for HCBS to inform future funding  decisions. For example, Florida officials said that they educate the  legislature about funding needs by conducting estimating conferences  that produce information that is provided to the Governor and both  legislative houses to use when deciding funding amounts. The  information provided includes the growth in the population of frail elders,  the projected demand for Medicaid, the cost of providing HCBS, and the  cost avoidance achieved by keeping people out of nursing homes.", "State officials have also leveraged alternative funding sources\u2014including  federal grants\u2014to help respond to funding limits for HCBS. Officials from  Montana and Mississippi said that CMS\u2019s Money Follows the Person  grant program\u2014which provided state Medicaid programs with funding for  beneficiaries to transition out of institutions\u2014had helped them to serve  more individuals in home- and community-based settings. Montana  officials noted that Money Follows the Person provided the state with  extra help to transition beneficiaries who were the most difficult to serve  and often had multiple co-occurring conditions from institutions to  community-based settings. Mississippi\u2019s Money Follows the Person  program\u2014Bridge to Independence\u2014resulted in a total of 540  beneficiaries moving from institutions to home- and community-based  settings, according to state officials. Mississippi officials also noted that  they maximize HCBS waiver funding by leveraging other potential funding  sources, such as charitable organizations, that could pay for items such  as a wheelchair ramp for a beneficiary before waiver funds were  expended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["State and MCO officials also mentioned other challenges providing  HCBS:", "Affordable housing. Officials from Mississippi and Montana and one  MCO cited the lack of affordable housing as a barrier for beneficiaries  wishing to transition out of an institution. The MCO officials we spoke  with said their transitions team, which assists beneficiaries who are  moving out of an institution into the community, includes a housing  coordinator whose job it is to track available housing and help  beneficiaries find housing they can afford.", "Limits on HCBS spending per beneficiary. Officials from one MCO  said that the state\u2019s limit on HCBS waiver spending per beneficiary\u2014 requiring that spending for HCBS does not exceed the cost of  institutional care\u2014was a challenge, particularly for beneficiaries with  high needs. The officials indicated that the MCO tracks HCBS  spending for each beneficiary and reviews plans of care when a  beneficiary reached 80 percent and 95 percent of the spending limit.  Beneficiaries whose spending exceeds 100 percent for more than a 6- month period can choose to move to an institutional setting, or to  continue to receive more limited HCBS that do not exceed the cost of  care in an institution. In cases where the MCO believed the  beneficiary could not be safely served in the community at that level of  spending, officials said that beneficiaries and their families were  required to sign a form acknowledging the safety risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "As discussed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after its  issuance date.
