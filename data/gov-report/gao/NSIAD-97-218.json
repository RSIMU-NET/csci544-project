Most CTR assistance is provided in the form of goods and services, including equipment, logistics support, materials, and training. Between fiscal years 1992 and 1997, Congress has authorized over $1.8 billion to help DOD achieve CTR objectives. As of July 1997, DOD had obligated over $1.4 billion of these funds.

According to financial statements provided by Ukraine, over $5 million has been spent of the $10.3 million grant. This grant was to support the final removal of nuclear warheads and nuclear support equipment from Ukraine and the elimination of deployed SS-19 missiles. According to DOD, Ukraine\u2019s agreement with Russia does not allow foreigners to observe such dismantlement activities. Thus, DOD awarded the cash grant to Ukraine instead of following its normal practice of providing CTR-funded equipment and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of State", "paragraphs": ["According to the State Department, through 1996 nearly $50 million of CTR funding was provided to help support the ISTC in Russia, including the branch offices recently opened in Belarus and Kazakstan, and the STCU. Although not described in DOD\u2019s report, 130 of the 320 ISTC projects underway received $41.5 million in CTR funding. The types of projects involved include safely disposing of weapons-grade plutonium, improving nuclear power safety, destroying chemical weapons, and protecting the environment. Through 1996, the United States provided $8 million of CTR funding to support 72 of the 87 ongoing STCU projects.

Of this amount, $14 million was used for purchasing equipment, such as metal detectors, computers, and security systems, and contracting directly with scientific institutes and labs in the recipient countries to improve controls over nuclear materials. For instance, a CTR-funded contract is helping the Luch Scientific Production Association in Russia develop an integrated network to exchange data between all computers on the network, thus enhancing material controls for the entire site.

These contractor personnel conducted approximately 115 visits to 51 different locations throughout Russia, Kazakstan, and Belarus, including 24 separate locations in Russia. In Ukraine, these teams visited 5 different sites on an average of 10 scheduled and 25 unscheduled maintenance repair calls per week.", "CTR project managers also traveled to the recipient countries to monitor the status of their projects and observe how CTR assistance was being used. During 1996, project managers and government contractors took 19 trips to several sites throughout the 4 recipient countries. During these visits a variety of projects were observed, including those designed to eliminate strategic offensive arms, safely transport and store nuclear materials, and restore the environment. In addition, personnel visited 14 of the 24 defense conversion projects, including 3 housing projects in Belarus and Ukraine.", "DOD also obtained information from the intelligence community.

According to DOD, however, the DCAA audited the financial statements for the $1.75 million spent during 1996 and plans to audit the remaining funds this year. Furthermore, the Ukrainian government has agreed to apply the remainder of the grant\u2014about $5 million\u2014to the integrating contract for nuclear arms elimination.

For example, the DCAA conducted the first annual financial audit for the STCU and concluded that the financial statements fairly presented the center\u2019s financial position, operations, and cash flows. Although DOD\u2019s report mentions that the European Union would perform the third annual ISTC financial audit, it does not mention that the European Union auditors issued their report in April 1997 and found that the financial statements fairly reflected the ISTC\u2019s financial activities.", "While DOD\u2019s report to Congress states that during 1996 DCAA assessed 17 ISTC projects at 7 locations, it did not provide a description of the audits or the audits\u2019 findings.

In approximately half of the 17 audits conducted, DCAA auditors found weaknesses in recording the labor charges of ISTC grantees\u2014they were working more hours than those billed. To date, however, such weaknesses have posed no risk to CTR funding. In reviewing these DCAA audits, the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office also highlighted two other issues\u2014namely that (1) the ISTC should provide the DCAA auditors with lists of equipment purchased for the projects and (2) Russian-speaking technical experts should accompany the auditors in reviewing the projects. According to an ISTC director, the center is taking measures to correct these problems. For example, the center has implemented an internal control procedure designed to track the total number of hours worked by grantees on ISTC projects.", "As stated in DOD\u2019s report, each of the centers also monitors its respective projects to measure technical accomplishments and status and to resolve difficulties.

DOD based its determination on a wide range of evidence obtained from audit and examination and technical support teams, program and contractor personnel, the intelligence community, and other government agencies involved in implementing CTR projects. DOD acknowledged that the risk of diversion exists, but believes that the cooperative relationship that it has developed with the CTR-recipient country officials and its emphasis on the audit and examination process help to ensure the appropriate use of assistance. According to DOD, it remains reasonably confident that any diversions of assistance would be discovered before U.S. interests were affected.
