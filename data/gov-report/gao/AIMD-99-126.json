For many years, we and others (e.g., HUD\u2019s Inspector General, external auditors) have reported significant management problems at HUD. These problems are the results of serious, long-standing departmentwide deficiencies in four management areas\u2014internal controls, information and financial management systems, organizational structure, and staffing. In 1994, we designated HUD programs as a high-risk area because of these management deficiencies, and in 1995 and 1997, we reported on the deficiencies and HUD\u2019s progress in resolving them. Taken together, these deficiencies place the integrity and accountability of HUD\u2019s programs at high risk. These deficiencies can affect HUD\u2019s management of significant financial commitments, obligations, and exposure. Resolving them is particularly critical for HUD because its housing and community development programs rely extensively on the integrity of thousands of diverse individuals and entities.", "Our statement today is primarily based on our January 1999 report on HUD\u2019s major management challenges and program risks. It discusses (1) corrective actions that HUD has taken or initiated on its major management challenges, (2) major management challenges that remain and limit HUD\u2019s effectiveness in carrying out its mission, and (3) further actions that are needed to resolve these challenges.", "In summary, we found the following:", "HUD is making significant changes and has made credible progress in overhauling its operations to correct its management deficiencies. Among other things, it has improved its financial reporting and developed risk assessments for its programs, developed and deployed components for its information and financial management systems, consolidated and centralized many of its operations, and reassigned and begun to retrain many of its staff. A major contributor to this progress is HUD\u2019s June 1997 2020 Management Reform Plan, a set of proposals intended to, among other things, correct the management deficiencies that we and others identified. However, it should be recognized that HUD\u2019s problems were years in the making and will take time and much effort to correct. Current HUD management has placed high priority on removing HUD programs from the high-risk designation, but it will take continued and sustained efforts before meaningful and lasting results can be achieved.", "While major reforms are under way, our recent work indicates that internal control weaknesses and problems with information and financial management systems persist. For example, material internal control weaknesses persist in the Section 8 subsidy payment process, which provides $18 billion in rental assistance, and HUD has not adequately monitored programs and functions, such as contractors\u2019 management of the Department\u2019s real estate assets. Recently, we reported that HUD is likely to continue to spend millions of dollars, miss milestones, and still not meet its objective of developing and fully deploying an integrated financial management system because it has not yet finalized detailed project plans or cost and schedule estimates for this effort. Furthermore, recent reforms to address the Department\u2019s organizational and staffing problems are in the early stages of implementation, and it is too soon to tell whether the reforms will resolve the major deficiencies that we and others have identified. Therefore, pending the achievement of substantial results, the integrity and accountability of HUD\u2019s programs remain at high risk in our opinion. We reached this conclusion using the same methodologies and criteria as our 1995 and 1997 reports.", "To resolve these management deficiencies, the Department needs to ensure that the actions being taken eliminate the remaining major internal control weaknesses; strengthen its management and oversight of efforts to integrate its information and financial management systems and correct these systems\u2019 weaknesses; ensure that the field offices have enough staff to carry out the work assigned, including the monitoring of programs and activities and the assessment of outcomes; and ensure that all staff have the skills needed to perform their functions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Directly or indirectly, HUD affects millions of Americans as it carries out the federal government\u2019s missions, policies, and programs for housing and community development.

HUD is also one of the nation\u2019s largest financial institutions, with significant commitments, obligations, and exposure. As of September 30, 1997, HUD was responsible for managing about $454 billion in insured mortgages and $531 billion in guarantees of mortgage-backed securities. For fiscal year 1999, it has $24.3 billion in budget authority.", "HUD initiated a number of reforms and downsizing efforts in the 1990s. In February 1993, then Secretary Cisneros initiated a \u201creinvention\u201d process under which task forces were established to review and refocus HUD\u2019s mission and identify improvements in the delivery of program services. HUD also took measures in response to the National Performance Review\u2019s September 1993 report, which recommended that HUD eliminate its regional offices, realign and consolidate its field office structure, and reduce its field workforce. Following a July 1994 report by the National Academy of Public Administration that criticized HUD\u2019s performance and capabilities, Secretary Cisneros issued a reinvention proposal in December 1994 that called for major reforms, including a consolidation and streamlining of HUD\u2019s programs coupled with a reduction in staff. Building upon the earlier reinvention efforts, Secretary Cuomo initiated the 2020 planning process in early 1997 to address, among other things, HUD\u2019s downsizing goals and management deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corrective Actions That HUD Has Taken or Initiated", "paragraphs": ["HUD has taken important steps to strengthen its internal controls and financial reporting, improve its information and financial management systems, consolidate its operations, and appropriately deploy and train its staff.

In addition, as the public accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick LLP reported this month, FHA presented its fiscal year 1998 financial statements in accordance with federal accounting standards and received an unqualified opinion on those statements. In 1998, HUD\u2019s Office of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) established a risk management division, which has continued efforts initiated by the CFO to work with the Department\u2019s program offices and new nationwide centers to identify risks and develop action plans to reduce them.

As of December 1998, HUD reported, it had developed and deployed 11 new financial management systems or components of these systems. For example, in March 1998, the Office of Housing deployed the first phase of the real estate management system, a new system being developed to implement 2020 reforms. In addition, the Office of the CFO developed and deployed a consolidated general ledger for fiscal year 1999 that will include summary transactions for the entire Department. The Office of the CFO is also developing a risk evaluation database that will be used to identify programs needing special risk reviews. The database will include information on the programs\u2019 funding, as well as findings reported by us, HUD\u2019s Inspector General, and internal reviews. Further agencywide improvements include cleaning up certain data elements in the Department\u2019s information systems and verifying the reliability of these and other data.

Second, poorly integrated, ineffective, and generally unreliable information and financial management systems did not meet the needs of program managers and weakened their ability to provide management control over housing and community development programs. Third, HUD had organizational problems, such as overlapping and ill-defined responsibilities and authorities between its headquarters and field organizations and a fundamental lack of management accountability and responsibility.

On the basis of data for calendar year 1996, HUD estimated that it had provided over $900 million in overpayments. This high level of improper payments exists because HUD does not have adequate internal controls over the process of verifying tenants\u2019 self-reported income\u2014the primary factor in determining the amount of assistance HUD pays.

The report added that because of the issues\u2019 complexity, implementing sufficient changes to mitigate these internal control weaknesses will take several years.
