GAO also interviewed Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and obtained information on how they used data to inform decisionmaking. GAO interviewed a range of stakeholders, including federal and industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's prior work recommended multiple actions to improve the Coast Guard's program management by improving the quality of data it uses to manage and report on its mission performance. Specifically, GAO recommended actions such as collecting more complete data and clarifying the data limitations to facilitate more effective program management. For example, in December 2017, GAO found that more information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could enhance the Coast Guard's knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality trends involving commercial fishing vessels. Having more complete information could be useful to carrying out its marine safety mission, and GAO recommended, among other things, that the Coast Guard ensure that data collected during commercial fishing vessel incident investigations is accurately captured. In 2018, the Coast Guard reported taking initial steps to capture more accurate data.", "GAO's prior work also identified areas where the Coast Guard could improve the transparency of the data it uses for reporting on its mission performance as well its capital planning purposes. For example, in an October 2017 report on performance goals, GAO found the Coast Guard's Annual Performance Report (APR) has not been released publicly since 2011. Consequently, there has not been full visibility over performance across all of the Coast Guard's missions. Coast Guard officials stated that a decision by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leadership to limit the number of performance goals shared publicly had deterred the Coast Guard from public release of its APR. GAO recommended that APRs be available on the Coast Guard's website; the Coast Guard plans to publicly release future APRs. In addition, previous GAO reports found that the Coast Guard's annual 5-year capital investment plan, which projects acquisition funding needs for the upcoming 5 years, did not consistently reflect current total cost estimates or the effects of tradeoffs made as part of the annual budget cycle. GAO made recommendations to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the difficult trade off decisions it will face given funding constraints. The Coast Guard agreed, but it is unclear when it will complete the 20-year plan."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations in this statement but has made them to the Coast Guard and DHS in the past on improving its program management through, among other things, better quality and more transparent data.

The Coast Guard, within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), serves as the principal federal  agency responsible for maritime safety, security, and environmental  stewardship in U.S. ports and waterways. The Coast Guard\u2019s 11 primary  statutory missions identified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as  amended, encompass the agency\u2019s important roles and responsibilities.  For example, as part of its marine safety mission, the Coast Guard  performs mandatory safety inspections, conducts accident investigations,  and promotes accident prevention involving vessels at sea, including for  commercial fishing vessels.", "To ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively fulfilling its missions, agency  managers must have accurate and reliable mission performance  information to monitor and track the progress the agency is making  toward achieving its goals. We have previously reported that evaluation  can play a key role in strategic planning and program management, and  that findings supported by sound analyses strengthen decision making.  Our findings are consistent with Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance on assessing an agency\u2019s performance, which emphasizes the  need for frequent, data-driven reviews, including data analyses, and  identifying steps necessary to increase agency performance. However,  we have previously raised questions about whether annual performance  goals and reported performance information accurately reflect the extent  to which the Coast Guard is accomplishing its mission goals. We have  also raised concerns about the Coast Guard\u2019s management of its capital  asset acquisitions given the impact these assets can have on the Coast  Guard\u2019s ability to conduct some of its missions.", "In 2014, we reported that better information on performance and  funding was needed to address Coast Guard acquisition shortfalls.", "In 2016, we reported that the Coast Guard did not provide field units  with realistic strategic goals to allocate their limited resources, and  testified on Coast Guard actions to improve its asset allocation  process.", "In 2017, we issued five reports and testimonies that collectively  underscore the importance of collecting good data and addressing its  limitations and being transparent about it for the benefit of  congressional decisionmakers and the public.", "My testimony today describes some of the findings and recommendations  from these reports. Specifically, I will discuss Coast Guard actions  needed to (1) improve the quality of data used for program management  and (2) improve the transparency of data used for reporting on its mission  performance and capital planning.", "This statement is based on eight products we issued from June 2014  through December 2017 on Coast Guard strategic planning and  performance management, and recommendation follow-up activities  conducted through February 2018. To perform the work for our previous  reports, among other things, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations,  policies and guidance for selected performance goals. We interviewed  Coast Guard officials responsible for administering these programs and  obtained information on their processes for ensuring data reliability,  including performing electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness. We determined that data were sufficiently reliable for  reporting some information, but in other instances, data reliability  limitations precluded us from reporting information, which we describe  later in this statement. We also conducted site visits and interviewed a  range of other stakeholders, including federal officials and industry  representatives. Further details on the scope and methodology for the  previously issued reports are available within each of the published  products. In addition, after the issuance of our reports and through  February 2018 we contacted the Coast Guard to obtain updated  information and documentation, as appropriate, on the status of  recommendations we made.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence obtained provides  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["With a staff of over 47,000 members, the Coast Guard operates a  multimission fleet of 201 fixed and rotary-wing aircraft and over 1,400  boats and ships. Operational control of surface and air assets is divided  into two geographic Areas (Pacific and Atlantic), within which are nine  Districts consisting of 37 sectors and the stations within them. The Coast  Guard\u2019s program oversight, policy development, and personnel  administration are carried out at the Coast Guard\u2019s headquarters. As  shown in table 1, the Coast Guard is responsible for 11 statutory missions  identified in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended. The  Coast Guard manages these missions through six mission programs, also  listed in table 1. As part of its marine safety mission, for example, the  Coast Guard conducts, among other activities, safety inspections and  vessel accident investigations, including those involving commercial  fishing vessels, which are part of an industry with one of the highest death  rates of any industry in the United States.", "For each of its 11 missions, the Coast Guard has developed goals and  targets to assess and communicate agency performance. The Coast  Guard\u2019s performance assessment process also includes identifying  performance gaps and implementing corrective actions to address unmet  performance goals. As part of its process, the Coast Guard is to establish  targets for the current and subsequent 2 fiscal years, according to Coast  Guard officials. Each target is set by the Coast Guard, but according to  the Coast Guard\u2019s Annual Performance Report (APR), some are derived  from external factors. For example, DHS requires that Coast Guard set a  100 percent target for the percent of people in imminent danger saved in  the maritime environment. Further, several of the Coast Guard\u2019s assets  used to conduct these missions are approaching the end of their intended  service lives. As part of its efforts to modernize its assets used to carry  out various missions, the Coast Guard has begun acquiring new vessels,  such as the National Security Cutter, the Fast Response Cutter as well as  other assets. However, concerns surrounding the affordability of this effort  remain as the Coast Guard continues to pursue multiple new acquisitions  without long-term planning to guide the affordability of its acquisition  portfolio. Figure 1 shows the Coast Guard\u2019s Fast Response Cutter and  National Security Cutter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Actions that Could Improve Data Quality", "paragraphs": ["We previously reported on actions the Coast Guard could take to ensure  that, among other things, it addresses limitations posed by incomplete  data, the use of unrealistic asset performance data, and limitations with  its performance goal data, for more effective program management.  Examples of data limitations that we have recommended that the Coast  Guard take action on are below.", "Improve completeness of mission data. In December 2017, we found  that several different federal agencies play a role in overseeing and  promoting commercial fishing vessel safety, including the Coast Guard.  As part of its marine safety activities, the Coast Guard conducts, among  other activities, safety inspections and vessel accident investigations.  Commercial fishing has one of the highest death rates of any industry in  the United States and vessel disasters are the leading cause of fatalities  among fishers, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety  and Health. However, our December 2017 review found that more  information is needed to calculate vessel safety statistics that could  enhance the Coast Guard\u2019s knowledge about accident, injury, and fatality  trends involving commercial fishing vessels.", "The Coast Guard collects some data on commercial fishing vessels that  operate in federal waters\u2014including a vessel\u2019s length and construction  date\u2014but data on the population of the active U.S. commercial fishing  vessel fleet are not complete. Between 2006 and 2015, the Coast Guard  investigated 2,101 commercial fishing vessel accidents that were  identified as occurring in federal waters. While the number of accidents  generally increased over this time period, the number of injuries and  fatalities declined over the same 10-year period. However, we could not  assess the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities by fishery\u2014 meaning the area in which a certain type of fish (e.g., shrimp, salmon,  crab) is caught\u2014because the Coast Guard\u2019s data is not complete.  Further, we were unable to calculate the rates of commercial fishing  vessel accidents, injuries, and fatalities, because reliable data on certain  information needed to do so\u2014including the total number of vessels that  are actively fishing and the fishery or region in which the vessel  operates\u2014are either not maintained or are not collected by the Coast  Guard or other federal agencies. Having this information could be useful  to carrying out the Coast Guard\u2019s marine safety mission, which includes  enforcing laws to prevent death, injury and property loss in the marine  environment.", "We recommended in our December 2017 report that the Coast Guard  ensure that data it collects during commercial fishing vessel incident  investigations is accurately captured. We also recommended that the  Coast Guard work with stakeholders to form a working group to determine  an efficient means to establish a reliable estimate of the population of  active commercial fishing vessels. The Coast Guard agreed with both  recommendations, and in February 2018 informed us that it is in the  process of developing additional data fields to capture more information,  such as the fishery in which the commercial fishing is involved, and is  engaging stakeholders to establish an appropriate working group. We will  continue to monitor these actions.", "Use more realistic asset performance data. In our May 2016 report on  Coast Guard strategic planning, we found that the Coast Guard did not  provide field units with realistic goals for allocating assets, by mission.  We reported that the Coast Guard\u2019s strategic allocations of assets were  based on unrealistic assumptions about the performance capacity of its  assets and did not reflect asset condition and unscheduled maintenance.  This was due, in part, to the Coast Guard not including information from  its field units on the actual performance of its assets. For example,  agency officials noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old  and these cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring  emergency dry dock repairs, which resulted in reduced availability to  carry out their missions during the year. In another example, a field unit  stated that based on historical use, it planned for 575 hours per vessel for  one type of cutter instead of the 825 hours performance capacity.", "Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset  performance capacities, there is not a direct alignment between the Coast  Guard\u2019s strategic operational goals and its prospects for achieving those  goals. As a result, the headquarters\u2019 strategic intent, which is based on  asset capacity rather than actual performance, did not provide the field  with strategic, realistic goals for allocating assets by mission. Agencies  should use quality information that is appropriate, current, complete,  accurate, accessible, and timely to achieve objectives and address  related risks. We recommended that the Coast Guard incorporate field  unit input, such as information on assets\u2019 actual performance, to inform  more realistic asset allocation decisions. The Coast Guard concurred with  this recommendation, and in February 2018 informed us that it plans to  address this recommendation through changes to two process  documents that are under revision, with an expected completion date in  March 2018.", "Improve performance goal data. In our October 2017 review of Coast  Guard performance goals, we reported that the Coast Guard and DHS  identified limitations with two of the seven selected performance goals we  reviewed, including the five year average number of recreational boating  deaths and injuries. In particular, officials believe that many recreational  boating injuries that do not require hospitalization are not reported to the  Coast Guard. These officials believe that the amount of underreporting  may vary over time due to changes in industry trends, making it difficult to  accurately determine actual injury rates and program performance. We  determined that the data for this performance goal was not sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives due to these likely  limitations. We found that the Coast Guard did not report the possible  extent of these limitations with this performance goal in its fiscal year  2016 APR.", "For the other performance goal, the Coast Guard and DHS identified  limitations with the number of detected incursions of foreign fishing  vessels violating U.S. waters, which is publicly reported in DHS\u2019s APR.  DHS\u2019s review of this performance goal, reported in August 2015, raised  questions about the validity of this goal\u2014that is, whether it provides a  useful measure of the Coast Guard\u2019s performance. Specifically, the  review noted that this performance goal is intended to measure a  deterrence effect, but doing so is inherently difficult and may lead to  contradictory interpretations of performance. In October 2017, we found  that the data for this performance goal was sufficiently reliable for our  reporting objective purposes, but questions remain about its validity.  Reliable data is not a useful indication of performance unless it is also a  valid representation of the goal being addressed. DHS officials reported  that they did not include a discussion of the limitations for this  performance goal in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2015 APR because the  performance goal met the minimum threshold for data reliability despite  the goal\u2019s limitations. Coast Guard officials reported they were aware of  these limitations and were working with DHS and OMB to improve the  performance goal and implement corrective actions within 1 to 2 years.  We recommended that the Coast Guard assess the extent to which  documentation on performance data reliability contains appropriate  information on known data reliability limitations and update these  documents, as needed, based on the results of the assessment. The  Coast Guard concurred and in February 2018, informed us that it had  taken initial actions to address our recommendation. However, our  preliminary review of these actions indicates that further action will be  needed to fully address our recommendation, such as documenting and  reporting the limitations of performance data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coast Guard Actions that Could Improve Transparency of Data for Reporting on Its Mission Performance and Capital Planning", "paragraphs": ["Our previous reports have identified areas in which the Coast Guard  could improve the transparency of its data used for reporting on its  mission performance and planning.", "Improve transparency of data on mission performance. In our  October 2017 report on performance goals, we found that the Coast  Guard\u2019s APR has not been released publicly since 2011 due to a previous  DHS leadership decision. Consequently, there has not been full visibility  over performance across all of the Coast Guard\u2019s missions. For  example, one of the Coast Guard\u2019s missions\u2014defense readiness\u2014has  no goals that are publicly reported or shared with Congress, even though  measures related to defense readiness are included in the Coast Guard\u2019s  APR.", "Coast Guard officials stated that they could see the benefit of publicly  releasing their APR; however, DHS\u2019s decision to limit the number of  performance goals shared publicly has so far deterred the Coast Guard  from pursuing the public release of its APR. DHS officials told us that the  department is concerned about conflicting information that a component\u2019s  APR might present because it is vetted and produced separately from the  DHS APR. However, the lack of transparency regarding performance  data shared publicly and with Congress can result in an incomplete  picture of mission performance and can limit effective oversight of Coast  Guard operations. As a result, the public and Congress may be unable to  determine the extent to which the Coast Guard is meeting its missions.  We recommended that future Coast Guard APRs be available on the  Coast Guard\u2019s public website. The Coast Guard concurred with this  recommendation and in February 2018, the Coast Guard informed us that  it had completed its 2017 APR and are determining an appropriate  approach for making it publicly available.", "Improve capital planning transparency. In our previously issued work  on the Coast Guard\u2019s annual 5-year capital investment plan (CIP), we  found that the CIP does not consistently reflect current total cost  estimates or the effects of tradeoffs that are made as part of the annual  budget cycle. We made several recommendations in recent years  intended to help the Coast Guard plan for future acquisitions and the  difficult tradeoff decisions it will likely face. The Coast Guard generally  concurred with these recommendations and is in various stages of  implementation. For example, in 2017 we reported that we have made  recommendations that DHS and the Coast Guard take several actions to  gain an understanding of what the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission  within its likely acquisition funding levels. These recommended actions  included the Coast Guard: (1) conducting a comprehensive portfolio  review across all its acquisitions to develop revised baselines that meet  mission needs and reflect realistic funding scenarios and (2) developing a  20-year plan that identifies all necessary recapitalization efforts and any  fiscal resources likely necessary to complete these efforts. For example,  in 2014 we recommended the Coast Guard develop a 20-year fleet  modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions needed to maintain the  current level of service and the fiscal resources needed to acquire them.  Without these efforts, the Coast Guard will continue, as it has in recent  years, to plan its future acquisitions through the annual budgeting  process, an approach that has led to delayed and reduced capabilities.", "In 2016, the Coast Guard revised its 2005 Mission Needs Statement,  which provides a basic foundation for long-term investment planning that  is to serve as the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of various fleet  mixes, and inform the Coast Guard\u2019s CIP. However, the 2016 Mission  Needs Statement did not identify specific assets the Coast Guard needs  to achieve its missions, nor did it update the annual hours it needs from  each asset class to satisfactorily complete its missions. The Coast  Guard has stated it is developing a 20-year Long-term Major Acquisition  Plan, but it has not stated when the plan will be completed or what will be  included in this plan, such as potential trade-offs that could be made  across the Coast Guard\u2019s portfolio of acquisitions to better meet mission  needs within realistic funding levels. A long-term plan with a tradeoff  analysis would facilitate a full understanding of the affordability challenges  facing the Coast Guard while it builds the Offshore Patrol Cutter. DHS  concurred with our 2014 recommendation, but it is unclear when the  Coast Guard plans to complete the 20-year plan.", "Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and members of the sub- committee, this completes my prepared statement.
