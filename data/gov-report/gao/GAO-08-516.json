On the programmatic side, DOD provided Congress with a plan that lays out an organizational structure and defines the responsibilities of the newly created Joint ORS Office, and describes an approach for satisfying warfighters' needs. DOD has also begun staffing the office. On the research and development side, DOD has launched one of its TacSat satellites--small experimental satellites intended to quickly provide a capability that meets an identified need within available resources--and has begun developing several others. It has also made progress in developing interface standards for satellite buses--the platform that provides power, altitude, temperature control, and other support to the satellite in space--and continued its sponsorship of efforts aimed at acquiring low cost launch vehicles. Despite this progress, it is too early to determine the overall success of these efforts because most are still in their initial phases. Achieving success in ORS will be challenging. With relatively modest resources, the Joint ORS Office must quickly respond to the warfighter's urgent needs, while continuing research and development efforts that are necessary to help reduce the cost and time of future space acquisitions. As it negotiates these priorities, the office will need to coordinate its efforts with a broad array of programs and agencies in the science and technology, acquisition, and operational communities. Historically, it has been difficult to transition programs from the science and technology environment to the acquisition and operational environment.

DOD created the Joint ORS Office to coordinate and manage  specific science and technology efforts to fulfill joint military operational  requirements for on-demand space support and reconstitution. In addition,  DOD is working with other government agencies to staff the office,  developing an implementation plan, and establishing a process for  determining which existing requirements for short-term tactical  capabilities the office should pursue.

As  the office negotiates these priorities, it will need to coordinate its efforts  with a broad array of programs and agencies in the science and  technology, acquisition, and operational communities. Historically it has  been difficult to transition programs initiated in the science and  technology environment to the acquisition and operational environment.  At this time, DOD lacks tools which would help the program office  navigate within this environment\u2014primarily, a plan that lays out how the  office will direct its investments to meet current operational needs while  at the same time pursuing innovative approaches and new technologies.", "The Joint ORS Office has a budget totaling about $646 million for fiscal  years 2008 through 2013 and with no more than 20 government staff. These  resources are relatively modest when compared with the resources  provided major space programs. For example, the ORS fiscal year 2008  budget represents less than 12 percent of the budget of the  Transformational Satellite Communications System program which is in  the concept development phase, and staffing is about a quarter of that  program\u2019s staff. While the Joint ORS Office\u2019s responsibilities are not the  same as those of large, complex acquisition programs, it is expected to  address urgent tactical needs that have not been met by the larger space  programs. At this time, for example, the office has been asked to develop a  solution to meet current communications shortfalls that cannot be met by  the current Ultra High Frequency Follow-On satellite system. And, while  the office has not yet been asked, officials have told us that ORS could  potentially satisfy a gap in early missile warning capabilities because of  delays in the Space Based Infrared Systems program, as well as gaps in  communications and navigation capabilities. Taking on any one of these  efforts will be challenging for ORS as there are constraints in available  technologies, time, money, and other resources that can be used to fill  capability gaps.", "At the same time, the Joint ORS Office will be pressured to continue to  sponsor longer term research and development efforts. According to the  Air Force Research Laboratory, the average cost of a small satellite is  about $87 million. This is substantially higher than the target acquisition  cost of about $40 million for an integrated ORS satellite in the 2007  National Defense Authorization Act. In addition, concerns are being  expressed that not enough funding and support are being devoted to  acquiring low cost launch capabilities. Some government and industry  officials believe that achieving such capabilities is a linchpin to reducing  satellite development costs in the future. The current alternatives for  launching ORS satellites\u2014an Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and  Minotaur launch vehicles\u2014do not meet DOD\u2019s low cost goal. DARPA  expects its responsive launch capabilities, currently in development, will  total about $5 million to produce\u2014a significantly lower cost than that of  current capabilities. However, in order to achieve the lower cost launch  capability, DOD will have to continue to fund research beyond the $15.6  million already spent on advanced technology development, facilities, test- range and mission support, and program office support.", "To execute both its short- and long-term efforts, the Joint ORS Office will  also need to gain cooperation and consensus from a diverse array of  officials and organizations. These include science and technology  organizations, the acquisition community, the U.S. Strategic Command, the  intelligence community, and industry. We have previously reported on  difficulties DOD has encountered in bringing these organizations together,  particularly when it comes to setting requirements for new acquisitions  and transitioning technologies from the science and technology  community to acquisition programs. As a new and relatively small  organization, the Joint ORS Office may well find it does not have the clout  to gain cooperation and consensus on what short- and long-term projects  should get the highest priority.", "Despite the significant expectations placed on the Joint ORS Office and  the challenges it faces, DOD does not have an investment plan to guide its  ORS decisions. DOD has begun to develop an ORS strategy that is to  identify the investments needed to achieve future capabilities. However,  the strategy is not intended to become a formalized investment plan that  would (1) help DOD identify how to achieve these capabilities, (2)  prioritize funding, and (3) identify and implement mechanisms to enforce  the plan. At the same time, there are other science and technology projects  in DOD\u2019s overall space portfolio competing for the same resources,  including those focused on discovering and developing technologies and  materials that could enhance U.S. superiority in space.
