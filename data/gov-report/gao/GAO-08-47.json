Beneficiaries, their appointed representatives, or physicians can ask sponsors to cover prescriptions restricted under their plan--a process known as a coverage determination--and can appeal denials to the sponsor and the independent review entity (IRE). GAO was asked to review (1) the processes for sponsors' coverage determination decisions and the approval rates, (2) the processes for appealing coverage denials and the approval rates at the sponsor and IRE levels, and (3) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) efforts to inform the public about sponsors' performance and oversee sponsors' processes. GAO visited seven sponsors that account for over half of Part D enrollment. GAO also interviewed and obtained data from CMS and IRE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Sponsors in our study address coverage requests for drugs with restrictions using processes that allow for prompt decisions, apply a range of criteria, and have resulted in approvals of most cases. To minimize the amount of time needed to make a determination, study sponsors use automated systems to compare the patient information they receive from prescribing physicians against preset coverage criteria. The coverage criteria for specific drugs incorporate Medicare requirements--such as whether the drug use is excluded from coverage under Medicare Part D--and discretionary components--such as whether a less expensive alternative drug has been tried and failed. Some study sponsors indicated they feel pressure to make decisions within the CMS-required time frames even when all pertinent patient information from physicians is not at hand. In reviewing a sample of 421 case files, GAO found that overall, study sponsors approved about 67 percent of the coverage determination requests, ranging from 57 percent to 76 percent. The process for conducting appeals allows staff not involved in the previous case review to make better-informed decisions by considering additional supporting evidence. At the first level of appeal, sponsor staff evaluate any corrected or augmented evidence to see if coverage criteria have been met. At the second level of appeal, IRE staff consider the information the sponsor reviewed, along with any additional support that may be available. In many cases, appeals result in new interpretations of whether the requested drug should be covered. CMS appeals data show that, from July 2006 through December 2006, the median approval rate across all Part D sponsors was 40 percent; from July 2006 through June 2007, appeals to the IRE received full or partial approval in 28 percent of cases. For some standard appeals, missing appointment of representative (AOR) documentation contributed to delays in sponsor-level appeals decisions and dismissals of IRE appeals cases. Some study sponsors have developed \"workarounds\" to eliminate the need for the completed AOR form. CMS has improved its efforts to inform beneficiaries about sponsors' performance, but its oversight of sponsors is hindered by poorly defined reporting requirements. CMS developed two performance metrics on sponsors' timeliness and the outcomes of their coverage decisions. The agency improved the way it displays this information on the Medicare Web site in late 2007. In addition, CMS requires that sponsors report data on various measures of coverage requests and approvals. However, the agency has provided minimal guidance on the types of cases to be included in each coverage determination measure. As a result, our study sponsors reported data differently to CMS, hindering the agency's ability to adequately monitor sponsors' activities. Finally, CMS has conducted several audits and found that sponsors were noncompliant with a number of specific requirements. Areas of sponsor noncompliance ranged from incomplete written policies and procedures to delays in authorizing drug coverage after the IRE approved an urgent request."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established a voluntary outpatient drug benefit, known as  Medicare Part D, that provides prescription drug coverage for nearly   25 million beneficiaries\u2014seniors and individuals with disabilities\u2014 enrolled in the program. Beneficiaries may obtain the drug benefit, which  began on January 1, 2006, by enrolling in plans offered by Part D  sponsors\u2014private companies, such as health insurance companies and  pharmacy benefit managers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers the Medicare program\u2014is  responsible for contracting with and overseeing the sponsors that provide  the drug benefit. Among its many functions, the agency is responsible for  monitoring sponsor compliance with program rules and publicly reporting  information on certain aspects of sponsor performance.", "The MMA and CMS\u2019s implementing regulations established specific  requirements for Part D sponsors. Sponsors\u2019 formularies\u2014lists of plan- covered drugs\u2014must include \u201call or substantially all\u201d drugs within six  designated drug categories: antidepressants, antipsychotics,  anticonvulsants, anticancer drugs, immunosuppressants, and HIV/AIDS  drugs. For each of the other therapeutic drug categories and classes,  sponsors\u2019 formularies generally must include at least two Part D drugs.  However, formularies generally cannot include drugs or their uses that the  MMA excluded from Medicare Part D coverage. In addition, MMA  promotes the use of generic drugs, which are generally cheaper than most  brand-name drugs. The MMA states that a Part D sponsor must require a  pharmacy to inform a beneficiary of any differential between the price of a  drug and the price of its lowest-priced generic version.", "Beyond the minimum formulary requirements, the MMA gives sponsors  discretion in designing their formularies to keep costs low. Because Part D  plan sponsors share financial risk with the Medicare program, they have  an incentive to control beneficiaries\u2019 drug spending. To do so, sponsors  negotiate discounted prices with drug manufacturers and design their  formularies to encourage the use of cost-saving prescription drugs. As long  as they meet the minimum formulary requirements, sponsors may exclude  particular drugs from their formularies. For drugs included on the  formulary, sponsors may assign drugs to tiers that correspond to different  levels of cost sharing. In general, they encourage the use of generic  medications by putting them on a cost-sharing tier that requires the lowest  out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries and discourage the use of expensive  drugs by putting them on tiers that require higher out-of-pocket spending  by beneficiaries. A national survey of noninstitutionalized seniors  conducted in the fall of 2006 found that 25.7 percent of beneficiaries  reported switching to a cheaper medication after they enrolled in a Part D  plan.", "Sponsors can also lower drug spending by applying various utilization  management restrictions to drugs on their formularies. Utilization  management restrictions typically include (a) prior authorization, which  requires the beneficiary to obtain the sponsor\u2019s approval before a drug is  covered for that individual; (b) quantity limits, which restrict the dosage or  number of units of a drug provided within a certain period of time; and   (c) step therapy, which requires that a beneficiary try lower-cost drugs  before a sponsor will cover a more costly drug.", "Beneficiaries who attempt to fill a prescription for a nonformulary drug or  a restricted formulary drug will have coverage withheld unless the  beneficiary receives special permission from the plan sponsor. In a 2006  national survey of seniors, 11.3 percent of respondents reported needing  special permission to get a prescription filled. When coverage is withheld,  CMS regulations require that pharmacies inform beneficiaries of their right  to make a formal request to their plan for coverage\u2014a process known as a  coverage determination. Beneficiaries, their appointed representatives, or  prescribing physicians can use the coverage determination process to  demonstrate that the sponsor\u2019s coverage criteria have been met or that an  exception to the formulary, cost-sharing requirements, or utilization  restrictions should be granted based on the medical needs of the  beneficiary. Beneficiaries who receive an unfavorable coverage  determination may appeal the decision, first to the sponsor\u2014a process  known as a redetermination\u2014and then to an independent review entity  (IRE)\u2014a process known as a reconsideration.", "As a beneficiary protection, MMA and CMS regulations require that  sponsors have procedures in place to make coverage determination and  appeal decisions in a timely manner. CMS established priority levels for  coverage determinations and appeal requests as either standard or  expedited (for requests thought to be urgent, based on the beneficiary\u2019s or  physician\u2019s judgment). Prescribing physicians may initiate coverage  determinations and expedited redeterminations on behalf of a beneficiary  without permission from the beneficiary, but to initiate a standard appeal  on a beneficiary\u2019s behalf, they must have a completed appointment of  representative (AOR) form. Sponsors must make standard coverage  determination decisions within 72 hours and expedited coverage  determination decisions within 24 hours. Decisions at the redetermination  level must be made within 7 days for a standard request and within   72 hours for an expedited request. If the sponsor fails to notify the  beneficiary of its decision within the established time frames, the decision  is deemed an automatic denial, at which point the sponsor must forward  the case to the IRE. At the reconsideration level\u2014the second level of  appeal\u2014the IRE has 7 days to decide a standard request and 72 hours for  an expedited request. (See app. I for an illustration of the coverage  determination and appeals levels and time frames.)", "Questions have been raised about how coverage determination and  appeals processes work to safeguard beneficiaries\u2019 access to the Part D- covered drugs they need. Little is known about how decisions are made,  the outcomes of coverage requests, and how CMS oversees sponsors\u2019  coverage determination and appeals processes. You asked us to review  Part D coverage determination and appeals processes at the sponsor and  IRE levels. This report provides information on (1) the processes for  sponsors\u2019 coverage determination decisions and the approval rates, (2) the  processes for appealing coverage denials and the coverage approval rates  at the sponsor and IRE levels, and (3) CMS\u2019s efforts to inform beneficiaries  about sponsors\u2019 performance and to oversee sponsors\u2019 coverage  determination and appeals processes.", "To review the processes for sponsors\u2019 coverage determination decisions  and approval rates, we conducted site visits to seven sponsors offering  Part D plans in 2006, and interviewed officials about how coverage  determinations are made. The seven sponsors were chosen because they  varied on a number of measures, including size of enrollment and their  market presence across the country. As of September 1, 2006, the seven  sponsors we interviewed enrolled about 13 million beneficiaries, about   54 percent of all Part D enrollees. In addition, at each sponsor we  reviewed a randomly selected sample of coverage determination case files  from October 2006 to verify the information sponsor officials told us. In  total, we reviewed 421 coverage determination case files\u2014at least 34 from  each sponsor. Information from these sponsors is illustrative and cannot  be generalized to the entire sponsor community. We also reviewed  relevant documents, including the MMA and Part D implementing  regulations, to understand sponsor requirements. Also, we obtained the  views of beneficiary advocates and physician association representatives  about the Part D coverage determination process. Physician association  representatives included both general and specialty practitioners.", "To examine appeals processes, we interviewed management staff from the  seven selected sponsors and the IRE about their policies and procedures.", "We reviewed randomly selected samples of October 2006 appeals case  files at each sponsor and the IRE to verify information obtained from our  interviews. In total, we reviewed 458 redetermination case files\u2014at least  43 from each sponsor\u2014and 100 reconsideration case files. To learn about  coverage approval decisions at the redetermination level, we analyzed  data reported by sponsors to CMS on the number of redeterminations  made from July 2006 through December 2006. To assess the reliability of  these sponsor-reported data, we interviewed CMS officials responsible for  the collection and analysis of the data, and we reviewed the CMS data  reporting requirements for redeterminations. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report. To learn about  coverage approval decisions at the reconsideration level, we analyzed IRE  workload data reported to CMS, including data on the results of IRE  decision making. To assess the reliability of the IRE data, we conducted  interviews with IRE staff to learn about how the data are compiled. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "To determine how CMS informs beneficiaries about sponsors\u2019  performance, we examined information posted on the Medicare  Prescription Drug Plan Finder tool and discussed planned changes to the  Web site with CMS officials. To determine how CMS oversees the coverage  determination and appeals processes, we interviewed agency officials  responsible for policy development and oversight of the Part D program.  We also examined data CMS collected to monitor sponsors\u2019 activities and  compared the reporting practices of our study sponsors. Finally, we  reviewed CMS\u2019s compliance audit reports.", "In conducting our work, we did not examine how beneficiaries are  informed about their rights to request a coverage determination, or the  appropriateness of sponsors\u2019 coverage criteria or coverage decisions. In  addition, we did not examine the extent to which beneficiaries use the  coverage determination process because the CMS data needed to do so  were inadequate.

As of September 2007, CMS had  contracts with 101 PDPs and 461 MA-PDs. The majority of Part D  enrollees, about 71 percent, are in PDPs.

The restrictions may also serve to ensure that proper dosages are  dispensed, to protect against adverse drug interactions, and to control the  use of medications with potential for abuse. Each sponsor has discretion  to decide under which circumstances it will apply utilization restrictions.", "Research conducted for The Kaiser Family Foundation has shown that  sponsors\u2019 use of formularies and utilization management restrictions  varies significantly. The study reported that the 2007 formularies of the   10 largest PDPs differed in their coverage of a sample of commonly used  drugs and their use of utilization management restrictions on those drugs.  Four PDPs included on their formulary all of the 152 sampled drugs  commonly used by Medicare beneficiaries. Among the remaining 6 PDPs,   1 covered between 90 and 100 percent, and 5 covered between 70 and   80 percent of the sampled drugs. The authors also found that the 10 PDPs  placed prior authorization requirements on between 3 and 14 of the   152 sampled drugs.

To  collect the patient information needed to make coverage determination  decisions, study sponsors generally rely on drug-specific request forms.  These forms typically ask a series of questions based on the sponsor\u2019s  established coverage criteria for a given drug. Prescribing physicians are  asked to use these forms to submit clinical information about a beneficiary  that generally includes the diagnosis associated with the requested drug,  and may include the beneficiary\u2019s other medical conditions and drug  history. For instance, to process a coverage determination request for the  osteoporosis drug Forteo, a sponsor may ask whether the beneficiary has  a diagnosis of osteoporosis, has multiple risk factors for fractures, and has  tried and failed other specific osteoporosis therapies. Some study  sponsors had dozens of different forms for drugs in different classes, with  a varying number of questions. For example, one sponsor asked   5 questions for the sleep medications Ambien and Lunesta and 23  questions for the injectible drug Pegasys, used to treat hepatitis. If a  physician makes a coverage determination request over the phone,  sponsor staff have on-line access to the drug-specific questions they need  to ask.", "With the information submitted by the prescribing physician, study  sponsors used computer algorithms\u2014a series of questions with yes/no  answers\u2014in order to make expeditious, consistent decisions. Technical  staff, such as pharmacy technicians or call center representatives, enter  the patient information into the computer system. The algorithms are used  to assess the information to determine whether the beneficiary meets the  sponsor\u2019s coverage criteria for the specific drug in question. This process  generates rapid, consistent decisions if sponsors receive sufficient  information from prescribing physicians. When the technical staff cannot  approve the drug, coverage determination requests are forwarded for a  decision by clinical staff with more expertise, such as staff pharmacists.  One sponsor reported that, on average, a standard coverage determination  involving prior authorization takes about 40 minutes after the prescribing  physician provides the needed information.", "However, the pressure to make a coverage determination within the CMS- mandated time frames increased the likelihood that sponsors may deny  requests when complete information is not at hand or can not be obtained  quickly. Two study sponsors told us that if they were not successful in  getting information they requested, they made decisions based on the  information they had at the time. For example, if physicians are asked to  provide a patient\u2019s medical records as part of their request but do not  provide that information quickly, the sponsor may deny the request in  order to meet the required time frame. Among the coverage determination  case files we reviewed at the study sponsors, the sponsor requested  additional information from the physician in about 13 percent of the cases  and about 30 percent of the denials were for lack of requested medical  information. One sponsor noted that there would probably be fewer  denials at the coverage determination stage if sponsors had more time to  acquire needed information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sponsors Apply a Range of Coverage Criteria in Making Coverage Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Sponsors apply a range of coverage criteria to evaluate requests for drugs  with restrictions. Their criteria are used, in part, to determine whether a  requested drug can be covered under Part D program rules set by MMA or  CMS. Sponsors consider a number of factors in reviewing a request,  including the following:    Should the drug be covered under another part of the Medicare  program? There are an estimated 6,000 unique drug products that  potentially could be covered under either Part B or Part D of the Medicare  program. Which part of the Medicare program is the appropriate payer  depends on factors such as the patient\u2019s diagnosis, when the beneficiary is  taking the drug, or the setting in which the drug is being administered. For  instance, immunosuppressive drugs suppress the body\u2019s immune response  and are used to treat autoimmune diseases\u2014diseases in which the body  attacks its own tissues\u2014and to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ.  Immunosuppressives are covered by Part B when the physician prescribes  them after a Medicare-covered organ transplant and by Part D for all other  outpatient uses.", "Is the requested drug in a Part D-excluded drug class? Although  sponsors generally can not cover drugs in 1 of 10 statutorily excluded drug  categories, beneficiaries or prescribing physicians may request a coverage  determination for a drug that is in an excluded drug category. For such  coverage determinations, the physician must show that the drug is  prescribed for a purpose that is not excluded under the law or that it has  been mistakenly classified by the sponsor as excluded. For instance,  medications for coughs and colds are generally excluded from Part D.  However, CMS has issued guidance to plan sponsors that cough and cold  medications are eligible to meet the definition of a Part D drug in clinically  relevant situations. For example, if a physician prescribes a cough  suppressant to a beneficiary because the beneficiary has osteoporosis and  may break a bone if the cough is not controlled, then the cough  suppressant would be considered a Part D-covered drug.", "Is the requested drug medically necessary? Part D sponsors must  approve coverage when the requested drug at the requested dosage is  medically necessary. In order to show medical necessity, the prescribing  physician must provide a statement that the requested drug is medically  necessary because (1) all of the covered Part D drugs on the sponsor\u2019s  formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective  for the beneficiary, would have adverse effects for the beneficiary, or both;  (2) the prescription drug alternatives on the formulary have been  ineffective in the past, are likely to be ineffective, or are likely to cause an  adverse reaction for the beneficiary; or (3) the number of doses available  under a quantity limit for a requested drug has been ineffective or is likely  to be ineffective. In addition, sponsors are required to approve a tiering  exception if they agree with the prescribing physician\u2019s statement that  treatment of the beneficiary\u2019s condition using the preferred alternative  drug would not be as effective for the beneficiary as the requested drug,  would have adverse effects for the beneficiary, or both.", "Is the requested drug being prescribed for a medically accepted  indication? Under Medicare Part D, a drug is considered to be prescribed  for a medically accepted indication if the drug is FDA-approved for that  use. Any off-label use\u2014one not approved by FDA\u2014is considered  medically accepted only if it is supported by a citation in one of the three  designated drug reference guides. Beneficiary advocates have argued that  the coverage restrictions on those off-label drug uses not listed in the  designated drug reference guides cause beneficiaries to be denied  coverage for needed drugs, some of which beneficiaries had been  previously taking successfully. For instance, a beneficiary without cancer  may have a condition which causes severe pain. After trying several  medications, the beneficiary may have less pain with the use of Actiq, a  medication approved only for breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Under  Part D, the beneficiary would be denied coverage for the drug, even if the  beneficiary\u2019s physician stated that the medication was medically  necessary, because the drug was not prescribed for a medically accepted  indication, and this use is not listed in one of the three drug reference  guides.", "Beyond ensuring compliance with MMA and CMS coverage rules, sponsors  have discretion to develop their own drug-specific coverage criteria.  Sponsors in our study also considered the following factors.", "Has the beneficiary tried and failed on a generic or preferred  alternative drug? To reduce costs, sponsors may require beneficiaries to  try and fail on generic or preferred alternative drugs before approving  coverage for higher-cost drugs. Sponsors told us, and CMS has affirmed,  that beneficiaries generally can switch to a therapeutically equivalent drug  without disruption to their care. Therefore, although a beneficiary has  been stable on a particular drug for a period of time, sponsors may require  the beneficiary to switch to a generic or preferred alternative drug.", "Has the physician conducted specific tests to confirm the  beneficiary\u2019s diagnosis or condition? Study sponsors sometimes also  ask for information from specified tests or studies that document a  patient\u2019s diagnosis or condition. For instance, one sponsor told us that it  requires genotype tests for hepatitis drugs because the length of time a  patient should be on the drug is determined by the genotype.", "Is the beneficiary already stable on the requested drug? Sponsors  may consider whether the beneficiary is stable on the requested drug  when deciding whether to approve or reapprove coverage.", "Does the beneficiary have other medical conditions or take other  medications that may contraindicate the use of the requested  drug? For instance, one sponsor\u2019s criteria for the drug Actiq\u2014used to  treat breakthrough cancer pain\u2014stipulated that the enrollee must not  have severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which are  contraindications to Actiq. This same sponsor\u2019s criteria for the  antidepressant Ensam noted that the medication should not be approved if  the enrollee is taking other types of antidepressants, such as monoamine  oxidose inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.", "Duration of the approval period depends upon the drug requested and on  plan policies. In general, sponsors told us they approve coverage of a  requested drug for either the duration of the year or a 12-month period.  Some sponsors also approve requests for as long as the beneficiary  remains enrolled in the plan in cases where the drug treats an illness that  can last for the duration of a person\u2019s life (such as multiple sclerosis). All  sponsors said that certain drugs, such as those with a specified length of  treatment for safety reasons, may be approved for shorter time periods.  For example, some injectible drugs are approved for 24 weeks. If coverage  criteria are not met, study sponsors\u2019 denial letters generally included the  reason for the decision. For instance, denial notices may state that the  requested drug was not covered because the preferred alternative drug  must be tried first. Some, but not all, sponsors that we visited sent  notification letters to prescribing physicians that identified which  preferred drug should be tried.

For example, one sponsor told us it treats all  physician appeals as expedited, regardless of the priority level indicated  by the physician. Our review of a sample of sponsors\u2019 case files showed  that 26 percent of redetermination requests were classified as expedited  compared to 4 percent of the coverage determination case files we  reviewed. Although expediting requests precludes the need for an AOR  form, one sponsor stated that because these requests may not be truly  urgent, it may not be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest for the appeal to be  rushed.

CMS officials told us that the agency selected these two  performance metrics, in part, because beneficiaries could interpret their  meaning easily. CMS includes the two metrics in information made  available to the public on the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Finder\u2014a  Web site designed to help beneficiaries compare drug plans.", "CMS account managers\u2014staff responsible for overseeing sponsors\u2019  performance\u2014review sponsors\u2019 scores on these performance metrics to  monitor how well their coverage determination and appeals processes are  operating. Sponsors with the highest rates of cases forwarded  automatically to the IRE and the lowest percentages of cases in which the  IRE agreed with their decisions are viewed as problematic. When a  sponsor is identified as an outlier, the assigned account manager contacts  the sponsor to discuss its coverage determination and appeal procedures  and works with the sponsor to identify ways to improve its performance,  such as conducting additional training sessions.", "Both the IRE and the sponsors in our study noted certain limitations in the  data underlying each of these metrics. The number of automatically  forwarded cases used for the timeliness metric may understate sponsors\u2019  timeliness. According to IRE officials, some sponsors have forwarded  cases to the IRE believing they had exceeded the required decision time  frames when they had not. According to the officials, these sponsors  automatically forwarded cases when they had not yet received a signed  AOR form or a physician statement to support a coverage request. In such  cases, the required time frames have not yet expired and the IRE returns  the case to the sponsor for processing. Because these sponsors  automatically fowarded cases to the IRE inappropriately, their rates of  missed time frames are higher than they should be.", "Another limitation is that the performance metric on the IRE\u2019s  concurrence with sponsors\u2019 decisions can be misleading. In discussing this  measure with the sponsors in our study, one sponsor commented that a  low rate of IRE agreement with their decisions implies, unfairly, that the  sponsor\u2019s decisions were flawed. They contend that the IRE often receives  additional supporting evidence that results in an overturn, as we found by  interviewing IRE officials. They state that had they received the same  information within their time frame for processing the case, they may have  approved the request. In their view, a low percentage of cases in which the  IRE agrees with the sponsor\u2019s decisions does not necessarily mean that  the sponsor was not performing well. However, a CMS official asserted  that sponsors are responsible for collecting all the information needed to  adjudicate a request in the time allotted and are accountable if they do not  obtain the same information available to the IRE.", "CMS uses these performance metrics to inform beneficiaries of sponsors\u2019  performance and to encourage poor performing sponsors to do better. In  an effort to improve the information shared with beneficiaries for the 2008  open enrollment period, the agency changed the manner in which it  calculates and displays these metrics\u2014using a star designation system.  For the 2007 open enrollment period, CMS used 2006 data from the IRE to  rank order sponsors\u2019 rates, classify sponsors into groups based on  sponsors\u2019 relative performance, and assign a star designation to each  group. For example, CMS chose to assign three stars, indicating very  good performance, to 90 percent of sponsors for each metric. The next   5 percent of sponsors were assigned two stars, indicating acceptable  performance, while the remaining sponsors were given one star, indicating  poor performance.", "By setting the star designations using relative comparisons rather than  defined benchmarks for different levels of performance, CMS implied that  those sponsors receiving the most stars had superior performance while  those with fewer stars were not meeting a CMS-set standard. The  clustering of 90 percent of sponsors in the three-star designation could  have been misinterpreted by beneficiaries as identifying those sponsors  with superior performance when, in fact, by definition, 90 percent of  sponsors received three stars. Moreover, the performance of sponsors in  the top category varied significantly. For example, among the 26 PDP  sponsors receiving three stars, the percentage of cases where the IRE  concurred with sponsors\u2019 redetermination decisions ranged from 39 to   75 percent. At the same time, the remaining categories were quite  compressed. A relatively small difference in rates could have placed a  sponsor in the lowest category rather than the highest category. CMS  designated an IRE concurrence rate of 39 percent to be very good  performance, but a 36 percent rate as acceptable performance, and   34 percent as poor performance.", "Recognizing the value of comparing sponsor performance against absolute  standards (benchmarks), CMS changed its star designation system in time  for the 2008 open enrollment period. For the performance metric on IRE  concurrence, the agency now assigns sponsors to one of five star  categories using fixed benchmarks rather than a percentile ranking.   Table 2 shows how sponsors are assigned to different performance  categories for the metric on IRE concurrence. For example, under the new  designation system, only those sponsors with IRE concurrence rates better  than 95 percent receive five stars, indicating excellent performance. Also,  stars are only displayed for sponsors that have at least five appeals cases  reviewed by the IRE.", "For the 2008 open enrollment period, CMS expanded its star designation  system for the timeliness metric from three stars to five stars. Although it  retained the relative ranking approach, CMS more evenly distributed the  sponsors across the star categories. For example, whereas previously CMS  assigned the top 90 percent of sponsors\u2014those with the lowest rates of  cases forwarded to the IRE because of missed time frames\u2014the highest  rating, the agency now assigns the highest rating to the top 15 percent of  sponsors. Previously, CMS assigned 5 percent of sponsors the lowest  rating, but now it assigns the lowest rating to 15 percent of the sponsors.  The remaining sponsors are distributed more evenly across the two-,  three-, and four-star designations. CMS continues to include among the top  performing sponsors those with no cases forwarded to the IRE due to  missed time frames.

In contrast, another sponsor in our study  reported in the nonformulary drug category requests for drugs that it  inadvertently did not include when designing its open formulary.", "We identified two sponsors that double counted the number of requested  and approved tiering exceptions by reporting them in two different  measures.
