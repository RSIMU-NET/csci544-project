Internal supervisory controls include the processes established by management to help ensure that procedures applicable to staff are performed completely, consistent with applicable policies and procedures, and remain current. The overall control framework is generally consistent with federal internal control standards, which includes identifying and assessing risks, identifying and assessing internal controls, and reporting the results of testing to management and Congress.", "As part of developing and applying an internal supervisory control framework, the offices each identified internal supervisory controls to mitigate risks that could undermine their ability to consistently and competently carry out their responsibilities. These internal supervisory controls are built into the offices' work processes--that is, the processes they use to carry out examinations, financial securities filing reviews, and investigations--and range from specific supervisory review and approval activities to management reports used to monitor the processes as a whole. For example, within Enforcement, supervisors must review and approve staff recommendations that a tip, complaint, or referral be closed without further investigation. Many of the offices' internal supervisory controls existed prior to the development of SEC's internal supervisory control framework; others were developed through the process of developing the framework.", "GAO identified deficiencies in about half of the 60 internal supervisory controls it tested. Specifically, GAO found that for 27 internal supervisory controls (1) the description of the control activity did not accurately reflect policy or practice; (2) documentation demonstrating execution of the control was not complete, clear, or consistent; or (3) the controls lacked clearly defined control activities. These control deficiencies may not prevent management from detecting whether the activities of the offices are conducted completely and in accordance with policy. However, similarities in the nature of deficiencies across all three offices suggest that management attention to the design and operation of internal supervisory controls is warranted. Federal internal control standards state that control activities should enable effective operation and have clear, readily available documentation. The offices have addressed or have been taking steps to address all of the 27 identified deficiencies. Some steps have been taken based on the offices' section 961 assessments. SEC addressed other deficiencies during GAO's review after discussions with GAO detailing the identified deficiency. Not enough time has passed for GAO to assess the effectiveness of these changes. Ensuring that all internal supervisory controls have clearly defined activities and clear, readily available documentation demonstrating execution of the control would provide SEC management with better assurance that policies were being executed as intended and strengthen SEC's internal supervisory control framework."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that controls are properly designed and operating effectively, SEC should make certain that existing internal supervisory controls and any developed in the future have clearly defined activities and clear and readily available documentation demonstrating execution of the activities.

SEC typically identifies potential violations of securities law  and brings hundreds of civil enforcement actions against individuals and  companies each year. However, the failure of the agency to detect high- profile cases of fraud in recent years\u2014such as the multi-billion dollar  fraud committed by Bernard Madoff Investment Securities, LLC\u2014has  caused some members of Congress and SEC\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG) to question SEC\u2019s ability to identify and stop financial  fraud.

Before 2010, the offices annually  assessed and provided assurance statements on the adequacy of their  internal controls to comply with requirements of FMFIA and OMB Circular  No. A-123; however, according to SEC officials, these assessments  generally focused on controls affecting SEC\u2019s financial statements and  information technology. In response to section 961 of the Dodd-Frank  Act, senior officers and staff from OCIE, Corporation Finance, and  Enforcement and the Offices of the Chief Accountant, General Counsel  and Executive Director formed the 961 Working Group (Working Group)  to coordinate the annual assessment and certification. This group also  worked to coordinate the section 961 assessments with agencywide  efforts to comply with FMFIA internal control requirements. The Working  Group included senior-level managers who also were tasked with leading  their office\u2019s 961 annual assessment efforts.

Staff discussed  risks to their respective programs and how existing controls addressed  those risks. For example, OCIE staff discussed a key risk of examinations  being conducted in a manner inconsistent with policies and procedures  due to a gap in its processes for organizing and updating policies and  procedures. OCIE staff described the development of the new  governance structure and how it addresses this gap. Division  management and senior officer involvement in the establishment of the  internal supervisory control framework and in-depth understanding of a  program\u2019s internal supervisory control framework, risks, and the design  and implementation of a plan to mitigate risks reflect the control  environment standard, which states that management should establish  and maintain an environment throughout the organization that sets a  positive and supportive attitude toward internal control and conscientious  management.", "As they worked to develop the internal supervisory control framework, the  Working Group used GAO\u2019s standards, guidance in OMB Circular No. A- 123, and the Commission\u2019s own internal control guidance to public  companies. To guide the design of the framework and internal  supervisory controls assessment process, the Working Group identified  three key principles\u2014(1) control systems and assessments should be  designed to provide a reasonable assurance of effectiveness, (2)  management should rely on its judgment, and (3) management should  make judgments based on risk and its own knowledge and expertise to  implement an efficient and effective evaluation process. The Working  Group also developed key definitions and criteria to better coordinate the  offices\u2019 approach for determining the scope and required evidence  needed to support management\u2019s evaluation and certification as required  under section 961. For example, the group defined \u201cinternal supervisory  control\u201d to assist each office in scoping its assessment and established  criteria for determining if a control evaluation finding rose to the level of a  \u201cdeficiency\u201d or \u201csignificant deficiency,\u201d which is consistent with generally  accepted government auditing standards. The resulting internal  supervisory control framework generally reflects federal internal control  standards. Specifically, SEC\u2019s internal supervisory control framework  includes the following elements:  Identifying and assessing risks. Under SEC\u2019s framework, each office  must conduct an annual risk assessment. Consistent with the risk  assessment standard of internal control, each office\u2019s risk assessment  includes processes for identifying and assessing key risks. To implement  this process, each office assigned a small group, led by the managing  executive or other senior officer, the task of identifying what they believed  to be the key risks.", "GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1, and OMB, Circular No A-123: Management\u2019s Responsibility for  The Working Group defines a key risk to be a risk that in the office\u2019s informed judgment  carries significant inherent risk to its ability to consistently conduct examinations,  investigations, or reviews with professional competence and integrity. from MorganFranklin in conducting its 961 reviews for fiscal years 2011  and 2012. These small groups then evaluated the \u201cinherent risk\u201d  associated with each key risk based on their judgment of the likelihood of  the risk occurring and the severity of impact if it were to occur. Based on  this evaluation, each risk was assigned a rating. For example, for each  identified risk in fiscal year 2011, Corporation Finance rated the likelihood  of the risk occurring using a three-level system (low, medium, or high). It  similarly rated each identified risk\u2019s impact. The group then used a three- by-three matrix to arrive at an overall risk rating.", "Identifying key internal controls that address the risks. For each key  risk, the small groups identified corresponding key controls, including  internal supervisory controls, used to address the risks. For example,  OCIE requires examination reports and workpapers to be reviewed and  approved by management at the end of every examination. This helps to  ensure that applicable rules and regulations are reviewed and  examinations are consistently performed. The key risks and controls are  documented in a risk-assessment tool called a risk and control matrix  and, according to SEC staff, vetted by other managers and senior officials  within each respective office, and approved by each office\u2019s director.  Specific controls implemented by each office are discussed in more detail  later in this report.", "Assessing the operating effectiveness of internal controls. In  developing SEC\u2019s framework, the Working Group incorporated the  required 961 annual assessments. Consistent with the internal control  standard for monitoring, the assessments provide the Commission and  management with annual evaluations of the design and operating  effectiveness of each office\u2019s internal supervisory controls. According to  the Working Group, each office has the discretion to determine the  methodology, including level of evidence and frequency, for testing each  control that would provide management with reasonable assurance of the  control\u2019s effectiveness. Furthermore, the Working Group also consulted  with SEC\u2019s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation and used  GAO\u2019s Financial Audit Manual for assistance in determining the  appropriate sample sizes, and the acceptable number of errors for a  particular sample size and for pulling random samples. Each office  designated an assessment team to carry out the testing and took steps to  maintain the objectivity of the testing. For example, Corporation Finance\u2019s  senior assessment team segregated testing duties so that an associate  director would not be involved in selecting samples or testing the work of  the offices that he or she oversees. According to staff, the fiscal year  2011 assessment was the first year for which control testing was  conducted under section 961. On the basis of our review of each office\u2019s  assessment procedures and documentation of assessment findings for  fiscal year 2011, each used accepted methods such as inquiry,  observation, inspection, and direct testing.", "In fiscal year 2012, the director of OCR began signing the certification document.", "961(c) requires the office director to certify that, among other things, he or  she has evaluated the effectiveness of the internal supervisory controls  during the 90-day period ending on the final day of the fiscal year to which  the report relates and disclosed to the Commission any significant  deficiencies in the design or operation of internal supervisory controls that  could adversely affect the ability of the office to consistently conduct  inspections, investigations, or financial securities filing reviews with  professional competence and integrity. Reporting assessment results  constitutes a significant part of an overall internal control framework and  reflects the information and communication and monitoring components  of internal control standards.", "In fiscal year 2012, the Working Group took additional steps to improve  the overall internal supervisory control framework and 961 assessment  processes. Notably, the group adopted a single set of procedures for  conducting the annual assessments for all of the offices. In fiscal year  2011, each office used similar but separate processes for conducting its  assessment. The fiscal year 2012 procedures maintain a risk-assessment  methodology that continues the offices\u2019 focus on identifying key risks, but  differs in that it establishes a common scale for assessing the likelihood  and impact of key risks. The fiscal year 2012 procedures also provide a  common definition of key controls and information on how to identify  them; allow for each office to design an appropriate control evaluation  strategy; provide guidance\u2014developed in consultation with economists  from the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation\u2014for  conducting statistical testing of internal supervisory controls; and  incorporate additional control testing guidance similar to that set forth in  our Financial Audit Manual.

According to OCOO staff, in  fiscal year 2012, they periodically reviewed the offices\u2019 documentation of  risks and controls, consulted with the offices to help address any  challenges or questions, and helped staff use an electronic tool that  assists in the identification of key risks and controls. This tool also  captures control descriptions and data on control evaluation results and  provides information to office management in a standardized format.  Additionally, OCOO staff assisted OCIE and Enforcement with identifying  potential gaps in risks and controls. OCOO staff and MorganFranklin also  provided staff from each of the three offices with additional training on  how to identify and evaluate risks and controls. For example, training  materials outline specific questions to ask when evaluating the design of  new or established controls such as (1) how often the control activity was  completed, (2) how the control was documented, and (3) the purpose of  the documentation. Such training can help to improve future 961  assessments, specifically the evaluation of a control\u2019s design to help  ensure it includes clear and specific implementing procedures.

For example,  TRENDS replaces paper-based scope memorandums and examination  reports with on-line \u201cworking scope\u201d and \u201cexamination summary\u201d  screens.", "In TRENDS, each examination workbook has three phases (prefieldwork,  fieldwork, and postfieldwork). At the completion of the prefieldwork and  postfieldwork phases, examination staff electronically submit the  examination workbook for management approval. Supervisors then can  approve the workbook or return it to the staff for corrections or additional  work. When staff receives a satisfactory registrant response to the  examination summary letter, supervisors then perform a final approval by  closing the examination. These approvals correspond to the internal  supervisory control activities described earlier. TRENDS also contains  built-in workflows and checklists that help ensure staff complete certain  steps before an examination moves to the next phase and automatic  notifications that alert supervisors of pending reviews. TRENDS also  allows staff to search associated or previously closed examinations and  track the status of deficiencies, and will be used to collect examination  program performance information and statistics. began a phased-in implementation of TRENDS. According to OCIE, by  September 30, 2013, all OCIE examination programs will use the system  for newly initiated examinations.", "Staff access rights to TRENDS examination information are based on the staff  member\u2019s role in specific examinations. In general, staff only may access examinations to  which they are assigned and work on those portions of the examination to which they  have been assigned.

All staff can open, in a read-only format, any closed examinations in  TRENDS. meeting described above, and where feasible, the examination exit  interview or conference call. According to staff, these meetings further  enable supervisors to obtain the operating information necessary to  determine if an examination team is meeting its objectives.", "OCIE also established standing meetings to discuss broader examination  program information. For instance, OCIE holds monthly videoconferences  with staff to provide updates on policies or procedures, share information  on current examination program events and trends, and provide staff with  the opportunity to raise issues with management. In addition, senior  officers in OCIE regional offices and headquarters conduct quarterly  meetings with the assistant directors and exam managers to review all  open examinations, and the NEP senior management meets weekly to  discuss program performance and goal achievement. Furthermore, OCIE  management obtains pertinent information, through monthly performance  reports that are prepared by the Office of the Managing Executive. These  reports contain key performance measures, such as the percentage of  enforcement investigations resulting from examination referrals and the  percentage of firms receiving examination summary letters that take  corrective action in response to all examination findings. Finally, OCIE  management monitors examination information to help ensure the office  meets the statutory requirement that examinations be completed within  the later of 180 days of the end of fieldwork or the date on which the last  document was received from the registrant.", "OCIE also implemented a number of controls consistent with federal  internal control standards for monitoring. In addition to the 961 annual  assessments, supervisory oversight of examinations, and management  review of regular reports and the meetings, OCIE hired a senior  specialized examiner to develop a compliance program within its Office of  Chief Counsel. Since then, a compliance group has been formed and  three additional permanent staff positions have been added to the group.  The group periodically tests a random sample of examinations from each  NEP office to evaluate for compliance with documented procedures and  make recommendations for improvement. According to staff, this group is  empowered to select what to evaluate (and when) and reports to the  Chief Counsel. As of March 5, 2013, the Office of Chief Counsel was in  the process of filling a recently created assistant director position to lead  OCIE\u2019s compliance group. Since its creation, the group has completed six  separate evaluations and, according to staff, has two additional  evaluations ongoing.", "Moreover, OCIE established policies and procedures for responding to  OCIE recommendations from GAO and SEC OIG audits.

We found that about half (33 controls)  were effectively designed and generally operating as intended. However,  the other half had deficiencies in design or operating effectiveness.  Specifically, for almost half (27) of the controls in our sample (1)  descriptions of the control activity did not accurately reflect policy or  practice; (2) documentation demonstrating the controls\u2019 execution was not  complete, clear, or consistent; or (3) the controls lacked clearly defined  control activities. These control deficiencies may not prevent  management from detecting whether the activities of the offices are  conducted completely and in accordance with policy. However, the  deficiencies were similar in nature across all three offices and made  testing the controls difficult. Without clearly defined control activities and  consistent, readily accessible documentation, management and others  (including external auditors) may not be able to determine whether the  supervisory controls were being appropriately applied and whether they  were effective in achieving their intended outcomes.

Six controls in our sample were difficult to review because the control  description, as stated in the fiscal year 2011 risk and control matrix, did  not accurately reflect the policy or practice in place during the audit period  (see table 2). For example, one of the controls implemented by  Enforcement stated that OMI was responsible for providing training on  TCR system policies and procedures. However, when questioning  Enforcement officials about this control, the officials said that OMI does  not maintain documentation of TCR training because it is provided on an  informal, as-needed basis and that attendance records are maintained by  a different SEC office. Enforcement updated its fiscal year 2012 risk and  control matrix to reflect the SEC office responsible for implementing the  control. Similarly, an OCIE control described supervisors\u2019 use of control  sheets to conduct the review of examination workpapers; however, we  found that OCIE policy did not require the use of control sheets during the  audit period. As OCIE continues to implement TRENDS, all supervisory  reviews and approvals of examination control sheets or similar  workpapers will be captured electronically. In March 2013, OCIE officials  updated the risk and control matrix to better align the control description  with current policy.", "Second, for some controls the documentation demonstrating execution of  the control was not complete, clear, or consistent. For nine controls in our  sample, the underlying documentation to support execution of the control  was inconsistent, unclear, or missing (see table 3). For example,  management reviews of OCIE examination reports were documented in  different ways, conducted by different levels of management, and found in  different locations in the examination file. As of April 2013, OCIE officials  stated that they addressed or were addressing deficiencies in all of these  controls. In another example, Enforcement\u2019s documentation of  supervisory review of case progress on a quarterly basis was not  consistent and in a few instances lacked evidence demonstrating that the  review took place. Specifically, we requested all checksheets from our  audit period, a total of 168, used by supervisors to document their  quarterly case reviews and found that the checksheets were not  maintained in a manner readily available for review.  As a result, we  worked with Enforcement officials to select a sample of 65 checksheets to  review. Upon review, we found that the practices for documenting  supervisory review were inconsistent and made our review challenging.   For example, in some checksheets, supervisors signed the checksheet  and also initialed next to each individual case listed on the checksheet.", "On other checksheets, supervisors signed the checksheet and either did  not initial next to individual cases at all or only initialed next to select  cases. Enforcement officials said that communication through standing  meetings with assistant directors and executive management, rather than  supervisory signatures, provided officials with confidence that the  quarterly case reviews were taking place. To increase consistency in how  the quarterly review sheets are executed, Enforcement officials provided  guidance to its senior officers communicating that supervisors must sign  the checksheet and that this signature will indicate that all matters on the  checksheet have been reviewed.", "Finally, some controls lacked clearly defined control activities.  Specifically, 12 controls in our sample were difficult to test because they  were not designed to enable the control to operate effectively (see table  4). For example, Corporation Finance\u2019s policy requires a review of all  Securities Act initial public offerings and initial Exchange Act registrations  unless an associate director determines otherwise; however, we found  that the division lacked specific procedures by which an associate director  could indicate and document this decision.
