In fiscal years 1993 to 2001, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded approximately $4.5 billion in HOPE VI revitalization grants. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban\\ Affairs, asked GAO to examine HUD's process for assessing grant applications, the status of work at sites for which grants have been awarded, and HUD's oversight of HOPE VI grants."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["HUD has generally used the same core rating factors to assess HOPE VI grant applications--need, capacity, quality, and leveraging. However, HUD has, over time, increased the requirements that housing authorities must meet for each of these factors in order to make better selection decisions. Although authorities' historical program performance had been considered under various rating factors, it was not until fiscal year 2002 that past performance became a threshold requirement that an applicant must meet to be eligible for a grant. The status of work at HOPE VI sites varies greatly, with construction complete at 15 of the 165 sites. As of December 31, 2002, grantees had completed 27 percent of the total planned units and spent approximately $2.1 of the $4.5 billion in HOPE VI revitalization funds awarded. However, the majority of grantees have not met their grant agreement deadlines. For example, the time allowed for construction has expired for 42 grants, yet grantees completed construction within the deadline on only 3 grants. Several factors affect the status of work at HOPE VI sites, including the development approach used and changes made to revitalization plans. HUD's oversight of HOPE VI grants has been inconsistent, due partly to staffing limitations and confusion about the role of field offices. Both headquarters and field office staff are responsible for overseeing HOPE VI grants. However, HUD field offices have not systematically performed required annual reviews. Additionally, despite grantees' inability to meet key deadlines, HUD has no formal enforcement policies. Instead, the agency determines if action should be taken against a grantee on a case-by-case basis. Although HUD has declared 9 grants to be in default and issued warnings regarding 3 grants, it has not done so for other grants in a similar situation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, some of the nation\u2019s public housing sites have exemplified  urban decay. In 1992, the National Commission on Severely Distressed  Public Housing reported that approximately 86,000, or 6 percent, of the  nation\u2019s public housing units were severely distressed\u2014characterized by  physical deterioration and uninhabitable living conditions, high levels of  poverty, inadequate and fragmented services, institutional abandonment,  and location in neighborhoods often as blighted as the sites themselves. In  an effort to address these long-standing problems in a new way, Congress,  in October 1992, established the Urban Revitalization Demonstration  Program, commonly known as HOPE VI, which is administered by the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The program  provides grants to public housing authorities to rehabilitate or rebuild  severely distressed public housing and improve the lives of public housing  residents through supportive services, such as child care and job training.  In fiscal years 1993 to 2001, HUD awarded approximately $4.5 billion in  HOPE VI revitalization grants to 98 public housing authorities (grantees)  for 165 sites.", "While each HOPE VI project is unique, all projects generally involve (1) the  preparation of a comprehensive revitalization plan; (2) relocation of the  original residents; (3) demolition of the distressed public housing units; (4)  construction of new public housing units, often intermingled with other  types of housing, or rehabilitation of existing public housing units; (5)  \u201creoccupancy,\u201d or the movement of some original residents to completed  units; and (6) occupancy, or the filling of all of the completed housing units.  To select housing authorities for participation in HOPE VI, HUD publishes  an annual notice of funding availability (NOFA) setting forth the program\u2019s  current requirements and available funds. Housing authorities then prepare  applications from which HUD selects those that best satisfy the NOFA  requirements and signs grant agreements that serve as contracts with the  housing authorities. Grant agreements specify the activities and  documentation, such as revitalization plans, that grantees must complete  as well as key deadlines that they must meet. Grantees that HUD  determines are in default of grant agreement terms are subject to various  sanctions, including having their remaining HOPE VI funds rescinded.", "You requested that we comprehensively review the HOPE VI program.  Because of the scope of the request, we agreed with your office to provide  the information in a series of reports. The first report, issued in November  2002, discussed the financing of HOPE VI sites.  This second report  focuses on HUD\u2019s management of the HOPE VI program. Specifically, as  agreed with your office, this report examines (1) HUD\u2019s process for  assessing HOPE VI revitalization grant applications and selecting grantees,  (2) the status of work at sites for which grants have been awarded and  compliance with grant agreement deadlines, (3) HUD\u2019s oversight of HOPE  VI grants, and (4) the amount of program funds that HUD has budgeted for  technical assistance and the types of technical assistance it has provided.", "To address these objectives, we first obtained and analyzed information  from HUD\u2019s HOPE VI reporting system on the 165 revitalization grants  awarded through fiscal year 2001, including production data and key  milestones. We assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  information about the system and performing electronic testing to detect  obvious errors in completeness and reasonableness. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. Second,  we visited the 18 housing authorities that were awarded revitalization  grants in fiscal year 1996. We selected 1996 because it was the first year  that grants were subject to a standard construction deadline, and the  deadline had passed for the majority of the grants by the time we began our  site visits. In addition, we interviewed the HUD headquarters officials  responsible for administering the program.", "We performed our work from November 2001 to April 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I  provides additional details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Housing Act of 1937, as amended, Congress created the federal  public housing program to help communities provide housing for low- income families. Congress annually appropriates funds for the program,  and HUD allocates these funds to the approximately 3,400 public housing  authorities nationwide. Housing authorities are typically created under  state law, and a locally appointed board of commissioners approves their  decisions. HUD and the housing authorities have an annual contributions  contract\u2014a written contract under which HUD agrees to make payments  to the housing authority and the housing authority agrees to administer the  housing program in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements. In  addition to competitively awarded HOPE VI grants, HUD provides housing  authorities with several types of assistance, including operating subsidies  to cover the difference between rent payments and operating expenses and  capital funds to improve the physical condition of properties and upgrade  the management and operation of existing public housing sites.", "HOPE VI is one of the few active federal housing production programs. By  providing funds for a combination of capital improvements and community  and supportive services, HOPE VI seeks to (1) improve the living  environment for public housing residents of severely distressed public  housing through the demolition, rehabilitation, reconfiguration, or  replacement of obsolete public housing; (2) revitalize sites on which such  public housing is located and contribute to the improvement of the  surrounding neighborhood; (3) provide housing that will avoid or decrease  the concentration of very low-income families; and (4) build sustainable communities.  With the 165 grants awarded through fiscal year 2001,  grantees planned, as of December 31, 2002, to demolish 78,265 public  housing units and construct or rehabilitate 85,327 units, including 44,757  public housing units.", "HUD\u2019s requirements for HOPE VI revitalization grants are laid out in each  fiscal year\u2019s NOFA and grant agreement.  NOFAs announce the availability  of funds and contain application requirements, threshold requirements,  rating factors, and the application selection process.  Grant agreements,  which change each fiscal year, are executed between each grantee and  HUD and specify the activities, key deadlines, and documentation that  grantees must meet or complete. For example, the fiscal year 2001 grant  agreement specified that the grantee must complete construction within 54  months of the date on which the grant agreement was executed.", "From fiscal years 1993 to 2001, HUD received 609 revitalization grant  applications.  HUD uses the same basic procedures each year to screen,  review, and rank grant applications. When grant applications are received,  they are screened to determine whether they meet the eligibility and  threshold requirements in the NOFA. Next, reviewers rate the grant  applications on the basis of the rating factors described in the NOFA and  rank them in score order. Generally, a group of applications representing  twice the amount of funds available is sent to a final review panel, which  may include the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Housing  Investments, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, and  other senior HUD staff. The final review panel assigns a final score and  recommends for selection the most highly rated competitive applications,  subject to the amount of available funding. For a list of the 165 grants  awarded through fiscal year 2001, see appendix II.", "Public housing authorities with revitalization grants can use a variety of  other public and private funds to develop their HOPE VI sites. Public  funding can come from federal, state, and local sources. For example,  housing authorities can use funds raised through federal low-income  housing tax credits. Under this program, states are authorized to allocate  federal tax credits as an incentive to the private sector to develop rental  housing for low-income households.  Private sources can include  mortgage financing and financial or in-kind contributions from nonprofit  organizations. Developing public housing with a combination of public and  private financing sources is known as mixed-finance development.", "HUD\u2019s Office of Public Housing Investments, housed within the Office of  Public and Indian Housing, manages the HOPE VI program. Grant  managers within the Office of Public Housing Investments are primarily  responsible for overseeing HOPE VI grants. They approve changes to the  revitalization plan and coordinate the review of the community and  supportive services plan that each grantee submits.  In addition, grant  managers track the status of grants by analyzing data on the following key  activities:  relocation of original residents, demolition of distressed units,  new construction or rehabilitation, reoccupancy by some original  residents, and occupancy of completed units. Public and Indian Housing  staff located in HUD field offices also play a role in overseeing HOPE VI  grants, including coordinating and reviewing construction inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Uses Core Factors to Assess Applications but Has Not Consistently Followed Its Selection Procedures", "paragraphs": ["According to our analysis, HUD has generally used a core of four rating  factors as the basis for assessing HOPE VI revitalization grant applications.  Although HUD\u2019s fundamental factors have remained the same, the  requirements that housing authorities must fulfill under each factor have  become more stringent from year to year. Additionally, until the most  recent NOFA, HUD had not eliminated applicants on the basis of poor  performance on previously awarded grants. HUD\u2019s Inspector General also  has reported that HUD has not consistently followed its selection  procedures that are established for each annual assessment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Although HUD Generally Uses the Same Core Factors to Assess Applications, Applicants Must Now Meet More Stringent Requirements", "paragraphs": ["HUD has generally evaluated applications for HOPE VI revitalization grants  on the basis of four core rating factors. Although other factors have been  added and removed over time and the names of the factors have varied  somewhat throughout the years, four key concepts\u2014need, capacity,  quality, and leveraging\u2014have been used consistently to assess  applications.  As defined in the most recent NOFA, need should indicate  the severity of distress at the targeted public housing site. Information  provided under capacity is used to assess the experience of the applicant\u2019s  team in planning, implementing, and managing comparable physical  development, financing, leveraging, and partnership activities.  HUD  determines quality by evaluating the overall quality of the plan, the  likelihood of success, project readiness, and design. Finally, information  provided under leveraging is used to assess the extent to which funds will  be leveraged for physical development and community and supportive  services, what other revitalization activities have been carried out in the  targeted area in anticipation of the HOPE VI grant, and if there are physical  development activities under way that will enhance the new HOPE VI site.  For more information on the most recent NOFA, see appendix III.", "Although the core factors have remained the same, the information that  housing authorities must submit and the requirements that they must fulfill  under each factor have generally increased over time (see fig. 1). For  example, although housing authorities have been required to provide basic  statistics, such as crime and vacancy rates, to document severe distress or  need since fiscal year 1993, housing authorities also were required,  beginning in fiscal year 1999, to submit a certification from an independent  engineer that the public housing targeted for revitalization met HUD  criteria for severe distress. Since fiscal year 1993, applicants also were  required to provide information on their own capacity to implement their  plans. But, beginning in fiscal year 1997, housing authorities also were  required to document the ability of their proposed partners to develop,  construct, and manage the proposed activities. To receive the maximum  amount of points for the quality rating factor in fiscal year 1996, applicants  were required to submit several pieces of information, including budgets, a  certification that the proposed activities could not be completed without  HOPE VI funding, and a description of how the housing authority planned  to maintain the proposed programs and policies over the long term. By  fiscal year 2002, housing authorities additionally had to submit  documentation that the revitalization plan would result in outside  investment in the surrounding community and evidence that, if funded,  work could commence immediately. To indicate that they could leverage  funds, housing authorities were encouraged to submit evidence of outreach  and support for the project in fiscal year 1995. However, by fiscal year 2000,  applicants had to show that they would obtain at least $4 in leveraged funds  for every HOPE VI dollar requested for development in order to receive the  maximum amount of points under leveraging.", "According to HOPE VI officials, HUD has increased the types and quantity  of information required each year in an effort to obtain information that  makes it easier to rate and rank applications and allows the agency to make  improved selection decisions. In addition, the agency has made some  changes in an effort to make the application process easier for housing  authorities. Finally, HOPE VI officials noted that the program\u2019s annual  appropriation legislation can change the requirements each year and that  the NOFAs must be revised to reflect these changes.", "Although the changes have given HUD better information upon which to  base selection decisions, some of the housing authority and public housing  industry group officials that we interviewed expressed concerns about the  changes in the application requirements that housing authorities must  meet. According to these officials, such changes make it difficult for  housing authorities to anticipate what HUD intends to emphasize and to  make detailed revitalization plans until each NOFA is published. The  officials also noted that it is challenging for previously denied applicants to  determine how to revise their applications. Housing authorities and  interest groups report that it generally costs $75,000 to $250,000 to prepare  a HOPE VI grant application. The fiscal year 2002 NOFA was of particular  concern to some of the housing authority officials and industry group  representatives that we interviewed. According to these officials, the NOFA  required housing authorities to conduct impractical up-front planning and  to obtain commitments at an unrealistically early date. For example, an  applicant had to certify that it had procured a developer for the first phase  of construction by the application due date. Officials we interviewed stated  that this requirement would be costly to the applicant, who at that point  would have no guarantee of funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Until Fiscal Year 2002, HUD Did Not Declare Applicants Ineligible because of Past Performance", "paragraphs": ["Although HUD\u2019s annual selection process had considered the performance  of applicants who had received HOPE VI grants in prior years, it was not  until the fiscal year 2002 NOFA that past program performance became a  mandatory threshold requirement for an applicant to be eligible for a HOPE  VI revitalization grant. Incorporating past performance\u2014specifically, the  demonstrated ability to efficiently manage projects\u2014can help direct HOPE  VI funds to where they can most effectively produce results.", "Starting in fiscal year 1995, an applicant\u2019s score for capacity was partially  based on the extent to which any previously awarded HOPE VI grants had  progressed. In fiscal years 1993, 1996, and 1997, applicants were also  required, under the capacity factor, to submit Public Housing Management  Assessment Program scores, which were a measure of a housing  authority\u2019s performance in all major areas of management operations. HUD  stopped requiring this information in fiscal year 1998, after the Public  Housing Management Assessment Program was discontinued.  The fiscal  year 2002 NOFA was the first that stated that an applicant with one or more  existing HOPE VI revitalization grants would be disqualified if one or more  of those grants failed to meet certain performance requirements as  required in the applicable HOPE VI revitalization grant agreement.", "During the years that past performance was a rating factor\u2014rather than a  threshold eligibility requirement\u2014multiple HOPE VI revitalization grants  were awarded to housing authorities that had made little progress in  constructing new units under previous grants. For example, the Chicago  Housing Authority was awarded grants in fiscal years 1998, 2000, and 2001,  although construction, as of December 31, 2002, was 21 percent complete  at the Cabrini-Green site (fiscal year 1994 grant); 26 percent complete at  the Robert Taylor B site (fiscal year 1996 grant); 27 percent complete at the  ABLA Brooks Extension site (fiscal year 1996 grant); and 0 percent  complete at the Henry Horner site (fiscal year 1996 grant). Similarly, the  Detroit Housing Commission has received three grants and constructed 25  percent of the units planned.", "In a June 2002 report to Congress, HUD acknowledged that it has done  little to rectify the problems among low performers and has often awarded  poorly performing housing authorities multiple grants despite low or no  unit production, inadequate oversight, and capacity issues.  HUD also  acknowledged that awarding multiple grants to poor performers further  strains the institutional and staff capacity of these public housing  authorities, intensifying existing problems. Finally, HUD noted that it had  initially awarded grants to large housing authorities for large-scale  developments, without fully recognizing that most of the grantees included  at-risk and troubled public housing authorities.  Some of these large  housing authorities were awarded multiple revitalization grants, and the  burden of managing the grants resulted in slow planning, redevelopment,  and construction.", "According to HUD, it elevated the importance of past performance in the  fiscal year 2002 NOFA because it wanted to emphasize accountability and  readiness. It determined that applicants that already had one or more  HOPE VI revitalization grants should demonstrate the capability to manage  them before HUD awarded them more funds. It also concluded that poor  performers should not be rewarded with additional funding when other  housing authorities possibly could implement the grants better."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Not Consistently Followed Its Grant Selection Procedures", "paragraphs": ["In annual reviews of the HOPE VI grant selection process, HUD\u2019s Inspector  General has found that the agency has not consistently followed its grant  selection procedures for each year. For example, in an audit of the fiscal  year 1996 grant award process, the Inspector General found that HUD  revised its screening procedures to allow applicants to comply with only  one of the two eligibility criteria in the NOFA.  Under the revised  screening procedures, HUD awarded $269 million to applicants that should  have been ineligible for funding because they did not demonstrate  compliance with the two criteria as specified in the NOFA. Similarly, when  HUD encountered a defect in a fiscal year 1996 application, often the  reviewers resolved the defect in a manner that improved the applicant\u2019s  application but did not always comply with the NOFA procedures for  resolving application defects. The Inspector General concluded that, as a  result, some applications that should have been ineligible for funding were  inappropriately funded.", "Similarly, the Inspector General also has found that in both fiscal years  1998 and 1999 HUD did not fully or consistently implement key application  review procedures.  Specifically, the final review panel, and to a lesser  degree the initial reviewers, did not always document their justifications  for scoring and rating individual applications. For example, in its fiscal year  1998 audit, the Inspector General reviewed 24 applications and identified 6  on which the final review panel changed preliminary scores without  providing adequate documentation or justification to support all the  changes. The scoring changes resulted in 5 of the applicants obtaining  funding and 1 losing funding. In its fiscal year 1999 audit, the Inspector  General reviewed 25 applications and found that HUD\u2019s final review panel  had changed scores for 6 applications without providing adequate  documentation or justification. The scoring changes resulted in 5 of the  applicants obtaining funding.", "In response to these and other Inspector General criticisms of the HOPE VI  grant selection process, HOPE VI officials told us that they follow their  review procedures to the best of their ability, given the time constraints of  the annual competition. Although the Inspector General generally has  about 4 months to review the previous year\u2019s applications, HOPE VI  officials noted that they have shorter time frames\u2014generally, 6 weeks.  HUD officials also stated that they have made efforts to address the  Inspector General\u2019s concerns, including efforts to better screen  applications. In its report on the fiscal year 1999 HOPE VI competition, the  Inspector General determined that HUD had addressed issues in its fiscal  year 1998 review, relating to the need to ensure that (1) each rejected  applicant would be provided specific written notification as to why the  application was not successful and (2) all evaluations were based on the  facts presented in the applications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Status of Work Varies Greatly, and Most Grantees Have Not Met Grant Agreement Deadlines", "paragraphs": ["The status of work at HOPE VI sites varies, with construction completed at  15 of the 165 sites that received revitalization grants through fiscal year  2001.

The fiscal year  1993 grantees took an average of 31 months after execution of grant  agreements to start construction. The fiscal year 1994 grantees took an  average of 41 months.  However, the 14 grantees awarded grants in fiscal  year 1999 that have started construction did so an average of 16 months  after grant agreement execution. Furthermore, the 9 fiscal year 2000  grantees that have started construction did so, on average, 10 months after  grant agreement execution.  According to HUD, there are several possible  reasons for this improvement, which include that the later grantees may  have more capacity than the earlier grantees, the applications submitted in  later years were more fully developed to satisfy NOFA criteria, and HUD  has placed greater emphasis on reporting and accountability.", "Overall, grantees have expended about $2.1 of the $4.5 billion (47 percent)  in HOPE VI revitalization funds awarded.

The dates included planned  completion of the revitalization plan, planned completion of a mixed- finance proposal, planned start of construction, and planned completion of  construction. Prior to this decision, grantees had been allowed to adjust  their planned dates when delays occurred, making it difficult for HUD to  determine the extent of delays. In its fiscal year 2002 NOFA, HUD also  stressed project readiness. For example, the NOFA required applicants to  provide a certification stating either that they had procured a developer for  the first phase of development by the application due date or that they  would act as their own developer. Similarly, applicants that proposed off- site replacement housing were required to submit evidence of control of  the proposed off-site locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Affect Work Status", "paragraphs": ["Our visits to the sites that were awarded revitalization grants in 1996 show  that many factors\u2014including the development approach, housing authority  management, and relationships with residents and the community\u2014can  affect the status of work at a site. In its June 2002 report to Congress, HUD  stated that a mixed-finance development approach might cause delays  because housing authorities often lack staff with expertise in development  and complex financing approaches. They must hire additional staff or  outside consultants proficient in private-sector real estate construction,  financing, and lending practices to put together financing and retain  developers. For example, the redevelopment of Dalton Village in Charlotte,  North Carolina, was delayed about 1 year due to the denial of its initial  application for low-income housing tax credits. In addition, the Housing  Authority of New Orleans decided to use tax increment financing to raise  additional funds for its St. Thomas site.  It took more than 2 years for the  housing authority to get all of the approvals necessary. In contrast, the  Chester Housing Authority was able to complete construction at Lamokin  Village within 5 years of grant execution because it used only public  housing funds, which did not require them to acquire additional expertise.", "Other aspects of the development approach, such as the type and location  of planned revitalization efforts, also can affect status. For example,  rehabilitation of existing buildings tends to take less time than construction  of new ones. As of December 31, 2002, over half of the HOPE VI units  scheduled for rehabilitation had been completed, while less than a quarter  of the new planned units had been constructed. The Cuyahoga  Metropolitan Housing Authority\u2019s fiscal year 1996 grant involves both  rehabilitation of existing units and construction of new units. As of April  2003, rehabilitation of 56 units was under way, whereas the construction of  new units was not scheduled to begin until October 2004. Also, on-site  construction tends to occur faster than off-site construction. As of  December 31, 2002, 29 percent of on-site construction was complete, while  19 percent of off-site construction was complete. Grantees planning for off- site construction sometimes have to purchase the property or properties on  which the units will be built. For example, the Housing Authority of the  City of Pittsburgh plans to acquire numerous parcels of land in the  community surrounding the Bedford Additions site and construct new off- site units prior to beginning construction on-site. Because acquiring the  sites is taking longer than anticipated, the housing authority has yet to  relocate residents and demolish the original site. For more examples of  how development approaches can affect work status, see appendix IV.", "The extent to which revitalization plans were changed during the course of  redevelopment also affects work status. The Housing Authority of the City  of Atlanta\u2019s original application for a fiscal year 1996 HOPE VI grant  outlined a plan for 100 percent public housing at the Perry Homes site. Two  years after the grant award, HUD conducted a site visit and determined that  the site should include a wide range of units, including market-rate units.  Due to these changes, a revitalization plan was not approved until October  2002. The Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority changed the plans for  its Riverview site due to environmental problems. In contrast, the Housing  Authority of Louisville, another fiscal year 1996 grantee, has not had to  make any significant modifications to its revitalization plan for Cotter and  Lang Homes, and over 60 percent of the 1,213 planned units were complete  as of December 31, 2002.", "Several grantees we visited stated that the performance of housing  authority management staff affected the status of their revitalization plans.  For example, residents in Jacksonville and housing authority staff in  Spartanburg stated that their fiscal year 1996 grants had progressed  significantly, in part, because the executive director communicated well  with residents, the housing authority board, and local community leaders.  In contrast, the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority was  experiencing internal problems at the time its fiscal year 1996 grant was  awarded. Its executive director was ultimately convicted for theft of public  funds, mail fraud, and lying about a loan. A new executive director was  hired in late 1998, and the housing authority was finally able to focus on the  fiscal year 1996 HOPE VI grant in 1999, according to housing authority  officials. In Detroit, the revitalization plans for Herman Gardens changed  multiple times because there were several changes in executive leadership  and each executive director had a different plan for the site. Because the  Detroit Housing Commission had not submitted a formal revitalization plan  for Herman Gardens, HUD notified the commission in March 2000 and  March 2002 that it was in default of its grant agreement.", "The extent of support from residents and the local community also can  affect the timing of progress at HOPE VI sites. For example, the Tucson  Community Services Department, which serves as the city\u2019s public housing  authority, worked closely with its residents and the local community during  the planning process for its fiscal year 1996 grant. Tucson did not submit its  revitalization plan until a majority of the residents had approved it. In  contrast, resident or community opposition delayed progress at several of  the sites we visited. For instance, the Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s plans for  Henry Horner Homes were delayed 4 years by legal actions related to a  resident lawsuit. Residents at San Francisco\u2019s North Beach site did not  want to relocate from the site during the redevelopment, which caused the  redevelopment to take longer than it would have otherwise. Because the  Housing Authority of New Orleans\u2019s St. Thomas site is located in a historic  district, local preservationists opposed the construction of a retail store at  the site. In July 2002, a nonprofit organization filed a lawsuit against the  housing authority for failing to comply with environmental and historic  preservation laws. The case was dismissed in April 2003. See appendix IV  for more information on each of the 20 sites we visited.", "HUD\u2019s approval process can also affect the status of work at HOPE VI sites.  Officials responsible for managing 12 of the 20 grants awarded in fiscal year  1996 told us that HUD\u2019s approval process for key documents, such as the  revitalization plan and mixed-finance proposals, was too slow. However,  according to a HUD report, the agency\u2019s approval process has been  improving. For instance, HUD\u2019s data show the average number of days  from the submission of a mixed-finance proposal to approval was 185 days  for the fiscal year 1996 grantees.

The field offices also are responsible for  performing an annual on-site monitoring visit to each HOPE VI grant.

As shown in figure 5, grant manager workload has been  increasing since HUD last hired a large group of grant managers in 1998,  but the workload remains below the previous level. As of fiscal year 2001,  each grant manager was responsible for an average of about 6 grants  totaling about $157 million in HOPE VI funding. In its June 2002 report to  Congress, HUD stated that one factor contributing to delays at HOPE VI  sites was limited HUD grant managers. Similarly, some of the grantees we  visited stated that they believe grant manager workload contributed to the  slow approval process previously discussed in this report.", "HUD reports that HOPE VI oversight also has been affected by a shortage  of field office staff and confusion about the role of field offices. Our site  visits showed that HUD field staff are not systematically performing the  required annual reviews. Of the 20 revitalization grants awarded in fiscal  year 1996, 8 had never had an annual review performed as of the end of  2002, and no grant had had an annual review performed each year since the  grant award. Overall, only one in five of the required annual reviews were  performed. However, the annual reviews that were performed did contain  important findings. For example, several of the annual reviews performed  for the fiscal year 1996 grantees noted that housing authorities were not  following procurement policies and lacked proper documentation of  resident relocations.", "From our interviews with field office managers, we determined that there  are two reasons why annual reviews were not performed. First, many of the  field office managers we interviewed stated that they simply did not have  enough staff to get more involved in overseeing HOPE VI grants. For  example, one field office manager told us that, because of staffing  constraints, his office did not perform any HOPE VI oversight. Second,  some field offices did not seem to understand their role in HOPE VI  oversight. For instance, one office thought that the annual reviews were  primarily the responsibility of the grant managers. Others stated that they  had not performed the reviews because construction had not yet started at  the sites in their jurisdiction or because they did not think they had the  authority to monitor grants.", "The HUD Inspector General and the agency itself have reported that  staffing shortages, particularly in the field, have resulted in a lack of  program oversight. In a 1998 review of the HOPE VI program, the Inspector  General stated that HUD had not been performing even the minimal  monitoring requirements for the HOPE VI program in part due to  understaffing in both headquarters and the field offices.  As noted in that  report, lack of monitoring led to grant implementation problems remaining  unresolved. In addition, HUD\u2019s most significant workforce planning activity  to date\u2014its Resource Estimation Allocation Process (REAP)\u2014cited  staffing shortages related to the HOPE VI program. Under REAP, HUD  systematically estimated the number of employees needed to do its work,  on the basis of current workload and operations. The final resource  estimation report, which was issued in April 2001, noted that the Office of  Public and Indian Housing needed to add approximately 38 full-time  employees in the field to conduct tasks such as monitoring and providing  assistance to HOPE VI grantees.  The report also concluded that the  Office of Public Housing Investments should more clearly articulate its  own role and the role of field offices in the oversight of HOPE VI grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Lacks Clear Enforcement Policies and Has Not Always Enforced Grant Agreement Deadlines", "paragraphs": ["Although the majority of grantees have missed key deadlines, HUD has not  developed and provided to grantees an official HOPE VI enforcement  policy, according to program officials. Instead, the agency determines if  action should be taken against a grantee on a case-by-case basis. A clear  enforcement policy could provide grantees with more certainty regarding  the consequences of not meeting grant agreement deadlines. In a  December 1999 memorandum, HUD\u2019s Office of General Counsel noted that  no statutory or program provisions required grantees to expend HOPE VI  funds within a set period of time. Therefore, it concluded that HUD may  grant extensions to time frames established in the grant agreements, thus  avoiding the need to declare grantees that have missed deadlines to be in  default of their grant agreements.", "In the absence of a formal enforcement policy, HUD has outlined in general  terms its default policy in grant agreements. In each grant agreement, HUD  describes several occurrences that might constitute a default by the  grantee under the grant agreement, including a grantee\u2019s failure to comply  with the conditions and terms of its grant agreement. HUD provides written  notice of all defaults and gives the grantee 30 days to remedy the default or  to submit evidence to HUD that it is not in default. If the default cannot be  remedied within 30 days, grantees have an additional 60 days to rectify the  default situation. At that time, if the condition(s) noted in HUD\u2019s initial  letter to the grantee has not been resolved, HUD may require the grantee to  revise its program schedule, management plan, or program budget. HUD  also may restrict the grantee\u2019s authority to draw down grant funds or  require reimbursement by the grantee. HUD also reserves the right to  appoint a receiver to carry out HOPE VI activities, reduce the amount of  the grant award, or terminate the grant.", "According to HOPE VI officials, all grantees would have been considered in  default of their grant agreements at some point in their grant process if  HUD had not been flexible regarding time frames. For example, virtually all  of the fiscal year 1996 grantees were allowed an extension to the date  construction was to be completed, and some were allowed multiple  extensions. The Chicago Housing Authority\u2019s Henry Horner grant and the  Housing Authority of the City of Atlanta\u2019s Perry Homes grant received  extensions for the execution of a general contractor\u2019s agreement and for  the date construction was to be completed. In 2000, the Housing Authority  of the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s grant for Bedford Additions received an  extension until early 2003 to complete construction; in 2002, the authority  received an additional extension to complete construction by July 2007.", "Although HUD has not developed a formal enforcement policy, it has issued  default notices to grantees. It has generally issued these notices when there  is no evidence of a formal and comprehensive approach to the grantee\u2019s  revitalization effort. As of March 2003, HUD had declared nine grants to be  in default and issued warning notices regarding three other grants.  According to program officials, HUD expects to increase the use of the  default tool because a default letter tends to garner enough attention with  the local media and political leaders to prompt action. However, HUD has  never rescinded any HOPE VI funds, even when it has issued default letters.", "Because HUD does not have a formal enforcement policy, its issuance of  default notices can be viewed as arbitrary. For example, in July 2000, HUD  declared the Housing Authority of Baltimore City\u2019s fiscal year 1996 grant  for Hollander Ridge to be in default of its grant agreement on the basis of  \u201cfailure to comply with the HOPE VI requirements or any other Federal,  State or local laws, regulations or requirements applicable in implementing  the Revitalization Plan.\u201d  The default letter also noted that, because the  housing authority\u2019s revitalization plan was no longer consistent with the  requirements of a consent decree, the grant was deemed to be in default. In  March 2000 and March 2002, HUD declared the Detroit Housing  Commission\u2019s fiscal year 1996 grant for Herman Gardens to be in default  because the housing authority had not submitted a revitalization plan as  required in its grant agreement. However, HUD has not issued default  letters to other grantees who have not met grant agreement deadlines for  completing construction. For example, even though no units have been  completed at St. Thomas in New Orleans or Bedford Additions in  Pittsburgh and, according to grant agreement deadlines, construction was  to be completed by early 2002, neither fiscal year 1996 grant has been  declared in default."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Obligated the Majority of Funds Budgeted for Technical Assistance for Support to Grantees and HOPE VI Program Reporting", "paragraphs": ["HUD estimates that it has obligated about $51 million of the $63 million in  HOPE VI funds that have been set aside for technical assistance, with the  majority of this obligation funding services provided directly to grantees  and program reporting.

Of the $51 million that HUD estimates it has obligated to date, 55  percent has been obligated for technical assistance provided to grantees.  For example, HUD assigns each grant an outside technical assistance  provider to help the grantee develop its community and supportive services  plan. In fiscal years 1996 to 2000, HUD assigned each new grant an  expediter to assist the grantee with its HOPE VI plans. These expediters  were private-sector experts in finance, real estate development, and  community revitalization. Another major category of technical assistance  has been program reporting. According to HOPE VI officials, HUD spends  about $2.5 million annually on the HOPE VI reporting system. A contractor  maintains the reporting system and staffs a help desk to respond to  questions from grantees. The remaining technical assistance funding has  been obligated for headquarters management assistance, such as  consultants; site inspections performed by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers; and staff training and travel.", "In recent years, HUD has eliminated some services previously provided to  grantees.  For example, in fiscal year 2001, HUD stopped providing  expediters because, according to program officials, the practice had  become too expensive. Currently, only at-risk grantees\u2014grantees that are  experiencing problems with their grants or do not have adequate capacity  to manage their grants\u2014are considered for technical assistance. According  to HUD officials, HUD has decreased the amount of technical assistance it  provides because the agency believes that grantees should be responsible  for retaining and funding their own technical assistance.
