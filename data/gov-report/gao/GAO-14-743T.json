This type of gaming is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the  tribes. Class II gaming includes bingo, games similar to bingo, and certain  card games. Class III gaming includes all other types of games, including  slot machines, craps, and roulette.

The Commission maintains  its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and has seven regional offices and  three satellite offices and it has approximately 100 full-time employees.

According to Commission officials, this merger was deemed  necessary, in part, to better support the Commission\u2019s emphasis on  compliance assistance through its ACE initiative. These officials  explained that centralizing compliance, enforcement, and auditing staff  into one division improves communication among these staff and allows  the Commission to identify compliance issues early. Early identification of  compliance issues, in turn, allows the Commission to provide assistance  to tribes before an issue becomes more serious. In keeping with the ACE  initiative, Commission officials said they would prefer not to let  compliance issues reach the enforcement stage. We will continue to  collect information on the Commission\u2019s reorganization, and we will  present this information in our final report.", "Chairman Tester, Vice Chairman Barrasso, and members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
