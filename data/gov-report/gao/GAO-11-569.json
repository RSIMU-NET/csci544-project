Because of long-standing weaknesses in supply chain management, GAO has designated DOD supply chain management as a high-risk area and identified three focus areas for improvement--requirements forecasting, asset visibility, and materiel distribution. GAO reviewed the extent to which DOD has developed and implemented (1) corrective action plans that address challenges in the three focus areas, (2) an effective program for monitoring and validating the effectiveness and sustainability of supply chain management corrective actions, and (3) an ability to demonstrate supply chain management progress. GAO prepared this report to assist Congress in its oversight of DOD's supply chain management. GAO reviewed strategic and improvement plans, reviewed documents detailing the performance management framework, and assessed performance measures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has developed and begun to implement a corrective action plan for requirements forecasting, one of the three focus areas GAO identified as needing improvement in supply chain management. However, it does not have similar plans for the focus areas of asset visibility or materiel distribution. Such corrective action plans are critical to resolving weaknesses in these two areas. Such plans should (1) define root causes of problems, (2) identify effective solutions, and (3) provide for substantially completing corrective measures in the near-term, including steps necessary to implement solutions. DOD's Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan, issued in October 2010 in response to a statutory mandate, includes the elements necessary to serve as a corrective action plan for requirements forecasting. DOD's 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan, and other prior logistics-related plans, do not contain all of the elements needed to serve as corrective action plans for either asset visibility or materiel distribution, such as definition of problems or performance information to gauge progress in achieving outcomes. DOD outlined a performance management framework that is designed to provide guidance and oversight of logistics efforts, including supply chain improvement efforts. GAO's prior work has shown that in order for agencies to address challenges, they need to institute a program to monitor and validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective actions. The framework, as outlined in the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan, offers a new management tool that may enable DOD to manage performance in supply chain management. For example, it calls for an ongoing assessment and feedback process that could help to ensure that improvement efforts are effective. However, DOD has not included key elements for instituting its performance management framework, such as implementing guidance to affected stakeholders, a strategy to communicate results internally and to stakeholders such as Congress, or definition of the roles and responsibilities of senior logistics governance bodies and chief management officers. Until the framework is fully instituted, DOD may not be able to effectively use this new management tool to monitor the effectiveness of corrective actions. DOD and its components track many aspects of the supply chain; however, DOD does not have performance measures that assess the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain across the enterprise. In order to fully address challenges, agencies must be able to demonstrate progress achieved through corrective actions, which is possible through the reporting of performance measures. In the development of its inventory management improvement plan, a collaborative process was used to define existing and needed performance measures for requirements forecasting. A similar collaborative focus on developing enterprisewide performance measures for asset visibility and materiel distribution has not occurred. The department may have difficulty demonstrating progress until enterprisewide performance measures are developed and implemented in all three focus areas for improving its supply chain management."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop and implement corrective action plans and performance measures for asset visibility and materiel distribution and take steps to fully institute its performance management framework.

In short, DOD\u2019s goal and challenge are to deliver the  right items to the right place at the right time, and at the right cost. Supply  chain management encompasses the processes and systems for  accomplishing this goal, and many DOD organizations have important  roles and responsibilities, including the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, the military services, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), U.S.  Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), and the geographic combatant  commands. DOD\u2019s investment in its supply chains is substantial; DOD  estimated that overall spending on logistics, including supply chain  management, amounted to more than $210 billion in fiscal year 2010.", "Because of long-standing weaknesses in supply chain management, we  have designated DOD supply chain management as a high-risk area  needing management attention and improvement. We identified three  focus areas for improvement\u2014requirements forecasting, asset visibility,  and materiel distribution.  \uf0b7  Requirements forecasting. DOD defines requirements as the need or  demand for personnel, equipment, facilities, other resources, or  services in specified quantities for specific periods of time or at a  specified time. Accurately forecasted supply requirements are a key  first step in efficiently buying, storing, positioning, and shipping items  that the warfighter needs. Matching supply inventories to  requirements has been a continuing challenge for the department. As  a result, the services and DLA have had inventory levels that are  higher than needed to meet current requirements. DOD reported that  it manages more than 4 million secondary inventory items valued at  more than $91 billion as of September 2009. However, DOD reported  that $10.3 billion (11 percent) of its secondary inventory has been  designated as potential excess and categorized for potential reuse or  disposal. According to DOD, another $15.2 billion (17 percent) of its  secondary inventory exceeds the approved acquisition objective and  is being retained because it was determined to be more economical to  retain than to dispose of it or it might be needed in the future. Our  prior reviews of spare parts inventory management at DLA and the  Army, Navy, and Air Force found that problems with accurately  forecasting demand for spare parts were a major factor contributing to  mismatches between inventory levels and requirements.   \uf0b7  Asset visibility. DOD describes this focus area as the ability to provide  timely and accurate information on the location, quantity, condition,  movement, and status of supplies and the ability to act on that  information. Limitations in asset visibility make it difficult to obtain  timely and accurate information on the assets that are present in the  theater of operations. DOD faces asset visibility challenges due, in  part, to a lack of interoperability among information technology  systems, problems with the management of shipping containers, and  challenges in instituting new technologies for tracking assets.  \uf0b7  Materiel distribution. This focus area is the process for synchronizing  all elements of the logistics system to deliver needed supplies to  support the deployed warfighter. DOD has faced difficult distribution  challenges in Afghanistan due to limited cargo-processing and cargo- receiving capabilities, a lack of full visibility over supply and equipment  movements into and around Afghanistan, and a lack of coordination  and competing logistics priorities in a coalition environment, along  with several other challenges. During operations in Iraq, DOD faced  challenges in coordinating and consolidating distribution and supply  support, such as establishing an effective mechanism that would  enable a joint force commander to exercise appropriate command and  control over transportation and other logistics assets in the theater.  Such distribution and supply support challenges impeded the timely  delivery of supplies and contributed to shortages of items critical to  the warfighter.", "Under our criteria for removing a high-risk designation, agencies with  such programs must, among other things, develop and implement  detailed corrective action plans and have an effective approach for  managing performance, which includes a program to monitor and validate  the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective actions and the ability to  demonstrate progress. As we have discussed in prior reports and  testimonies, DOD has taken steps toward addressing supply chain  management weaknesses over the last several years and has made  some progress. In 2010, DOD issued its Logistics Strategic Plan, which  represents the department\u2019s most recent high-level strategy for continuing  to address supply chain management, as well as other logistics issues.", "This report addresses DOD\u2019s efforts to improve supply chain  management under its 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan. It was prepared  under the authority of the Comptroller General to conduct evaluations at  his own initiative and is being addressed to the committees of jurisdiction  and to others who have expressed interest in tracking DOD\u2019s efforts to  improve supply chain management. Specifically, this report addresses the  extent to which DOD has developed and implemented (1) corrective  action plans that address challenges in the three focus areas we  identified for improvement, (2) an effective program for monitoring and  validating the effectiveness and sustainability of supply chain  management corrective actions, and (3) an ability to demonstrate supply  chain management progress. The Related GAO Products section at the  end of this report provides additional information on our prior relevant  work.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has developed and implemented  corrective action plans that address high-risk challenges in the three  focus areas, we identified existing plans for logistics, supply chain  management, and the three focus areas. We assessed the extent to  which such plans provided a comprehensive, integrated strategy for  improving one or more of the focus areas and included the key elements  of a corrective action plan that we have previously identified. We also met  with officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Supply Chain Integration to determine the status of DOD\u2019s planning  efforts. To assess the extent to which DOD has an effective program for  monitoring and validating the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective  actions, we reviewed the performance management framework identified  in DOD\u2019s 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan. We reviewed the features of the  framework, its implementation status, and the extent the framework  included key elements as identified, for example, in results-oriented  management best practices. We also met with DOD officials to  understand the logistics governance processes and structure. To assess  the extent to which DOD has an ability to demonstrate supply chain  management progress, we reviewed performance measures discussed in  the Logistics Strategic Plan, as well as any existing or planned  performance measures for the three focus areas. As a basis for  evaluating these measures, we reviewed DOD policy, federal standards,  and our prior findings and recommendations on this issue. We also  reviewed ongoing performance measurement initiatives and met with  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military services  who are involved with those initiatives. We spoke with DOD officials,  including officials from various agencies and offices, to determine what  performance measures they tracked and monitored.

Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary  of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments are responsible  for, among other things, organizing, training, and equipping their forces.  Additionally, according to a DOD directive, each military department  Secretary is responsible for preparing and submitting budgets for their  respective department, justifying approved budget requests before  Congress, and administering the funds made available for maintaining,  equipping, and training their forces. Another important organization in  supply chain management is DLA, which purchases and provides nearly  all of the consumable items needed by the military, including a majority  of the spare parts needed to maintain weapon systems and other  equipment.", "During joint military operations, J-4 is the principal joint staff organization  responsible for integrating logistics planning and execution in support of  joint operations. In carrying out this responsibility, the J-4 relies on  various DOD components, including the military services, DLA, and  TRANSCOM, to provide the logistics resources and systems needed to  support U.S. forces. Specifically, DOD\u2019s doctrine governing logistics in  joint operations states that DLA and the military services share  responsibilities as the suppliers of equipment and supplies to the joint  force needed for sustained logistic readiness. It further states that as the  suppliers, they are responsible for delivering the right forces and materiel,  at the right place and time, to give the components of the joint force what  they require, when they need it. TRANSCOM, in addition to its  responsibilities for transporting equipment and supplies in support of  military operations, is designated as the distribution process owner for  DOD. The role of the distribution process owner is to, among other things,  oversee the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and alignment of  departmentwide distribution activities, including force projection,  sustainment, and redeployment/retrograde operations.", "DOD also has two senior-level governance bodies for logistics and supply  chain management\u2014the Joint Logistics Board and the Supply Chain  Executive Steering Committee. The Joint Logistics Board reviews the  status of the logistics portfolio and the effectiveness of the defensewide  logistics chain in providing support to the warfighter. The Joint Logistics  Board is co-chaired by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics  and Materiel Readiness and the Joint Staff Director of Logistics, and has  senior-level participants from the military services, combatant commands,  and DLA.

We have identified DOD supply chain management as a high-risk  area due to weaknesses both in the management of supply inventories  and responsiveness to warfighter requirements. Inventory management  problems have included (1) high levels of inventory beyond that needed  to support current requirements and future demands and (2) ineffective  and inefficient inventory management practices. In addition, we have  reported on shortages of critical items and other supply support problems  during the early operations in Iraq, as well as on the numerous logistics  challenges that DOD faces in supporting forces in Afghanistan.", "We initiated our high-risk list and biennial updates to focus attention on  government operations that we identified as being at high risk due to their  greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, as  well as areas that have a need for broad-based transformations to  address major economic, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. The  high-risk list serves to identify serious weaknesses in areas involving  substantial resources and provide critical services to the public. Solutions  to high-risk problems offer the potential to save billions of dollars, improve  service to the public, and strengthen the performance and accountability  of the U.S. government.", "Removal of a high-risk designation may be considered when legislative  and agency actions result in significant and sustainable progress toward  resolving a high-risk problem. Over time, we have removed the high-risk  designations of 21 programs or operations. When we review an  agency\u2019s actions taken to address high-risk challenges, we assess the  actions against five criteria: (1) a demonstrated strong commitment to and  top leadership support for addressing problems, (2) the capacity to  address problems, (3) a corrective action plan that provides for  substantially completing corrective measures in the near term, (4) a  program to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and  sustainability of corrective measures, and (5) demonstrated progress in  implementing corrective measures. With respect to supply chain  management, we found in our most recent update of the high-risk series  that DOD generally met the first two criteria.

Combined with effective leadership, strategic  planning provides decision makers with a framework to guide program  efforts and the means to determine if these efforts are achieving the  desired results.

For  example, DOD issued the first iteration of its Supply Chain Management  Improvement Plan in 2005 to address some of the systemic weaknesses  highlighted in our reports. DOD subsequently updated that plan on a  periodic basis. Also in 2005, DOD produced its Focused Logistics  Roadmap, which catalogued current efforts and initiatives. In 2008, DOD  released its Logistics Roadmap with the intent of providing a more  coherent and authoritative framework for logistics improvement efforts,  including supply chain management.

In a recent internal DOD review of joint supply issues in  theater, the department acknowledged it had insufficient visibility of  assets in theater, which can result in potential inventory sources being  overlooked due to lack of visibility or service ownership, as well as  limited visibility of assets while in-transit. In addition, a December 2010  Army Audit Agency report found that despite having policies and  procedures in place for identifying, inspecting, and repairing containers,  personnel in Iraq sometimes did not comply with the policies and failed to  correctly inspect the condition of containers or update this information in  computer systems. As a result, the Army did not have an accurate  accounting of containers that were in good condition for supporting the  ongoing drawdown in Iraq and meeting time frames for that withdrawal. In  a prior review of supply support in Afghanistan, we reported that DOD has  been challenged by several materiel distribution issues, such as the  transportation of cargo through neighboring countries and around  Afghanistan, limited airfield infrastructure, limited storage capacity at  logistics hubs, and difficulties in synchronizing the arrival of units and  equipment. DOD had undertaken some efforts to mitigate these  challenges, such as the expanding cargo areas at some distribution hubs.  Later this year we will report on the extent to which DOD continues to  experience challenges with asset visibility and materiel distribution in  Afghanistan.", "The 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan indicates that improving asset visibility  and materiel distribution remain priorities for the department; however,  the plan does not, by itself, constitute a corrective action plan to resolve  supply chain management weaknesses because it lacks detailed  information needed to guide and oversee improvement efforts.  Regarding asset visibility, the Logistics Strategic Plan indicates that two  priorities for the department are implementing a global container  management policy and implementing radio frequency identification.  Similarly, the Logistics Strategic Plan includes improvement initiatives for  materiel distribution. However, the plan does not discuss the root causes  for either asset visibility or materiel distribution weaknesses, identify the  extent to which the weaknesses are present, detail steps for  implementing improvement initiatives and thus achieving solutions, or  contain information (such as milestones, performance information,  benchmarks, and targets) necessary to gauge the department\u2019s progress  in implementing these initiatives and achieving outcomes.", "DOD has not developed corrective actions plans for asset visibility and  materiel distribution because senior-level officials considered prior  strategic plans and initiatives sufficient to address high-risk challenges in  these areas.

However, the exact roles  and responsibilities of these bodies are not defined in the plan. DOD  issued a charter for the Joint Logistics Board in 2010 that broadly defines  the roles and responsibilities of the board, and a draft charter exists for  the Supply Chain Executive Steering Committee. However, neither  charter specifically defines or describes the participation of those bodies  in the performance management framework for logistics. For example,  the charters do not clarify how the governance bodies will provide  oversight of the key initiatives in the Logistics Strategic Plan. Moreover, it  is not clear how the bodies will play a role in implementing individual  steps in the framework such as setting targets and monitoring  performance against those targets. Both bodies appear to provide  oversight primarily by periodic briefings, as opposed to systematic  monitoring of performance measures and improvement initiatives. For  example, we found that the Joint Logistics Board provides some oversight  of issues such as the development of a new joint supply support concept,  ongoing and new joint logistics initiatives, and activities of joint groups  and commands. The Supply Chain Executive Steering Committee  maintains visibility over issues such as the development of performance  metrics and some supply chain management initiatives. Although both  bodies have met regularly, our review of records from these meetings  indicate that neither body has exercised comprehensive and systematic  oversight across all key improvement initiatives for supply chain  management. Specifically, our review of the Joint Logistics Board\u2019s 2010  meeting minutes showed that the board discussed and received status  briefings on 4 of the 12 supply chain improvement initiatives identified as  key priorities in the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan.

DOD officials have stated that logistics  governance bodies are to oversee improvement efforts within the logistics  enterprise, but DOD Directives provide that the CMO and Deputy CMO  also have responsibilities related to the improvement of the efficiency and  effectiveness of the department\u2019s business operations.

We have previously reported that additional  opportunities exist for the CMO, assisted by the Deputy CMO, to provide  the leadership needed to achieve business-related goals, including supply  chain management goals. For example, the Deputy CMO stated that  she was not involved in developing or reviewing the Comprehensive  Inventory Management Improvement Plan. Although she did review the  Logistics Strategic Plan, this plan lacked clear performance measurement  information and other detailed information, as noted earlier in this report.  Moreover, successful resolution of weaknesses in supply chain  management depends on improvements in some of DOD\u2019s other  business operations, such as business systems modernization and  financial management. We have previously recommended that DOD  more clearly define how the CMO, Deputy CMO, and the military  departments will reach consensus on business priorities, coordinate  review and approval of updates to plans, synchronize the development of  plans with the budget process, monitor implementation of reform  initiatives, and report on progress, on a periodic basis, towards achieving  established goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Continues to Have Gaps in Its Ability to Measure Performance in Supply Chain Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effective Performance Measures Are Important for Demonstrating Progress in Programs and Activities", "paragraphs": ["Federal government standards and best practices highlight the  importance of tracking and demonstrating progress in programs and  activities through the development and implementation of performance  measures.

DLA uses a perfect order  fulfillment metric to measure how well the end-to-end supply chain  delivers the right part to the customer on time, in the correct quantity, and  with no material deficiencies. The department consistently tracks one  enterprisewide supply chain metric, customer wait time. DOD logistics  officials stated that as of December 2010, they increased the amount of  performance information they regularly submit to the Deputy CMO for  inclusion in the department\u2019s performance budget. These measures  include customer wait time by military service, perfect order fulfillment for  DLA, and two measures related to inventory management. However, our  prior work has found, and DOD has acknowledged, that additional  measures are needed.", "In an effort to develop enterprisewide performance measures, DOD  began an initiative in 2007 called the Joint Supply Chain Architecture to  identify a hierarchy of performance measures to track overall  effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain and to identify areas for  improvement based on industry standards. Led by the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration and the Director of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff Logistics Directorate, the Joint Supply Chain  Architecture effort is identified in the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan as a  key initiative intended to promote process standardization, facilitate  process integration, and define the enterprise framework. The Joint  Supply Chain Architecture is based on the Supply Chain Operations  Reference model, a process model that is a long-established best  practice for commercial supply chains and that provides a method to  evaluate and improve supply chains. We found DOD has made progress  with the initiative. The progress includes clarifying some common  concepts across the various DOD supply chains and organizations. For  instance, it details the types of performance information that will feed into  higher-level measures and identifies three possible enterprisewide  measures\u2014customer wait time, perfect order fulfillment, and total supply  chain management cost. The measures focus on speed, reliability, and  efficiency of the supply chain, respectively.", "Two of these three measures, customer wait time and perfect order  fulfillment, are not new and predate the Joint Supply Chain Architecture.  DOD directed the implementation of the customer wait time metric as  early as 2000 in a DOD instruction. Perfect order fulfillment is used by  DLA, as noted above, but it is not used by any other DOD components or  at the enterprisewide level. A total supply chain management cost metric  is far from completion, and various officials stated that the  meaningfulness of this measure is uncertain. Time lines for completion of  a total supply chain management cost metric or an enterprisewide perfect  order fulfillment metric have not been established.

Ongoing efforts to modernize or replace DOD  business information systems, including systems supporting supply chain  management, are intended to improve data quality and data sharing  within DOD components. However, we have found that data-quality  problems persist, and these systems are not designed to routinely share  data across organization boundaries, such as among military  departments. Further, DOD\u2019s information system modernization efforts  have experienced significant delays and cost increases while projected  benefits have not yet been achieved. Our recent review of DOD\u2019s  Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan revealed  concerns about data reliability and availability that could affect the  department\u2019s efforts in implementing the plan, including delays in  implementing business system modernization. The department is further  challenged because it does not have a common approach to developing  and implementing performance measures that include common  definitions, data sources, and agreement regarding how to measure  attributes of the supply chain across the enterprise. For example, we  found that it could be difficult for the services and DLA to measure  demand forecasting as they all differ in their current approach. These  factors have likewise been a challenge for the Joint Supply Chain  Architecture initiative. For example, one weapons system official  explained that customer wait time may be ambiguous because it can be  calculated differently and with different definitions.

Continued progress in defining needed performance measures for the  requirement forecasting focus area, combined with the identification,  development, and implementation of performance measures in the asset  visibility and materiel distribution focus areas could highlight progress and  needed management focus in order to address problems in those areas  that span the supply chain enterprise.

The corrective action plan or plans  should (1) identify the scope and root causes of capability gaps and other  problems, effective solutions, and actions to be taken to implement the  solutions; (2) include the characteristics of effective strategic planning,  including a mission statement; goals and related strategies (for example,  objectives and activities); performance measures and associated  milestones, benchmarks, and targets for improvement; resources and  investments required for implementation; key external factors that could  affect the achievement of goals; and the involvement of all key  stakeholders in a collaborative process to develop and implement the  plan; and (3) document how the department will integrate these plans with  its other decision-making processes; delineate organizational roles and  responsibilities; and support departmentwide priorities identified in higher- level strategic guidance (such as the Strategic Management Plan and  Logistics Strategic Plan).", "To institute the performance management framework for guiding and  overseeing supply chain management and other logistics improvement  efforts, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to take  the following three actions:  \uf0b7  Develop and issue detailed guidance to affected stakeholders  involved in implementing the performance management framework for  logistics.  \uf0b7  Develop and implement a communications strategy for documenting  and reporting on the results of supply chain management  improvement efforts.

DOD stated that guidance will be provided to  components and applicable defense agencies in the last quarter of fiscal  year 2011. DOD did not elaborate regarding the nature and scope of  information to be included in this guidance.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to revise the charters  of the Joint Logistics Board and the Supply Chain Executive Steering  Committee to define and describe how these governance bodies will  participate in the performance management framework for logistics. DOD  stated that the performance management framework is not explicitly  described in the charters, but that the charters reflect that these bodies  are to provide oversight, coordination, and information-sharing for  logistics initiatives and issues. DOD stated its view that no change is  required for the Joint Logistics Board charter, but the draft charter for the  Supply Chain Executive Steering Committee will be revised to address  reviews that are of performance measures and initiatives designed to  drive logistics improvements. We continue to believe that effective  implementation of DOD\u2019s new performance management framework for  logistics will require departmentwide direction and oversight from its  governance bodies to ensure initiatives are staying on track and that  progress toward goals is being made consistently throughout the  department. As we discussed in our report, we found that neither of the  two governance bodies has exercised comprehensive and systematic  oversight across all the key improvement initiatives for supply chain  management that were outlined in the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan.  Since DOD does not intend to revise their charters in order to define and  describe how these bodies will participate in the department\u2019s new  performance management framework, then it will be even more important  that their roles and responsibilities be made clear and explicit in the  implementation guidance that DOD says it plans to issue for the  performance management framework.", "In disagreeing with our other four recommendations, DOD indicates that  its ongoing involvement in major improvement initiatives, as well as  existing policy, is sufficient for addressing supply chain management  problems. We disagree based on the findings discussed in this report.  Problems in supply chain management, including the three focus areas of  requirements forecasting, asset visibility, and materiel distribution, are  long-standing and complex. Identifying root causes and implementing  effective solutions will require the involvement and coordination of  multiple stakeholders across the department, as well as a strong effort to  monitor, evaluate, and oversee improvements. Our recommendations are  intended to promote a systemic, integrated, and enterprisewide approach  to resolving problems in supply chain management. In addition, the  recommendations are closely linked with criteria and steps that agencies  need to take to successfully institute changes across an enterprise and to  have an area removed from GAO\u2019s high-risk list. As noted in our report,  with the issuance of the Comprehensive Inventory Management  Improvement Plan in 2010, DOD took important initial positive steps to  address challenges in the requirements forecasting focus area, as well as  other areas of inventory management. We believe that a similar approach  could also be effective in addressing challenges in asset visibility and  materiel distribution challenges. Our evaluation of DOD\u2019s comments with  regard to each of these four recommendations follows.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation to develop and implement  corrective action plans for the focus areas of asset visibility and materiel  distribution. DOD stated that it did not agree with our recommendation  because the department is already engaged in major efforts to improve  asset visibility and materiel distribution. While DOD for many years has  had improvement initiatives for certain challenges within these areas, we  continue to believe that developing and implementing a corrective action  plan for each of the remaining focus areas\u2014or a single, integrated plan  covering both areas\u2014is critical to resolving supply chain management  problems with a systemic, integrated, and enterprisewide approach.  GAO\u2019s criteria for removing the high-risk designation\u2014for supply chain  management and other programs\u2014specifically calls for corrective actions  plans that identify the root causes of problems, solutions to these  problems, and steps to achieve these solutions. Moreover, an effective  strategic planning process that results in a high-quality corrective action  plan can provide clear direction to addressing DOD\u2019s weaknesses in  supply chain management.", "DOD commented that its involvement in major efforts to improve asset  visibility and materiel distribution negates the need for a corrective action  plan. DOD specifically refers to three efforts\u2014(1) the Distribution  Strategic Opportunities initiative, (2) the Distribution Network Optimization  initiative, and (3) the Comprehensive Inventory Management  Improvement Plan. DOD states that each of these efforts has specific  goals, milestones, and targets, and involves key stakeholders. It is  unclear why DOD, in its written comments, focuses on the first two efforts  to the exclusion of other ongoing initiatives for improving distribution.  During our review, DOD officials did not highlight these efforts as  paramount, nor does the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan characterize these  as DOD\u2019s most critical key initiatives. On the contrary, the 2010 Logistics  Strategic Plan briefly describes the Distribution Strategic Opportunities  initiative as an effort \u201cto improve distribution across the enterprise\u201d and  includes it among several other initiatives the department has to improve  supply chain processes. The Logistics Strategic Plan provides no other  explanation of this initiative; provides no goals, milestones, or targets  associated with the initiative; and does not show how this initiative will  enable it to achieve high-level outcomes such as operating supply chains  more effectively and efficiently. The plan, moreover, makes no specific  mention of the second effort\u2014the Distribution Network Optimization  initiative\u2014although information provided separately by the department  indicates it is a sub-initiative under the Distribution Strategic Opportunities  initiative.", "Furthermore, without a strategic planning process that examines root  problems and capability gaps and results in a corrective action plan, it is  unclear that these initiatives alone are sufficient for addressing all major  challenges in the asset visibility and materiel distribution focus areas. For  example, it is unclear to what extent these initiatives address challenges  in managing supply support in a joint theater of operations. It is also  unclear whether the initiatives are intended to focus on improving asset  visibility. As mentioned above, DOD has demonstrated an ability to carry  out a collaborative strategic planning process resulting in the issuance of  its Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan. That plan  identifies corrective actions that could, when implemented, effectively  address the requirements forecasting focus area and other aspects of  inventory management. We continue to believe that following a similar  collaborative approach that results in a corrective action plan or plans for  the focus areas of asset visibility and materiel distribution would result in  significant progress in addressing remaining challenges in the supply  chain management high-risk area.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation to develop and implement  a communications strategy for documenting and reporting on the results  of supply chain management improvement efforts. DOD stated that an  additional strategy of documenting and reporting its progress is not  required because the department\u2019s senior logistics leadership is  continuously engaged in communicating its goals and performance to  internal and external stakeholders via governing bodies, public forums,  and formal reporting to Congress. Further, DOD stated that it will continue  to use monthly in-progress reviews of supply chain management  improvement efforts as the communications strategy with the  components. We continue to believe that DOD needs to report on the  results and progress of its logistics and supply chain management  improvement efforts. Such reporting can enhance accountability, help  ensure that all stakeholders are aware of progress being made and areas  needing further attention, and convey consistent directions throughout the  department for follow-on actions. Communication regarding goals and  performance are key steps that DOD identifies as part of the performance  management framework for logistics outlined in the Logistics Strategic  Plan. Further, DOD stated in this plan its commitment to issue a DOD  Logistics Strategic Management Report to document the results of the  assessments performed as part of the performance management  framework. Given DOD\u2019s response to our recommendation, it is unclear  how the department plans to implement these aspects of its performance  management framework. As discussed in this report, a management  report has not yet been issued, and it is unclear what types of information  DOD intends to include in this report and how the information in the report  will be used as part of the performance management framework.

DOD stated that this recommendation is not required  because the Deputy CMO\u2019s roles and responsibilities are sufficiently  documented in DOD guidance. We stated in our report that the CMO and  Deputy CMO have broad responsibilities related to the improvement of  the efficiency and effectiveness of DOD\u2019s business operations. However,  we have previously reported that additional opportunities exist for the  CMO and Deputy CMO to achieve business-related goals, including  supply chain management goals. For example, we reported that the  Deputy CMO was not involved in developing or reviewing the  Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement Plan. This plan was  described in DOD\u2019s comments on this draft report as one of the three  major ongoing efforts to improve supply chain management. Further,  neither the CMO nor Deputy CMO attends meetings of the Joint Logistics  Board or Supply Chain Executive Steering Committee. Among the  responsibilities of the Deputy CMO are to participate as a member of  senior governance councils, and participation in senior logistics  governance bodies therefore may provide more opportunities for closer  collaboration and involvement of the Deputy CMO in addressing  challenges in supply chain management, especially those challenges that  span business areas. DOD additionally stated in its comments that it did  not concur with our recommendation because the logistics enterprise  reports to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics, who has oversight and management responsibility for  logistics. Our recommendation does not imply that oversight and  management responsibility for logistics should be shifted to the CMO and  Deputy CMO; however, these individuals are in a unique position to  coordinate improvement efforts across all defense business areas.  Therefore, these individuals need to have a clearly defined role,  consistent with their overarching responsibilities in each business area,  including logistics and supply chain management.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation to use a collaborative  approach to identify, develop, and implement enterprisewide performance  measures needed to demonstrate progress in the focus areas of asset  visibility and materiel distribution. DOD stated that no additional actions  are required because enterprisewide performance measures have been  and continue to be developed using a collaborative process involving all  stakeholders. Further, DOD stated that the performance management  framework is a process rather than a document of performance  management. The department\u2019s comments noted that it is following this  process in a collaborative fashion involving all stakeholders in the  identification, development, and implementation of enterprisewide  performance measures to demonstrate progress in key areas, including  asset visibility and materiel distribution. As noted in our report, DOD used  a collaborative process to define existing and needed performance  measures as part of the development of its Comprehensive Inventory  Management Improvement Plan. We continue to believe that DOD should  follow a similar, collaborative approach for the focus areas of asset  visibility and materiel distribution. Our work has shown that, at this time,  enterprisewide measures for these focus areas do not yet exist. DOD  began an initiative in 2007 called the Joint Supply Chain Architecture to  identify a hierarchy of performance measures. However, the only  enterprisewide performance measure used across the department,  customer wait time, predates this Joint Supply Chain Architecture  initiative. Other enterprisewide measures identified by the initiative are not  fully developed and may be some time from full implementation. We  agree with DOD that the performance management framework is a  process and not a document. Our report does not suggest otherwise. We  recommended that once key performance measures for these focus  areas are defined and implemented, they be incorporated as part of the  process for managing improvement efforts within the performance  management framework.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II.

We assessed the extent to which such  plans provide a comprehensive, integrated strategy for improving one or  more of the focus areas and include the key elements of a corrective  action plan that we have previously identified. Specifically, we evaluated  DOD\u2019s October 2010 Comprehensive Inventory Management  Improvement Plan and determined its applicability as a corrective action  plan for inventory management and the requirements forecasting focus  area by comparing the plan and its elements to criteria from our prior  reports on corrective action plans and effective strategic planning.  Specific criteria on corrective action plans and the elements of effective  strategic planning are discussed in the report. Using these same criteria,  we evaluated the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan and determined the extent  to which it could serve as a corrective action plan for the areas of asset  visibility and materiel distribution.

In addition, we assessed the extent that DOD has  included elements needed for instituting the framework across the  department. We based this assessment, in part, on a body of work that  sets forth criteria for results-oriented management and best practices for  organizations that are transforming their management practices and  structures.

We compared the  performance management frameworks of the two DOD plans to  determine the degree of congruence between the frameworks. We met  with officials from the Office for Supply Chain Integration to discuss the  performance management framework and oversight structure (including  senior-level logistics governance bodies) and obtain additional insight and  supporting documentation (e.g., agendas and meeting minutes of these  bodies) on the purpose and implementation of the framework. We  reviewed DOD\u2019s recent congressional testimony on the 2010 Logistics  Strategic Plan and written responses to related questions for the record to  determine DOD\u2019s approach and perspective on implementing the plan,  including the performance management framework. In addition, we  reviewed legislation, DOD policies, and other documentation regarding  the chief management officials, including the DOD Chief Management  Officer, the Deputy Chief Management Officer, and military departments\u2019  Chief Management Officers; and our prior work on performance  management.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has an ability to demonstrate  supply chain management progress, we reviewed how DOD uses, or  plans to use, performance measures discussed in the 2010 Logistics  Strategic Plan. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s existing or planned performance  measures for the three focus areas of improvement, including measures  discussed in the Comprehensive Inventory Management Improvement  Plan. As a basis for evaluating these measures, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  supply chain management regulation, federal standards and best  practices, and our prior findings and recommendations on this issue.", "We discussed existing and planned measures with officials from the  Office for Supply Chain Integration and other DOD components. We also  obtained information from these officials on the development of the Joint  Supply Chain Architecture since a major effort of the initiative is to define  enterprisewide performance measures to track efficiency, effectiveness,  and reliability of the supply chains. We met with officials from the  following weapons systems program offices involved in implementing  Joint Supply Chain Architecture case study programs: Integrated Materiel  Management Center, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle  Management Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; PEO Integrated  Warfare Systems, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C.; Warner  Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia; Naval  Inventory Control Point, U.S. Naval Supply Systems Command,  Mechanicsburg and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We discussed  performance measures used by these case study programs as well as  DOD efforts to develop enterprisewide performance measures.", "We conducted a site visit to the U.S. Transportation Command, Scott Air  Force Base, Illinois, to obtain information and perspectives on  distribution-related initiatives to discuss supply chain improvement efforts  and performance management. In addition, we contacted officials from  the following agencies and offices to obtain information and perspectives  on the 2010 Logistics Strategic Plan, supply chain improvement initiatives  and efforts, and their use of performance measures:  \uf0b7  U.S. Joint Forces Command: Operations, Plans, Logistics and  Engineering Directorate, J4 Division, Norfolk, Virginia;  \uf0b7  Defense Logistics Agency, Ft.
