Consequently, the Congress enacted base realignment and closure (BRAC) legislation that instituted base closure rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. For the 1991, 1993, and 1995 rounds, the legislation required DOD to complete all closures and realignments within 6 years from the date the President sent the BRAC Commission\u2019s recommendations and his approval to the Congress. Closure and realignment actions for the 1988 and 1991 rounds were required to be completed by September 30, 1995, and July 10, 1997, respectively. Actions for the 1993 and 1995 rounds are to be completed by July 3, 1999, and July 15, 2001, respectively.", "The Congress established two base closure accounts to fund the closure rounds. The first account, the DOD base closure account, funded BRAC activities for the 1988 round and the second account, the DOD base closure account 1990, funded BRAC activities for the 1991, 1993, and 1995 rounds.", "DOD\u2019s authority to obligate 1988 base closure account funds to close or realign bases expired on September 30, 1995. After that date, funds in the 1988 account ceased to be available for new obligations and may only be used to adjust and liquidate obligations already charged to the account.Unobligated funds in the account must remain there until the Congress transfers them or the account is closed. According to DOD officials, the account will be closed on September 30, 2000. Appendix II discusses the status of funds in the 1988 account.", "A different set of rules applies, however, to the 1990 base closure account. Funds in that account are available for an indefinite period. New obligations may be incurred and old obligations liquidated against the account until the Secretary of the Defense closes it. As a consequence of the 6-year implementation period for the 1991, 1993, and 1995 rounds, the period provided to obligate appropriated funds differs by BRAC round. For example, after July 10, 1997, unobligated funds in the account were not available to incur new obligations for BRAC 1991 closure or realignment actions, except for (1) environmental restoration and mitigation, and property management and disposal activities at BRAC 1991 sites and (2) adjusting and liquidating obligations properly charged to the BRAC 1991 round.", "The Congress, in appropriating funds to the 1990 base closure account, gave DOD the flexibility to allocate funds by military service, budget function, and BRAC installation. The Congress recognized the complexities of realigning and closing bases and of providing for environmental restoration and mitigation. As a result, appropriations to the 1990 account are structured in a manner that permits the Secretary of Defense to redistribute unobligated balances as appropriate to avoid delays and complete realignments and closures, along with environmental actions.", "In March 1998, DOD requested more than $1.7 billion for the BRAC program in fiscal year 1999. As shown in table 1, the amount requested is getting smaller each year as more implementation actions are completed.

Further, these officials are reluctant to include estimated proceeds in the annual budget process because of the uncertainties in collecting BRAC revenues. For example, in the budget request for fiscal  year 1997, the Navy estimated $243.9 million in land sales for the BRAC 1993 round. However, due primarily to less emphasis on selling surplus land and a greater emphasis on economic benefits of transferring the property to nearby communities, there were no proceeds.

We agree that the military services have reprogrammed some funds to other BRAC requirements. We also recognize that program requirements tend to change, and in some cases disappear, as base closure and realignment actions are implemented. However, the $54.8 million in unobligated balances represents additional available funding that was not anticipated at the time the fiscal year 1999 budget request was submitted to the Congress in February 1998. The $54.8 million was identified during interviews in March and April 1998 with officials from the services\u2019 major commands and the Army Corps of Engineers. As a result of reviews of their unobligated balances and unliquidated obligations during February, March, and April 1998, the major commands and the Army Corps of Engineers found that the requirements for these funds no longer existed. At the time of our review, DOD, the Army, and the Navy could not provide supporting documentation that showed where they would use the unobligated balances, nor did they identify plans to redesignate for other BRAC needs those funds we identified as potentially available to offset DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget request. Only the Air Force, in May 1998 after DOD submitted its budget estimate, identified a need to use some of these funds to reduce a shortfall it identified for two closing bases. 3. We continue to believe that the 1999 BRAC budget request contains $40.6 million for two separate military construction projects that are no longer required. DOD requested $31 million for DLA to build a medical warehouse for the Army, even though the requirements for the warehouse have not been determined. As of May 4, 1998, DLA officials continued to question the Army\u2019s requirements for the warehouse and were unable to provide a revised cost estimate for the project that could be included in the 1999 budget request. It has been the OUSD Comptroller\u2019s policy to not fund MILCON projects where requirements are not determined. DOD agreed that the Army\u2019s MTMC headquarters building request for $9.6 million had already been funded. DOD asserts that these funds are still needed to refund previously approved actions where the funds were reprogrammed to accommodate an accelerated construction schedule. However, at the time of our review, we found no evidence of deferred actions that still needed to be fully funded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Norfolk Field Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Military Base Closures: Detailed Budget Requests Could Improve Visibility (GAO/NSIAD-97-170, July 14, 1997).", "Military Bases: Cost to Maintain Inactive Ammunition Plants and Closed Bases Could Be Reduced (GAO/NSIAD-97-56, Feb. 20, 1997).", "Military Base Closures: Reducing High Costs of Environmental Cleanup Requires Difficult Choices (GAO/NSIAD-96-172, Sept. 5, 1996).", "Military Bases: Update on the Status of Bases Closed in 1988, 1991, and 1993 (GAO/NSIAD-96-149, Aug. 6, 1996).", "Military Bases: Potential Reductions to the Fiscal Year 1997 Base Closure Budget (GAO/NSIAD-96-158, July 15, 1996).", "Military Bases: Closure and Realignment Savings Are Significant, but Not Easily Quantified (GAO/NSIAD-96-67, Apr. 8, 1996).", "Closing Maintenance Depots: Savings, Workload, and Redistribution Issues (GAO/NSIAD-96-29, Mar. 4, 1996).", "Military Bases: Case Studies on Selected Bases Closed in 1988 and 1991 (GAO/NSIAD-95-139, Aug. 15, 1995).", "Military Bases: Environmental Impact at Closing Installations (GAO/NSIAD-95-70, Feb. 23, 1995).", "Military Bases: Reuse Plans for Selected Bases Closed in 1988 and 1991 (GAO/NSIAD-95-3, Nov. 1, 1994).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
