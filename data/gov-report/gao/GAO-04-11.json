Today, public and private sector entities view the SSN as a key piece of information that enables them to conduct their business and deliver services. However, given the apparent rise in identity crimes as well as the rapidly increasing availability of information over the Internet, Congress has raised concern over how certain private sector entities obtain, use, and safeguard SSN data. In previous reports, we discussed the benefits of government and commercial entities using SSNs. We also examined how certain private sector entities and the government obtain, use, and safeguard SSNs. This report provides additional information on private sector uses of SSNs. The Chairman, Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways and Means, asked that GAO examine the private sector use of SSNs by businesses most likely to obtain and use them including information resellers, consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), and health care organizations. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) describe how information resellers, CRAs, and some health care organizations obtain and use SSNs and (2) discuss the laws and practices relevant to safeguarding SSNs and consumers' privacy. GAO makes no recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Information resellers, consumer reporting agencies, and some health care organizations routinely obtain SSNs from their customers and have come to rely on SSNs as identifiers that help them determine an individual's identity and accumulate information about individuals. Larger information resellers usually obtain SSNs from their customers and use them to determine the identity of an individual for purposes such as employment screening, credit information, and criminal history. Other Internet-based information resellers whose Web sites we accessed also obtain SSNs from their customers and scour public records and other publicly available information to provide the information to persons willing to pay a fee. CRAs, too, are large users of SSNs. They obtain SSNs from businesses that furnish individuals' data to them and use SSNs to determine consumers' identities and match the information they receive from businesses with information stored in consumers' credit files. Finally, health care organizations obtain SSNs from individuals themselves and companies that offer health care plans and use them as identifiers. Some health care organizations use SSNs as member identification numbers. Certain federal laws help to safeguard consumers' personal information, including SSNs, by restricting the disclosure of and access to such information, and private sector officials we spoke with said that they indeed take steps to safeguard the SSN information they collect. Information resellers, CRAs, and health care organizations told us they take steps to safeguard SSN data in part for business purposes but also because of federal and state laws that require such safeguards. Finally, some states are taking steps, legislatively, to address consumer concerns regarding SSN use and privacy of their personal information. Of the 18 states we examined, at least 6 had enacted laws specifically restricting private sector use and display of SSNs. California's law, in particular, has had some nationwide effect on business practices in places where some businesses have discontinued the display of SSNs in all of their locations. Also, our review shows that several state laws are similar to California's. In addition, while some state laws and regulations we reviewed did not restrict or prohibit SSN use or display specifically, they did extend beyond federal restrictions regarding the sharing of personal information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security number (SSN) is used for a myriad of non\u2013Social  Security purposes. Private and public sector entities frequently ask  individuals for SSNs in order to conduct their business and sometimes to  comply with federal laws. Certain private sector entities, such as  consumer reporting agencies (CRAs), information brokers or resellers,  and health care organizations, use the SSN as a key piece of information  that enables them to conduct their business and deliver services to their  customers. For example, business clients or individual customers provide  SSNs to these entities, and the numbers are used to produce credit reports  or verify information about individuals for employment and other  purposes. However, given the apparent rise in identity theft crime, as  recently reported by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the rapidly  increasing availability of personal information over the Internet, Congress  has expressed concern over how certain private sector entities obtain, use,  and safeguard SSN data.", "We previously reported on the benefits to government and commercial  entities of using SSNs. To build on that work and to address Congress\u2019  ongoing concern about certain commercial entities\u2019 use of SSNs, in this  report we focus on information brokers or resellers, CRAs (sometimes  referred to as credit bureaus), and health care organizations, which are the  same industries that we focused on in our previous work. You requested  that we (1) describe how information resellers, CRAs, and some health  care organizations obtain and use SSNs and (2) discuss the laws and  practices relevant to safeguarding SSNs and consumers\u2019 privacy.", "To determine how information resellers, CRAs, and health care  organizations obtain and use SSNs, we conducted on-site structured  interviews with six large information resellers, three large and well\u2013 known CRAs, two large health care plans, and two health care industry  associations. We also had our investigators access the Web sites of six  Internet-based information resellers that specialize in searching for people  or obtaining information about individuals by the use of SSNs, and our  investigators paid them a fee to obtain their information. To determine the  laws and practices relevant to safeguarding SSNs, we questioned  information resellers, CRAs, health care organizations, and the Federal  Trade Commission about the relevant federal laws that limit these entities\u2019  ability to obtain and use individuals\u2019 personal information that includes  SSNs. We also questioned the private sector entities about the safeguards  they had in place to protect SSNs and reviewed some of their policies and  procedures. However, we did not verify the extent to which these  businesses comply with their own policies, procedures, and safeguards. To  discuss actions taken by states to safeguard consumers\u2019 privacy, we  conducted site visits to two states\u2014one that had passed privacy legislation  and one that had issued an executive order on personal information,  surveyed state audit officials in each of the 50 states, and interviewed  select industry and state officials in person or via telephone. We also  conducted a legislative review of 18 states that were identified by state  officials as having laws or proposed laws governing SSN use.", "We conducted our work between November 2002 and December 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Through a process known as enumeration, unique numbers are created for  every person as a work and retirement benefit record for the Social  Security program. SSA generally issues SSNs to most U.S. citizens, and  SSNs are also available to noncitizens lawfully admitted to the United  States with permission to work. SSA estimates that approximately 277  million individuals currently have SSNs. Because of the number\u2019s  uniqueness and broad applicability, the SSN has become the identifier of  choice for government agencies and private businesses, and thus it is used  for a myriad of non\u2013Social Security purposes.", "With the enhancement of computer technologies in recent years, private  sector businesses are increasingly computerizing their records; as a result,  these enhancements have spawned new business activities involving the  aggregation of personal information. Such entities aggregate large  numbers of both public and private data, including SSNs, from record- keeping systems throughout the country into centralized databases and  use those databases, in many cases, for the purpose of providing consumer  services. Businesses and others rely on entities such as information  resellers and CRAs to use SSNs to build credit reports, extract or retrieve  data from consumers\u2019 credit histories, verify individuals\u2019 identities, market  their products, and prevent financial fraud.", "Information resellers, sometimes referred to as information brokers, are  businesses that specialize in amassing consumer information that includes  SSNs for informational services. They may provide their services to a  variety of customers, either to specific business clients or through the  Internet to anyone willing to pay a fee. Large information resellers limit  their services to businesses that establish accounts with them. Law firms,  private businesses, law enforcement agencies, and others are usually their  clients. For example, lawyers, debt collectors, and private investigators  may request information on an individual\u2019s bank accounts and real estate  holdings for use in civil proceedings such as divorce; automobile insurers  may want information on whether insurance applicants have been  involved in accidents or have been issued traffic citations; employers may  want background checks on new hires; pension plan administrators may  want information to locate pension beneficiaries; and individuals may ask  for information to help locate birth parents. When requesting information,  customers may ask for nationwide database searches or searches of only  specific geographical areas. Other information resellers, particularly those  that are Internet-based, generally offer their services to the public at large  for a fee.", "CRAs, also known as credit bureaus, are agencies that collect and sell  information about the creditworthiness of individuals. CRAs collect  information that is considered relevant to a person\u2019s credit history. These  agencies then use this information to assign a credit score to an individual,  indicating the person\u2019s creditworthiness. Prospective creditors purchase  credit reports about specific individuals from CRAs, and then use this  information to decide how much credit, if any, to extend to the individual.", "Organizations that provide health care services also commonly use  consumers\u2019 SSNs. These organizations generally deliver their services  through a coordinated system that includes health care providers and  health plans (insurers). While both providers and insurers are within this  coordinated system, they are distinct from each other. For instance, in  conducting business, health care providers offer medical or health  services to patients and bill either the patient or the health plan for those  services. In contrast, health plans offer insurance to individuals or groups  of employees, who then make premium payments in exchange for  services. Some health care organizations play dual roles of both health  care provider and health insurer, which makes the distinction in how they  obtain and use SSNs more complex.", "Because of the myriad of uses of the SSN, Congress has previously asked  GAO to review various aspects of SSN use in both the public and the  private sectors. In our previous work, our reports have looked at how  private businesses and government agencies obtain and use SSNs. In  addition, we have reported that the perceived widespread sharing of  personal information and instances of identity theft have heightened  public concern about the use of Social Security Numbers. We have also  noted that the SSN is used, in part, as a verification tool for services such  as child support collection, law enforcement enhancement, and issuing  credit to individuals. Although these uses of SSNs are beneficial to the  public, SSNs are also key elements in creating false identities. We testified  before the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee on Ways  and Means, about SSA\u2019s enumeration and verification processes, and  reported that the aggregation of personal information, such as SSNs, in  large corporate databases, as well as the public display of SSNs in various  public records, may provide criminals the opportunity to commit identity  crimes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Entities Routinely Obtain SSNS from Their Business Clients and Use Them Largely as a Tool to Identify Individuals", "paragraphs": ["Information resellers, CRAs, and health care organizations routinely  obtain SSNs from their business clients and use SSNs for various  purposes, such as to build tools that verify an individual\u2019s identity or  match existing records. In addition to acquiring SSNs from various public  sources, officials from these firms said they often obtain SSNs from their  business clients wishing to use their services. For example, health care  organizations obtain SSNs from the subscriber or policyholder of the  employer group during the enrollment process. Given the various types of  services these companies offer, we found that all of them have come to  rely on the SSN as an identifier, which helps them determine a person\u2019s  identity for the purpose of providing the services they offer. These officials  said that because the SSN is a unique number, it is the most reliable factor  in determining an individual\u2019s identity. However, most of the large  information resellers said that the SSN is not needed to develop many of  their products, such as products that launch e-mail marketing or  telemarketing programs, but when the SSN is used, it provides increased  accuracy and completeness in terms of trying to determine an individual\u2019s  identity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Large and Internet-Based Information Resellers Obtain SSNs from Their Business Clients, as Do CRAs and Health Care Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Information resellers generally obtain SSNs from their business clients,  who often provide SSNs to obtain a reseller\u2019s services or products.  However, most of the large information reseller officials we spoke to said  that many of the products they offer do not incorporate SSN data. They  said they generally amass demographic information about households in  order to provide marketing products such as detailed data lists of e-mails  and postal addresses, and telephone numbers, or information for retailers  and others to use to obtain new customers. As a result, their business  concentrates more on marketing such products. However, these officials  said that they obtain SSNs from their business clients because they also  offer specific services, such as background checks, employee screening,  determining criminal histories, or searching for individuals. For example,  business customers of some of the information resellers who specialize in  employee screening provide them with SSNs in order to have background  checks done on potential employees.", "Large information resellers also said they can obtain SSNs from various  public and private sources. For example, they obtain SSN data from public  records such as bankruptcies, tax liens, civil judgments, criminal histories,  deaths, real estate ownership, driving histories, voter registration, and  professional licenses. These officials said, however, that the availability of  SSN information in public records varied depending on the state and  county. For example, some states and counties included SSNs in their  filings of tax liens and court records, but not in other records. Bankruptcy  information, which is governed at the federal level, always includes SSNs.  All of the resellers that we spoke to said that they obtain SSNs from public  records where possible, and to the extent the information is provided on  the Internet, they are likely to obtain it from such sources. However, given  the varied nature of SSN data found in public records, some reseller  officials said they are more likely to rely on receiving SSNs from their  business clients than they are from obtaining them from public records.  Our investigators also used the Web sites of the Internet-based resellers to  try to determine the sources they used to obtain information on SSNs. We  reviewed the sources of information the resellers listed on their Web sites.  They found that they relied mostly on public information and public  record data. For example, they listed various kinds of public record  information at the state, county, and national levels, as well as other  publicly available information, such as newspapers. As with large  information resellers, once they obtained an SSN they relied on  information in public records to help verify an individual\u2019s identity and  obtain additional information.", "Some large information resellers may also obtain SSN information from  private sources. In many cases such information was obtained through  review of data where a customer has voluntarily supplied information  resellers with information about himself or herself. In addition, large  reseller officials said they also use their clients\u2019 records in instances where  the client has provided them with information. For example, officials from  one large reseller said they obtained lists of their retail customers\u2019 credit  card holders. The list includes the names, addresses, SSNs, and other data  of the credit card holders. The reseller then uses the list to match the  names of the retail company\u2019s delinquent payment holders with the most  recent bankruptcy records.  In addition, Federal Trade Commission (FTC)  staff said that information resellers also obtain information from CRAs.", "We found the Internet-based resellers to be more dependent on SSNs than  the large information resellers, primarily because their focus is more  related to providing investigative or background-type services to anyone  willing to pay a fee. We found these entities to be primarily focused on  amassing information around an individual\u2019s SSN, which in most cases  they obtain from customers trying to use their Web sites. To discover what  type of information could be obtained from such sources, our investigators  accessed the Web sites of six Internet-based information resellers and paid  a fee to gain access to the personal data. We found that when we supplied  a SSN, these resellers provided with us information such as the  corresponding name, address, and telephone number and, on two  occasions, a truncated SSN such as 123-45-xxx. All but one of the Internet- based resellers required our investigators to provide both the name and  SSN of the person who was the subject of our inquiry.", "Like information resellers, CRAs also obtain SSNs from their customers or  the businesses that furnish data to them, as well as from private and public  sources. CRA officials said that they obtain SSNs from businesses that  subscribe to their services, such as banks, insurance companies, mortgage  companies, debt collection agencies, child support enforcement agencies,  credit grantors, and employment screening companies. These businesses  voluntarily report consumers\u2019 charge and payment transactions,  accompanied by SSNs, to CRAs. Individuals provide these businesses with  their SSNs for reasons such as applying for credit. CRA officials said that  they also obtain SSNs from public sources. For example, some officials  said SSNs can be obtained from bankruptcy records, a fact that is  especially important in terms of determining that the correct individual  has declared bankruptcy. CRA officials told us that they also obtain SSNs  from other information resellers, especially those that specialize in  obtaining information from public records.", "CRA and information reseller officials we spoke to also said that they  would support limiting the public display of SSNs, especially where the  general public might be able to retrieve such information. For example,  they said they support removing the SSN from identification cards, health  care insurance cards, and university student identification numbers. None  of these officials, however, support removing the SSN from public records  or restricting their access to SSN data in public records. They said such  restrictions would slow some business transactions and likely increase  costs to consumers because many of the conveniences currently enjoyed  by consumers, such as obtaining instant credit, would take much longer  and, in some cases, cease to exist.", "Finally, health care organization officials said that they obtain SSNs from  individuals themselves and companies that offer health care plans. For  example, subscribers or policyholders provide health care plans with their  SSNs through their company or employer group when they enroll in health  care plans. In addition to health care plans, health care organizations  include health care providers, such as hospitals. Such entities often collect  SSNs as part of the process of obtaining information on insured people.

In addition, the SSN was also used to compile and match data  about individuals with information already in company databases. This  was particularly true of CRAs, whose officials said they usually match  individuals\u2019 SSNs with records in their data sets. Most information reseller,  CRA, and health care organization officials we spoke to said that the SSN  is the single most important identifier available, mainly because it is truly  unique to an individual, unlike an individual\u2019s name and address, which  can often change over an individual\u2019s lifetime."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Large and Internet-based Information Resellers Use the SSN as an Identifier", "paragraphs": ["Large information resellers said that they generally use the SSN as an  identity verification tool. Some of these entities have incorporated SSNs  into their information technology, while others have incorporated SSNs  into their client\u2019s databases used for identity verification. For example,  one large information reseller that specializes in information technology  solutions has developed a customer verification data model that aids  financial institutions in their compliance with some federal laws regarding  \u201cknowing your customer.\u201d According to this company\u2019s information, the  data model compares information provided by the applicant, such as  name, address, and SSN, with the data they already have in their  databases, which is composed of multiple public and private sources.  Another information reseller that specializes in mortgage services uses the  SSN as the main factor in identifying individuals for their product reports  and also for conducting investigations for their clients for resident  screening or employment screening. Yet another large information reseller  uses SSNs for internal matching purposes of its databases. For example,  this company has various database products that compile information to  provide such products as insurance underwriting tools. We also found  that Internet-based information resellers use the SSN as a factor in  determining an individual\u2019s identity. Although the Internet Web sites we  accessed advertised by saying they would be able to find a person\u2019s SSN or  find a person using an SSN, these resellers in all but one case required us  as the client to supply the SSN. The information they then provided back  to us was information that usually restated what we had given them or  verified the person\u2019s SSN.", "Most of the information resellers officials we spoke to said that although  they obtain the SSN from their business clients, the information they  provide back to their customers rarely contains the SSN. Almost all of the  officials said that they provide their clients with a truncated SSN, an  example of which would be 123-45-xxxx. In one case, one large  information reseller provides business products with three different  access levels, which includes the general public, subscriber products, and  select products for entities such as law enforcement. Company officials  said the subscriber level provides subscribers with truncated SSNs, while  full SSNs are viewable at the select group product level, giving the user  group a tool to authenticate data about specific individuals. With regard  to the Internet-based information resellers we accessed, only one provided  the complete SSN back to us. These resellers usually provided information  related to the SSN we had provided them, such as name, address, or date  of birth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CRAs Use SSNs as Identifiers and to Match Incoming Data with Their Existing Databases", "paragraphs": ["CRAs use SSNs as the primary identifier of individuals that enables them  to match the information they receive from their business clients with the  information stored in their databases on individuals. Because these  companies have various commercial, financial, and government agencies  furnishing data to them, the SSN is the primary factor that ensures that  incoming data is matched correctly with an individual\u2019s information on  file. For example, CRA officials said they use several factors to match  incoming data with existing data, such as name, address, and financial  account information. If all of the incoming data, except the SSN, match  with existing data, then the SSN will determine the correct person\u2019s credit  file. Given that people move, get married, and open new financial  accounts, these officials said that it is hard to distinguish among  individuals. Because the SSN is the one piece of information that remains  constant, they said that it is the primary identifier that they use to match  data.", "We found that CRAs and information resellers can sometimes be the same  entity, a fact that blurs the distinction between the two types of businesses  but does not affect the use of SSNs by these entities. For example,  information resellers that assemble or evaluate consumer credit  information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third  parties would be considered CRAs under federal law, and the law restricts  what they can do with the credit report information. Five of the six large  information resellers we spoke to said they were also CRAs. CRA officials  said that they also build their own databases or purchase databases from  other companies, and then resell the information in these databases to  their customers. However, CRA officials said that information furnished  for credit reports can only be used for credit reporting purposes and  cannot be resold. Information not covered by federal law that CRAs use to  build their databases or buy from other databases can be resold as  consulting solutions or direct-marketing products.

Health care officials said  that they use SSNs for identification purposes, such as linking an  individual\u2019s name to an SSN to determine if premium payments have been  made, or they use the SSN as an online services identifier, as an alternative  policy identifier, and for phone-in identity verification. Health care  organizations also use SSNs to tie family members together where family  coverage is used, to coordinate member benefits, and as a cross-check  for pharmacy transactions. For example, health care officials said that  when people purchase pharmaceuticals, the SSN is used to help identify  the person that is authorized to receive the pharmaceuticals and medical  benefits. Health care industry association officials also said that SSNs are  used for claims processing, especially with regard to Medicare. According  to these officials, under some Medicare programs, SSNs are how Medicare  identifies benefits to an individual.", "Given the increased interest in the use and protection of SSNs as well as  the recent passage of federal and state laws, health care organization  officials said that in some instances health care organizations are limiting  their use of SSNs to be in compliance with the laws. For example, one  health care organization we spoke to said that certain of its regions no  longer use SSNs as a basis for providing member records or for  identification purposes. Another region does not use the SSN to verify the  identity of members, but instead relies upon the medical record number,  date of birth, or address.

GLBA created a new  definition of personal information, referred to as nonpublic personal  information, which means personally identifiable financial information  that is  1.  provided by a consumer to a financial institution (for example, name,  address, income, SSN, or other information on an application);  2.  the result of any transaction with the consumer or any service  performed for the consumer (for example, account numbers, payment  history, loan or deposit balances, and credit or debit card purchases);  or  3.  otherwise obtained by the financial institution (for example,  information from a consumer report).", "Provisions under GLBA limit when a financial institution may disclose a  consumer\u2019s nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties.", "Financial institutions must notify their customers about their information  sharing and tell consumers of their right to opt out if they do not want  their information shared with certain non-affiliated third parties.

These officials said that potential risks occur from internal sources  such as employees\u2019 unauthorized access to information and from external  sources such as business clients and computer hackers. To address  internal risks, these officials said they (1) conduct background checks on  employees, (2) train employees on the appropriate way to handle sensitive  information, (3) teach employees about the federal and state laws  governing certain information, (4) require employees to sign written  agreements that specify what they are allowed to do with information that  includes an SSN, and (5) terminate employees and take legal actions  against employees that improperly use or disclose SSNs. For example,  health care organization officials said they train their employees on how to  comply with HIPAA and how to safeguard medical records and other types  of personal information. Some information resellers said that they take  steps to control and monitor employee access to computerized records  that contain SSNs by assigning different levels of access. Employees are,  therefore, only given access to information that they need to perform their  job. In addition, employees\u2019 access to records that contain SSNs was also  monitored. For example, some officials said they track employees  browsing in records in certain databases and monitor any unusual  transactions. In some cases, CRA and health care officials said they  created audit trails for every transaction, and these trails allow them to  track employees\u2019 activities.", "Officials from large information resellers and CRAs also told us that they  take action to mitigate external risks that could result in the unauthorized  use and disclosure of SSNs. Some of these officials said they have \u201cknow  your customer\u201d policies in place. For example, one information reseller  told us that prior to the sale of information, they verify the identity of their  customers and make sure they have the necessary credentials to obtain  access to their information database. Large information resellers and CRA  officials also said they always determine the eligibility of their customers  to have access to their information by conducting audits of their  customers prior to entering into a contract with them. For example, they  determine prior to entering into a formal contract that in the case of a  CRA, the financial institution is what it says it is and is eligible to receive  credit reports. Or, in the case of an information reseller, that a law  enforcement agency is in fact a law enforcement agency and is eligible to  receive motor vehicle information. In conducting their audits, these  entities review customers\u2019 business licenses, perform background and  credit checks, and often visit the entity itself. Some officials did say,  however, that they face certain challenges in protecting SSN data, such as  ensuring that they provide their information to legitimate businesses or  government agencies that have appropriate, legally permissible purposes  to have such information. Nonetheless, there have been cases when the  unauthorized use and disclosure of SSNs have occurred. For example,  CRA officials told us that through their audit process they discovered  instances where their clients have violated their written agreement by  using personal information for non-permissible purposes.", "Large information reseller and CRA officials also said they require their  clients to sign formal agreements acknowledging that the information  provided to them will be used in accordance with permissible activities  under federal and state law. For example, if a business client wanted to  obtain information from a state motor vehicle agency, the client would  have to sign a formal agreement saying that such information would be  used only for permissible purposes, such as the verification of personal  information for the purpose of preventing fraud or the pursuit of legal  remedies against an individual. Representatives of one large reseller that  we spoke to said that they not only require their clients to indicate which  permissible use applies before they give access to information, but they  also have specific access levels, depending on their client\u2019s formal  agreement with them. For example, if the client was an investigative police  unit, then it could be granted full access to the reseller\u2019s databases under  the formal agreement, which included full SSN disclosure as well as other  personally identifiable information. Clients granted this level of access  were subject to background checks and other verification techniques,  such as on-site verifications, by the reseller.", "Once a formal contract has been entered into with a customer, large  information resellers and CRA officials said that they audit their clients to  ensure that they are complying with the legal and contractual restrictions,  such as obtaining credit reports for legitimate business purposes. In  addition, these audits may be conducted either on-site or by mail requiring  the customer to provide documentation regarding the permissible  purposes for the information requested by the customer. Officials from  one entity told us they conduct an Internet \u201csecret shopper\u201d program  whereby they police certain Internet Web sites that sell SSNs to make sure  that their customers are not supplying these sites. In addition, health care  officials said that health insurance companies are audited by state  insurance departments to ensure that, among other things, appropriate  computer safeguards are in place.", "Large information resellers and CRA officials also told us that they are  frequently audited by their customers, who need to ensure that they are in  turn in compliance with the same laws and restrictions they impose on  their clients. For example, CRA officials told us that especially with regard  to GLBA requirements, financial institutions are frequently auditing their  computer systems to make sure they meet standards under GLBA.", "We found that Internet-based information resellers require customers,  upon accessing their Web site, to acknowledge that they will abide by their  \u201cterms and conditions\u201d and indicate the permissible purpose for which  they are obtaining the information. For example, we found that they  required our investigators to concur with the site\u2019s terms and conditions  before any informational service was provided.

Based on our review of select legislative documents  within 18 states, California, Missouri, Arizona, Georgia, Utah, and Texas  had enacted laws to restrict either the display or the use of SSNs. In 2001,  California enacted Senate Bill (SB) 168, restricting private sector use of  SSNs. Specifically, this law generally prohibits companies and persons  from:    posting or publicly displaying SSNs,    printing SSNs on cards required to access the company\u2019s products or  requiring people to transmit an SSN over the Internet unless the  connection is secure or the number is encrypted,  requiring people to log onto a Web site using an SSN without a password,  or   printing SSNs on anything mailed to a customer unless required by law or  the document is a form or application.", "Furthermore, in 2002, shortly after the enactment of SB 168, California\u2019s  Office of Privacy Protection published recommended practices for  protecting the confidentiality of SSNs. These practices were to serve as  guidelines to assist private and public sector organizations in handling  SSNs.", "Similar to California\u2019s law, Missouri\u2019s law (2003 Mo. SB 61), which is not  effective until July 1, 2006, bars companies from requiring individuals to  transmit SSNs over the Internet without certain safety measures, such as  encryption and passwords. However, while SB 61 prohibits a person or  private entity from publicly posting or displaying an individual\u2019s SSN \u201cin  any manner,\u201d unlike California\u2019s law, it does not specifically prohibit  printing the SSN on cards required to gain access to products or services.  In addition, Arizona\u2019s law (2003 Ariz. Sess. Laws 137), effective January 1,  2005, restricts the use of SSNs in ways very similar to California\u2019s law.  However, in addition to the private sector restrictions, it adds certain  restrictions for state agencies and political subdivisions. For example,  state agencies and political subdivisions are prohibited from printing an  individual\u2019s SSN on cards and certain mailings to the individual. Last,  Texas prohibits the display of SSNs on all cards, while the Georgia and  Utah laws are directed at health insurers and, therefore, pertain primarily  to insurance identification cards. None of these three laws contain the  provisions mentioned above relating to Internet safety measures and  mailing restrictions. Table 2 lists states that have enacted legislation and  related provisions.", "During the course of our work, we found that California is at the forefront  with respect to its consumer privacy protection efforts and that the  enactment of its SSN law restricting private sector display of SSNs appears  to have had some nationwide effect on business practices. For example, a  senior manager for at least one private company with locations in  California stated that the company identified 175 areas within its  organization where SSNs were being used, and 130 of these (over 74  percent) were in connection with health care organizations providing  health care services to its employees. As a result, the company has asked  all of its health care providers nationwide\u2014regardless of respective state  laws\u2014to discontinue their display of SSNs on health benefit cards. In  addition, according to officials representing one health care association, as  a result of the California law, by January 2006 all of its health care plans\u2014 located in various states\u2014are required to discontinue displaying SSNs on  their cards. In addition, our review of state legislation and interviews of  state and industry officials show several state laws are very similar to  California\u2019s law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some State Laws and Regulations Extend beyond Similar Federal Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["We found that regulations and laws in 2 of the 18 states we reviewed do  not address SSNs specifically but do extend beyond federal restrictions  regarding the sharing of \u201cpersonal information,\u201d which may include SSNs.  As previously mentioned, GLBA requires that financial institutions provide  consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing personal information with  certain third parties, meaning that unless a consumer notifies the financial  institution not to, the institution may share this information. Alternatively,  financial institutions may disclose nonpublic information to non-affiliated  third parties, including other financial institutions, pursuant to certain  exceptions in GLBA, without providing consumers a right to opt out of  those disclosures. In addition, FCRA allows those with a legitimate, legally  defined purpose or permissible purpose access to consumers\u2019 credit  information. To better address consumer concerns about privacy and the  protection of personal information, however, states such as Vermont and  North Dakota have issued regulations or enacted laws that extend beyond  the provisions of these two federal laws. For example, an Assistant  Attorney General in Vermont stated that while Vermont does not have any  specific laws governing the use of SSNs, it has regulations requiring  banking, insurance, and securities companies to obtain consumers\u2019  permission prior to sharing consumers\u2019 personal information\u2014opt-in  provisions. The Assistant Attorney General added that Vermont\u2019s Fair  Credit Reporting Act has a similar opt-in requirement before permitting  access to consumer credit reports. Furthermore, until Congress passed the  GLBA, North Dakota had a banking privacy law to protect personal  information. This banking law also prohibited financial institutions in  North Dakota from selling or sharing customer data with other companies  unless the individual provided consent. The North Dakota legislature  amended the state\u2019s opt-in privacy law to make it consistent with GLBA\u2019s  opt-out requirement.

Certain state laws, however, limit the  disclosure of some personal information that includes SSNs. Federal laws  that have some restrictions on reselling nonpublic personal information,  such as GLBA, have broad exceptions, which entities can broadly  interpret. This broad interpretation combined with the uncertainty about  the application of the exceptions suggests that reselling personal  information\u2014including SSNs\u2014is likely to continue.", "Private sector officials we spoke to agreed that, given the continued rise in  identity crimes, removing SSNs from public display is a step in the right  direction. However, these officials stated that they had legitimate uses for  the SSN and that restricting business-to-business access or use of such  information would hurt consumers and possibly aid identity thieves in  their attempts to assume an individual\u2019s identity by making it more  difficult for businesses to verify an individual\u2019s identity.
