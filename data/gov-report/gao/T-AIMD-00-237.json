Begun in fiscal year 1998,management reform was seen as a way to transform the District\u2019s operations to provide quality services to its citizens, businesses, and visitors. From fiscal years 1998 through 2000, the District budgeted over $300 million, $33 million of which was federal appropriations, to fund these initiatives. Included in the District\u2019s budgets for this period were projected savings of about $200 million, including $17 million in management reform productivity savings. Because of your concern that little information was available regarding the results achieved from these initiatives, you asked us to provide information on the status of the over 250management reform initiatives; estimated $10 million in management reform productivity savings resulting from these initiatives contained in the fiscal year 1999 budget; estimated $41 million in management savings outlined in the fiscal year $152.4 million in estimated cost savings initiatives contained in the fiscal year 1998 budget as proposed in the previous Mayor\u2019s plan, ATransformed GovernmentofthePeopleofWashington,D.C.", "In summary, over the past 3 fiscal years, the District government has proposed hundreds of management reform initiatives that were estimated to save millions of dollars as well as improve government services. However, as of June 1, 2000, the District had only reported savings of about $1.5 million related to these initiatives and had not consistently tracked the status of these projects. Neither the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the Authority) nor the District could provide adequate details on the goals achieved for all of the projects that had been reported as completed or in various stages of completion. The District does not currently have a systematic process to monitor these management reform projects and determine where savings or customer service improvements have been realized. Consequently, the District cannot say for certain how funds designated for management reform have been spent or whether the key goals of these initiatives have been realized.", "Before discussing these matters in more detail, I will provide some background information to the Subcommittee regarding management reform in the District.

Funding for management reform was to be provided, for the most part, by existing budget authority within agencies and by the fiscal year 1998 surplus that resulted from the federal government\u2019s assumption of the cost of certain functions previously financed through District revenue. The law gave the Authority the power to allocate surplus funds to management reform projects. The Authority reported in the FiscalYear1998Annual PerformanceReport:AReportonServiceImprovementsandManagement Reform,dated October 30, 1998, that the projects were selected using management reform criteria of customer satisfaction; empowering employees; long-term service delivery improvements; and greater internal capacity (through infrastructure changes, staff training, and automation).", "In September 1997, the Authority hired 11 consultants, at a cost of $6.6 million, to develop management reform plans for these agencies and functions. The District\u2019s management reform team, consisting of the Chairman of the Authority, the former Mayor, the Chairman of the City Council, and the heads of each agency, approved the projects for implementation. The Authority then hired a Chief Management Officer (CMO) who was delegated responsibility for these projects. The CMO implemented a system to manage these projects that included development of operational plans, identification of the official directly responsible for each project, and periodic monitoring of each project. Agencies were required to report monthly on expenditures and the results of the projects. On October 30, 1998, the Authority reported in its Fiscal Year1998AnnualPerformanceReportthat 69 projects had been completed. In January 1999, the Authority returned responsibility for the nine city agencies and four citywide functions to the newly elected Mayor.", "District officials told us that the current administration established a new reform agenda that incorporated a small number of the remaining management reform projects. Specifically, the District selected 20of the remaining 200 projects that it considered to be the best projects to be continued in fiscal year 1999. The District also initiated 7 new projects, for a total of 27 projects that were funded in fiscal year 1999.", "To determine the status and results of the District\u2019s management reform initiatives, we reviewed pertinent financial documents and reports provided by the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO), the Authority, the office of the former CMO, and the D.C. City Council. We also interviewed the Deputy Mayor for Operations, the Chief Financial Officer, and other officials from those offices and the Authority.", "We did not audit the District\u2019s management reform funds or expenditures, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on these reported amounts.

According to District officials, the former CMO requested information regarding funds spent for consultants and contractors from the agencies during fiscal year 1998. This information was reported to the OCFO on a monthly basis. However, we found that the data was inconsistent, and no such information related to these management reform projects was requested in fiscal year 1999.

The District does not expect any savings in fiscal year 2000 from the $14 million, which was to be derived from the District\u2019s establishment of a District Supply Schedule. District officials told us that the new Chief Procurement Officer had reviewed the D.C. Supply Schedule initiative in the summer of 1999 and determined that it did not offer advantages beyond existing federal schedules that District agencies were already utilizing. The District expects no savings from the $20 million productivity bank project, nor are these savings directly related to any management reform initiatives. The timing of congressional approval of the federal budget resulted in productivity bank funds not being available to agencies until the second quarter of fiscal year 2000.
