This report discusses whether (1) federal websites complied with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidance on the use of cookies and (2) the guidance provided federal agencies with clear instructions on the use of cookies. GAO reviewed 65 websites randomly selected from the General Services Administration's government domain registry database between November 2000 and January 2001 to determine whether they used persistent cookies and whether such use was disclosed in the website's privacy policy. As of January 2001, most of the websites reviewed were following OMB's guidance on the use of cookies. Of the 65 sites GAO reviewed, 57 did not use persistent cookies on their websites, eight used persistent cookies, four did not disclose such use in their privacy policy, and the remaining four sites using persistent cookies did provide disclosure but did not meet OMB's other conditions for using cookies.

In October 2000, at your request, we provided interim information on federal agencies\u2019 use of cookies, which indicated that seven agencies were using persistent cookies without disclosing such use.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed 65 federal Web sites, including (1) sites operated by 33 high-impact agencies, which handle the majority of the government\u2019s contact with the public, and (2) 32 Web sites randomly selected from the General Services Administration\u2019s government domain registry database. We reviewed these Web sites between November 2000 and January 2001, to determine whether they used persistent cookies and whether such use was disclosed in the Web site\u2019s privacy policy. We then contacted each agency to determine whether the remaining three requirements in the OMB guidance had been met. We also reviewed OMB\u2019s guidance on cookies and interviewed officials from OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).

The information stored in a cookie includes, among other things, the name of the cookie, its unique identification number, its expiration date, and its domain. When a browser requests a page from the server that sent it a cookie, the browser sends a copy of that cookie back to the server. In general, most cookies are placed by the visited Web site. However, some Web sites also allow the placement of a third-party cookie\u2014that is, a cookie placed on a visitor\u2019s computer by a domain other than the site being visited.", "Cookies\u2014whether placed by the visited Web site or a third-party\u2014may be further classified as either session cookies or persistent cookies. Session cookies are short-lived, are used only during the current on-line session, and expire when the user exits the browser. For example, session cookies could be used to support an interactive opinion survey. Persistent cookies remain stored on the user\u2019s computer until a specified expiration date and can be used by a Web site to track a user\u2019s browsing behavior, through potential linkage to other data and whenever the user returns to a site.", "Although cookies help enable electronic commerce and other Web applications, persistent cookies also pose privacy risks even if they do not themselves gather personally identifiable information because the data contained in persistent cookies may be linked to persons after the fact, even when that was not the original intent of the operating Web site. For example, links may be established when persons accessing the Web site give out personal information, such as their names or e-mail addresses, which can uniquely identify them to the organization operating the Web site. Once a persistent cookie is linked to personally identifiable information, it is relatively easy to learn visitors\u2019 browsing habits and keep track of viewed or downloaded Web pages. This practice raises concerns about the privacy of visitors to federal Web sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Has Issued Guidance on Privacy Policies for Federal Web Sites", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the protection of the privacy of visitors to federal Web sites, OMB directed\u2014in Memorandum 99-18, issued in June 1999\u2014every agency to post clear privacy policies on its principal Web site, other major entry points to agency Web sites, and any Web page where the agency collects substantial personal information from the public. Further, the memorandum stated that such polices must inform Web site visitors what information the agency collects about individuals, why it is collected, and how it is used, and that the policies must be clearly labeled and easily accessed when someone visits the site.", "In addition to these specific requirements, the memorandum was accompanied by an attachment entitled \u201cGuidance and Model Language for Federal Web Site Privacy Policies.\u201d OMB attached the guidance and model language for agencies to use, depending on their needs. For example, the discussion in the attachment states that in the course of operating a Web site, certain information may be collected automatically or by cookies, and that in some instances, sites may have the technical ability to collect information and later take additional steps to identify people. The discussion further states that agency privacy policies should make clear whether or not they are collecting this type of information and whether they will take further steps to collect additional information.", "In June 2000, OMB issued further guidance specifically concerning the use of cookies on federal Web sites. Memorandum 00-13 had two major objectives. First, it reminded agencies that they are required by law and policy to establish clear privacy policies for their Web activities and to comply with those policies. To this end, the memorandum reiterated the requirement of Memorandum 99-18 for agencies to post privacy policies on their principal Web sites, major entry points, and other Web pages where substantial amounts of personal information are posted. Second, Memorandum 00-13 established a new federal policy regarding cookies by stating that \u201cparticular privacy concerns may be raised when uses of Web technology can track the activities of users over time and across Web sites.\u201d This guidance established a presumption that cookies would not be used on federal Web sites. Further, it provided that cookies could be used only when agencies (1) provide clear and conspicuous notice of their use, (2) have a compelling need to gather the data on the Web site, (3) have appropriate and publicly disclosed privacy safeguards for handling information derived from cookies, and (4) have personal approval by the head of the agency. The memorandum also directed agencies to provide a description of their privacy practices and the steps they have taken to ensure compliance with this memorandum as part of their information technology budget submission package.", "Concerned about the impact of Memorandum 00-13 on federal Web sites, the Chairman of the CIO Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Privacy subsequently sent a letter to the Administrator of OMB\u2019s OIRA recommending that session cookies be exempt from the requirements of the memorandum. The Chairman noted that the term \u201ccookie\u201d covers a number of techniques used to track information about Web site use, and that there is an important distinction between session and persistent cookies. Although supporting the application of the new policy to persistent cookies, the Chairman recommended that session cookies, which are discarded on completion of a session or expire within a short time frame and are not used to track personal information, not be subject to the requirements of the memorandum. He added that the use of these cookies should, however, continue to be disclosed in the Web sites\u2019 privacy statements.", "In a September 2000 letter responding to the Chairman, the Administrator agreed that persistent cookies are a principal example of a technique for tracking the activities of users over time and across different Web sites, and, thus, agencies should not use persistent cookies unless they have met the four conditions provided in the guidance. Further, the Administrator noted that Web sites could gather information from visitors in ways that do not raise privacy concerns, such as retaining the information only during the session or for the purpose of completing a particular on-line transaction, without the capacity to track the user over time and across different Web sites. The letter concluded that such activities would not fall within the scope of the new policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Federal Web Sites Reviewed Followed OMB Cookie Guidance", "paragraphs": ["As of January 2001, most federal Web sites we reviewed followed OMB\u2019s guidance on the use of cookies. Of the 65 federal Web sites reviewed, 57 did not use persistent cookies.

Two of these four were allowing commercial, third-party sites to place these cookies on the computers of individuals visiting the sites. The four remaining sites using persistent cookies disclosed this use but did not meet OMB\u2019s other conditions. In addition, four sites that did not use persistent cookies did not post privacy policies on their home pages.", "After we brought these findings to their attention, all 12 agencies either took corrective action or stated that they planned to take such action, as follows:   The four sites using persistent cookies without disclosing such use have removed those cookies from their Web sites.", "Two of the four sites using persistent cookies with disclosure have now removed them. Regarding the other two sites, one has recently met all of OMB\u2019s conditions in order to use persistent cookies.

Guidance concerning cookies is currently contained in two official policy memorandums. These documents, taken together, prompted the CIO Council to recommend clarification of OMB\u2019s cookie policy. Although OMB\u2019s response provided useful clarification on the requirements for using persistent cookies, OMB has not yet revised the guidance memorandums themselves. Further, the letter to the CIO Council does not appear on OMB\u2019s Web site with the two guidance memorandums. As a result, federal agencies may not have ready access to the clarifying letter and may be confused as to requirements on the use of cookies.", "OMB\u2019s guidance documents also do not provide clear direction on the disclosure requirements for session cookies. Memorandum 99-18 stated that agency privacy policies should make clear whether information is collected automatically through cookies or other techniques, but it did not distinguish between session and persistent cookies. Memorandum 00-13 established the four conditions for cookie use but, again, did not clearly distinguish between session and persistent cookies. This prompted the CIO Council\u2019s letter recommending clarification. OIRA\u2019s letter in response clarified that Memorandum 00-13 applied only to persistent cookies but did not directly respond to the Council\u2019s recommendation that session cookies continue to be disclosed in Web site privacy policies. This left unresolved questions as to what extent the notice requirements from Memorandum 99-18 apply to session cookies.", "When we asked OMB to clarify the disclosure requirements for session cookies, OIRA officials stated that session cookies do not present a privacy issue; therefore, no disclosure is required. This position, however, may confuse and mislead federal Web site visitors. For example, under this policy, a federal Web site may state in its privacy policy that it is not using cookies, while it continues to give session cookies. If a site visitor has enabled a browser to detect the presence of cookies, it may not be apparent to the visitor whether the cookies they see are session or persistent. This could raise questions about the practices of the Web site that would not be resolved by viewing the privacy policy.", "The Chair of the CIO Council\u2019s Subcommittee on Privacy agreed that the issue is one of clarity rather than privacy.
