As you know, access to credit and investment capital is essential for creating and retaining jobs, developing affordable housing, revitalizing neighborhoods, and promoting the development and growth of small businesses. Community-based financial institutions have improved the economic well-being of economically distressed communities and their residents through lending and investments tailored to these communities. In 1994, recognizing that such community-based institutions were relatively few in number and small in size and often had difficulty meeting the demand for their services, the Congress created the CDFI Fund. To date, the Fund has sought to expand access to credit and other financial services in distressed communities primarily through two programs\u2014the CDFI and the Bank Enterprise Award (BEA) programs. The CDFI program provides financial and technical assistance to a wide range of for-profit and nonprofit financial institutions to support their activities in distressed communities and monitors their performance over a period of at least 5 years. The BEA program rewards banks for increased lending and investments in CDFIs or in distressed communities. To receive their awards, banks must prove that they have made eligible loans or investments, but the Fund has no long-term monitoring role in this program.", "Our testimony today focuses on the first year\u2019s performance of the CDFI and BEA programs and identifies opportunities for improving their effectiveness. Because participants in the CDFI program are just beginning to report preliminary results, our discussion of this program will focus on the Fund\u2019s progress in developing performance measures for awardees and systems to monitor and evaluate their progress. In contrast, participants in the BEA program have largely completed the activities for which they are rewarded; therefore, we will discuss the impact of the program on banks\u2019 investments in CDFIs and distressed communities. Finally, our testimony will review the Fund\u2019s progress in meeting the strategic planning requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Results Act).", "Our testimony is based on the experience of the institutions that received fiscal year 1996 awards. In the CDFI program, the Fund selected 31 of 268 applicants, largely on the basis of the business plans in which they laid out their proposals for economic revitalization and community development. In the BEA program, over 50 banks applied for awards and the Fund chose 38, basing its selection on the increased investments in CDFIs and distressed communities that the banks projected. The Fund reserved about $37 million for awardees in the CDFI program and $13.1 million for banks selected to participate in the BEA program. To obtain in-depth information about the two programs, we visited six CDFIs and five participating banks.", "In summary, our preliminary analysis shows the following: As of January 1998, the Fund had entered into assistance agreements with 26 of the 31 CDFIs that received awards in 1996. These agreements include performance goals and measures that were based on the business plans submitted by awardees in their application packages and negotiated between the Fund and the awardees, as the CDFI Act requires. These agreements are consistent with the program\u2019s objectives. Because the CDFI Act provides no specific guidance for evaluating performance measures, we used the Results Act\u2019s standards. We found that the performance measures in the assistance agreements generally assess activities (such as the number of loans made) rather than accomplishments reflecting the results of activities (such as the number of new low-income homeowners). According to Fund officials and CDFIs in our case studies, this emphasis on activity measures is due, in part, to difficulties in isolating and assessing the results of community development initiatives, which may not be observable for many years and may be subject to factors outside the awardees\u2019 control. We further found that although the performance measures in the assistance agreements are generally related to specific goals, they do not always address all key aspects of the goals, and most assistance agreements lack baseline data that would facilitate tracking progress over time. The Fund has developed reporting requirements for awardees to collect information for monitoring their performance and is developing postaward monitoring procedures for assessing their compliance with their assistance agreements. The Fund currently does not have a system for evaluating the impact of awardees\u2019 activities.", "Although the Fund has disbursed about 80 percent of the fiscal year 1996 BEA award funds, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the program has encouraged the 38 awardees to increase their investments in distressed communities. Our case studies of five awardees and interviews with Fund officials indicate that although the prospect of receiving a BEA award prompted some banks to increase their investments, it had little or no effect on other banks. We found that, in general, other regulatory or economic incentives exerted a stronger influence on banks\u2019 investments than the BEA award. In addition, some banks do not collect all of the data on their activities needed to guarantee that increases in investments under the BEA program are not being offset by decreases in other investments in these distressed areas. Although banks have statutory discretion to use their BEA awards as they choose, their reports to the Fund indicate that they are furthering the BEA program\u2019s objectives by investing a portion or all of their awards in loans or investments supporting community development.", "The CDFI Fund\u2019s strategic plan contains all of the elements required by the Results Act and OMB\u2019s associated guidance, but these elements generally lack the clarity, specificity, and linkage with one another that the act envisioned. Although the plan identifies key external factors that could affect the Fund\u2019s mission, it does not relate these factors to the Fund\u2019s strategic goals and objectives and does not indicate how the Fund will take the factors into account when assessing awardees\u2019 progress toward goals. In addition, the plan does not describe the relationship of its activities to similar activities in other government agencies, and it does not indicate whether or how the Fund coordinated with other agencies in developing its strategic plan. These shortcomings are similar to those in other federal agencies\u2019 initial efforts to comply with the Results Act and OMB\u2019s associated guidance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Currently located within the Department of the Treasury, the CDFI Fund was authorized in 1994 and has received appropriations totaling $225 million through fiscal year 1998.

As of May 8, 1998, the Fund had 27 full-time and 2 part-time staff.", "The Fund\u2019s overall performance is subject to the Results Act. This act seeks to improve the management of federal programs and their effectiveness and efficiency by establishing a system for agencies to set goals for performance and measure the results. Under the act, federal agencies must develop a strategic plan that covers a period of at least 5 years and includes a mission statement, long-term general goals, and strategies for reaching those goals. Agencies must report annually on the extent to which they are meeting their annual performance goals and identify the actions needed to reach or modify the goals they have not met.

On the one hand, the Fund has entered into assistance agreements with most of the 1996 awardees. As the CDFI Act requires, these assistance agreements include performance measures that (1) the Fund negotiated with the awardees and (2) are generally based on the awardees\u2019 business plans. On the other hand, the Fund\u2019s performance goals and measures fall somewhat short of the standards for performance measures established in the Results Act. Although awardees\u2019 assistance agreements are not subject to the Results Act, the act establishes performance measurement standards for the federal government, including the CDFI Fund. In the absence of specific guidance on performance measures in the CDFI Act, we drew on the Results Act\u2019s standards for discussion purposes.", "The assistance agreements called for under the CDFI Act require awardees to comply with multiple provisions, including the accomplishment of agreed-upon levels of performance by the final evaluation date, typically 5 years in the future. As of January 1998, the Fund had entered into assistance agreements with 26 of the 31 awardees for 1996. We found, on the basis of our six case studies, that the Fund had negotiated performance goals that met the statutory requirements and established goals for awardees that match the Fund\u2019s intended purpose, extensively involved the awardees in crafting their planned performance, and produced a flexible schedule for designing goals and measures.", "According to the Results Act, both activity measures, such as the number of loans made, and accomplishment measures, such as the number of new low-income homeowners, are useful measures. However, the act regards accomplishment measures as more effective indicators of a program\u2019s results because such measures identify the impact of the activities performed. Our survey of CDFIs nationwide, including the 1996 awardees, and our review of six case study awardees\u2019 business plans showed that CDFIs use both types of measures to assess their progress toward meeting their goals. Yet our review of the 1996 awardees\u2019 assistance agreements revealed a far greater use of activity measures. As a result, the assistance agreements focus primarily on what the awardees will do, rather than on how their activities will affect the distressed communities. According to most of the case study awardees, difficulties in isolating and measuring the results of community development efforts and concerns about the effects of factors outside the awardees\u2019 control inhibited the awardees\u2019 use of accomplishment measures.", "According to the Results Act, goals and measures should be related and clear. We found that most of the goals and measures were related; however, in some agreements, the measures did not address all key aspects of the goals. Finally, under the Results Act, clarity in performance measurement is best achieved through the use of specific units, well-defined terms, and baseline and target values and dates. While the measures in the agreements included most of these elements, they generally lacked baseline values and dates. Fund officials told us that they used baseline values and dates in negotiating the performance measures, but this information did not appear in the assistance agreements themselves. Therefore, without information contained in awardees\u2019 files, it is difficult to determine the level of increase or contribution the investment is intended to achieve.", "Refining the awardees\u2019 goals and measures to meet the Results Act will facilitate the Fund\u2019s assessment of the awardees\u2019 progress over time.

In addition, the Fund has not yet established procedures for evaluating the impact of awardees\u2019 activities. The effectiveness of the Fund\u2019s monitoring and evaluation systems will depend, in large part, on the quality of the information being collected through the required reports and the Fund\u2019s assessment of awardees\u2019 compliance and the impact of awardees\u2019 activities. Primarily because of statutorily imposed staffing restrictions in fiscal years 1995 and 1996 and subsequent departmental hiring restrictions, the Fund has had a limited number of staff to develop and implement its monitoring and evaluation systems. In fiscal year 1998, it began to hire management and professional staff to develop monitoring and evaluation policies and procedures.", "The Fund has established quarterly and annual reporting requirements for awardees in their assistance agreements. Each awardee is to describe its progress toward its performance goals, demonstrate its financial soundness, and maintain appropriate financial information. However, according to an independent audit recently completed by KPMG Peat Marwick, the Fund lacks formal, documented postaward monitoring procedures to guide Fund staff in their oversight of awardees\u2019 activities. In addition, Fund officials indicated that they had not yet established a system to verify information submitted by awardees through the reporting processes.", "Fund staff told us that they had not developed postaward monitoring procedures because of the CDFI program\u2019s initial staffing limits. Now that additional staff are in place, they have begun to focus their attention on monitoring issues, including those identified by KPMG Peat Marwick.", "The CDFI statute also specifies that the Fund is to annually evaluate and report on the activities carried out by the Fund and the awardees. According to the Conference Report for the statute, the annual reports are to analyze the leveraging of private assistance with federal funds and determine the impact of spending resources on the program\u2019s investment areas, targeted populations, and qualified distressed communities. To date, the Fund has published two annual reports, the second of which contains an estimate of the private funding leveraged by the CDFI funding. This estimate is based on discussions with CDFIs and CDFI trade association representatives, not on financial data collected from the awardees. Anecdotal information from three of our six case study awardees indicates that the CDFI funding has assisted them in leveraging private funding. One awardee estimated that the Fund\u2019s award generated more than three times its value in private investment.", "In part because it has been only 15 months since the Fund made its first investment in a CDFI, information on performance in the CDFI program is not yet available for a comprehensive evaluation of the program\u2019s impact, such as the Conference Report envisions. The two annual reports include anecdotes about individuals served by awardees and general descriptions of awardees\u2019 financial services and initiatives, but they do not evaluate the impact of the program on its investment areas, targeted populations, and qualified distressed communities. Satisfying this requirement will entail substantial research and analysis, as well as expertise in evaluation and time for the program\u2019s results to unfold.", "Fund officials have acknowledged that their evaluation efforts must be enhanced, and they have planned or taken actions toward improvement. For instance, the Fund has developed preliminary program evaluation options, begun hiring staff to conduct or supervise the research and evaluations, and revised the assistance agreements for the 1997 awardees to require that they annually submit a report to assist the Fund in evaluating the program\u2019s impact. However, because the Fund has not yet finished hiring its research and evaluation staff, it has not yet reached a final decision on what information it will require from the awardees to evaluate the program\u2019s impact.

Through February 1998, the Fund had received 41 quarterly reports from 19 CDFIs, including community development banks, community development credit unions, nonprofit loan funds, microenterprise loan funds, and community development venture capital funds. The different types of CDFIs support a variety of activities, whose results will be measured against different types of performance measures.", "Given the variety of performance measures for the different types of CDFIs, it is difficult to summarize the performance reported by the 19 CDFIs. To illustrate cumulative activity in the program to date, we compiled the data reported for the two most common measures\u2014the total number of loans for both general and specific purposes and the total dollar value of these loans.

Our case studies of five awardees and interviews with Fund officials indicate that although the BEA awards encouraged some banks to increase their investments, other regulatory or economic incentives were equally or more important for other banks. In addition, more complete data on some banks\u2019 investments are needed to guarantee that the increases in investments in distressed areas rewarded by the BEA program are not being offset by decreases in other investments in these distressed areas. The Fund has tried to measure the program\u2019s impact by estimating the private investments leveraged through the BEA awards. However, this estimate includes banks\u2019 existing, as well as increased, investments in distressed areas. Furthermore, the Fund cannot be assured that the banks\u2019 increased investments remain in place because it does not require banks to report any material changes in these investments. Although the CDFI statute does not require awardees to reinvest their awards in community development, banks have reported to the Fund that they have done so, thereby furthering the BEA program\u2019s objectives, according to the Fund.

In addition, a CDFI Fund official told us that some CDFIs marketed the prospect of receiving a BEA award as an incentive for banks to invest in them. We found, however, that the prospect of an award did not influence other banks\u2019 investment activity. For example, two banks received awards totaling over $324,000 for increased investments they had made or agreed to make before the fiscal year 1996 awards were made.", "Banks have multiple incentives for investing in CDFIs and distressed areas. Therefore, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the BEA award from the effects of other incentives; however the receipt of a BEA award is predicated on a bank\u2019s increasing investments in community development. Discussions with our five case study banks indicated, however, that regulatory and economic incentives have a greater influence on these banks\u2019 investments than the prospect of a BEA award. A reason that the banks frequently cited for investing in CDFIs and distressed areas was the need to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Economic considerations also motivated the banks. One bank said that such investments lay the groundwork for developing new markets, while other banks said that the investments help them maintain market share in areas targeted by the BEA program and compete with other banks in these areas. Two banks cited improved community relations as reasons for their investments.

Concerned about the validity of the net increases in investments in distressed areas reported by awardees, the Fund required the 1996 awardees that did not maintain such data to certify that, to the best of their knowledge, they had not decreased investments in distressed areas that were not linked to their BEA award.

The CDFI later repaid a portion of the bank\u2019s total investment. Because the Fund does not require banks to report their postaward activity, the Fund was not aware of this situation until we brought it to the attention of Fund officials.

For example, the effects of investment in community development may not be readily distinguishable from other influences and may not be observable for many years.

Recently, however, the Fund has hired several senior staff\u2014including a director; two deputy directors, one of whom also serves as the chief financial officer; an awards manager; a financial manager; and program managers\u2014and is reportedly close to hiring an evaluations director. While it is too early to assess the impact of filling these positions, the new managers have initiated actions to improve the programs and the strategic plan.
