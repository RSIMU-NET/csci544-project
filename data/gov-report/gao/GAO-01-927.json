Generally, at each DOE laboratory, researchers independently propose projects that are judged by peer panels and managers for their potential scientific merit. Only the most promising projects are to be chosen for LDRD funding. Most projects cost $100,000 to $300,000 and last 2 to 3 years. The laboratories pay for these projects by assessing their regular programs\u2019 budgets a maximum of 6 percent\u2014 except for fiscal year 2000, when the Congress limited the amount to 4 percent\u2014and putting that money into a separate LDRD account.

In addition, we examined oversight practices used by DOE\u2019s headquarters and field offices for the LDRD program. We also randomly selected five projects from each laboratory for detailed analysis and evaluation.

Because of our coverage, we believe our findings reflect the condition of the review and selection processes for the vast majority of DOE\u2019s LDRD program.

DOE\u2019s implementation of its authority to conduct discretionary research evolved over the years. For example, in 1983, DOE Order 5000.1A formally established a discretionary R&D program called Exploratory Research and Development (ER&D); in 1992, DOE Order 5000.4A established the current LDRD program, which includes the previously defined ER&D program and other discretionary work, and further memorialized its long-standing policy of allowing its multi-program national laboratories the discretion to conduct self-initiated, independent R&D; and in 1997, DOE revised its LDRD program direction in DOE Order 413.2 providing clearer guidance on how LDRD funds may and may not be used.", "Each of DOE\u2019s nine multi-program national laboratories has an LDRD program.

By contrast, DOE\u2019s other laboratories generally spend less than 4 percent of their budgets on LDRD projects. (See table 2.)", "Each of the nine multi-program national laboratories established separate but similar LDRD categories of funding, using these as guides to selecting proposals. The number of categories ranged from one to five. In most laboratories, the largest category contained projects that aligned most closely with the laboratory\u2019s strategic missions, such as the principal missions of national security at the defense laboratories and fundamental science at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. These types of LDRD projects tended to be larger and were expected to have nearer-term results. The second largest category was generally directed at building scientists\u2019 skills and strengthening laboratory competencies. Generally, the laboratories target the smallest amount of funding to projects that are the highest risk and most cutting-edge as shown in the following examples:  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has three main categories of funding. Strategic Initiatives projects represent 27 percent of all LDRD funds, focus on research addressing national needs in support of the laboratory\u2019s strategic vision, and are larger multidisciplinary projects. Exploratory Research projects received 67 percent of the funds, support the strategic vision and competencies building of programs and directorates across the laboratory, and are smaller than the Strategic Initiatives projects. Laboratory-wide projects received about 6 percent of the funds, are designed to encourage creativity of individual scientists in the pursuit of innovative research, and are funded at a maximum of $180,000. A category of funding that receives less than 1 percent of the laboratory\u2019s LDRD funds\u2014 Definition and Feasibility Study projects\u2014provides the seeds for new research ideas and are usually funded for less than 6 months and $50,000.", "The Los Alamos National Laboratory has two categories of LDRD projects. Directed Research projects received about two-thirds of the funds, support the laboratory\u2019s strategic plan, are typically multidisciplinary, and generally cost $1 million or more. Exploratory Research projects received about one-third of LDRD funds, are usually smaller and the most innovative, and generally cost $250,000 or less.", "The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has three categories for LDRD projects. Laboratory-level projects received about two-thirds of the laboratory\u2019s LDRD funds and are for projects that directly align with the laboratory\u2019s primary research areas, are generally multiyear and multidisciplinary, and cost from $100,000 to $250,000. Division- level projects received about one-third of the LDRD funds, are aimed at developing new ideas in a particular mission area, have intermediate and near-term mission relevance, and cost from $80,000 to $100,000. Level VI projects, which received a total of about $500,000 of the laboratory\u2019s LDRD budget, are intended to support highly innovative ideas, and typically cost less than $60,000 each.", "DOE and laboratory officials believe that the innovative nature of LDRD projects helps attract new scientists who can contribute to maintaining the vitality of the laboratories. Those officials focusing on national security issues believe that the LDRD program helps attract scientists who can eventually perform national security research work. They believe that because nuclear weapons science is not taught in colleges and must be taught within the defense laboratories, LDRD projects\u2014and the scientists they attract\u2014are vital for national security in the long term. For example, postdoctoral students represent a major source of future research staff at the laboratories, and most of them are hired to work on LDRD projects. Sixty-two percent of Sandia\u2019s postdoctoral staff hired between 1996 and 1999 worked on LDRD projects.", "DOE\u2019s Laboratory Operations Board, comprising internal managers and external consultants, reported, in January 2000, that LDRD programs are vital in recruiting and retaining the best scientific talent into the laboratories.

Officials from nondefense program laboratories also told us that LDRD projects are important for attracting and maintaining scientific talent in their laboratories.

The project involves developing complex integrated simulation tools that will advance fundamental research in the areas of mathematical foundations of simulation, issues in implementing and computing for large simulations, statistical methods for simulation-based studies, and principles for simulation-based assisted reasoning.

The physical size of a magnetic system may affect its magnetic properties; this project proposes to study this phenomenon and make major inroads in understanding the fundamental issues of low-dimensional magnetic systems. These issues require a basic understanding of magnetic thin films and multilayers used in computing today as well as a deeper understanding of one- dimensional nanotechnology and synthesis of materials in this environment. The project managers plan to develop samples unprecedented in the study of lower-dimensional systems to better explore fundamental questions about the next-generation magnetism research.

The goal of this proposed LDRD project is to show that earlier detection, based on cellular-level changes in the body through blood analysis, could be accomplished. The project also aims to develop techniques and models to detect and analyze infection without waiting for external symptoms. The results could reduce disease detection time from days to hours. The development of a rapid, highly sensitive screening mechanism would also have widespread application in the fight against other infectious diseases.

Also, certain publications have higher levels of difficulty and achievement and, therefore, significance. The same issue surrounds the tabulation of awards as performance indicators. Likewise, symposia, as well as other potential measures, carry different degrees of significance. Many suggested that success stories are the best measures of a project\u2019s performance, particularly for basic research whose ultimate value may not be evident for a long time.
