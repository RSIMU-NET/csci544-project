Officials from selected courts and representatives from organizations GAO spoke to described their observations about elder abuse by a guardian, including that one of the most common types appeared to be financial exploitation. Some efforts are under way to try to collect better data on elder abuse and guardianship at the federal, state, and local levels to support decision making and help prevent and address elder abuse by guardians. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) plans to launch the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System\u2014a national reporting system based on data from state Adult Protective Services (APS) agency information systems by early 2017. According to HHS and its contractor, this system has the capability to collect information that could specifically help identify cases of elder abuse where a guardian was involved.

The  official stated the number of new adult guardianships is partially  estimated because about half of the courts in the state report a  combined number of guardianships for minors and adults.", "Florida. A court official in Florida acknowledged that the court does  not collect guardianship and elder abuse information such as the  number of guardians for older adults, the types of guardians currently  serving in guardianship roles for older adults, and the number of elder  abuse hearings conducted. This official cited lack of funding as a  barrier for collecting this type of information. Detailed information on  financial exploitation specifically may be available at the county level.

These representatives explained that cases of elder abuse may appear  as other charges, such as assault, battery, or theft. Identifying all cases  involving elder abuse, and more specifically that by a guardian, would  require a difficult manual review of a large volume of court cases.

At the request of SSA, the  Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) administered and  analyzed the results of a survey of judges, court staff, and guardians to  review guardianship practices in state courts in 2014. The survey  collected information regarding appointment, monitoring, and discipline of  guardians; caseloads and electronic case-management capabilities; and  court interaction with federal agencies and other organizations.

A prosecutor in one of the states  we spoke to shared her observation that the majority of financial  exploitation by professional guardians is done through overcharging for  services that were either not necessary or were never performed.

According to  HHS officials and the contractor developing NAMRS, this system will  have the capability to collect information that could help identify cases of  elder abuse where a guardian was involved. For example, NAMRS can  collect information about substitute decision makers, including guardians,  associated with the complaint such as whether there was a substitute  decision maker at the start and end of the investigation, whether the  perpetrator was the older adult\u2019s substitute decision maker, and what  recommendations or actions the state APS agency initiated against the  perpetrator. An official from the Administration on Aging stated that the  pilot phase of the system is complete and the agency hopes to roll it out  for data submissions from all states by early 2017.", "Representatives from the National Adult Protective Services Association  stated that NAMRS would provide important information that could inform  the guardianship process once fully implemented. For example, a court  official from Florida suggested that having more information on elder  abuse by a guardian may help guardianship programs decide whether to  place more focus on screening, education, and monitoring of guardians,  and enforcement of policies and laws governing guardians, as described  later in this report.", "In addition to this federal effort, some state and local efforts are also  under way to collect better data on elder abuse and guardianship.

A court official in Florida told us that in the fall of  2016, the Chief Justice of Florida will appoint a workgroup under the  state\u2019s Judicial Management Council to examine judicial procedures  and best practices related to guardianship to help ensure that courts  are protecting these individuals. Similarly, in Texas, the Office of  Court Administration started the Guardianship Compliance Pilot  Project, which provides additional resources to courts handling  guardianships by supplementing local staff to review compliance with  statutory requirements and by developing an electronic database to  monitor guardianship filings of initial inventory and annual  accountings. Information collected includes the number of courts  involved in the project, the number of guardianships reviewed, the  number of guardianships out of compliance with required reporting,  the number of guardians reported to the court for person under  guardianship well-being or financial exploitation concerns, and the  status of technology developed to monitor guardianship filings.", "Collecting complaint data.

The National Guardianship  Association has developed standards of practice that define a  guardian\u2019s duty to comply with laws and regulations; the guardian\u2019s  relationship with the courts, protected persons, and others; and other  duties to the person under guardianship. Also, the Center for  Guardianship Certification has developed a certification program that  tests a prospective certified guardian\u2019s ability to apply these standards  of practice. Under this certification program, certified guardians must  meet continuing educational requirements to maintain their status as  professional guardians. According to the Center for Guardianship  Certification, 12 states require professional guardians to be certified,  including 8 states that require certification via the use of Center for  Guardianship Certification examinations, as of September 2016.", "Educational materials. Courts in all six of the selected states we  spoke to post written guidance for guardians online. These guides  explain the responsibilities and duties associated with becoming a  guardian while providing other potentially useful information. For  example, a guide from California discusses the importance of  separating funds of guardian and of persons under guardianship by  warning guardians that mixing their money with that of the persons  under guardianship could get the guardian in serious trouble.  Minnesota has also made online videos that explain the guardianship  process as well as guardian roles and responsibilities. In conjunction  with the NCSC, North Dakota developed a web-based information  seminar that guardians can use to better understand their  responsibilities. The training is scenario-based and helps the trainee  understand his or her options, and was designed to be easily modified  for replication in other states. One challenge that one official noted is  that it can be difficult to reach family guardians to provide them with  educational materials. Also, even when family guardians can be  reached, one stakeholder suggested that a 30-minute training video is  unlikely to radically enhance guardian performance when a guardian  is faced with some of the more complicated scenarios.", "Support for guardians. One of the stakeholders we spoke with  suggested that guardians and persons under guardianship would  benefit from other initiatives, such as states providing guardians with a  mechanism to ask questions and allowing guardians to receive  positive feedback when something went well instead of just warnings  when something went wrong. Another stakeholder told us it would be  beneficial for guardians to interact with one another to finds ways to  achieve better outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["According to some of the stakeholders we spoke with, most states require  guardians to be monitored, but the level of oversight and specific  requirements vary by state. On the basis of our review of published  materials and interviews with various state courts and nongovernmental  stakeholders, we observed the following promising practices and  challenges related to monitoring.", "In person visits and well-being checks. To monitor the person  under guardianship\u2019s personal well-being, one stakeholder told us  courts in every state should periodically send a court investigator to  conduct an unannounced site visit to check on that individual.", "Examinations of guardian expenditures. A state court official we  spoke with cautioned that, without effective monitoring, guardians  basically have free access to the person under guardianship\u2019s money  and other officials we interviewed outlined some specific related  measures. For example, an official from one organization suggested  that steps should be taken to help ensure that fees are appropriate for  the services rendered (e.g., attorneys should not charge attorney  rates for grocery shopping), while another representative of a different  organization suggested that fees should be capped to help protect  persons under guardianship. Other related suggestions from various  stakeholders included independent reviews of mandatory annual  financial reports, an initial inventory of the person under  guardianship\u2019s assets, and utilizing effective accounting controls to  help protect that individual\u2019s assets. Technology can be used to  support the oversight process. For example, as previously described,  Minnesota monitors the state\u2019s conservators using an online program  that allows auditors to flag suspicious spending patterns and other  warning signs for potential abuse.", "Despite the known importance of monitoring efforts, stakeholders  described how challenges in monitoring guardians often arise from  resource limitations. According to one of the stakeholders we interviewed,  courts often do not have the resources to employ court visitors,  investigators, auditors, or robust case-management systems for tracking  key filings and case events. Another stakeholder told us that guardians  are supposed to submit annual reports about persons under  guardianship, and in many states and counties these reports are filed, but  no one checks to see if the reports have been filed on time or to verify if  what is reported is accurate.", "In addition, other monitoring efforts can be limited. For example, a court  official in Washington told us some reviews are paper audits where no  one conducts a site visit to the person under guardianship to verify his or  her well-being. Representatives from the National Guardianship  Association told us that while guardianships have some oversight, there is  significant variation in the level of oversight performed by different states.  The investment in monitoring the activity of guardians is up to local  counties and constrained by resources. One of the recurring themes  these representatives find when they examine guardianship issues is that  states would like to apply more robust oversight, but the states say that  there are not enough resources available to investigate and oversee  these cases.", "To help overcome resource limitations, the American Bar Association and  AARP have developed programs courts can use to recruit and train  volunteers to help monitor guardian activities. While there are some costs  associated with these programs, according to stakeholders, they can  reduce the burden on courts for monitoring guardian activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["Enforcement activities punish the guardian for his or her abusive actions  against a person under guardianship, deter future abuse by sending the  message that the abuse of older adults by guardians will not be tolerated,  and at times may allow for restitution to the victim. On the basis of our  review of published materials and interviews with various state courts and  nongovernmental stakeholders, we observed the following promising  practices and challenges related to enforcement.", "Complaint systems. In addition to providing educational benefits to  guardians, certification systems can provide states with a mechanism  for receiving complaints and addressing noncriminal guardian  performance issues (e.g., not submitting required accountings), while  offering other potential certification-related benefits such as screening  opportunities and continuing education requirements. In states that  certify guardians, complaints may also be directed to the guardianship  certification board. State-operated hotlines can also help identify  cases of abuse. For example, the Palm Beach County Clerk\u2019s  Inspector General set up a hotline that allows the public to report  concerns about guardians via telephone, e-mail, or the Internet, or in- person. From fiscal year 2011 through February 2016, the Palm  Beach County Clerk\u2019s Inspector General reported 516 contacts, 250  of which were actionable. However, multiple stakeholders also  identified some challenges related to complaints. For example, some  of the representatives we spoke with stated that it may be difficult or  impossible for people with diminished capacity to file a complaint  about a guardian, so complaints typically originate from family  members. Also, one of the stakeholders we interviewed told us it is  not always clear where complaints about guardians should be sent,  but that anyone with an elder-abuse related concern could contact law  enforcement agencies or the state APS agency. In addition, this  stakeholder told us that courts may have complaint processes, but it  can be difficult to navigate these processes without effective counsel.", "Dedicated investigative resources. Palm Beach County, Florida,  dedicated resources to independently audit guardian spending reports  and also dedicated resources to the investigation and monitoring of  guardianship-related activities, which has had a positive effect,  according to officials there. A prosecutor that we spoke with in San  Diego discussed similar efforts in his jurisdiction, but noted that law- enforcement entities in most cities do not have departments dedicated  to investigating elder abuse.", "Appropriate disciplinary measures. Guardianship enforcement  activities can range from removing guardians for poor performance to  prosecution for overt criminal actions. States that apply such  measures appropriately can punish bad actors, obtain restitution for  victims, and deter future abuse. However, there can be investigative  and prosecutorial challenges associated with cases of elder abuse by  a guardian. Stakeholders we spoke to highlighted obstacles that can  obstruct efforts to punish abusive guardians. For example, a  prosecutor in Washington noted that when abuse by guardians takes  the form of overcharging an older adult for the guardian\u2019s services,  because the courts have approved the payments in question it is  virtually impossible for the prosecutor\u2019s office to file charges. This  prosecutor explained that a guardian charged with financial  exploitation in such a case would be able to argue that the fees he or  she obtained were appropriate because they were sanctioned by the  courts; this would almost certainly prevent such a guardian from being  found guilty at trial. Also, a prosecutor in California opined that law- enforcement officials generally feel that when someone is in a position  of trust, law enforcement officials cannot and should not get involved.  Specifically, they feel it is a civil matter that should be handled in the  civil jurisdiction. Other representatives we spoke with raised concerns  about the cost of investigating cases of potential abuse. For example,  representatives from the National Guardianship Association noted the  forensic analysis to identify evidence in these cases can cost $20,000  or more for just one case. Other challenges relate to the penalties  associated with these crimes. For example, an official in Washington  has noted the sentences tend to be insignificant and jail time can  often be avoided. This official also noted that prosecutors will rarely  proceed with cases that do not exceed certain dollar thresholds."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report.

Federal agencies  are responsible for oversight of representative payees assigned under  these programs, while state and local courts are responsible for oversight  of guardianship appointments. A representative payee may also be a  guardian, and some beneficiaries with a representative payee may also  have a guardian. According to a white paper prepared for the Elder  Justice Coordinating Council, the representative payee and the guardian  might or might not be the same person or organization. Table 3 shows  the number of beneficiaries who are older adults and have representative  payees, as well as the number of representative payees and court- appointed guardians or conservators that the respective federal agency is  aware of.", "We have previously found that, among other things, poor communication  between the courts and federal agencies has enabled guardians to  chronically abuse persons under guardianship and others. In 2011, we  found that information sharing among federal fiduciary programs and  state courts could improve the protection of older adults with guardians.  More specifically, we found that information about SSA\u2019s incapable  beneficiaries and their representative payees could help state courts (1)  avoid appointing individuals who, while serving as SSA representative  payees, have misused beneficiaries\u2019 SSA payments in the past, and (2)  provide courts with potential candidates for guardians when there are no  others available. At that time, we recommended that SSA should  determine how it can, under current law, disclose certain information  about beneficiaries and fiduciaries to state courts upon request,  potentially proposing legislative changes to allow such disclosure. Upon  review of our recommendation, SSA determined it could not disclose  information about SSA beneficiaries and representative payees to state  courts for the purposes of determining guardianship without written  consent because legal limitations prevent the sharing of this information.", "While we continue to believe that it is in the best interest of incapable  SSA beneficiaries for the agency to disclose certain information about  beneficiaries and fiduciaries to state courts, SSA officials with whom we  spoke in 2016 maintain that the agency cannot disclose information  regarding SSA beneficiaries and representative payees to courts for the  purposes of determining guardianship issues without written consent,  unless a Privacy Act exception applies. SSA officials also told us they  were not aware of any routine exchanges of information between state  courts and their agency; however SSA does share limited information  about representative payees with other federal agencies when legally  authorized to do so.", "Officials from state courts we spoke to also reiterated the need for  increased coordination and communication with federal representative  payee programs. For example, a court official in Washington explained  that it is important for courts to know when there is an issue with a  representative payee who is trying to become a guardian, and it is also  important for SSA to know when there is a problem guardian. Also, court  officials in Ohio described another challenge related to their monitoring  efforts that occurs when they are unaware of significant increases in the  assets of the person under guardianship, caused by the receipt of sizable  back payments paid by SSA.", "As described in this report, the Administrative Conference of the United  States administered and analyzed the results of a survey of judges, court  staff, and guardians to review, among other things, court interaction with  federal agencies. In August 2016, SSA officials told us the agency was  using the study to make improvements that will leverage the work of state  courts in SSA\u2019s process for determining whether a representative payee  is necessary. For example, SSA is exploring whether the agency could  automatically appoint guardians\u2014or individuals who are currently serving  in a similar capacity\u2014as representative payees. Additionally, SSA  officials told us they are using the results to identify better ways to  communicate with state and local courts and the guardians appointed by  these entities.
