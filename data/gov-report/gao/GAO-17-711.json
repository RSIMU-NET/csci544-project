For example, contract obligations were relatively stable at NASA and USCIS. CFPB, on the other hand, saw an increase in obligations due to ramping up operations from 2011, when the agency began operations. Variances in FEMA's obligations stemmed primarily from fluctuations in NFIP contracts due to changing priorities. The number of public affairs employees generally increased at the selected agencies, but was relatively stable at NASA. These increases were due to changes in operations and staffing structure. For example, USCIS changed its staffing model to add more lower-level public affairs staff. Officials at three of the four agencies we reviewed noted an increased use of digital media for public outreach, though the effects on contract and staff resources have been mixed.", "The agencies measured performance of their activities using web-based and other indicators, such as the number of website visits and length of time spent on a page, and reported using this information to inform decision making.

These four contracts all focused on increasing general awareness of the  tools and resources CFPB offers to the public to promote better financial  decision making. Contract documentation linked the need for increasing  general awareness of CFPB\u2019s tools and resources to CFPB\u2019s statutory  responsibility to develop and implement initiatives intended to educate  and empower consumers to make better financial decisions. According to  CFPB officials, promoting awareness of CFPB\u2019s tools and the services it  provides is intended to increase their use. In particular, research  conducted by a CFPB contractor in 2015 showed that before CFPB\u2019s  campaign to increase awareness of its tools and resources, awareness  and use of these tools and resources had remained level over the prior two and a half years.

The largest of FEMA\u2019s advertising and public relations contracts  represented just over 40 percent of all obligations for these contracts over  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 ($8.7 million out of $20.7 million). This  contract, and several others, supported the National Flood Insurance  Program (NFIP). According to FEMA officials, part of its role in  administering the NFIP involves public communications and advertising to  encourage people to buy flood insurance to better prepare themselves for  disaster. FEMA\u2019s other high-value contracts included ones for services  promoting emergency preparedness, including those supporting the  Ready campaign.

For example, a USCIS public affairs official told us that the  agency contracts for services related to outreach in situations where  contractual services will save time and money or result in higher quality,  such as providing a daily delivery of news clippings and media references  to the agency, and maintaining a media contact database that agency  staff use for outreach. Additionally, a NASA public affairs official told us  that the agency contracts for services that employees do not have the  expertise to do.

Officials told us that during fiscal years  2013 through 2015, they piloted campaigns and conducted research on  outreach. The results of these pilot campaigns and research informed  later outreach activities. Increases in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 were  due primarily to two contracts that focused on increasing awareness of  CFPB and the tools it offers consumers. CFPB officials told us that fiscal  year 2016 obligations reflect full operations, and they expect future years\u2019  obligations to be more consistent.", "The changes in FEMA obligations over the past decade are due in large  part to changes in three contracts related to supporting outreach and  customer support services for the agency\u2019s National Flood Insurance  Program (NFIP). For example, in fiscal year 2010, most of the agency\u2019s  obligations for advertising and public relations services (about $12.5  million out of a total of $16.2 million) were for an integrated marketing,  advertising, and public relations services contract for the NFIP. In fiscal  year 2011, the amount obligated to that contract dropped to about $1  million. In fiscal year 2016, FEMA obligated about $8.7 million for another  contract supporting the NFIP, which drove the sharp increase in  obligations in that year.

FEMA officials  emphasized the usefulness of these media in obtaining information from  the public by gaining awareness of conditions during disasters. For  example, FEMA guidance described how during Hurricane Sandy public  affairs employees were able to use social media to obtain information  about power outages, volunteering and donations, and concerns about  the response efforts. A USCIS public affairs official also said that digital  media have improved and changed the agency\u2019s reach. For example,  USCIS has been working to provide customer service online by doing  things like holding \u201coffice hours\u201d on Twitter, during which Twitter users  can post questions, which are answered by USCIS staff (see figure 6).", "The increased use of digital media has had mixed effects on resources at  the agencies we reviewed.

With the exception of  NASA, each agency used contracts and public affairs staff to support a  major outreach initiative. These agencies also assigned to contractors  responsibility for supporting performance assessment of those initiatives.  For example, USCIS contracts supporting education and outreach  initiatives for the E-Verify and SAVE programs directed the contractors to  develop performance indicators to analyze and assess the results of  outreach efforts. Appendix II provides examples of how the agencies we  reviewed assessed the performance of selected major initiatives.", "Agencies also assign responsibility to public affairs employees to assess  the outreach activities they support. Position descriptions for public affairs  staff at all four of the agencies we reviewed specifically included  assessment of agency outreach activities. For example, a NASA public  affairs official told us that public affairs staff are involved in reviewing data  on how many people read certain features and analyzing the effects of  releasing new information, such as photos taken from spacecraft. The  agency\u2019s Internet manager, who is classified under the public affairs  occupational series, supervises the review of analytic information.", "Officials at the agencies we reviewed told us that they use performance  information to inform decisions about outreach activities. For example:", "FEMA officials told us that they use the results of emergency  preparedness surveys to inform the focus of future advertising for the  Ready campaign. In response to people reporting lack of time as a  barrier to discussing emergency preparedness with family members,  FEMA developed messages for its Ready initiative focused on  working towards emergency preparedness while doing other daily  tasks, such as driving to school or eating dinner.", "USCIS used a report summarizing lessons learned from fiscal year  2016 outreach about the E-Verify program to inform fiscal year 2017  outreach efforts. The report included an assessment of which efforts  in fiscal year 2016 most successfully supported objectives such as  building awareness of the program. It included performance  indicators, such as the number of times an online advertisement is  shown on a search result page or other site (impressions), and the  number of times a person clicks on an on-line advertisement (clicks).  The summary report recommended approaches for fiscal year 2017  based on lessons learned from fiscal year 2016 performance.", "Despite the usefulness of web-based indicators and other tools used to  measure outreach activities, officials at the agencies we reviewed  acknowledged some challenges in using them. The following are  examples of challenges officials at our case study agencies identified:", "Lack of qualitative feedback: Officials at USCIS and CFPB told us  that while they have access to several indicators related to  performance of outreach (for example, number of visitors to a site or  downloads of materials), these indicators are not the same as  understanding whether and how information is being used. A USCIS  public affairs official said that the agency has this challenge with  outreach through both digital and traditional media. For example,  USCIS staff have information on the circulation of a newspaper in  which they have placed an advertisement, but without additional  assessment, it is difficult for staff to know how or if someone used  information in the advertisement or had a favorable impression of it.", "Difficulty measuring long-term effects: NASA officials told us that  digital media offers the ability to get virtually immediate feedback on  indicators such as the number of people reached, and that such  information helps inform decisions and ensure they make sound  investments. However, officials noted that it is more difficult to  determine the long-term effects of outreach activities. For example, it  would be difficult for NASA to determine whether its outreach aimed at  schoolchildren led them to eventually pursue careers in science,  technology, engineering, and math fields.", "Difficulty identifying factors that influence performance: FEMA  officials told us that there are many variables that affect performance  of digital media outreach, including the time of day or week, the  specific content of the message, and other news topics or marketing  campaigns occurring at the same time. They said they use the data to  make decisions, but in some instances it is difficult to determine why  outreach did not perform well. In our prior work on advertising at the  Department of Defense, we reported similar challenges in measuring  the impact of advertising on recruitment. We stated that determining  the precise impact of advertising on outcomes in this case is  inherently challenging, in part due to concurrent effects of external  factors, such as the influence of family support and the availability of  other career or educational activities.", "Difficulty performing in-depth assessments: Tools that allow for  more in-depth assessments of outreach activities may require more  resources than collecting web-based or other indicators does. For  example, under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), agencies must  receive approval from OMB for surveys or other efforts that involve  collecting data from the public. CFPB officials told us the approval  process for collecting information from the public can be challenging  because the outreach initiative that is the subject of the information  collection often changes or may evolve in the time it takes to receive  approval, which can take up to a year. In our 2010 report on  opportunities to strengthen agencies\u2019 customer service efforts, we  reported that in certain circumstances the PRA clearance process  made obtaining customer input difficult because of the time it takes to  obtain approval for surveys to collect customer input. In our 2014  report on customer service at selected agencies, we reported that use  of the Fast Track process designed to speed OMB survey approval  had varied among the agencies we reviewed and not led to significant  improvements.", "Selected agencies have taken steps to address these challenges. For  example, FEMA and CFPB have used focus groups or surveys to obtain  richer information on whether and how people are using their outreach  material. FEMA works with a contractor to administer surveys that provide  data on how the public may be responding to the agency\u2019s outreach, such  as the extent to which people have taken action to prepare for  emergencies. Both agencies have worked with OMB to obtain approval  for their information collections, despite the resources involved. CFPB  officials told us the information obtained through these collections makes  it worth the time and resources involved in the approval process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CFPB, DHS, and NASA for comment.

Of those agencies, we selected ones  with differing missions and types of interactions with the public. We also  considered input on the suitability of agencies for case illustration  purposes from our staff with expertise in agencies\u2019 operations. The four  selected agencies were the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Aeronautics and  Space Administration, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.", "We previously reported that the Department of Defense (DOD) obligates  more funding to advertising and public relations contracts, and employs  more public affairs staff than any other agency. We did not include DOD  in this review because we have recent work that examined advertising at  that department.", "To identify the activities selected agencies conduct using advertising and  public relations contracts and the purposes of these activities, we  reviewed information on these contracts. Specifically, we used the  Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  database to identify contracts at the selected agencies with values of  $150,000 or more that were classified as advertising or public relations  services over fiscal years 2012 through 2016. The FPDS-NG database  captures information on the federal government\u2019s contract awards and  obligations. It includes data for most federal contracts that have an  estimated value of $3,000 or more. The four agencies we reviewed had a  combined total of 68 contracts with these characteristics. These 68  contracts represented just over a quarter (68 out of 253) and almost 95  percent ($90.7 million of the $97.4 million) of all advertising and public  relations contracts and related obligations at these agencies over this  time period.", "To illustrate the types of general activities the 68 contracts supported, we  analyzed statements of work and other documentation using a data  collection instrument (DCI).We used the DCI to categorize key  characteristics of the services described in the contract documentation,  such as the purpose of the activities, media channels for each of the  activities, the intended audiences of the outreach, and any references to  agency statutes or missions. We also interviewed agency contracting and  public affairs officials about activities supported by contracts.", "We also classified the contracts according to five categories that we  identified in our earlier work: (1) public education and awareness; (2)  customer service; (3) general information; (4) recruitment; and (5)  compliance with laws and policies. To conduct our analysis, one analyst  used the DCI to review and code each contract. Another analyst verified  the coding. Finally, we shared our classification according to the five  categories with agency public affairs officials to ensure concurrence.", "We assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by considering known  strengths and weaknesses of the data based on our past work that used  the database, and by comparing FPDS-NG data to information in  contracts provided by agencies. We also reviewed a nongeneralizable  sample of 18 contracts not coded as advertising or public relations  services, but that appeared to include some activities related to these  services. We identified these other contracts by searching FPDS-NG for  contracts with (1) vendors that had received other contracts for  advertising and public relations services, and (2) contract descriptions  that used the terms \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201cpublic relations.\u201d We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To identify activities supported by public affairs staff, and their purposes,  we analyzed employment data provided by agencies on employees  classified under the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) public  affairs occupational series. We also reviewed position descriptions and  other documents provided by agencies and interviewed agency public  affairs officials who manage public relations activities to describe the  organization and role of public affairs employees in public relations and  advertising activities, and the purposes of those activities.
