In the case of third-party requests, when a patient gives permission for another entity\u2014for example, an attorney\u2014to request copies of the patient's medical records, the fees are not subject to the reasonable cost-based standard and are generally governed by state law.

For example, three of the states have per-page fee amounts for patient and third-party records requests. The amounts charged are based on the number of pages requested and vary across the three states.", "One of the three states has established a different per-page fee amount for third-party requests. The other two do not authorize a different fee for patient and third-party requests.", "One of the three states also specifies a maximum allowable fee if the provider uses an electronic health records system. The other two do not differentiate costs for electronic or paper records.", "In the fourth state, state law entitles individuals to one free copy of their medical record.

Representatives from ROI  vendors, provider representatives, and other stakeholders we interviewed  told us that not all states have established their own requirements  governing the fees for medical record requests and, among the states  that have, the laws can vary. For example, states can vary as to whether  they set a maximum fee that may be charged or whether they establish a  fee schedule that is applicable to paper records, electronic records, or  both.

According to ROI vendors and other  stakeholders we interviewed, such fees are typically higher than the  reasonable, cost-based fees permitted under HIPAA for patient and  patient-directed requests and may be established by formulas that vary  by state. For example, states can vary as to whether they establish per- page copy fees, allow providers to charge a flat fee, or charge different  fees based on the type of media requested (e.g., electronic copies, X- rays, microfilm, paper, etc.). Additionally, state laws of general  applicability (for example, the commercial code) may govern the  permissible fees applicable to ROI release of records.

This  advocate explained that per-page fees, even if legally authorized, can  pose challenges for patients; in particular, patients who have been  seriously ill can accumulate medical records that number in the  thousands of pages and can, as a result, face fees in excess of $1,000 for  a single copy of their records.", "Stakeholders we interviewed told us that in many cases, providers may  also be unaware of patients\u2019 right to access their medical records and the  laws governing the fees for doing so.", "Two patient advocates and an expert said that patients are sometimes  denied access to their medical records.", "Patient advocates and experts told us that some providers are not  aware of the 2016 OCR guidance, which describes patients\u2019 rights to  access their medical records, as well as the permitted fees for such  access.", "One patient advocate and a provider representative also noted that  providers may be confused about caregivers\u2019 and family members\u2019  access to medical records.

For example, patient advocates said that the  \u201cnotice of privacy practices\u201d form that patients receive and are asked to  sign when they first seek care from a provider could be improved to raise  awareness of the rights associated with accessing medical records. This  form is used to explain a provider\u2019s privacy policies and obligations, and  what patients have to do to obtain access to their medical records.  However, a provider association and an expert told us that these forms  are not always easy for patients to understand, and patients might not  always read them.

Stakeholders noted that printing a complete record from an EHR  system can result in a document that is hundreds of pages long due to  the amount of data stored in EHR systems.", "Representatives from three ROI vendors told us that as providers  have transitioned from using paper records to using EHR systems,  information has been scanned into electronic medical records. This  has, in some cases, resulted in records being incorrectly merged  (e.g., the records of two patients merged into a single record).

OCR officials noted a number of reasons why complaints can  take a significant amount of time to close. In some cases, the patient  receives her records early in the investigation, but the complaint is kept  open by OCR to ensure that agreed-upon or recommended corrective  actions are taken by the provider\u2014for example, training staff on patient  access rights or demonstrating that the provider\u2019s policies pertaining to  patient access have been changed. In other complaints, time is needed  for OCR to obtain consent from the patient who filed the complaint. OCR  officials noted that in some instances, patients ultimately decide they do  not want to give OCR consent to investigate their complaint, due to  concerns that the provider will learn their identity.
