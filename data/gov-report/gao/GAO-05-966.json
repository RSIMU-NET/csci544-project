Although DOD guidance on implementing these arrangements states program offices should update their business case analysis based on actual cost and performance data, only 1 of the 15 program offices included in GAO's review had performed such an update consistent with DOD guidance. In the single case where the program office had updated its business case analysis, it determined that the performance-based logistics contract did not result in expected cost savings and the weapon system did not meet established performance requirements. In general, program offices had not updated their business case analysis after entering into a performance-based logistics contract because they assumed that the costs for weapon system maintenance incurred under a fixed-price performance-based logistics contract would always be lower than costs under a more traditional contracting approach and because they lacked reliable cost and performance data needed to validate assumptions used. Furthermore, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has not established procedures to monitor program offices to ensure they follow guidance and update the business case analysis. Additionally, program officials said because of limitations in their own information systems, they typically relied on cost and performance data generated by the contractors' information systems to monitor performance-based logistics contracts. The program offices, however, had not determined whether contractor-provided data were sufficiently reliable to update their business case analysis. Although the Defense Contract Management Agency and the Defense Contract Audit Agency are most commonly used to monitor higher risk contracts, such as cost plus contracts, they are potential resources available to assist program offices in monitoring fixed-price performance-based contracts. In doing so, these DOD agencies have the capability to verify the reliability of contractors' information systems and collect cost and performance data needed to update their business case analysis. Until program offices follow DOD's guidance and update their business case analysis based on reliable cost and performance data, DOD cannot evaluate the extent to which performance-based logistics arrangements are achieving expected benefits and being effectively implemented within DOD."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) reported that it spent $23.6 billion in  fiscal year 2004 for depot maintenance of military weapon systems.   Almost half of those expenditures were paid to private sector companies to  perform depot maintenance activities for selected weapon systems.  DOD\u2019s  preferred approach for providing long-term total system support for  weapon systems is a concept it calls performance-based logistics.   Performance-based logistics is a variation of other contractor logistics  support strategies and involves defining a level of performance that the  weapon system is to achieve over a period of time at a fixed cost to the  government.  Specific performance measures are established in each  contract.  DOD believes this contracting strategy for supporting weapon  systems and components will achieve higher levels of performance while  minimizing costs.  For example, DOD has claimed millions of dollars in cost  savings and significant performance improvements in such areas as  material availability and logistics response time through the use of  performance-based logistics.  As a result of aggressively pursuing this  contracting strategy, DOD expected an increasing number of weapon  systems and components to be maintained for the military services by  private sector companies under long-term, fixed-price, performance-based  contracts.  To justify the use of a performance-based logistics strategy,  according to DOD guidance, program offices should conduct a business  case analysis prior to adopting this approach.  Following implementation of  a performance-based logistics contract, program offices should update  their business case analysis to validate the assumptions used based on  actual cost and performance data and to support future weapon systems  plans.", "As requested, we reviewed DOD\u2019s implementation of performance-based  logistics arrangements.  Our objective was to determine whether DOD  could demonstrate cost savings or improved responsiveness through the  use of performance-based logistics arrangements.  This is the second of  two reports addressing DOD\u2019s implementation of performance-based  logistics.  In an August 2004 report, we identified the types of contractor  logistics support arrangements the private sector used when outsourcing  the maintenance of complex and costly equipment with life-cycle  management issues similar to those of military systems.  We also identified  several lessons learned from comparisons between private sector  contractor support practices and the performance-based logistics approach  that DOD was urging the services to use.  That report recommended that  DOD incorporate into guidance the private sector\u2019s practice of using  performance-based contracts to achieve economies at the component  level, rather than as a preferred practice at the platform level.  DOD issued  policy memoranda and revised its guidebook to implement our  recommendation.", "As part of our current review, we collected and analyzed data on 15 weapon  system programs that were among those identified by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the military services as programs that have  successfully used performance-based logistics arrangements.  We selected  weapon system programs that were sufficiently mature to provide lessons  learned on the use of performance-based logistics.  We reviewed contracts  and related files and interviewed program officials to determine how these  arrangements were structured and managed.  We examined business case  analysis documents prepared by the program offices to justify the use of a  performance-based logistics strategy.  We discussed with program officials  the systems they used to monitor contractor cost and performance.  We  also reviewed DOD policies, procedures, and guidance related to the use of  performance-based logistics for weapon system support.  We determined  that the data used were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We  performed our work from August 2004 through June 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.  The Scope and  Methodology section contains more detailed information about the work  we performed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD has increasingly relied on contractors to provide logistics support for  weapon system maintenance.  These logistics support arrangements have  taken various forms.  In fiscal year 1998, DOD directed the armed services  to pursue logistics support \u201creengineering\u201d efforts with contractors to  achieve cost savings and improve efficiency.  A 1999 DOD study identified  30 pilot programs to test logistics support concepts that placed greater  reliance on the private sector.  Some of the pilot programs involved  performance-type arrangements that were subsequently converted to, or  designated as, performance-based logistics contracts.  DOD\u2019s Quadrennial  Defense Review Report advocated the implementation of performance- based logistics, with appropriate metrics, to compress the supply chain by  removing steps in the warehousing, distribution, and order fulfillment  processes; reducing inventories; and reducing overhead costs while  improving the readiness of major weapon systems and commodities.", "Over the last few years, DOD has issued guidance on the implementation of  performance-based logistics.  In November 2001, the Office of the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense issued guidance recommending that program  managers conduct a sound business case analysis to decide whether they  should implement performance-based logistics for new systems and major  acquisitions for already fielded systems.  In an August 2003 memorandum  to the military departments, the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics) stated that DOD should continue to increase its  use of performance-based logistics acquisitions.  On February 4, 2004, the  Deputy Secretary of Defense (1) directed the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), in conjunction with the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), to issue clear guidance on purchasing  logistics support using performance criteria and (2) directed each service  to provide a plan to aggressively implement performance-based logistics  for current and planned weapon system platforms.  Then, based on  recommendations in our August 2004 report, the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) issued a memorandum  reemphasizing that the use of this type of support strategy was intended to  optimize weapon system availability while minimizing costs and the  logistics footprint and may be applied to weapon systems, subsystems,  and components.  The memorandum also provided specific definitions of  performance metrics to be used.", "DOD describes performance-based logistics as the process of (1) identifying a level of performance required by the warfighter and  (2) negotiating a performance-based arrangement between the government  and a contractor or government facility to provide long-term total system  support for a weapon system at a fixed level of annual funding.  Instead of  buying spare parts, repairs, tools, and data in individual transactions, DOD  program offices that use a performance-based logistics arrangement buy a  predetermined level of performance that meets the warfighter\u2019s objectives.   Although established performance measures should be tailored to reflect  the unique circumstances of each performance-based logistics  arrangement, the measures are expected to support five general objectives:  (1) percentage of time that a weapon system is available for a mission  (operational availability); (2) percentage of mission objectives met  (operational reliability); (3) operating costs divided by a specified unit of  measure (cost per unit usage); (4) size or presence of support required to  deploy, sustain, or move a weapon system (logistics footprint); and  (5) period of time that is acceptable between the demand or request for  support and the satisfactory fulfillment of that request (logistics response  time).  Currently, a DOD task force is refining these objectives into DOD  standard performance definitions to be used by program offices in every  service when preparing performance-based logistics arrangements.", "DOD guidance recommends that program offices prepare a business case  analysis prior to adopting a performance-based logistics approach to  support a weapon system.  The aim of the business case analysis is to  justify the decision to enter into a performance-based logistics contract.   The business case analysis is to include cost savings that are projected as a  result of using a performance-based logistics approach and the  assumptions used in developing the business case analysis.  Furthermore,  DOD guidance states that program offices should update their business  case analyses at appropriate decision points when sufficient cost and  performance data have been collected to validate the assumptions used in  developing the business case analyses, including the costs of alternative  approaches, projected cost savings, and expected performance levels.   Further, GAO Internal Control Standards state that it is necessary to  periodically review and validate the propriety and integrity of program  performance measures and indicators.  Also, actual performance data  should be continually compared against expected or planned goals, and  any difference should be analyzed.  Additionally, management should have  a monitoring strategy that emphasizes to program managers their  responsibility for internal controls (i.e., to review and validate performance  measures and indicators) and that includes a plan for periodic evaluation of  control activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Program Offices Could Not Demonstrate Cost Savings and Performance Improvement Resulting from the Use of Performance-Based Logistics", "paragraphs": ["DOD program offices could not demonstrate that their use of performance- based logistics arrangements had achieved cost savings and performance  improvements because they had not updated their business case analysis  as suggested by DOD guidance.  Specifically, of the 15 DOD program  offices, only 1 updated its business case analysis to validate assumptions  concerning cost and performance.  Other DOD program offices had not  updated their business case analysis in part because they lacked reliable  contractor cost and performance data.  The program offices typically relied  on cost and performance data generated by contractors\u2019 information  systems without verifying that the data were sufficiently reliable to update  the business case analysis.  Two DOD agencies, DCMA and DCAA, have the  capability to assist program offices in monitoring fixed-price performance- based contracts, verifying the reliability of contractors\u2019 information  systems, and collecting cost and performance data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Projected Cost Savings and Performance Improvements Were Not Validated", "paragraphs": ["None of the 15 program offices included in our review could demonstrate  that use of a performance-based logistics arrangement had achieved cost  savings and performance improvements.

Of the 15 program offices, 11 had  developed a business case analysis prior to entering into a performance- based logistics arrangement. In their analysis, these program offices  projected that they would achieve significant cost savings.  For example, an  Army program office projected total cost savings of $508.5 million, and a  Navy program office projected cost savings of $29.7 million.  However, only  the Navy\u2019s T-45 program office had subsequently updated its business case  analysis consistent with DOD guidance to determine whether cost savings  were being achieved.  Realizing that the contractor was not meeting the  aircraft availability performance measure, the program office reassessed  its business case assumptions and found that costs per flying hour were  higher than estimated because the aircraft was flying fewer hours than  forecasted.  As a result, the program office negotiated separate contracts  for the airframes and engines, which resulted in estimated cost savings of  $144 million over 5 years.", "Performance indicators tracked by the program offices showed that the  contractors met or exceeded performance requirements.  Of the 15  programs, 10 reported that performance levels exceeded contract  requirements, and 5 reported that performance levels were meeting  contract requirements.  For example, an Army program office reported a  weapon system availability rate of 99 percent, which is 7 percent higher  than what was projected in the business case analysis.  Similarly, a Navy  program office reported a weapon system availability rate of 97 percent,  which is 7 percent higher than projected.", "Despite the reported performance improvements, the program offices had  not analyzed the performance data to validate the improvements and  determine whether these improvements could be attributed directly to  their use of performance-based logistics arrangements to support the  weapon systems.  In addition, we noted that program offices in the past  reported they had also met or exceeded required levels of performance  using other contractual arrangements for weapon system maintenance.   Moreover, the DOD program offices reporting that performance levels were  exceeding contract requirements under performance-based logistics  arrangements had not determined the incremental costs associated with  achieving these higher levels of performance.  As a result, they had no way  of knowing whether incremental costs outweighed the benefits derived  from achieving performance levels in excess of requirements.", "Program officials did not follow DOD guidance to update and validate their  business case analyses because they assumed that costs incurred under  fixed-price performance-based logistics arrangements would always be  lower than costs incurred under more traditional contracting  arrangements, and several program officials cited a lack of reliable data  needed to validate expected costs savings and improved performance.   However, the experience of the T-45 program showed that it is possible for  program offices to validate the assumptions in the business case analysis  and to determine whether expected cost savings and performance  improvements were achieved.  There are also other benefits derived from  validating the assumptions used in the business case analysis.  Validation  can provide a better understanding of costs associated with the repair and  maintenance of weapon systems, ensure that proper performance metrics  are in place to satisfy logistical demand, isolate incremental costs  associated with achieving higher levels of performance, and make cost and  performance data available for contract renegotiations in order to obtain  the best value for the government.  Furthermore, we did not find evidence  that the Office of the Secretary of Defense had established procedures to  monitor whether program offices were following its guidance to update  their business case analyses.  The results of these updates could be used by  DOD to assess the implementation of performance-based logistics  arrangements and evaluate the extent to which performance-based  logistics arrangements are achieving expected benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Program Offices Relied on Contractors\u2019 Data Without Verifying the Reliability of the Data", "paragraphs": ["DOD program offices included in our review stated that because of  limitations in their own information systems, they typically relied on cost  and performance data generated by the contractors\u2019 information systems to  monitor performance-based logistics contracts.
