In fiscal year 2005, CMS's total IT appropriations was about $2.55 billion, of which about $760 million, or 30 percent, was to support internal investments, and $1.79 billion was to fund the Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) that states use to support their Medicaid programs. (GAO is using the term \"internal\" to refer to all of CMS' IT investments excluding state MMISs.) In light of the size and significance of these investments, GAO's objectives were to (1) evaluate CMS's capabilities for managing its internal investments, (2) determine any plans the agency might have for improving these capabilities, and (3) examine CMS's process for approving and monitoring state MMISs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Judged against GAO's framework for IT investment management, which measures the maturity of an organization's investment management process, CMS's capabilities for effectively managing its internal investments are limited. Specifically, the agency has established a little over half of the foundational practices it needs to manage individual investments and has executed 2 of the 27 key practices needed to manage investments as a portfolio. Until CMS fully establishes foundational and portfolio-level practices, executives will lack the assurance that they are managing the agency's collection of investments in a manner that minimizes risks and maximizes returns. CMS has initiated steps to improve its investment management process; however, these steps do not fully address the weaknesses GAO identifies in this report, nor are they coordinated with other needed improvement efforts into a plan that (1) is based on an assessment of strengths and weaknesses; (2) specifies measurable goals, objectives, and milestones; (3) specifies needed resources; (4) assigns clear responsibility and accountability for accomplishing tasks; and (5) is approved by senior-level management. Without such a plan and procedures for implementing it, CMS will be challenged in sustaining the commitment it needs to fully establish its investment management process. The process for approving requests for federal funding of MMIS activities (including development, operations, and maintenance activities) is characterized by standard procedures, guidance, and reported information to CMS's Center for Medicaid and State Operations. In contrast, the process for monitoring MMIS activities lacks standard procedures, guidance, and reporting requirements. Without these elements for monitoring MMIS activities, CMS may not be able to easily determine whether the state MMISs in which CMS invests close to $1.7 billion annually are facilitating the delivery of Medicaid benefits in the most effective and beneficial manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), formerly called the  Health Care Financing Administration, within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for overseeing the Medicare and  Medicaid programs.

Similarly, in 2003, we  placed the Medicaid program on our high-risk list, noting the growing  concerns about the quality of fiscal oversight. In our latest high-risk series,  issued in January 2005, we continued to designate both these programs as  high risk.

The overriding purpose of the framework is to encourage  investment processes that increase business value and mission  performance, reduce risk, and increase accountability and transparency in  the decision process. We have used the framework in several of our  evaluations, and a number of agencies have adopted it. These agencies  have used ITIM for purposes ranging from self-assessment to the redesign  of their IT investment management processes.", "The ITIM framework\u2019s five maturity stages represent steps toward  achieving stable and mature processes for managing IT investments. Each  stage builds on the lower stages; the successful attainment of each stage  leads to improvement in the organization\u2019s ability to manage its  investments. With the exception of the first stage, each maturity stage is  composed of \u201ccritical processes\u201d that must be implemented and  institutionalized in order for the organization to achieve that stage. These  critical processes are further broken down into key practices that describe  the types of activities that an organization should be performing to  successfully implement each critical process. An organization may be  performing key practices from more than one maturity stage at the same  time. This is not unusual, but efforts to improve investment management  capabilities should focus on becoming compliant with lower-stage  practices before addressing higher-stage practices.", "Stage 2 of the ITIM framework encompasses building a sound investment  management process by establishing basic capabilities for selecting new IT  projects. It also involves developing the capability to control projects so  that they finish predictably within established cost and schedule  expectations and the capability to identify potential exposures to risk and  put in place strategies to mitigate that risk. The basic selection processes  established in Stage 2 lays the foundation for more mature selection  capabilities in Stage 3.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options. It focuses on  establishing a consistent, well-defined perspective on the IT investment  portfolio and maintaining mature, integrated selection (and reselection),  control, and evaluation processes that can be evaluated during  postimplementation reviews. This portfolio perspective allows decision  makers to consider the interaction among investments and the  contributions to organizational mission goals and strategies that could be  made by alternative portfolio selections, rather than focusing exclusively  on the balance between the costs and benefits of individual investments.

Their responsibilities  include, among other things, scoring and ranking IT investments, and  recommending investments to the ITIRB for funding.", "Notwithstanding these strengths, CMS does not have an IT investment  process guide that reflects the agency\u2019s current investment management  practices. For example, the agency uses ESCs to work with the board on  specific areas of IT investments, but its process guide does not identify this  critical group. Moreover, the process guide does not mention the agency\u2019s  move to classify its IT investments in line with the department\u2019s  classification scheme. (The new classification scheme consists of three  levels in which projects are rated as major, supporting, or tactical.) Instead,  the process guide outlines a four-level classification scheme that identifies  investments as A, B, C, or D, depending on the nature and sensitivity of the  project. According to CMS officials, the guide has not yet been updated  because the agency has made a priority of fully defining its processes  before documenting them. Documenting the process, however, does not  preclude it from future revisions or improvements, but does provide a basis  for consistent implementation across the agency. Until CMS\u2019s documented  IT investment process guidance is updated, executives are at risk of  inconsistently performing key investment decision-making activities and  inaccurately communicating management practices. Such updated  guidance would also provide a process that could lead to greater  accountability about future IT investment outcomes, which would be  helpful to new members joining the board.", "Another key weakness is that CMS\u2019s ITIRB has not operated in accordance  with its assigned roles and responsibilities. For example, the ITIRB has not  yet been involved in systematically controlling investments nor has it  actively maintained the documented investment management process.  Until the ITIRB fully carries out its assigned roles and responsibilities,  executives will not have assurance that the whole IT investment  management process is functioning smoothly and effectively as intended.", "Table 2 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for instituting the investment board at the Stage 2 level of  maturity.

This critical process ensures that a link exists between the  organization\u2019s business objectives and its IT management strategy.  According to the ITIM, effectively meeting business needs requires, among  other things, (1) documenting business needs with stated goals and  objectives, (2) identifying specific users and other beneficiaries of IT  projects and systems, (3) providing adequate resources to ensure that  projects and systems support the organization\u2019s business needs and meet  users\u2019 needs, and (4) periodically evaluating the alignment of IT projects  and systems with the organization\u2019s strategic goals and objectives.

The agency also has  detailed procedures for developing these documents that call for  identifying users. We verified that the four projects we reviewed identified  specific users and also documented how the projects linked back to CMS  business needs. Resources for ensuring that IT projects and systems  support the organization\u2019s business needs and meet users\u2019 needs include  Component Leads, the Enterprise Architecture Group, and detailed  procedures and associated templates for developing the IT fact sheet and  business case analysis document.", "Although CMS has performed most of the key practices associated with  meeting business needs, a few weaknesses remain. Specifically, officials  told us they rely on the HHS strategic plan to guide their efforts because  CMS\u2019s strategic plan documenting the agency\u2019s business mission, goals, and  objectives is outdated. However, the primary tool used to justify funding  for investments does not tie into the HHS plan but provides high-level  business drivers for aligning these investments with business needs.  While, according to agency officials, these business drivers reflect a  common understanding of the agency\u2019s goals and objectives, they are not  descriptive enough to drive IT investments. Until CMS develops a current  strategic plan or other detailed statement of business mission with  supporting goals and objectives, the agency is at risk of not being able to  thoroughly communicate critical information on its goals and objectives or  to provide clear and transparent direction for its IT investment  management process.", "Finally, CMS\u2019s budget formulation process serves as a mechanism to  reevaluate the alignment of projects and systems with the organization\u2019s  goals and objectives. However, the ITIRB selected investments for the first  time this past spring and, therefore, has not yet had to reevaluate projects\u2019  and systems\u2019 alignment with organizational goals and objectives. When  CMS executes all key practices associated with this critical process, it will  have greater assurance that its projects effectively meet the agency\u2019s  business needs.", "Table 3 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for meeting business needs at the Stage 2 level of maturity  and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "Selecting new IT proposals and reselecting ongoing investments require a  well-defined and disciplined process to provide the agency\u2019s investment  board, business units, and developers with a common understanding of the  process and the cost, benefit, schedule, and risk criteria that will be used  both to select new projects and to reselect ongoing projects for continued  funding. According to the ITIM, this critical process requires, among other  things, (1) making funding decisions for new proposals according to an  established process; (2) providing adequate resources for investment  selection activities; (3) using a defined selection process to select new  investments and reselect ongoing investments; (4) establishing criteria for  analyzing, prioritizing, and selecting new IT investments and for reselecting  ongoing investments; and (5) creating a process for ensuring that the  criteria change as organizational objectives change. (The complete list of  key practices is provided in table 4.)", "CMS has executed 4 of the 10 key practices associated with selecting an  investment. Specifically, CMS used a process it defined in February  2005\u2014its budget formulation process\u2014to select new investments and  reselect existing investments using a set of limited criteria. We confirmed  that the four projects we reviewed were reselected using this new process.  In addition, by using the budget formulation process to select investments,  executives had assurance that funding decisions were aligned with  selection decisions. Officials indicated that adequate resources were  provided for identifying and selecting investments.", "However, weaknesses remain in the selection area. Although CMS has a  number of documents that address investment selection and reselection,  these documents are not linked to provide a clear understanding of the  selection and reselection process. In addition, they do not define (1) the  roles and responsibilities for each participating unit involved in the project  selection process and (2) the decision-making procedures. CMS officials  told us they chose to first implement the selection process and then go  back to document it. Another key weakness in the selection area is that,  although selection and reselection criteria have been defined, they do not  include cost, benefit, schedule, and risk factors. Officials indicated that  because the Executive Steering Committees and the ITIRB had a short  amount of time to perform selection activities this year, they defined a  limited set of criteria to evaluate projects. Further, CMS does not have a  mechanism to ensure that its selection criteria continue to reflect  organizational objectives.", "Until CMS implements all of the key practices associated with selecting  investments, executives will not be adequately assured that they are  consistently and objectively selecting projects that meet the needs and  priorities of the agency in a cost-effective and risk-insured manner.", "Table 4 shows the rating for each key practice required to implement the  critical process for selecting an investment at the Stage 2 level of maturity  and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "An organization should provide effective oversight for its IT projects  throughout all phases of their life cycles. Its investment board should  maintain adequate oversight and observe each project\u2019s performance and  progress toward predefined cost and schedule expectations as well as each  project\u2019s anticipated benefits and risk exposure. The investment board  should also employ early warning systems that enable it to take corrective  action at the first sign of cost, schedule, or performance slippages. This  board has ultimate responsibility for the activities within this critical  process. According to the ITIM framework, effective project oversight  requires, among other things, (1) having written policies and procedures  for management oversight; (2) developing and maintaining an approved  management plan for each IT project; (3) making up-to-date cost and  schedule data for each project available to the oversight boards; (4) having  regular reviews by each investment board of each project\u2019s performance  against stated expectations; and (5) ensuring that corrective actions for  each underperforming project are documented, agreed to, implemented,  and tracked until the desired outcome is achieved. (The complete list of  key practices is provided in table 5.)", "CMS has only executed 1 of the 7 key practices associated with effective  project oversight.

In addition, while the board is receiving performance data for  some investments, including revitalization investments, it is not yet  performing oversight of projects on a systematic basis. CMS officials  indicated that the ITIRB\u2019s involvement in overseeing investments to date  has been limited because the board was first focusing on selecting  investments. However, CMS recognizes the importance of the ITIRB\u2019s  involvement in oversight of IT investments, and, according to officials, the  agency is currently developing an approach to address this issue.", "While CMS is in the process of developing a structured process for the  ITIRB to oversee investments, other entities are involved in the oversight of  projects. For example, performance information for one of the projects we  reviewed was not provided to CMS\u2019s ITIRB, but instead was provided to  senior-level management, such as the Chief Technology Officer and  directors from some CMS components. Until the ITIRB systematically  oversees CMS\u2019s investments, the oversight process will not benefit from the  corporate perspective that is gained by having an enterprisewide board. As  a result, executives may not be able to easily determine the impact  individual project decisions may have on other projects and on the  attainment of organizational goals and objectives.", "Table 5 shows the rating for each key practice that is required to implement  the critical process for project oversight at the Stage 2 level of maturity and  summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "To make good IT investment decisions, an organization must be able to  acquire pertinent information about each investment and store that  information in a retrievable format. During this critical process, an  organization identifies its IT assets and creates a comprehensive repository  of investment information. This repository provides information to  investment decision makers to help them evaluate the impacts and  opportunities that would be created by proposed or continuing  investments. It can provide insights and trends about major IT cost and  management drivers. The repository can take many forms and does not  have to be centrally located, but the collection method should identify each  IT investment and its associated components. This critical process may be  satisfied by the information contained in the organization\u2019s current  enterprise architecture, augmented by additional information\u2014such as  financial information and information on risk and benefits\u2014that the  investment board may require to ensure that informed decisions are being  made.

CMS stated that this is misleading since the  report also indicates that the agency has accomplished 20 of 38  foundational IT investment management practices. CMS also provided  examples of the practices it has implemented, such as establishing an  investment review board. In our report, we make a distinction between  foundational practices, which are the Stage 2 key practices for establishing  basic project-level selection and control capabilities, and portfolio-level  practices, which are the Stage 3 key practices for managing investments as  an integrated set of competing options. We also note that both of these sets  of key practices are needed to implement the processes required by the  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. On the basis of this, we state that CMS does not  have the full suite of capabilities to manage its internal investments  because it has only established a little over half of the foundational  practices and 2 of 27 portfolio-level key practices, and we reiterate the  need to fully establish both sets of practices to increase assurance that  executives are selecting and managing the mix of investments that best  meets the agency\u2019s needs and priorities.

CMS made three points: (1) it is not practical to  publish an updated guide without having the effective and repeatable  underlying process in place and noted that it is not provided the latitude to  do this; (2) in the section of the report discussing instituting the investment  board, the noted successful execution of key practices appears to be  negated by the statement that the investment management processes are  not documented; and (3) in the same section of the report, we are implying  that an updated guide would improve rather than explain the process. We  disagree with CMS that the process needs to be repeatable and  strengthened before it can be documented. Documented procedures could  actually serve to strengthen and improve the process by ensuring it is  performed consistently.
