Both new sets of satellites will provide critical weather forecasting data over the next two decades. GAO has reported that gaps in polar satellite coverage and in backup coverage for geostationary satellites are likely in the near future. Given the criticality of satellite data to weather forecasts, concerns that problems and delays on the new satellite acquisition programs will result in gaps in the continuity of critical satellite data, and the impact of such gaps on the health and safety of the U.S. population, GAO added mitigating weather satellite gaps to its High-Risk List in 2013 and it remains on the 2015 update to the High-Risk List.", "GAO was asked to testify on two recently released reports on NOAA's satellite programs, specifically on (1) the JPSS program's status, the potential for a gap and mitigation alternatives, and contingency plans, and (2) the GOESR program's status, potential for a gap, and contingency plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) $11.3 billion Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program has recently completed significant development activities and remains within its cost and schedule baselines; however, recent cost growth on key components is likely unsustainable, and schedule delays could increase the potential for a near-term satellite data gap. In addition, while the program has reduced its estimate for a near-term gap in the afternoon orbit, its gap assessment was based on incomplete data. A gap in satellite data may occur earlier and last longer than NOAA anticipates. The figure below depicts a possible 11-month gap, in which the current satellite lasts its full expected 5-year life (until October 2016) and the next satellite is launched in March 2017 and undergoes on-orbit testing until September 2017.", "Multiple alternatives to prevent or reduce the impact of a gap exist. Key options for reducing the impact of a near-term gap include extending legacy satellites, obtaining additional observations such as data from aircraft, advancing data assimilation and a global forecast model, and increasing high performance computing capacity. While NOAA has improved its contingency plan by identifying mitigation strategies and specific activities, the agency's plan has shortfalls such as not assessing the cost and impact of available alternatives. In addition, NOAA has not yet prioritized mitigation projects most likely to address a gap, and key mitigation projects have been delayed. Until the agency addresses these shortfalls, the agency will have less assurance that it is prepared to deal with a near-term gap in polar satellite coverage.", "NOAA's $10.8 billion Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) program has also made major progress on its first satellite. However, the program has continued to experience delays in major milestones and has not efficiently closed defects on selected components, both of which could increase the risk of a launch delay. As the GOES-R program approaches its expected launch date of March 2016, it faces a potential gap of more than a year during which an on-orbit backup satellite would not be available. Specifically, there could be no backup from April 2015 (when an operational satellite is expected to reach its end-of-life) through September 2016 (after GOES-R completes its post-launch test period). Any delay to the GOES-R launch date would extend the length of time without a backup satellite and, if an operational satellite were to experience a problem during that time, there could be a gap in GOES coverage. NOAA has improved its plan to mitigate gaps in satellite coverage, but it does not yet include steps for mitigating a delayed launch."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its recently issued reports, GAO recommended that NOAA update its polar data gap assessment, address shortfalls in both its polar and geostationary contingency plans, and prioritize mitigation projects most likely to address a gap in polar satellite coverage.

As the earth rotates  beneath it, each polar-orbiting satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites maintain a fixed position  relative to the earth from a high orbit of about 22,300 miles in space.", "Both types of satellites provide a valuable perspective of the environment  and allow observations in areas that may be otherwise unreachable.  Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing systems,  satellites have become an indispensable part of monitoring and  forecasting weather and climate. For example, polar-orbiting satellites  provide the data that go into numerical weather prediction models, which  are a primary tool for forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including  forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes. Geostationary satellites  provide the graphical images used to identify current weather patterns  and provide short-term warning. These weather products and models are  used to predict the potential impact of severe weather so that  communities and emergency managers can help prevent and mitigate its  effects.", "Federal agencies are currently planning and executing major satellite  acquisition programs to replace existing polar and geostationary satellite  systems that are nearing the end of their expected life spans. However,  these programs have troubled legacies of cost increases, missed  milestones, technical problems, and management challenges that have  resulted in reduced functionality and major delays to planned launch  dates over time. We and others\u2014including an independent review team  reporting to the Department of Commerce and its Inspector General\u2014 have raised concerns that problems and delays with environmental  satellite acquisition programs will result in gaps in the continuity of critical  satellite data used in weather forecasts and warnings.", "According to officials at NOAA, a polar satellite data gap would result in  less accurate and timely weather forecasts and warnings of extreme  events, such as hurricanes, storm surges, and floods. Such degradation  in forecasts and warnings would place lives, property, and our nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures in danger. The importance of having such data  available was highlighted in 2012 by the advance warnings of the path,  timing, and intensity of Superstorm Sandy. Given the criticality of satellite  data to weather forecasts, concerns that problems and delays on the new  satellite acquisition programs will result in gaps in the continuity of critical  satellite data, and the impact of such gaps on the health and safety of the  U.S. population, we concluded that the potential gap in weather satellite  data is a high-risk area.

Between July  2013 and July 2014, the total program cost estimate increased by $222  million (or 2 percent). More than half of this increase was for three  instruments.

If JPSS costs were to continue to grow at this rate, the  program could end up costing $2 billion more than expected by 2025.  Therefore, moving forward, it will be important for NOAA and NASA  managers to aggressively monitor and control components that are  threatening to exceed their expected costs.", "Also, while the launch date of the JPSS-1 satellite has not yet been  affected, key components, such as the satellite\u2019s major instruments, have  encountered delays in development and testing.

These delays have caused a  reduction in schedule margin prior to the JPSS-1 satellite integration and  testing phase.", "Further, because of the technical issues experienced on ATMS, the  instrument has now become the critical path for the entire JPSS-1  mission and only 1 month of schedule reserve remains until its expected  delivery in March 2015.

However, we believe that this estimate is likely too optimistic.  There are several reasons why this potential gap could occur sooner and  last longer than NOAA currently anticipates.", "Inconsistent launch date plans: The program\u2019s analysis that  JPSS-1 will be operational by June 2017 is inconsistent with NOAA\u2019s  launch date commitment of March 2017, given that the program office  estimates 6 months for on-orbit checkout and calibration/validation  before the satellite data are operational.", "Unproven predictions about the on-orbit checkout and validation  phase: The on-orbit checkout and calibration/validation phase could  take longer than the program\u2019s estimated 6 months if there are issues  with the instruments or ground systems. Also, additional algorithm  work may be needed after the satellite launches, which could extend  the validation time frame.", "Exclusion of a key risk: The JPSS program\u2019s gap assessment does  not factor in the potential for satellite failures from space debris that  are too small to be tracked and avoided. Thus, the S-NPP mission  could end earlier than its 5-year design life, resulting in a gap period  that occurs sooner and lasts longer than expected.", "As a result, a gap in polar satellite data may occur earlier and last longer  than NOAA anticipates.

In that  case, the data gap would extend 11 months.
