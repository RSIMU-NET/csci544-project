Prior to 2018, these rates were based on historical laboratory fees and were typically higher than the rates paid by private payers. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) required CMS to develop a national fee schedule for laboratory tests based on private-payer data. To revise the rates, CMS collected data on private-payer rates from approximately 2,000 laboratories and calculated median payment rates, weighted by volume. GAO found that the median private-payer rates were lower than Medicare's maximum payment rates in 2017 for 88 percent of tests. CMS is gradually phasing in reductions to Medicare payment rates, limited annually at 10 percent over a 3-year period (2018 through 2020), as outlined in PAMA.", "CMS relied on laboratories to determine whether they met data reporting requirements, but agency officials told GAO that CMS did not receive data from all laboratories required to report. CMS did not estimate the amount of data it should have received from laboratories that were required to report but did not. CMS took steps to exclude inaccurate private-payer data and estimated how collecting certain types and amounts of additional private-payer data could affect Medicare expenditures. However, it is not known whether CMS's estimates reflect the actual risk of incomplete data resulting in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. GAO found that PAMA's phased in reductions to new Medicare payment rates likely mitigated this risk of inaccurate Medicare payment rates from 2018 through 2020. However, GAO found that collecting incomplete data could have a larger effect on the accuracy of Medicare payment rates in future years when PAMA allows for greater payment-rate reductions.", "CMS's implementation of the new payment rates could lead Medicare to pay billions of dollars more than is necessary and result in CLFS expenditures increasing from what Medicare paid prior to 2018 for two reasons. First, CMS used the maximum Medicare payment rates in 2017 as a baseline to start the phase in of payment-rate reductions instead of using actual Medicare payment rates. This resulted in excess payments for some laboratory tests and, in some cases, higher payment rates than those Medicare previously paid, on average. GAO estimated that Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 may be $733 million more than if CMS had phased in payment-rate reductions based on the average payment rates in 2016. Second, CMS stopped paying a bundled payment rate for certain panel tests (groups of laboratory tests generally performed together), as was its practice prior to 2018, because CMS had not yet clarified its authority to do so under PAMA, according to officials. CMS is currently reviewing whether it has the authority to bundle payment rates for panel tests to reflect the efficiency of conducting a group of tests. GAO estimated that if the payment rate for each panel test were unbundled, Medicare expenditures could increase by as much as $10.3 billion from 2018 through 2020 compared to estimated Medicare expenditures using lower bundled payment rates for panel tests."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of CMS (1) collect complete private-payer data from all laboratories required to report or address the estimated effects of incomplete data, (2) phase in payment-rate reductions that start from the actual payment rates rather than the maximum payment rates Medicare paid prior to 2018, and (3) use bundled rates for panel tests. HHS concurred with GAO's first recommendation, neither agreed nor disagreed with the other two, and has since issued guidance to help address the third. GAO believes CMS should fully address these recommendations to prevent Medicare from paying more than is necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is the single largest purchaser of laboratory tests in the United  States.

PAMA also called for a phase-in of the new payment  rates by limiting any reductions to 10 percent per year for each of the first  3 years of implementation. PAMA continues phasing in the reductions in  the second 3-year cycle after implementation, limiting any reductions to  15 percent per year.

We identified these market reports by searching a  database of industry analyses from 2014 through 2018. We also  identified reports cited by laboratory industry representatives and  reviewed information submitted to CMS by industry stakeholders during  rate-setting processes. We did not independently verify the data in these  reports. We also interviewed officials from three organizations  representing the laboratory industry and laboratory companies that we  identified. We selected these organizations because they represented a  large and diverse group of laboratories and different perspectives in their  support for the new payment rates initially proposed by CMS. We relied  on market reports and interviews with industry officials because we were  unable to identify a reliable and comprehensive source on private-payer  rates for laboratory tests.", "To describe how CMS developed the 2018 CLFS payment rates, we  reviewed documents from CMS, such as guidance to industry and  Medicare contractors, and the agency\u2019s proposed and final rulemaking  that describes the process CMS established to collect data on private- payer rates that laboratories received. We also reviewed documentation  CMS published about its preliminary and final calculations of the 2018  CLFS. In addition, we compared the median private-payer rates  (weighted by volume) that CMS calculated to Medicare\u2019s 2017 national  limitation amounts for laboratory tests (the maximum that CMS would pay  for a laboratory test). We used this comparison to determine the  percentage difference between the median payment rates and the 2017  national limitation amounts. We also interviewed CMS officials and  representatives from the laboratory industry and laboratory companies.", "To determine the challenges CMS faced in setting accurate Medicare  rates based on complete private-payer data, and what factors may have  mitigated these challenges, we conducted two types of analyses. First,  we determined the share of Medicare payments in 2016 that reporting  laboratories received to compare against the share that CMS estimated  laboratories meeting reporting requirements would receive. We identified  laboratories reporting data to CMS using the national provider identifier  (NPI) they reported. We used the Medicare claims data to determine  these laboratories\u2019 share of Medicare payments in 2016. We assessed  the reliability of the claims data by testing for missing data and obvious  outliers. On this basis, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our report.", "For our second analysis related to collecting complete data, we estimated  the potential effects that collecting data from additional laboratories could  have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures from 2018  through 2020. For this analysis we used the private-payer data that  CMS collected to estimate what Medicare expenditures could be if CMS  had received additional data. Specifically, we used the private-payer data  CMS collected to identify median private-payer rates and payment rates  at other percentiles. We then estimated the amounts of additional private- payer data as well as the payment rates in these additional data that  would be needed to shift median private-payer rates to these other  percentiles. To estimate the amount that additional data could shift  median private-payer rates, we assumed that all of the payment rates in  additional data could shift these medians in the same direction, either up  or down. For example, we estimated that collecting 20 percent more data  with payment rates above the 60th percentile of payment rates in the data  already collected could shift median rates to the 60th percentile,  approximately. Conversely, we estimated that collecting 20 percent more  data with payment rates below the 40th percentile of payment rates in the  data already collected could shift median rates to the 40th percentile,  approximately. We then estimated Medicare payment rates and  expenditures using payment rates at these percentiles as median private- payer rates. See appendix II for our calculations at the different  percentiles.", "To determine the challenges CMS faced in setting accurate Medicare  rates based on accurate private-payer data, we analyzed the effects on  Medicare expenditures of including and excluding data that CMS  identified as potentially inaccurate in calculating the payment rates,  assuming that the same number of laboratory tests performed in 2016  was also performed in each year from 2018 through 2020. We also  interviewed CMS officials about how they addressed the effect of  inaccurate private-payer data on Medicare payment rates and their  estimates of the potential effect of inaccurate data on Medicare  expenditures, as well as the effect of incomplete private-payer data. We  compared CMS\u2019s activities to relevant federal standards for internal  control related to identifying, analyzing, and responding to risk.", "To examine the potential effect of CMS\u2019s implementation of new payment  rates on Medicare expenditures, we estimated Medicare expenditures  from 2018 through 2020, using CLFS rates CMS published and  conducted two analyses related to panel tests, which are groups of tests  performed together. The first analysis examined the effect of using 2017  national limitation amounts to phase in reductions to payment rates for  panel tests, which Medicare commonly paid at lower rates. We estimated  changes in Medicare expenditures if CMS had limited annual reductions  to payment rates for panel tests based on the average amounts Medicare  had allowed for payment in 2016 instead of on the national limitation  amounts from 2017.", "For our second analysis of the potential effect of CMS\u2019s implementation of  new payment rates on Medicare expenditures, we examined the effect of  paying for panel tests as a group using bundled payments or separately  as individual component tests using multiple, unbundled payments. We  estimated potential changes in Medicare expenditures due to paying  separately for each component test that makes up a panel test, in  comparison with paying a bundled rate. For panel tests without billing  codes, we used Medicare bundled payment rates from 2016 to compare  with CMS\u2019s calculated payment rates for component tests from 2018  through 2020 because bundled payment rates are not available for these  years.", "We took additional steps to support or extend our analyses. We reviewed  analyses conducted by CMS and reviewed information from a  subcommittee to the Medicare Advisory Panel on Clinical Diagnostic  Laboratory Tests regarding payment for panel tests. We interviewed CMS  about its legal authority to use bundled payment rates and its actions to  avoid paying more than necessary for laboratory tests.

Additionally, 57 geographic  jurisdictions had their own fee schedules for laboratory tests. CMS used  the 57 separate fee schedules to calculate a national limitation amount,  which served as the maximum payment for individual laboratory tests.

Additionally, there are 7 specific combinations of these  23 component tests that are commonly used and have their own billing  code. Prior to 2018, Medicare paid for both types of panel tests (those  without or with a billing code) using a bundled rate based on the number  of tests performed, with modest payment increases for each additional  test conducted. For example, in 2017, Medicare paid $7.15 for panel  tests with two component tests and $9.12 for panel tests with 3  component tests, with a maximum bundled payment rate of $16.64 for all  23 component tests. Prior to 2018, the Medicare Administrative  Contractors would count the number of tests performed before  determining the appropriate bundled payment rate.

To assist laboratories, CMS issued multiple guidance documents  to the industry outlining the criteria for being an applicable laboratory and  describing the type of data CMS intended to collect.

This  conclusion was based, in part, on a sensitivity analyses that CMS  conducted of the effects that collecting certain types and amounts of  additional data would have on weighted median private-payer rates and  the effects those rates could have on Medicare payment rates and, thus,  expenditures. Results from these analyses showed that Medicare  expenditures based on the CLFS would have changed by 2 percent or  less after collecting more data from the various types of laboratories.

As demonstrated in figure 1, while 59 percent of tests  had median private-payer rates that were at least 30 percent less than  their respective 2017 national limitation amounts, CMS published  Medicare rates for these tests for 2018 through 2020 that were reduced  by only 10 percent per year as a result of this limit. For example, a  hypothetical laboratory test with a 2017 CLFS national limitation amount  of $10.00 and a median private-payer rate of $7.00 would result in CLFS  rates of $9.00 in 2018, $8.10 in 2019, and $7.29 in 2020. Changes to  median private-payer rates due to collecting more complete data or  eliminating inaccurate data would have no effect on Medicare payment  rates from 2018 through 2020 for this hypothetical test if they resulted in  new median rates of $7.29 or less.", "Our analysis of the potential effects that collecting data from additional  laboratories could have had on Medicare payment rates and expenditures  found that the effect of CMS not collecting complete data would likely  have been greater absent PAMA\u2019s limits on annual reductions to  Medicare payment rates. As a result, CMS may face challenges setting  accurate Medicare rates if it does not collect complete data from all  laboratories required to report in the future when PAMA allows for greater  annual payment-rate reductions. To conduct this analysis, we used the  private-payer data CMS collected to analyze the range of effects that  collecting additional data could have on Medicare expenditures, assuming  2016 utilization rates remain constant. The extent of these effects  depends on the amount of additional data CMS would need to collect to  obtain complete data and whether the payment rates in these additional  data would have been greater or less than the medians of the rates  reported. For example, we estimated that if CMS needed to collect 20  percent more data for its collection to be complete, doing so could  increase Medicare CLFS expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by as  much as 3 percent or reduce them by as much as 3 percent depending  on the payment rates in these additional data. However, if annual limits to  Medicare payment-rate reductions were not applied, collecting these  additional data could increase CLFS expenditures by as much as 9  percent or reduce them by as much as 9 percent.

However, without valid estimates of how much  more data these additional laboratories were required to report and how  much these data would change median payment rates, it remains  unknown whether CMS\u2019s analyses estimate the actual risk of setting  Medicare payment rates that do not reflect private-payer rates from all  applicable laboratories, as mandated by PAMA. CMS could have  compared the data it collected with independent information on the  payment rates laboratories were required to report, for example.

This increase in estimated expenditures is due, in part, to CMS\u2019s use of  above-average payment rates as a baseline to calculate payment rates  for those laboratory tests affected by PAMA\u2019s annual payment-rate  reduction limit of 10 percent. (See fig. 4.)", "When applying the 10-percent payment-rate reduction limit, CMS used as  its starting point the 2017 national limitation amounts in order to set a  single, national payment rate for each laboratory test. Thus, the Medicare  payment rate for a test in 2018 could not be less than 90 percent of the  test\u2019s 2017 national limitation amount. However, prior to 2018, some  payment rates were commonly lower than the national limitation amounts  because they were based on the lesser of (1) the amount billed on claims,  (2) the local fee for a geographic area, or (3) a national limitation amount,  and because panel tests had different bundled payment rates. As a result,  by reducing payment rates from national limitation amounts, CMS did not  always reduce rates from what Medicare actually paid.", "Panel tests, in particular, frequently received bundled payment rates that  differed substantially from national limitation amounts associated with  their billing codes prior to 2018. We compared national limitation  amounts, which represent maximum Medicare payment rates for tests,  with the average amounts Medicare allowed for payment in 2016, which  reflect actual Medicare payment rates. For example, figure 5 below  shows that the 2017 national limitation amount for comprehensive  metabolic panel tests ($14.49) was substantially higher than both the  average amount Medicare allowed for payment in 2016 ($11.45) and the  median payment rate laboratories reported receiving from private payers  ($9.08). As a result, using the 2017 national limitation amount as a basis  for payment reductions caused Medicare\u2019s payment rate to increase from  an average allowed amount of $11.45 in 2016, to a payment rate of  $13.04 in 2018, instead of decreasing towards a lower median private- payer rate of $9.08. By increasing average payment rates rather than  phasing in reductions to rates, CMS\u2019s implementation may lead to paying  more than necessary for some tests.", "Federal standards for internal control for information and communications  require agency management to use quality information to achieve its  objectives. Basing reductions on national limitation amounts rather than more relevant information on how much Medicare actually paid\u2014such as  the average allowable amounts in 2016, for example\u2014could result in  Medicare paying more than necessary by $733 million from 2018 through  2020, according to our estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Changes to Payment Rates for Panel Tests Could Lead Medicare to Pay Billions of Dollars More than Is Necessary", "paragraphs": ["In implementing PAMA, CMS eliminated bundled rates for panel tests that  lack billing codes and started paying separately for each component test  instead.

However, CMS staff and members of its advisory panel discussed  concerns with this approach. At an advisory panel meeting in 2016, CMS  staff relayed concerns from stakeholders that CMS would not be able to  collect valid data on private-payer rates for these panel tests. According  to agency staff, stakeholders had informed CMS that private payers  commonly use bundled payment rates for these panel tests, but  laboratories would only be able to report unbundled payment rates for  individual component tests.", "We estimated that unbundling these payment rates would increase  Medicare expenditures from 2018 through 2020 by $218 million in  comparison to the estimated Medicare expenditures over the same time  period based on Medicare\u2019s 2016 utilization and allowable amounts. For  example, under the 2016 CLFS, Medicare paid approximately 435,000  claims for panel tests that included the laboratory tests assay of  creatinine (HCPCS code 82565) and assay of urea nitrogen (HCPCS  code 84520) at an average bundled payment rate of $6.82. In contrast,  under the 2018 CLFS, these two component tests are reimbursed  individually at $6.33 and $4.88, respectively, or $11.21 combined\u2014a 63  percent increase.", "Despite concerns about the validity of available private-payer data on  component tests for panel tests without billing codes, CMS used these  data to set payment rates for component tests. CMS officials told us that  they stopped using bundled payment rates for these panel tests because  it is not clear that CMS has the authority to combine the individual  component tests into groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018  due to PAMA\u2019s reference to payments for each test. However, in July  2018, CMS officials told us the agency was reviewing its authority  regarding this issue. CMS officials told us they are exploring alternative  approaches that could limit increases to Medicare expenditures but had  not yet determined what additional legal authority would be needed, if  any, and did not know when CMS would make this determination. Agency  officials told us that CMS has taken initial steps to monitor unbundling and  explore possible responses, including the following:", "Monitoring unbundling: CMS has begun monitoring changes in  panel test utilization, payment rates, and expenditures associated  with its implementation of PAMA, according to officials. For  example, CMS officials told us that preliminary data indicated that  Medicare payments for individual component tests of panel tests  has increased substantially in 2018, but, as of July 2018, it was  too early to draw conclusions from these data because  laboratories have up to one year to submit claims for tests.", "Collecting input on alternatives: In 2016, a subcommittee of an  advisory panel that CMS established reviewed Medicare\u2019s use of  bundled payment rates for panel tests and published different  approaches for CMS to consider implementing in combination with  other changes to implement PAMA.", "CMS\u2019s Implementation of PAMA May Have Allowed Unbundling of  Payment Rates for Panel Tests with Billing Codes  Beginning in 2018, laboratories that submit claims for any of the seven  panel tests with billing codes by using the billing codes for the individual  component tests now receive the payment rate for each component test,  rather than the bundled rate. Prior to 2018, laboratories could submit  claims for these panel tests either by using the specific codes for panel  tests or by billing separately for each of the component tests, and,  regardless of how laboratories submitted claims, Medicare Administrative  Contractors would pay bundled payment rates based on how many of the  23 component tests were conducted. However, CMS instructed Medicare  Administrative Contractors to stop bundling payment rates for tests that  are billed individually on claims rather than billed on claims using codes  for panel tests, beginning in 2018. CMS did so because it was not clear  that CMS had the authority to combine the individual component tests into  groups for bundled payment as it did before 2018 due to PAMA\u2019s  reference to payments for individual tests, according to agency officials.  This change could potentially have a large effect on Medicare spending.  For example, if a laboratory submitted a claim individually for the 14  component tests that comprise a comprehensive metabolic panel it would  receive a payment of $81.91, a 528 percent increase from the 2018  Medicare bundled payment rate of $13.04 for this panel test. (See fig. 6.)", "Improving how reductions to payment rates for panel tests are phased in  could mitigate, but not completely counteract, the effect of unbundling  these payment rates. For example, for the comprehensive metabolic  panel test described in figure 6, basing maximum reductions on 2016  average allowable amounts would result in a 2018 Medicare bundled  payment rate of $10.31 instead of $13.04 and individual payment rates for  the 14 component tests that total $56.06\u2014a 32 percent decrease from  $81.91 that Medicare would otherwise pay.", "If the payment rate for each panel test with a billing code were unbundled,  we estimated that Medicare expenditures for these tests from 2018  through 2020 could reach $13.5 billion, a $10.1 billion increase from the  $3.3 billion we estimated Medicare would spend using the bundled  payment rates in the CLFS. Similarly, prior to implementing PAMA, CMS  estimated that Medicare expenditures to physician-office, independent,  and other non-hospital laboratories could potentially increase as much as  $2.5 billion in 2018, alone if it paid for the same number of panel tests  with billing codes as it did in 2016 but paid for each component test  individually. These estimates represent an upper limit on the increased  expenditures that could occur if every laboratory stopped using panel test  billing codes and instead used the billing codes for individual component  tests. We do not know the extent to which laboratories will stop filing  claims using panel test billing codes.", "CMS officials also told us that they were aware of the risks associated  with paying for the individual component tests instead of the bundled  payment rate for a panel test with a billing code. However, CMS  guidance, which was effective in 2018, continued to allow laboratories to  use the billing codes for individual component tests rather than the billing  code for the panel. CMS officials explained that this was due to PAMA\u2019s  reference to payments for individual tests, similar to CMS\u2019s decision to  stop paying bundled rates for panel tests without billing codes. At the time  we did our work, CMS had not implemented a response to these risks but  had taken some initial steps to monitor unbundling and consider  alternative approaches to Medicare payment rates for these tests.

In  addition, we estimated that Medicare expenditures on laboratory tests will  be $733 million higher from 2018 through 2020, because CMS started  phasing in payment-rate reductions from national limitation amounts  instead of more relevant data on actual payment rates, such as average  allowable amounts.
