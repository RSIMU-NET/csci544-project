This year's filing season was expected to be risky because of tax system changes, including the telephone excise tax refund (TETR) which can be requested by all individuals and entities that paid the excise tax. GAO was asked to describe IRS's service to taxpayers so far this filing season (including the impact of this year's tax systems changes). GAO was also asked to provide updates of previous assessments of the performance of paid tax preparers, IRS's efforts to modernize its information systems, and what IRS is doing to better measure taxpayer compliance. GAO compared IRS's filing season performance to prior years' and goals and based analyses of paid preparers, information systems, and compliance research efforts on recent reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS's interim filing season performance is improved in some areas. The number of individual income tax returns processed to date is comparable to last year, and the number filed electronically is almost 6 percent greater. Taxpayers' ability to reach an IRS telephone assistor was somewhat less than last year, but the accuracy of answers to taxpayers' questions was about the same. Use of IRS's Web site increased, important because it is available 24 hours a day and is less costly than some other types of assistance. However, there have been challenges. Taxpayers' use of the Free File program, which provides free tax preparation and electronic filing through IRS's Web site--is 5.2 percent below last year at this time. Also, the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), a modern tax return processing system, became operational 2 months behind schedule. IRS still expects to post 17 -19 million taxpayer accounts to CADE, which is about two and a half times more than last year. Tax systems changes have not had a significant effect on filing season performance. For example, IRS has received a fraction of the TETR-related telephone calls it expected to date. Because paid preparers prepared over 62 percent of all individual income tax returns last year, they are a critical quality control for tax administration by helping to prevent noncompliance. Last year, GAO reported to this Committee about errors made by paid preparers. Some of the most serious errors involved not reporting business income and failing to itemize deductions. GAO's limited work last year did not permit observations about the quality of the work of paid tax preparers in general and undoubtedly, many preparers do their best to prepare tax returns that are compliant with tax laws. In response to GAO's report, IRS has scheduled compliance reviews of some preparers. In addition, recent Justice Department suits to stop fraudulent return preparation at more than 125 outlets of one preparation chain for allegedly taking part in tax preparation scams highlight the importance and obligations of paid preparers. Despite progress made in implementing Business Systems Modernization projects, including CADE, and improving modernization management controls and capabilities, significant challenges and serious risks remain. Delays in the latest release of CADE resulted in continued contention for key resources and will likely impact future releases. Also, IRS has more to do to fully address GAO's prior recommendations such as developing a long-term strategy that would include timeframes for retiring legacy computer systems. GAO has long supported IRS's research to better understand taxpayers' compliance. IRS's fiscal year 2008 budget request includes a proposal for annual research instead of larger but intermittent efforts. GAO considers this to be a good approach because it will allow compliance data to be continually refreshed and should reduce costs by eliminating the need to plan new studies every few years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate this opportunity to support your oversight of the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) and the broader tax administration system.", "The annual tax return filing season is when IRS provides much of its  service to taxpayers.

Smaller  numbers of taxpayers will be assisted at IRS\u2019s walk-in sites or at sites  operated by other organizations and staffed by volunteers.", "While it is always a massive undertaking, the IRS Commissioner stated  that this year\u2019s filing season is high risk for several reasons, including  challenges in implementing the new telephone excise tax refund (TETR),  split refund option (refunds can now be directly deposited to up to three  separate accounts), and several tax law extensions that were enacted in  December of 2006.", "We have reported that IRS has made significant progress improving  taxpayer service since the passage of the IRS Restructuring and Reform  Act of 1998 (RRA 98), including increased electronic filing, better access  to IRS\u2019s telephone assistors, and more accurate answers to taxpayers\u2019  questions. The progress has been due, in part, to IRS bringing modern  information systems on line. However, we have also described taxpayer  service challenges including the quality of assistance at walk-in and  volunteer sites, delays in some new information systems, and fully  implementing our prior recommendations on the management of systems  acquisition and development.", "In addition to the IRS, tax administration in the U.S. relies heavily on the  private sector including the paid preparer industry, the tax preparation  software industry, and third parties who withhold taxes or submit  information returns.

However, we have reported that IRS  lacks quantitative estimates of the impact of taxpayer service on voluntary  compliance by taxpayers as well as on the impact of enforcement on  compliance. As a necessary first step to gaining more understanding of the  impact of service on compliance, we have strongly supported IRS\u2019s  ongoing National Research Program (NRP) to measure compliance and  estimate the tax gap.", "As agreed, our statement will describe IRS\u2019s service to taxpayers so far  this filing season (including the impact of this year\u2019s tax system changes)  and provide updates of previous assessments of the performance of paid  tax preparers in our tax administration system, IRS\u2019s ongoing efforts to  modernize its information systems, and what IRS is doing to better  measure taxpayer compliance with the tax laws including the impact of  service on compliance.", "To assess IRS\u2019s filing season performance for processing, telephones, face- to-face assistance and its Internet Web site, we obtained and analyzed  IRS\u2019s performance and production data and compared it to annual goals  and prior years\u2019 performance. Our work also included direct observations  of key filing season operations, and interviews with IRS officials and  external stakeholders.", "Our work was done primarily at IRS\u2019s National Office operating divisions,  the Joint Operations Center in Atlanta, Ga. and processing centers and call  sites in Atlanta, Ga. and Andover, Ma. We reviewed relevant external  documentation, our reports, and reports of the Treasury Inspector General  for Tax Administration (TIGTA).

We  considered filing season performance measures and data to be objective  and reliable based on our prior work. Since sources and procedures for  producing this year\u2019s data have not significantly changed from prior years,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report. Data limitations are discussed where appropriate. We  performed our work from December 2006 through March 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we make the following major points:  IRS\u2019s interim filing season performance is improved in some areas,  although there have been challenges. As of March 30, 2007, IRS had  processed 76.8 million individual income tax returns and issued over 68  million refunds, about the same number as last year. The number of  returns filed electronically was almost 6 percent greater than this time  last year. However, taxpayers\u2019 use of the Free File program, accessible  through IRS\u2019s Web site and which allows for free on line tax  preparation and electronic filing, is 5.2 percent below last year at this  time. IRS\u2019s latest release of the Customer Account Data Engine  (CADE), a modern tax return processing system that issues faster  refunds, was delayed\u2014it became operational 2 months behind  schedule. IRS expects to post approximately 17 \u2013 19 million taxpayer  returns to CADE in 2007. Although this is less than the 33 million  planned, it is almost two and a half times the approximately 7.4 million  taxpayer accounts posted last year on CADE. With respect to taxpayer  service, call volume continued to decline, taxpayers\u2019 ability to reach an  IRS assistor was somewhat less than last year, but the accuracy of  answers to taxpayers\u2019 questions was about the same as last year. Use of  IRS\u2019s Web site continues to increase, important because it is available  around the clock and is lower cost than most other types of assistance.  About 69 percent of individual income tax returns filed to date included  TETR requests. The impact of TETR on taxpayer services has been  much less than IRS anticipated. For example, IRS has received a  fraction of the TETR-related telephone calls it expected to date.", "Because they help the majority of taxpayers prepare their returns, paid  preparers are a critical quality control checkpoint for the tax system.  Last year, over 62 percent of all individual income tax returns were  prepared by paid preparers. However, we reported to this Committee  last year about errors made by paid preparers. In visits to 19 outlets of  several commercial chain preparers, we found that paid preparers  made mistakes in every one of our visits, with tax consequences that  were sometimes significant. Some of the most serious problems  involved preparers not reporting business income and failing to itemize  deductions at all or failing to claim all available deductions. The limited  data did not permit observations about the quality of the work of paid  tax preparers in general. Undoubtedly, many paid preparers do their  best to provide their clients with tax returns that are compliant with  the tax law. IRS has initiated some enforcement actions in response to  our findings with audits of some preparers\u2019 returns scheduled to begin  in April 2007. Recent Justice Department suits to stop fraudulent return  preparation at more than 125 outlets of one preparation chain for  allegedly taking part in preparation scams highlight the obligations of  paid preparers.

Future  BSM project releases face serious risks, which IRS is working to  mitigate. For example, delays in deploying the latest release of CADE  have resulted in contention for key resources and will likely impact the  design and development of the next two important releases, which are  scheduled to be deployed later this year. IRS has made significant  progress in implementing our prior recommendations and improving its  modernization management controls and capabilities. However, critical  controls and capabilities related to requirements development and  management and post-implementation reviews of deployed BSM  projects have not yet been fully implemented. In addition, more work  remains to be done by the agency to fully develop a long-term vision  and strategy for completing the BSM program, including establishing  time frames for consolidating and retiring legacy systems.", "Continued compliance research is essential to IRS\u2019s ability to  effectively focus its service and compliance efforts, and we have long  been a supporter of such research. Well-designed compliance research  gives IRS and Congress an important measure of taxpayer compliance  and it allows IRS to better target enforcement resources towards  noncompliant taxpayers. IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request includes  a proposal for a rolling sample of individual returns (small annual  samples that would replace larger but intermittent efforts) and a  dedicated cadre of examiners to review the returns. We consider this to  be a good approach to refreshing research compliance data because  doing compliance studies once every few years does not provide  information in the intervening years.

Last year, electronic filing of federal returns  increased 27 percent for the three states (New York, Connecticut, and  Utah) with new 2006 mandates. This year, state mandates are likely to  continue to show a positive effect on federal electronic filing because,  with the addition of West Virginia, 13 states now have state mandates.", "Compared to processing paper returns, electronic filing reduces IRS\u2019s  costs by reducing staff devoted to processing. In 2006, IRS used almost  1,700 (36 percent) fewer staff years for processing paper tax returns than  in 1999, shown in figure 1. IRS estimates this saved the agency $78 million  in salary, benefits, and overtime in 2006. Electronic filing also improves  service to taxpayers.

While state I-file systems generated benefits, such as increased  electronic filing, the overall benefits were limited by low usage, which  ranged from about 1 percent to just over 5 percent of eligible taxpayers.  Restrictions on taxpayer eligibility and system features helped keep costs  modest. States varied in whether they used contractors to develop and  operate the I-file system. For the states we profiled, it is unclear whether  benefits were greater than costs, in part, because of the low number of  taxpayers who converted from paper to electronic filing.", "IRS\u2019s potential to realize net cost savings from an I-file system depends on  the costs of developing the system and the number of taxpayers converted  from paper. IRS\u2019s costs to provide a new I-file service could be higher than  states\u2019 for several reasons: (1) the federal tax system is more complex, (2)  unlike some states that already had transactional Web sites, IRS would  need to develop the capability to receive tax returns on its Web site, and  (3) developing an I-file system could further stretch IRS\u2019s capability to  manage systems development, an area we have designated high risk since  1995. The key to IRS achieving a net cost savings depends on the number  of individuals converted from paper to electronic filing and the savings per  return estimated to be $2.36 by IRS. It is uncertain how many of the 58  million taxpayers who filed on paper would convert. The over 13 million  taxpayers who self-prepare their returns on a computer but print them out  and mail them to IRS are an attractive target for I-file because they already  have access to a computer and may be more willing to try I-file.

Sixty-two percent of all the individual tax  returns filed for the 2006 filing season used a paid preparer.", "In most states, anyone can be a paid preparer regardless of education,  training, or licensure. However, there are different types of preparers. Paid  preparers who hold professional certificates include CPAs and attorneys.  Other preparers vary in their backgrounds. Some have extensive training  and experience and others do not.", "In 2003 we reported to this Committee that while many taxpayers who  used paid preparers believed they benefited from doing so, some were  poorly served. Last year we reported to this Committee on errors made  by commercial chain preparers, including the results of undercover visits  to 19 locations.", "In our visits to 19 outlets of several commercial chain preparers, we found  that paid preparers made mistakes in every one of our visits, with tax  consequences that were sometimes significant. The errors resulted in  unwarranted extra refunds of up to almost $2,000 in five instances, while  in two cases they cost the taxpayer over $1,500. Some of the most serious  problems involved preparers    not reporting business income in 10 of 19 cases;    not asking about where a child lived or ignoring our answer to the  question and, therefore, claiming an ineligible child for the earned  income tax credit in 5 out of the 10 applicable cases; failing to take the most advantageous postsecondary education tax  benefit in 3 out of the 9 applicable cases; and failing to itemize deductions at all or failing to claim all available  deductions in 7 out of the 9 applicable cases.", "At the time, IRS officials responded that, had our undercover investigators  been real taxpayers filing tax returns, many of the preparers would have  been subject to penalties for such things as negligence and willful or  reckless disregard of tax rules and some may have risen to the level of  criminal prosecution for willful preparation of a false or fraudulent return.  The taxpayers in these cases would also have been potentially exposed to  IRS enforcement action.", "The limited data did not permit observations about the quality of the work  of paid tax preparers in general. Undoubtedly, many paid preparers do  their best to provide their clients with tax returns that are both fully  compliant with the tax law and cause them to neither overpay nor  underpay their federal income taxes.", "IRS and the paid preparer community have taken some actions as a result  of our work. After we provided the results of our 19 visits to IRS, IRS  determined that 4 of these cases warranted a Program Action Case. In a  Program Action Case, IRS selects 30 tax returns from a preparer and  audits them to look for a pattern of compliance problems. IRS officials  told us that these audits would begin in April 2007. Other cases were  referred to the office responsible for monitoring earned income tax credit  compliance, and we have been told that 10 preparers that we visited will  receive visits to check for compliance with the due diligence requirements  of that program. IRS also referred the cases to the office that monitors  electronic filing compliance.", "We also presented our findings at all six of its nationwide tax forums last  year, large educational conferences for the paid preparer community. In  addition, we have been told that some tax preparation chains and preparer  organizations have incorporated the results of our work into their  educational materials. Finally, we recommended that IRS conduct  research to determine the extent to which paid preparers live up to their  responsibilities to file accurate and complete tax returns based on  information they obtain from their customers. IRS officials have described  plans to develop data to use to research paid preparer compliance issues,  including whether tax preparers who are noncompliant themselves are  more likely to prepare client returns that are noncompliant. To date, this  research has not been completed. While this may be useful research, we  do not believe such research would determine the extent to which paid  preparers live up to their responsibilities.", "Recent suits filed by the Justice Department highlight the obligations of  paid preparers.

For example, BSM includes projects to allow  taxpayers to file and retrieve information electronically and to provide  technology solutions to help reduce the backlog of collections cases.  Despite progress made in implementing BSM projects and improving  modernization management controls and capabilities, significant  challenges and serious risks remain, and further program improvements  are needed, which IRS is working to address.", "Over the past year, IRS has made further progress in implementing BSM  projects and in meeting cost and schedule commitments, but two key  projects experienced significant cost overruns during 2006\u2014CADE and  Modernized e-File. During 2006 and the beginning of 2007, IRS deployed  additional releases of the following modernized systems that have  delivered benefits to taxpayers and the agency: CADE, Modernized e-File,  and Filing and Payment Compliance (a tax collection case analysis  support system). Each of the five associated project segments that were  delivered during 2006 were completed on time or within the targeted 10  percent schedule variance threshold, and two of them were also  completed within the targeted 10 percent variance threshold for cost.  However, one segment of the Modernized e-File project as well as a  segment of the CADE project experienced cost increases of 36 percent and  15 percent, respectively. According to IRS, the cost overrun for  Modernized e-File was due in part to upgrading infrastructure to support  the electronic filing mandate for large corporations and tax-exempt  organizations, which was not in the original projections or scope.", "IRS has also made significant progress in implementing our prior  recommendations and improving its modernization management controls  and capabilities, including efforts to institutionalize configuration  management procedures and develop an updated modernization vision  and strategy and associated 5-year plan to guide information technology  investment decisions during fiscal years 2007 through 2011. However,  critical controls and capabilities related to requirements development and  management and post implementation reviews of deployed BSM projects  have not yet been fully implemented. In addition, more work remains to be  done by the agency to fully address our prior recommendation of  developing a long-term vision and strategy for completing the BSM  program, including establishing time frames for consolidating and retiring  legacy systems. IRS recognizes this and intends to conduct further  analyses and update its vision and strategy to address the full scope of tax  administration functions and provide additional details and refinements on  the agency\u2019s plans for legacy system dispositions.", "Future BSM project releases continue to face significant risks and issues,  which IRS is taking steps to address. IRS has reported that significant  challenges and risks confront its future planned system deliveries. For  example, delays in deploying the latest release of CADE to support the  current filing season have resulted in continued contention for key  resources and will likely impact the design and development of the next  two important releases, which are planned to be deployed later this year.  The potential for schedule delays, coupled with the reported resource  constraints and the expanding complexity of the CADE project, increase  the risk of scope problems and the deferral of planned functionality to  later releases. Maintaining alignment between the planned releases of  CADE and the new Accounts Management Services project is also a key  area of concern because of the functional interdependencies. The agency  recognizes the potential impact of these project risks and issues on its  ability to deliver planned functionality within cost and schedule estimates  and, to its credit, has developed mitigation strategies to address them. We  will, however, continue to monitor the various risks IRS identifies and the  agency\u2019s strategies to address them and will report any concerns.", "IRS has also made further progress in addressing high-priority BSM  program improvement initiatives during the past year, including efforts  related to institutionalizing the Modernization Vision and Strategy  approach and integrating it with IRS\u2019s capital planning and investment  control process, hiring and training 25 entry-level programmers to support  development of CADE, developing an electronic filing strategy through  2010, establishing requirements development/management processes and  guidance (in response to our prior recommendation), and defining  governance structures and processes across all projects. IRS\u2019s high- priority improvement initiatives continue to be an effective means of  assessing, prioritizing, and incrementally addressing BSM issues and  challenges. However, more work remains for the agency to fully address  these issues and challenges.", "In addition, we recently reported that IRS could improve its reporting of  progress in meeting BSM project scope (i.e., functionality) expectations by  including a quantitative measure in future expenditure plans. This would  help to provide Congress with more complete information on the agency\u2019s  performance in implementing BSM project releases.

Well designed compliance research gives IRS  and Congress an important measure of taxpayer compliance and it allows  IRS to better target enforcement resources towards noncompliant  taxpayers. Taxpayers benefit as well, because properly targeted audits  mean fewer audits of compliant taxpayers and more confidence by all  taxpayers that others are paying their fair share.", "IRS develops its tax gap estimates by measuring the rate of taxpayer  compliance\u2014the degree to which taxpayers complied with their tax  obligations fully and on time. That rate is then used, along with other data  and assumptions, to estimate the dollar amount of taxes not timely and  accurately paid. For instance, IRS most recently estimated a gross tax gap  of $345 billion for tax year 2001 and that underreporting of income  represented over 80 percent of the gap. IRS developed these estimates  using compliance data collected through its 2001 NRP study, which took  several years to plan and execute.", "In that study, IRS reviewed the compliance of a random sample of about  46,000 individual taxpayers and used those results to estimate compliance  for the population of all individual taxpayers and identify sources of  noncompliance. IRS also used the 2001 NRP results to update its computer  models for selecting likely noncompliant tax returns and used that model  to select cases beginning with returns filed in 2006. IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2008  budget request states that this improved targeting of audits has increased  dollar-per-case yield and reduced \u201cno change\u201d audits of compliant  taxpayers. IRS now has a second NRP study underway, this one looking at  5,000 S corporation tax returns filed in 2003 and 2004.", "IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request includes a proposal for a rolling NRP  sample of individual taxpayers and a dedicated cadre of examiners to  conduct these research audits. Using a rolling sample, IRS plans to  replicate the 2001 NRP study by conducting audits of a smaller sample  size. At the end of 5 years, IRS would have a comparable set of results to  the 2001 study and continue to update the study annually by sampling the  same number of taxpayers, dropping off the oldest year in the sample, and  adding the new years\u2019 results every year. We support this approach. In  previous GAO products, we have observed that doing compliance studies  once every few years does not give IRS or others information about what  is happening in the intervening years, and that a rolling sample should  reduce costs by eliminating the need to plan entirely new studies every  few years or more and train examiners to carry them out. Compliance  research in this way will also give Congress, IRS, and other stakeholders  more frequent and more current information about IRS\u2019s progress towards  its long term compliance goals.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
