Under provisions of the Indian Self-Determination Act, nearly all of the health care programs traditionally administered by IHS have been transferred to 13 Alaska Native regional health organizations (RHO) with which IHS contracts to manage the programs for the Native communities.In recent years, however, some Native communities have chosen to contract directly with IHS rather than go through an RHO to manage their health care programs.", "Some of these individual community contracts have generated controversy. Critics contend that such contracts carry extra administrative costs that can shift dollars out of health care and into overhead.

To provide care to Alaska\u2019s estimated 104,305 Natives, most of whom live in small and isolated villages, a three-tiered health care delivery system of local clinics, regional hospitals, and a comprehensive medical center was developed. (See table 1.)", "IHS\u2019 mission is to provide a comprehensive health services system, while at the same time providing opportunity for maximum tribal involvement in developing and managing programs to meet their needs. The Indian Self-Determination Act gives Alaska Native communities, as well as Indian tribes throughout the United States, the option of replacing IHS as the manager and provider of health care services. To cover the costs of operating such systems on their own, the act authorizes IHS to contract with any of the recognized Alaska Native communities or other tribal organizations, such as regional or village corporations.", "In Alaska, IHS has established an order of precedence for recognizing various Native entities for purposes of self-determination contracting. In this order of precedence, an individual Native community has priority over an RHO in obtaining contract awards from IHS.

These 34 communities comprise two main groups\u201425 communities that decided at some point to separate from their RHO to obtain certain services, and 9 communities, mostly in the Cook Inlet area near Anchorage, that generally have not participated in an RHO.

However, a Native community has the option of withdrawing its resolution from an RHO and contracting directly with IHS to manage all or part of the health services that previously were provided by the RHO. Communities have pursued this option for a variety of reasons, including the belief that local control will improve the delivery of health services and help them attain self-determination goals. Under the Self-Determination Act, IHS\u2019 authority to decline such community contract proposals is very limited.", "Twenty-five communities have decided to stop obtaining some services through RHOs and to contract directly with IHS. In total, there are 12 contractors that separated from RHOs because some contracts cover more than one community. These contracts are generally for a limited number of services\u2014most often alcohol and mental health services, community health aides, community health representatives, and other community-based services. Ten of the contracts, for example, involve management of village community health aide clinics, often in conjunction with alcohol education, prevention, and counseling activities. The Native populations served by the 12 contracts range in size from fewer than 30 people to nearly 2,000, and contract awards range from about $100,000 to more than $3 million.

KIC manages a comprehensive primary care health center with a permanent staff of physicians, dentists, nurses, and a wide range of ancillary services, such as laboratory, X-ray, and pharmacy. KIC officials told us that the community decided to manage the health center itself because it was dissatisfied that the RHO did not provide information that it had agreed to provide, such as quarterly financial statements; did not attend KIC tribal council meetings; and had planned to replace the existing health center with a new one in the neighboring village of Saxman rather than on KIC property in Ketchikan.

The Chickaloon and Knik contracts illustrate the extent to which IHS is bound to support village self-determination decisions. When IHS identified funding to open a new midlevel clinic in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley northeast of Anchorage, three Native organizations in that area submitted proposals to manage the clinic: Southcentral Foundation (an RHO), Chickaloon, and Knik. IHS approved Southcentral\u2019s proposal to manage the clinic; in addition, IHS\u2014under rules requiring IHS to approve any severable portion of a self-determination proposal\u2014negotiated with Chickaloon and Knik regarding what services they could provide with their limited per-capita-based shares of the clinic funding.

In Alaska, these provisions apply both to contracts between IHS and RHOs and to contracts between IHS and individual Native communities. Direct program funding is the amount that IHS would have spent to operate the programs that were transferred to the contractors. CSC funding generally is an additional amount, not normally spent by IHS, that is needed to cover reasonable costs incurred by Native organizations to ensure compliance with the terms of the contracts and prudent management of the programs. Direct program costs are the same regardless of who manages the contracts\u2014communities or RHOs. In contrast, CSC amounts may differ considerably.", "Determination of CSC needs is based on three cost categories: start-up costs, indirect costs, and direct costs. (See table 3.) The largest cost category is indirect costs, which include most ongoing overhead expenses. For most contracts, indirect costs account for over 80 percent of the recurring CSC funding needs.", "Our analysis of cost differences between RHO contracts and individual community contracts focused on the first two types of contract support costs\u2014start-up and indirect costs.

For fiscal year 1998, IHS determined indirect cost needs of slightly more than $3 million for the 12 individual community contracts that separated from RHOs. The IHS official responsible for negotiating these contracts told us that to estimate what the indirect costs would have been if the services provided under the 12 contracts had instead been provided through RHOs, he would use the indirect cost rates in place for the RHOs during fiscal year 1998. Using these rates that he provided, we determined the indirect costs for the RHOs to be about $1.3 million\u2014or less than half of the indirect costs for the community contractors. (See app. IV for a contract-by-contract comparison of indirect cost needs of the Native communities and RHOs.)", "IHS officials said the main reason individual community contracts had higher indirect costs was that the small size of these contracts resulted in the loss of administrative economies of scale. Because RHOs have an administrative structure in place to support other contracts and services, they can spread the overhead expenses among their programs. Small communities, however, generally have to build the administrative structure for these services alone.", "We did not compare the indirect costs of the other nine community contracts with those of RHOs because the programs managed by these contracts were not formerly a part of an RHO. However, we found that indirect costs as a proportion of total funding needs that IHS determined for these contracts were similar to those of the 12 community contracts that cover services formerly obtained through an RHO.

The small number of these contracts; their generally restricted scope; and in some cases, their recent implementation have likely been key factors in limiting the effects on Native communities or RHOs. However, a shortfall in available CSC funding may jeopardize the continuation of this level of service. Native communities that are not in a financial position to absorb unfunded contract support costs may face the risk of having to divert funds from health services to cover their unfunded contract support needs. We found one instance, in Fort Yukon, where this may already have occurred."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "To Date, Service Availability Has Not Been Greatly Affected", "paragraphs": ["When individual Alaska Native communities have contracted directly with IHS to provide some of their own health services, they generally have assumed management responsibility for existing, defined service programs being operated by IHS or an RHO.

In addition, the community contractors generally continue to employ the same staff and use the same facilities.", "Generally, we did not find that a community\u2019s takeover of services from an RHO in itself had a substantial effect on the types of services provided or service utilization. The service disruptions that we did find in some communities, such as in Ketchikan, and in some clinics staffed by community health aides tended to be transitory in nature.", "In Ketchikan, when KIC took over the contract from the RHO in October 1997, the health center\u2019s resources, staff, and patient population were split and two separate facilities were established. KIC\u2019s health center initially had a gap in dental services because the RHO retained both dentists when staffing was split. This gap has been partly remedied, and we observed no other gaps in services at the time of our review. However, due to uncertainty surrounding the future of this contract, the staffing situation at both the KIC and RHO clinics was not stable.", "A review of clinics staffed by community health aides that now are managed by community contractors revealed sharp variations in some communities over past years in the numbers of patient encounters provided. However, these variations did not appear to be related to community contracting because they occurred whether a community or an RHO was managing the services. The variations most likely reflect temporary losses of staff because in small, remote Alaska communities, it takes time and training to replace community health aides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortfall in CSC Funding Poses Risks to Service Availability", "paragraphs": ["The 1988 and 1994 amendments to the Indian Self-Determination Act clarified that CSC funding should be made available to provide Indian tribes and Alaska Native communities with additional resources to develop the capability and expertise to manage services on their own. The Senate report accompanying the 1994 amendments expressed concern that without this additional support, Indian tribes would be compelled to divert funds from health services to contract support costs.", "IHS has established two separate pools of CSC funding\u2014one for the recurring CSC needs of ongoing contracts and the other for additional CSC needs of new or expanded contracts. IHS-wide, CSC funding for ongoing contracts has increased from about $100.6 million in fiscal year 1993 to $168.7 million in fiscal year 1998; and since 1994, the Congress has appropriated $7.5 million per year specifically for the CSC needs of new or expanded contracts. However, the demand for CSC funding has greatly exceeded these appropriations. As a result, while IHS has agreed with each contractor on the amount of their CSC funding needs, it has not been able to fully fund those needs. The contractors have the option of delaying or going ahead without full CSC funding, and most of them have chosen to begin implementing their contracts without full funding. Since 1995, IHS has reported a shortfall in CSC funding each year, largely because of the rapid increase in tribal assumption of IHS programs nationwide. For fiscal year 1997, the shortfall totaled $82 million nationwide, over $12 million of it in Alaska.", "As a mechanism for allocating available CSC funds among contractors, IHS maintains a waiting list for new contractors that have chosen to operate without full CSC funding. Available funding is allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and a new contractor\u2019s waiting time for full CSC funding may be at least several years. For example, contractors that entered into contracts in 1994 are now at the top of the waiting list and expect to be funded in fiscal year 1998, a 3- to 4-year wait.", "IHS reports that a continued lack of sufficient CSC funds could, by necessity, result in tribes funding administrative functions with moneys that otherwise would have been used to provide direct health care services. This condition could occur if tribes are unable to realize efficiency gains or do not have other resources to help offset their CSC funding shortfalls.", "This risk is present in Alaska. Fourteen of the 21 direct community contractors were operating with CSC shortfalls in fiscal year 1998, and 7 of these shortfalls represented between 30 to 74 percent of the contract\u2019s total recurring CSC funding needs. (See app. V for details on the CSC shortfalls by contractor.) Shortfalls of this magnitude could make it difficult for tribes to continue to maintain the same level of health services. The risk is less for RHOs, which also may have CSC shortfalls but generally are in a better financial position than community contractors to manage these shortfalls because they manage large multimillion-dollar operations that can benefit from economies of scale and have multiple sources of revenue that can generate positive cash flow. The varying effects of substantial CSC shortfalls on communities that contract directly with IHS can be seen in Ketchikan and Fort Yukon\u2014which are served by the two largest direct community contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Ketchikan, Other Resources Were Initially Available to Manage the CSC Shortfall", "paragraphs": ["In Ketchikan, the large CSC shortfall of over $500,000 a year has not had a negative impact on overall services to the communities involved because both the community contractor, KIC, and the RHO, Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium (SEARHC), were able\u2014at least temporarily\u2014to provide additional resources to make up for the funding gap.", "Prior to October 1997, SEARHC was managing the Ketchikan Indian health center to serve six Native communities\u2014Ketchikan, Saxman, and four outlying communities on Prince of Wales Island. When the health center contract was split, KIC received 58 percent of the funding to serve Ketchikan Natives and SEARHC retained the remainder to serve Saxman and the other communities. Loss of economies of scale occurred in two ways.", "First, additional clinic space was leased to operate two separate clinics. Second, additional staff were needed to deliver the same level of services in two facilities. For example, the total number of clinical and administrative staff for the clinic before the split was 59.5 full time equivalents (FTE). After the split, the two clinics had a combined total of 68 FTEs. Most of the increase was for duplicated administrative functions, such as the need to have two clinic directors, two business office directors, and two computer programmers. Both SEARHC and KIC had the additional resources to initially absorb the additional costs.", "SEARHC is a large RHO that manages many federal and state health programs and services for the benefit of Alaska Natives in Southeast Alaska. At the end of fiscal year 1996, its annual budget was over $50 million and it had over $23 million in net assets. Although the Ketchikan clinic had 2 years remaining on its lease, SEARHC decided to lease a new facility nearby for its own clinic to serve Saxman and the outlying communities, asserting that it was not practical to share the original building with KIC. SEARHC spent almost an additional $1 million of its own resources on this new clinic. With the new clinic and additional staff, clinic waiting times for the Saxman Native community were reduced.", "KIC assumed management of the original clinic with a contract award of nearly $3.4 million and a CSC shortfall of over $500,000. Although it is too soon to determine the long-term impact of this shortfall, KIC has been able to use its tribal government resources\u2014especially management staff from other programs\u2014to reduce the additional administrative need.

In 1997, for example, there was considerable turnover in the Fort Yukon clinic\u2019s physician assistant staff, resulting in vacancies that were not immediately filled. Although the number of outpatient visits at the clinic did not decline substantially, the Native Village of Fort Yukon was so dissatisfied with CATG\u2019s failure to fill the clinic vacancies and with other matters that the village considered asking IHS or the RHO to resume management of the clinic or contracting directly with IHS.
