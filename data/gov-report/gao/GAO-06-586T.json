The SSN was created as a means to track  workers\u2019 earnings and eligibility for Social Security benefits. However, the  SSN has evolved beyond its original intended purpose and has become the  identifier of choice for public and private sector entities, and is used for  numerous non-Social Security purposes. This is significant because SSNs,  along with a name and date of birth, are the pieces of information most  often sought by identity thieves. Once an SSN is obtained fraudulently, it  can then be used to create false identities for financial misuse, assuming  another individual\u2019s identity, fraudulently obtaining credit, violating  immigration laws, or fleeing the criminal justice system. Recent statistics  suggest that the incidence of identity theft is rapidly growing. The Federal  Trade Commission (FTC) estimated that over a 1-year period nearly 10  million people\u2014or 4.6 percent of the adult U.S. population\u2014discovered  that they were victims of some form of identity theft, translating into  estimated losses exceeding $50 billion. FTC also reported that most  victims of identity theft do not report the crime, and, therefore, the total  number of identity theft incidences is unknown.", "Over the last few years Congress and some states have recognized the  importance of restricting the use and display of SSNs by both public and  private sectors.

GAO has issued a number of reports and testified before  this Subcommittee about the various aspects of SSN use in both the public  and private sectors. (See related GAO products at the end of this  testimony.) Accordingly, you asked us to speak about some of our findings  regarding SSN use and protections. My remarks today will focus on (1) the  use of SSNs by government agencies and certain private sector entities, (2)  the federal laws that regulate the use and disclosure of SSNs, and (3) the  gaps that remain in protecting the SSN and what more could be done.", "In summary, SSN use is widespread by both the public and private sectors.  Agencies at all levels of government frequently collect and use SSNs to  administer their programs, verify applicants\u2019 eligibility for services and  benefits, and perform research and evaluations of their programs. In  addition, SSNs are available in a variety of public records held by states,  local jurisdictions, and courts, appearing in records that document  common life events and transactions, such as marriages and home  purchases. Certain private sector entities also use SSNs. Information  resellers, credit reporting agencies (CRAs), and health care organizations  routinely obtain SSNs from various public and private sources, and use  SSNs for various purposes, such as to build tools that verify an individual\u2019s  identity or match existing records.

In our prior work, we found gaps in the  practices for protecting SSNs by government agencies and across industry  sectors. As a result, we made recommendations to federal agencies to  address the issues we found and proposed matters for Congress to  consider. For example, we found that certain measures that could help  protect SSNs are not uniformly in place at all levels of government. In  addition, there are gaps in the federal law and oversight in different  industries that share SSNs with their contractors, and there are few  restrictions placed on certain entities\u2019 abilities to obtain and use SSNs in  the course of their business. Finally, SSNs are widely exposed in a variety  of public records and are still subject to exposure on identity cards issued  under federal auspices. To address some of these issues, we made  recommendations and proposed matters for congressional consideration.  For example, to address gaps in the government uses of SSNs and the  exposure of SSNs in public records and on identification cards, we advised  Congress to convene a group of government officials to develop a unified  approach to safeguarding SSNs.

Today, SSA  issues SSNs to most U.S. citizens, but they are also available to non- citizens lawfully admitted to the United States with permission to work.  Lawfully admitted noncitizens may also qualify for a SSN for nonwork  purposes when a federal, state, or local law requires that they have a SSN  to obtain a particular welfare benefit or service. SSA staff collect and  verify information from such applicants regarding their age, identity,  citizenship, and immigration status.", "With the enhancement of computer technologies in recent years, private  sector businesses are increasingly computerizing their records; as a result,  these enhancements have spawned new businesses activities involving the  aggregation of person information. Information resellers, sometimes  referred to as information brokers, are businesses that specialize in  amassing consumer information including SSNs for informational services.  They may provide their services to a variety of customers, either to  specific businesses clients or through the Internet to anyone willing to pay  a fee. Consumer reporting agencies, also known as credit bureaus, are  agencies that collect and sell information about the creditworthiness of  individuals. CRAs collect information that is considered relevant to a  person\u2019s credit history, and obtain SSNs from their customers or  businesses that furnish data to them, as well as from private and public  sources. Organizations that provide health care services also commonly  use consumers\u2019 SSNs. They obtain SSNs from individuals themselves and  companies that offer health care plans.", "In recent years, companies have increasingly relied on the use of  contractors to perform certain activities and functions related to their  business operations. This trend has often been referred to as outsourcing.  However, no commonly recognized definition of outsourcing exists, and  there has been confusion over whether it encompasses only activities a  company performed in-house or includes any activity a company may  contract out. According to outsourcing experts, approximately 90 percent  of businesses contract out some activity because they find either it is more  economical to do so or other companies are better able to perform these  activities. Some of the activities companies outsource will require that  contractors be provided personal information about the companies\u2019  customers in order to perform those activities, in some cases, this  information includes SSNs.", "Due to the pervasive use of SSNs, individuals are routinely asked to  disclose their SSNs, along with other personal identifying information, for  numerous purposes. In some instances where individuals provide their  SSNs to government entities, documents containing the SSN are routinely  made available to the public for inspection. The widespread disclosure of  SSNs in public records has raised concern because it can put individuals at  increased risk of identity theft. In addition, given the explosion in the  Internet use and the ease with which personally identifiable information is  accessible, individuals looking to steal someone\u2019s identity are increasingly  able to do so. According to FTC, it receives roughly 15,000 to 20,000  contacts per week on its hotline and Web site, or through the mail from  victims and consumers who want to avoid becoming victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both Government and Private Sector Entities Collect and Use SSNs for a Variety of Purposes", "paragraphs": ["Government entities are generally required by law to collect SSNs to  determine individuals\u2019 eligibility for services and benefits.

Based on a survey of federal, state,  and local governments, we reported in 2004 that state agencies in 41 states  and the District of Columbia were displaying SSNs in public records; this  was also true in 75 percent of U.S. counties. We also found that while the  number and type of records in which SSNs were displayed varied greatly  across states and counties, SSNs were most often found in court and  property records.", "Public records displaying SSNs are stored in multiple formats that vary by  different levels of government. State government offices tended to store  such records electronically, while most local government records were  stored on microfiche or microfilm. However, our survey found that public  access to such records was often limited to inspection of the individual  paper copy or request by mail.", "We found that few state agencies make public records available on the  Internet, although some do so. However, few state or local offices reported  any plans to significantly expand Internet access to public records that  display SSNs.

Large or well known information resellers have told us they  obtain SSNs from various public records, such as records of bankruptcies,  tax liens, civil judgments, criminal histories, deaths, real estate  transactions, voter registrations, and professional licenses. They also said  that they sometimes obtain batch files of electronic copies of jurisdictional  public records where available. However, some reseller officials said they  are more likely to rely on SSNs obtained directly from their clients, who  would voluntarily provide such information for a specific service or  product, than those found in public records.", "Like information resellers, CRAs also obtain SSNs from public and private  sources. CRA officials have told us that they obtained SSNs from public  sources, such as bankruptcy records. We also found that these companies  obtained SSNs from other information resellers, especially those that  specialized in obtaining information from public records. However, CRAs  are more likely to obtain SSNs from businesses that subscribe to their  services, such as banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies, debt  collection agencies, child support enforcement agencies, credit grantors,  and employment screening companies. Therefore, individuals who provide  these businesses with their SSNs for reasons such as applying for credit  would subsequently have their charges and payment transactions,  accompanied by the SSN, reported to the CRAs.", "Health care organizations, including health care insurance plans and  providers, are less likely to obtain SSN data from public sources. Health  care organizations typically obtained SSNs either from individuals  themselves or from companies that offer health care plans. For example,  subscribers or policyholders enrolled in a health care plan provide their  SSN as part of their health care plan application to their company or  employer group. In addition to health care plans, health care organizations  also included health care providers, such as hospitals. Such entities often  collected SSNs as part of the process of obtaining information on insured  people. However, health care provider officials told us that, particularly  with hospitals, the medical record number is the primary identifier, rather  than the SSN.", "We found that the primary use of the SSN by information resellers, CRAs,  and health care organizations alike was to help verify the identity of an  individual. Large information resellers said they generally use the SSN as  an identity verification tool. They also use it for internal matching  purposes of its databases, as a factor in identifying individuals for their  product reports, or for conducting investigations for their clients for  resident screening or employment screening. CRAs use SSNs as the  primary identifier of individuals that enables them to match the  information they receive from their business clients with information  stored in their databases on individuals. Because these companies have  various commercial, financial, and government agencies furnishing data to  them, the SSN is the primary factor that ensures that incoming data is  matched correctly with an individual\u2019s information on file. We found that  in some cases CRAs and information resellers can sometimes be the same  entity, a fact that blurs the distinction between the two types of businesses  but does not affect the use of SSNs by these entities. Finally, health care  organizations also use the SSN to help verify the identity of individuals.  These organizations use SSNs, along with other information such as name,  address, and date of birth, as a factor in determining a member\u2019s identity.", "Private sector companies also share customers\u2019 SSNs with their  contractors. Banks, investment firms, telecommunication companies, and  tax preparation companies we interviewed routinely obtain SSNs from  their customers for authentication and identification purposes. All these  companies contracted out various services, such as data processing,  administrative, and customer service functions. Although these companies  may share consumer information, such as SSNs, with contractors that  provide services to their customers, company officials said that they only  share such information with their contractors for limited purposes,  generally when it is necessary or unavoidable.", "The companies we contacted provided us with standard contract forms  they use in contracting with service providers to safeguard customers\u2019  personal information, such as SSNs, from misuse. In general, the types of  provisions these companies included in their standard contract forms  included electronic and physical data protections, audit rights, data breach  notifications, subcontractor restrictions, and data handling and disposal  requirements. We found that most of the companies we interviewed had  established some type of due diligence or credentialing process to verify  the reliability of potential contractors prior to and during contract  negotiations.

These laws, however, tend to be directed at specific industries or  governmental agencies and often do not apply broadly across public and  private sectors or across private sector industries. For example, the  overall use and disclosure of SSNs by the federal government is restricted  under the Privacy Act, which, broadly speaking, seeks to balance the  government\u2019s need to maintain information about individuals with the  rights of individuals to be protected against unwarranted invasions of their  privacy. The Privacy Act requires that any federal, state, or local  government agency, when requesting an SSN from an individual, tell  individuals whether disclosing their SSN is mandatory or voluntary, cite  the statutory or other authority under which the request is being made,  and state what uses it will make of the individual\u2019s SSN.", "Other federal laws have also placed restrictions on private sector entities\u2019  use and disclosure of consumers\u2019 personal information, including SSNs.  These include the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Fair and Accurate  Credit Transaction Act (FACTA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the  Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), and the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As shown in table 1, some of  these federal laws either restrict certain private sector entities from  disclosing personally identifiable information to specific purposes or with  whom the information is shared. In addition, certain industries, such as  the financial services industry, are required to protect individuals\u2019  personal information to a greater degree than entities in other industries.", "Congress has also introduced a federal statute that criminalizes fraud in  connection with the unlawful theft and misuse of personal identifiable  information. In 1998, Congress enacted the Identity Theft and Assumption  Deterrence Act (Identity Theft Act). The act made it a criminal offense for  a person to \u201cknowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority,\u201d  another person\u2019s means of identification \u201cwith the intent to commit, or to  aid or abet, or in connection with, any unlawful activity that constitutes a  violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable  state or local law.\u201d Under the act, a name or Social Security number is  considered a \u201cmeans of identification\u201d and a number of cases have been  prosecuted under this law.", "Many states have begun to enact laws to restrict the use and display of  SSNs. (See appendix 1 for a listing of state laws previously reported by  GAO.) After one state took action, other states followed in enacting similar  laws. For example, in 2001, California enacted a law restricting the use and  display of SSNs, which generally prohibited companies and persons from  engaging in certain activities, such as posting or publicly displaying SSNs,  or requiring people to transmit an SSN over the Internet unless the  connection is secure or the number is encrypted. In addition, California  enacted a law containing notification requirements in the event of a  security breach where a business or a California state agency is required to  notify any California resident whose unencrypted personal information  was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized  person.", "Subsequently, other states have enacted laws restricting the use and  display of SSNs.  Specifically, in our prior work, we identified 13 others  states\u2014Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,  Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia\u2014that  have each passed laws similar to California\u2019s. While some states, such as  Arizona, have enacted virtually identical SSN use and display restrictions,  other states have modified the restrictions in various ways. For example,  unlike the California law, which prohibits the use of the full SSN, the  Michigan statute prohibits the use of more than four sequential digits of  the SSN.  The Michigan law also contains a prohibition against the use of  SSNs on identification and membership cards, permits, and licenses.  Missouri\u2019s law includes a prohibition against requiring an individual to use  his or her SSN as an employee number.  Oklahoma\u2019s law is unique in that it  only limits the ways in which employers may use their employees\u2019 SSNs,  and does not apply more generally to other types of transactions and  activities.", "Some states have recently enacted other types of restrictions on the uses  of SSNs as well. Arkansas, Colorado, and Wisconsin limit the use of a  student\u2019s SSN as a student identification number. New Mexico requires  businesses that have acquired consumer SSNs to adopt internal policies to  limit access to authorized employees. Texas recently enacted a law  requiring businesses to properly dispose of business records that contain a  customer\u2019s personal identifying information, which is defined to include  SSNs.", "Other recent state legislation includes new restrictions on state and local  government agencies. For example, South Dakota law prohibits the  display of SSNs on all driver\u2019s licenses and nondriver\u2019s identification  cards, while Indiana law generally prohibits a state agency from releasing  a SSN unless otherwise required by law. In addition, as of January 1,  2007, a Nevada law will require governmental agencies, except in certain  circumstances, to ensure that the SSNs recorded in their books and on  their records are maintained in a confidential manner.", "We also identified four states that have passed legislation containing  notification requirements in the event of a security breach. For example,  New York recently enacted a law requiring such notifications. California  requires a business or a California state agency to notify any California  resident whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably  believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person. In the last  year, this law forced several large companies to notify individuals that  their information was compromised because of certain circumstances.  Under a Nevada law, government agencies and certain persons who do  business in the state must notify individuals if their personal information is  reasonably believed to have been compromised. Similarly, Georgia  requires certain private sector entities to notify their customers if a  security breach occurred that compromised their customers\u2019 personal  information, such as their SSNs.", "In addition, we found that some state offices were beginning to take  measures to change the way in which they displayed or shared SSNs in  public records. For example, we found that many state agencies had  restricted access to or redacted\u2014covered or otherwise hidden from  view\u2014SSNs from public versions of records. Specific restrictions and  other actions state agencies reported taking included blocking or  removing SSNs from electronic versions of records, allowing individuals  identified in the record to request removing their SSN from the publicly  available version, replacing SSNs with alternative identifiers, and  restricting access only to individuals identified in the records.", "Finally, Congress is currently considering consumer privacy legislation,  which in some cases includes SSN restrictions. In 2005, there were more  than 20 proposed bills pending before the U.S. House and Senate. In some  cases, the provisions being considered mirrored provisions in enacted  state laws. For example, some proposed legislation included prohibitions  on the display of SSNs, similar to a Colorado law, while other proposed  legislation address the solicitation of SSNs by public and private sector  entities. In addition, some federal privacy legislation also proposed  consumer safeguards, such as security freezes and prohibitions on the sale  and purchase of SSNs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Could Be Done To Protect SSNs", "paragraphs": ["Although laws at both state and federal levels have helped to restrict SSN  display and protect individual\u2019s personal information, clearly gaps remain.

Agencies that deliver services and benefits use SSNs to  administer programs and took some steps to safeguard SSNs. However,  when federal, state, and county agencies request SSNs, they did not  consistently inform the SSN holders of whether they must provide the SSN  to receive benefits or services and how the SSN will be used. In addition,  although some agencies took action to limit the display of SSNs on  documents that were not intended to be public but may be viewed by  others, these actions sometimes took place in a piecemeal manner rather  than as a result of a systematic effort.", "In our reviews of private sector entities\u2019 collection and use of SSNs, we  found gaps in how different industries are covered by federal laws  protecting individual\u2019s personal information. In our third party  contractors\u2019 review, we reported that federal regulation and oversight of  SSN sharing varies across four industries we reviewed, revealing gaps in  federal law and agency oversight for different industries that share SSNs  with their contractors. For example, federal law and oversight of the  sharing of personal information in the financial services industry is very  extensive: financial services companies must comply with GLBA  requirements for safeguarding customer\u2019s personal information, and  regulators have an examination process in place that includes determining  whether banks and securities firms are safeguarding this information. IRS  has regulations and guidance in place to restrict the disclosure of SSNs by  tax preparers and their contractors, but does not perform periodic reviews  of tax preparers\u2019 compliance. FCC does not have regulations covering  SSNs and also does not periodically review telecommunications  companies to determine whether they are safeguarding such information.  Companies in the industries we reviewed relied on accepted industry  practices and primarily used the terms of their contracts to safeguard  personal information, including SSNs they shared with outside  contractors.", "We also found that there are few restrictions placed on certain entities\u2019  abilities such as information resellers to resell SSNs in the course of their  business. Although certain federal laws have some restrictions on reselling  nonpublic personal information, these laws only apply to certain types of  private sector entities, such as financial institutions.", "In our review of SSNs in public records, we found that SSNs are widely  exposed to view in a variety of public records and are still subject to  exposure on identity cards issued under federal auspices. The number  and type of records in which SSNs are displayed varies greatly for both  states and counties, and SSNs are available in some federal court records.  A number of government agencies and oversight bodies are taking steps to  eliminate the open display of SSNs. For example, some actions state  agencies reported taking included blocking or removing SSNs from  electronic versions of records, and replacing SSNs with alternative  identifiers. However, such initiatives to protect the SSN may slow its  misuse, but the absence of uniform and comprehensive policy is likely to  leave many individuals vulnerable.", "Finally, although they are not displayed in public records en masse, we  found that millions of SSNs are still subject to exposure on individual  identity cards issued under federal auspices. We found that in 2004 an  estimated 42 million Medicare cards displayed entire 9-digit SSNs, as did  approximately 8 million Department of Defense (DOD) insurance cards  and 7 million Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiary cards.   Some of these agencies have begun taking action to remove SSNs from  identification cards.  For example, VA is eliminating SSNs from 7 million  VA identification cards and is replacing cards with SSNs or issuing new  cards without SSNs from 2004 through 2009, until all such cards have been  replaced.  DOD has begun replacing approximately 6 million health  insurance cards that display SSNs with cards that do not display the  bearer\u2019s SSN, but continues to include SSNs on approximately 8 million  military identification cards.

The Privacy Act and other federal laws prescribe  actions federal departments and agencies must take to assure the  security of SSNs and other personal information. However, these  requirements may not be uniformly observed. We presented a matter  for congressional consideration to facilitate intergovernmental  collaboration in strengthening safeguards at the state and local levels.  We also made two recommendations to the Office of Management and  Budget that it direct federal agencies to review their practices for  securing SSNs and providing required information, and advise all  federal, state, and local governments of the applicability of the Privacy  Act to their uses of SSNs. OMB has implemented both our  recommendations.", "In our report on third party contactors\u2019 uses of SSNs, we recommended  that Congress consider possible options for addressing the gaps in  existing federal requirements for safeguarding SSNs shared with  contractors. The current gaps do not provide incentives for companies  to commit to protecting personal information. Each industry is subject  to different federal oversight and is often left to decide what  established practices for safeguarding SSNs and other consumer  information it wishes to follow. We suggested that one approach  Congress could take would be to require industry-specific protections  for the sharing of SSNs with contractors where such measures are not  already in place. For example, Congress could consider whether the  Telecommunications Act of 1996 should be amended to address how  that industry shares SSNs with contractors. Alternatively, we suggested  that Congress could take a broader approach. For example, in  considering proposed legislation that would generally restrict the use  and display of SSNs, Congress could also include a provision that  would explicitly apply this restriction to third party contractors. We  stated that with either approach, Congress would want to establish a  mechanism overseeing compliance by contractors and enforcement.", "In our report on the display of SSNs on identification cards and in  public records, we recommended that OMB identify all those federal  activities that require or engage in the display of 9-digit SSNs on health  insurance, identification, or any other cards issued to federal  government personnel or program beneficiaries, and devise a  governmentwide policy to ensure a consistent approach to this type of  display. Although SSA has authority to issue policies and procedures  over the Social Security cards that it issues, it does not have authority  over how other federal agencies use and display SSNs. Rather, it is up  to individual government agencies to have their own policies for the  cards issued under their authority. The lack of a broad, uniform policy  allows for inconsistent, but persistent exposure of the SSN. OMB has  not yet taken action on our recommendation but said at the time we  issued our report they would consider it. With regard to SSN exposure  in public records, we again noted that it would be constructive for a  representative group of federal, state, and local officials to develop a  unified approach to safeguarding SSNs used in all levels of government,  particularly those displayed in public records.", "Finally, with regard to private sector entities, such as information  resellers reselling personal information, including SSNs, we noted that  there are few restrictions placed on these entities ability to obtain, use,  and resell SSNs for their businesses. The federal laws that have some  restrictions can be interpreted broadly. The broad interpretation  combined with the uncertainty about the application of the exceptions  suggest that reselling personal information\u2014including SSNs\u2014is likely  to continue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The use of SSNs by both public and private sector entities is likely to  continue given that it is used as the key identifier by most of these entities  and there is currently no other widely accepted alternative. Given the  significance of the SSN in committing fraud or stealing a person\u2019s identity,  it is imperative that steps be taken to protect it. Without proper safeguards  in place, SSNs will remain vulnerable to misuse, thus adding to the  growing number of identity theft victims.", "SSNs are still widely used and publicly available, although becoming less  so. State legislatures have begun to place restrictions on SSNs by enacting  laws that restrict the use and display of SSNs and prohibit the theft of  individuals\u2019 personal information. Yet, more could be done to protect  SSNs. As Congress continues to propose and consider legislation to  protect individuals\u2019 personal information, gaps in protections that have  already been identified could help focus the debate on the areas that could  be addressed immediately based on our work in order to prevent SSNs and  other personal information from being misused.", "At this Subcommittee\u2019s request, we are continuing work on SSNs and the  ease with which they can be purchased from Internet information  resellers. We look forward to supporting continued congressional  consideration of these important policy issues. That concludes my  testimony, and I would be pleased to respond to any questions the  subcommittee has."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information regarding this testimony, please contact Cindy M.
