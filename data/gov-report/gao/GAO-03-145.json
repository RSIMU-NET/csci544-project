The increase in collections reflected VA's improved ability to manage the larger billing volume and more itemized bills required under its new fee schedule. Billings increased mainly due to a reduction of billing backlogs and improved collections processes--such as better medical documentation prepared by physicians, more complete identification of billable care by coders, and more bills prepared per biller--according to VA managers in three regional health care networks. However, VA continues to address operational problems, such as missed billing opportunities, that limit the amount VA collects. To address operational problems and further increase collections, VA has several initiatives under way and is developing additional ones. VA has been implementing initiatives in its 2001 improvement plan that was designed to address operational problems, such as unidentified insurance for some patients, insufficient documentation of services for billing, shortages of coding staff, and insufficient pursuit of accounts receivable. VA's last formal status report in May 2002 designated only 8 of the plan's 15 initiatives scheduled for completion by that time as having been completed. VA continues implementation of this plan and is also developing new initiatives, such as an automated financial system to better serve billing needs. It is too early to evaluate the extent to which VA's full implementation of its 2001 plan and new initiatives will be able to address operational problems and further increase third-party collections. In commenting on a draft of this report, VA generally agreed with our findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care to eligible  veterans and, under certain circumstances, VA is authorized to collect  reasonable charges from their health insurers. Specifically, VA can bill  insurers for treatment of conditions that are not a result of injuries or  illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service. VA cannot bill for  health care conditions that result from military service, nor is it generally  authorized to collect from Medicare and Medicaid. In fiscal year 2002, VA  collected $687 million in insurance payments, which are known as third- party collections. These collections were VA\u2019s largest source of revenue to  supplement its $21 billion medical care appropriation, and they helped pay  for veterans\u2019 growing demand for care. The total number of veterans VA  treated has increased from 2.6 million in fiscal year 1996 to 3.8 million in  fiscal year 2001, and VA predicts continuing growth in its patient  workload.", "Over the past several years, we and others have raised concerns about  VA\u2019s ability to maximize its third-party collections to enhance revenue. For  example, a VA Inspector General report stated that VA missed billing  opportunities, had billing backlogs, and did inadequate follow-up on  accounts receivable in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. We testified in  September 2001 that problems in VA\u2019s collections operations\u2014such as  inadequate patient intake procedures to gather insurance information,  insufficient physician documentation, a shortage of qualified coders, and  insufficient automation\u2014diminished VA\u2019s collections.", "At your request, we have examined VA\u2019s progress with third-party  collections since September 2001. In this report, we are providing an  update on (1) VA\u2019s third-party collections and problems in collections  operations for fiscal year 2002 and (2) VA\u2019s initiatives to improve  collections. To conduct our review, we examined VA\u2019s collections data for  fiscal years 2001 and 2002; reviewed relevant VA documents, such as its  2001 collections improvement plan; and interviewed officials in VA  headquarters and in 3 of VA\u2019s 21 health care networks\u2014Network 2  (Albany), Network 9 (Nashville), and Network 22 (Long Beach)\u2014to better  understand the reasons for increased collections. Our work was  performed from February 2002 through January 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. For more details on  our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Although VA has been authorized to collect third-party health insurance  payments since 1986, it was not allowed to use these funds to supplement  its medical care appropriations until enactment of the Balanced Budget  Act of 1997. Part of VA\u2019s 1997 strategic plan was to increase health  insurance payments and other collections to help fund an increased health  care workload. The potential for increased workload occurred in part  because the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996  authorized VA to provide certain medical care services not previously  available to veterans without service-connected disabilities or low  incomes. VA expected that collections from third-party payments,  copayments, and deductibles would cover the majority of costs for higher- income veterans without service-connected disabilities. These veterans  increased from about 4 percent of all veterans treated in fiscal year 1996 to  about 20 percent in fiscal year 2001.", "To collect from health insurers, as shown in figure 1, VA uses five related  processes to manage the information needed to bill and collect. The  patient intake process involves gathering insurance information and  verifying that information with the insurer. The medical documentation  process involves properly documenting the health care provided to  patients by physicians and other health care providers. The coding process  involves assigning correct codes for the diagnoses and medical procedures  based on the documentation. Next the billing process serves to create and  send bills to insurers based on the insurance and coding information.  Finally, the accounts receivable process includes processing payments  from insurers and following up with insurers on outstanding or denied  bills.", "In 1999, VA adopted a new fee schedule, called \u201creasonable charges,\u201d  which are itemized fees based on diagnoses and procedures, and the new  schedule allows VA to bill in a way that more accurately captures the care  provided. Previously, VA had nine charges for inpatient care and one  charge for outpatient care. These charges were not specific to the care  provided. For example, VA had charged the same per diem rate for any  patient in a surgical bed section regardless of the care provided. In  addition, before adopting the new fee schedule, VA had billed all  outpatient visits, including surgery, based on VA\u2019s average outpatient cost  of $229, a single rate that had limited VA\u2019s ability to collect higher amounts  for more expensive care. In contrast, when the reasonable charges fee  schedule was adopted in September 1999, an outpatient hernia surgery  charge increased to about $6,500; and an office visit charge for an  established patient decreased to a range of about $22 to $149, depending  on the care given.", "By linking charges to the care provided, VA created new bill-processing  demands\u2014particularly in the three areas of documenting care, coding that  care, and processing bills per episode of care. First, VA must be prepared  to provide an insurer supporting medical documentation for the itemized  charges. Second, VA must accurately assign medical diagnoses and  procedure codes to set appropriate charges, a task which requires coders  to search through medical documentation and various databases to  identify all billable care. Third, in contrast to a single bill for an episode of  care under the previous fee schedule, under reasonable charges VA must  prepare a separate bill for each provider involved in the care and an  additional bill if a hospital facility charge applies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collections Are Increasing, but Operational Problems Limit Insurance Payments", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2002, VA collected third-party payments of $687 million, a  32 percent increase over its fiscal year 2001 collections. The increased  collections in fiscal year 2002 resulted from VA\u2019s submitting and collecting  for more bills than previously. According to three network revenue  managers we interviewed, billings increased mainly because of a reduction  of billing backlogs and improvements in the processes necessary to collect  under the new reasonable charges fee schedule. Nevertheless, VA\u2019s ability  to collect was limited by problems such as missed billing opportunities.  VA does not know how many dollars remain uncollected because of such  limitations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Third-Party Collections Increased", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2002, VA collected $687 million, up 32 percent compared to  the $521 million collected during fiscal year 2001. The increased  collections reflected VA\u2019s processing a higher volume of bills than it did in  the prior fiscal year. VA processed and received payments for over 50  percent more bills in fiscal year 2002 than in fiscal year 2001. VA\u2019s  collections grew at a lower percentage rate than the number of paid bills  because the average payment per paid bill dropped 18 percent compared  to the prior fiscal year. Average payments dropped primarily because a  rising proportion of VA\u2019s paid bills were for outpatient care rather than  inpatient care. Since the charges for outpatient care were much lower on  average, the payment amounts were typically lower as well.", "VA had difficulties establishing the collections processes to bill under a  new fee schedule, processes which were necessary to achieve the  increased billing and collections in fiscal year 2002. Although VA  anticipated that the shift to reasonable charges would yield higher  collections, collections dropped in fiscal year 2000 after implementing the  new fee schedule in September 1999. VA attributed that drop to its being  unprepared to bill under reasonable charges, particularly because of its  lack of proficiency in developing medical documentation and coding to  appropriately support a bill. As a result, VA reported that many VA medical  centers developed billing backlogs after initially suspending billing for  some care.", "As shown in figure 2, VA\u2019s third-party collections increased in fiscal year  2001\u2014reversing fiscal year 2000\u2019s drop in collections\u2014and increased  again in fiscal year 2002. After initially being unprepared in fiscal year 2000  to bill reasonable charges, VA began improving its implementation of the  processes necessary to bill and increase its collections. According to VA,  by the summer of 2000, facilities had sufficiently implemented processes  to move forward with billing under reasonable charges. By the end of  fiscal year 2001, VA had submitted 37 percent more bills to insurers than in  fiscal year 2000. VA submitted even more in fiscal year 2002, over 8 million  bills that constituted a 54 percent increase over the number in fiscal year  2001.", "VA officials cited various sources for an increased number of bills in fiscal  year 2002. Managers we spoke with in three networks\u2014Network 2  (Albany), Network 9 (Nashville), and Network 22 (Long Beach)\u2014mainly  attributed the increased billing to reductions in billing backlogs. They also  cited an increased number of patients with billable insurance as a factor  for the increased billing. In addition, a May 2001 change in the reasonable- charges fee schedule for medical evaluations allowed billing for a facility  charge in addition to billing for the professional service charges, a change  that contributed to the higher volume of bills in fiscal year 2002.", "Increased collections for fiscal year 2002 reflected VA\u2019s improved ability to  manage the volume and billing processes required to produce multiple  bills under reasonable charges, according to three network revenue  managers. Networks 2 (Albany) and 9 (Nashville) reduced backlogs, in  part by hiring more staff, contracting for staff, or using overtime to  process bills and accounts receivable. Network 2 (Albany), for instance,  managed an increased billing volume through mandatory overtime for  billers. Managers we interviewed in all three networks noted better  medical documentation provided by physicians to support billing. In  Network 22 (Long Beach) and Network 9 (Nashville), revenue managers  reported coders were getting better at identifying all professional services  that can be billed under reasonable charges. In addition, the revenue  manager in Network 2 (Albany) said that billers\u2019 productivity had risen  from 700 to 2,500 bills per month over a 3-year period, as a result of  gradually increasing productivity standards and a streamlining of their  jobs to focus solely on billing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Operational Problems Limit Collections, but VA Lacks an Estimate of Uncollected Dollars", "paragraphs": ["Studies have suggested that operational problems\u2014missed billing  opportunities, billing backlogs, and inadequate pursuit of accounts  receivable\u2014limited VA\u2019s collections in the years following the  implementation of reasonable charges. After examining activities in fiscal  years 2000 and 2001, a VA Inspector General report estimated that VA  could have collected over $500 million more than it did. About 73 percent  of this uncollected amount was attributed to a backlog of unbilled medical  care; most of the rest was attributed to insufficient pursuit of delinquent  bills. Another study, examining only professional-service charges in a  single network, estimated that $4.1 million out of $4.7 million of potential  collections was unbilled for fiscal year 2001. Of that unbilled amount, 63  percent was estimated to be unbillable primarily because of insufficient  documentation. In addition, the study found coders often missed services  that should have been coded for billing.", "According to the Director of the Revenue Office, VA could increase  collections by working on operational problems. These problems included  unpaid accounts receivable and missed billing opportunities due to  insufficient identification of insured patients, inadequate documentation  to support billing, and coding problems that result in unidentified care.  During April through June 2002, three network revenue managers told us  about backlogs and processing issues that persisted into fiscal year 2002.  For example, although Network 9 (Nashville) had above average increases  in collections for both inpatient and outpatient care, it still had coding  backlogs in four of six medical centers. According to Network 9\u2019s  (Nashville) revenue manager, eliminating the backlogs for outpatient care  would increase collections by an estimated $4 million for fiscal year 2002,  or 9 percent. Additional increases might come from coding all inpatient  professional services, but the revenue manager did not have an estimate  because the extent to which coders are capturing all billable services was  unknown. Moreover, although all three networks reported that physicians\u2019  documentation was improving for billing, they reported a continuing need  to improve physicians\u2019 documentation. In addition, Network 22 (Long  Beach) reported that accounts receivable staff had difficulties keeping up  with the increased volume of bills because it had not hired additional staff  or contracted help for accounts receivable.", "As a result of these operational limitations, VA lacks a reliable estimate of  uncollected dollars, and therefore does not have the basis to assess its  systemwide operational effectiveness. Some uncollected dollars resulting  from currently missed billing opportunities\u2014such as billable care missed  in coding\u2014are not readily quantified. Other uncollected dollars\u2014such as  those from backlogged bills and uncollected accounts receivable\u2014are  either only partially quantifiable or their potential contribution to total  collections is uncertain. For example, even though the uncollected dollars  in older accounts receivable can be totaled, the yield in payments through  more aggressive pursuit of accounts receivable is uncertain. This is  because, according to VA officials, some portion of the billed dollars is not  collectable due to VA inappropriately billing for services not covered by  the insurance policy, billing against a terminated policy, or not closing out  the accounts receivable after an insurer paid the bill."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Is Implementing Planned Actions and Developing Other Initiatives to Address Problems in Collections Operations", "paragraphs": ["VA continues to implement its 2001 improvement plan and is planning  more improvements.

These problems include unidentified insurance for some patients,  insufficient documentation for billing, shortages of coding staff, gaps in  the automated capture of billing data, insufficient pursuit of accounts  receivable, and uneven performance across collections sites.", "The plan seeks increased collections through standardization of policy and  processes in the context of decentralized management, in which VA\u2019s 21  network directors and their respective medical center directors have  responsibility for the collections process. Since management is  decentralized, collections procedures can vary across sites. For example,  sites\u2019 procedures can specify a different number of days waited until first  contacting insurers about unpaid bills and can vary on whether to contact  by letter, telephone, or both. The plan intends to create greater process  standardization, in part, by requiring certain collections processes, such as  the use of electronic medical records to provide coders better access to  documentation and legible records.", "When fully implemented, the plan\u2019s actions can improve collections to the  extent that they can reduce operational problems such as missed billing  opportunities. For example, two of the plan\u2019s actions\u2014requiring patient  contacts prior to scheduled appointments to gather insurance information  and electronically linking VA to major insurers to identify patients\u2019  insurance\u2014are intended to increase the number of patients identified with  insurance. A recent study estimated that 23.8 percent of VA patients in  fiscal year 2001 had billable care, but VA actually billed for the care of only  18.3 percent of patients. This finding suggests that VA could have billed  for 30 percent more patients than it actually billed.", "VA has implemented some of the improvement plan\u2019s 24 actions, which  were scheduled for completion at various times through 2003, but is  behind the plan\u2019s original schedule.

For example, although VA designated electronic billing as  completed in the May 2002 report, in August 2002 a VA official indicated  that 20 hospitals were still working on a step required to transmit bills to  all payers. In other cases, VA has designated an action completed by  mandating it in a memorandum or directive. However, mandating an  action in the past has not necessarily ensured its full implementation. For  example, although an earlier 1998 directive required patient  preregistration, the 2001 improvement plan reported that preregistration  was not implemented consistently across VA and thus mandated its use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Developing Other Improvement Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Officials in VHA\u2019s new Chief Business Office told us that this office is  developing a new approach for improving third-party collections.  According to the Chief Business Officer, the Under Secretary of Health  proposed, and the Secretary approved, the establishment of the Chief  Business Office to underscore the importance of revenue, patient  eligibility, and enrollment functions; and to give strategic focus to  improving these functions. He said the new approach can help increase  revenue collections by further revising processes and providing a new  business focus on collections.", "Officials in this office told us that the new approach will combine these  and other actions with the actions in the improvement plan. For example,  the Chief Business Office\u2019s improvement strategy incorporates electronic  transmission of bills and of third-party payments, which are part of the  2001 improvement plan. The new approach also encompasses initiatives  beyond the improvement plan, such as the one in the Under Secretary of  Health\u2019s May 2002 memorandum that directed all facilities to refer  accounts receivable older than 60 days to a collection agency, unless a  facility can document a better in-house process. According to the Deputy  Chief Business Officer, this initiative has shown some sign of success\u2014 with outstanding accounts receivables dropping from $1,378 million to  $1,317 million from the end of May to the end of July 2002, a reduction of  about $61 million or 4 percent.", "Another initiative in the new approach is the Patient Financial Services  System (PFSS). PFSS is an automated financial system focused on patient  accounts, which is intended to overcome operational problems in VA\u2019s  current automated billing system. For example, VA\u2019s automated system for  clinical information was not designed to provide all of the episode-of-care  information, such as the health care provider and diagnoses, that are  required for billing. The development of PFSS is tied to a demonstration  project of a financial system, which is now being designed for Network 10  (Cincinnati). According to the Deputy Chief Business Officer, VA  anticipates awarding a PFSS contract by April 1, 2003. The Chief Business  Office\u2019s plan is to install this financial system in other facilities and  networks if it is successfully implemented in the Network 10 (Cincinnati)  demonstration.", "The Chief Business Office also intends to improve collections by  developing better performance measures, which will be similar to those  used in the private sector. For example, the office intends to use the  measure of gross days revenue outstanding, which indicates the pace of  collections relative to the amount of accounts receivable. During fiscal  year 2003, the office plans to hold network and facility directors  accountable for collections through standards that are tied to these  performance measures. In addition, the Chief Business Officer said that  tracking performance with these measures could help identify further  opportunities for collections improvements.", "The Chief Business Office is developing the new initiatives, which it had  not formalized into a planning document as of August 2002. Certain key  decisions were under consideration. For example, the Chief Business  Officer was considering whether to centralize some processes at the  network or national level and was developing the performance standards  that would be required for holding network and facility directors  accountable.
