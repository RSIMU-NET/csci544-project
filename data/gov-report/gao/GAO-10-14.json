To address these objectives GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) retirement-related data, and other program-related documents, and interviewed officials from OPM, ALJ professional associations, and the two largest federal agencies employing ALJs--the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SSA and HHS officials responsible for hiring new ALJs reported they were satisfied with the quality of the judges hired from OPM's ALJ register of qualified candidates in 2008. Despite their satisfaction with these ALJ candidates, agency officials raised several issues regarding ALJ hiring and offered suggestions to improve the process, including (1) opening the OPM registry to accept new candidates more frequently, (2) giving greater consideration to agency-specific knowledge and experience, and (3) providing additional agency flexibility in meeting the procedural requirements associated with selecting from the three best qualified candidates and awarding veterans' preference. OPM officials reported they are working to address these issues and develop new approaches, where appropriate. ALJ agencies could experience skill and competency gaps in the ALJ workforce in the near future. As of September 2008, the most currently available data, 51 percent of all ALJs were already eligible to retire. Moreover, by 2013, 78 percent of all ALJs employed as of September 2008 will be eligible to retire, while at 9 of the 25 ALJ agencies, all of the ALJs were eligible to retire. Retiring employees can leave gaps in institutional knowledge and technical skills due, in part, to the time required for new hires to become fully productive. To ensure agencies have talented staff to accomplish their missions, OPM requires agencies to make meaningful progress toward closing skills, knowledge, and competency gaps/deficiencies in all occupations in the agency. Despite the significant proportion of ALJs who were eligible to retire from 2008 to 2013, OPM officials reported that, as of October 2009, they had no record of any federal agency designation of ALJ skill gaps or competency issues. OPM, as ALJ program manager and lead agency in federal human capital management, could use its annual review of federal agencies' human capital accountability plans to assure that ALJ agencies appropriately identify and plan for future ALJ related skill and competency gaps. To safeguard the independence of ALJ decisionmaking, ALJ agencies are prohibited from rating or tying an ALJ's compensation to their performance. Nevertheless, SSA and HHS officials reported using numerous other practices to manage ALJ performance. ALJ association officials were concerned some SSA performance management practices could affect ALJs' decisional independence. The use of competencies in ALJ performance management might help OPM and ALJ agencies define needed ALJ skills and behaviors, ensure objective and balanced performance discussions between managers and ALJs, and enhance consistency in ALJ performance, while not influencing ALJ compensation. Given its role as ALJ program manager and its expertise in performance management, OPM is well-positioned to lead a review of all agencies' ALJ-related management practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, federal administrative law judges (ALJ) adjudicate hundreds of  thousands of disputes between federal agencies and private parties  relating to such issues as entitlement to benefits, professional licensing,  regulations, and contracts. Collectively, their decisions can simultaneously  affect a substantial number of Americans and make significant  commitments on behalf of the federal government. For example, each  year, ALJs at the Social Security Administration (SSA) decide cases that,  collectively, commit the federal government to pay out millions of dollars  in disability benefits to thousands of Americans. In 2008, 25 federal  agencies employed approximately 1,400 ALJs, with SSA employing over  three-quarters of all federal ALJs.", "For decades, policymakers have debated ALJ hiring and employment  issues, in the context of protecting the decisional independence of ALJs  and promoting the ability of agencies to effectively and efficiently resolve  their cases. Because recent events and trends could affect, in part, the  capacity of the ALJ workforce to effectively adjudicate current and future  cases in a timely fashion, the importance of addressing these issues has  become more pressing.", "For example, at the same time that a growing proportion of ALJs was  becoming eligible for immediate retirement, the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) was involved in protracted litigation over the manner  in which veterans\u2019 preference was applied to the rating of applicants for  ALJ positions. As a result, OPM was under a series of administrative  orders to suspend the use of its list of qualified candidates, referred to as  the ALJ register, in hiring new ALJs and to suspend accepting new  applications from 1999 to 2003 (except for short periods in 2001). In 2003,  after prevailing in the lawsuit that triggered the administrative order, OPM  updated and reopened the ALJ register for use by the agencies but  generally did not permit new applicants to take the examination. From  2003 through 2006, OPM generally did not accept new applications to the  register but retained the ALJ register so that the ALJ agencies could hire  new ALJs from among the eligible candidates. In October 2007, OPM  established a new ALJ register based on a new examination and the  previous ALJ register was terminated. Agencies began hiring from the new  register in fiscal year 2008. Meanwhile, the growth in the number of  disability cases awaiting disposition at SSA prompted a number of SSA  management initiatives aimed at reducing the backlog of these cases as a  means of increasing ALJ productivity.", "Based on a mandate accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act  of 2008, this report examines (1) the process for hiring ALJs and selected  agencies\u2019 observations on the process; (2) ALJ retirements and retirement  eligibility; (3) the reported ALJ management practices at SSA and HHS,  and the stakeholders\u2019 views of these practices; and (4) the options that  have been proposed to improve the management of the ALJ workforce,  either within existing authorities or requiring new authorities.", "To address these four objectives, we reviewed related statutes,  regulations, testimonies, announcements, correspondence, manuals, and  other program documentation gathered from OPM, and the two federal  agencies employing about 88 percent of ALJs\u2014SSA and the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS). We also obtained testimonies,  announcements, correspondence, contracts, guidelines, and other related  documentation from the Association of ALJs (AALJ), a union representing  ALJs at SSA and HHS; the Federal ALJ Conference (FALJC), a professional  association of federal ALJs and ALJ managers; and the American Bar  Association\u2019s (ABA) National Conference of the Administrative Law  Judiciary, a professional association of federal ALJs who are also  members of the ABA. In addition, we interviewed officials from these  agencies and associations. At SSA we interviewed ALJ managers from the  Office of Disability Adjudication and Review, who conduct impartial  hearings and make decisions on appealed determinations involving  retirement, survivors, disability, and supplemental security income  benefits. At HHS, we interviewed ALJ managers from the Office of  Medicare Hearings and Appeals, who conduct appeal hearings for the  Medicare program and who make a new and impartial decision in  accordance with the applicable law, and managers from the Departmental  Appeals Board, who provide impartial, independent review of disputed  decisions in a wide range of HHS programs under more than 60 statutory  provisions. Due to ongoing litigation, we did not collect detailed  information regarding OPM\u2019s use of its ALJ register in 2007 and 2008. In  addition to the research methods described above, we undertook other  data collection and analyses to address specific objectives. To review ALJ  retirement and retirement eligibility, we analyzed employment data from  OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File (CPDF), which is OPM\u2019s human  resources reporting system. To identify the proposed options to improve  ALJ performance management, we reviewed numerous related legislative  proposals and proposals from OPM, SSA, the three associations, and the  Social Security Advisory Board. We selected three proposals because,  collectively, they contained the major design features of other more  narrowly focused options and compared these three proposals with the  current ALJ program features. See appendix I for more information on our  scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2008 through  January 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The first duty is to preside over the taking of evidence at agency  hearings and act as the finder of facts in the proceedings. An ALJ\u2019s other  main duty is to act as a decision maker by making or recommending an  initial determination about the resolution of the dispute. In these regards,  ALJs, who are executive branch employees, function much like trial judges  in the judicial branch. In general, ALJs hear cases that fall into four  different categories: (1) enforcement cases; (2) entitlement cases; (3)  regulatory cases; and (4) contract cases. Depending on the rules relevant  to the particular issue in dispute, the hearings can be either adversarial,  where the parties or their representatives debate evidence and law before  the ALJ, or non-adversarial, where the ALJ investigates the facts and  develops the arguments both for and against each party.", "In fiscal year 2008, the federal government employed 1,436 civilian ALJs at  25 agencies. The ALJ agencies are extremely diverse, ranging from  components of cabinet-level agencies, such as the U.S. Coast Guard at the  Department of Homeland Security, to independent agencies such as SSA,  the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and Exchange  Commission. SSA employed the largest number of federal ALJs with 1,192  ALJs (83 percent of the federal ALJ workforce), distantly followed by HHS,  which employed 72 ALJs, about 5 percent of the ALJ workforce.

In order to ensure ALJs carry out their duties impartially, the  Administrative Procedure Act (APA) stipulates that ALJs are to be  independent of their employing agencies in matters of appointment, tenure  and compensation. To achieve this objective, the APA assigns  responsibilities for the ALJs to three agencies: OPM, the ALJ agency, and  the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).", "The ALJ agencies are responsible for managing the ALJs they hire. MSPB  has a role in disciplining ALJs. Under its authority to issue regulations  implementing the APA, the OPM regulations divide the responsibilities for  hiring, pay and performance management among OPM, the ALJ agency  and the MSPB. Table 1 lists how the major hiring, pay and individual  performance management responsibilities are divided between OPM and  the ALJ agency.", "OPM has a number of responsibilities for ALJs under the statutory  framework of the APA. OPM is responsible for administering the exam and  creating a register of qualified candidates for ALJ positions. OPM also has  the authority to prescribe regulations regarding (1) various sections of the  APA governing ALJs; (2) implementing the section governing the  appointment of ALJs; (3) implementing the requirements that ALJs be  assigned cases in rotation as so far as is practicable and not perform  duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as ALJs; (4)  implementing the detail provisions of the APA, which allow details of ALJs  to agencies with occasional or temporary needs for ALJs as selected by  OPM; (5) regulations excluding ALJs from the definition of employee for  the purposes of performance appraisals; and (6) implementing the three  levels of basic pay for ALJs and allowing OPM to provide for appointment  of an ALJ in the lowest level at an advanced rate where OPM deems it  appropriate.", "In the hiring of ALJs, OPM is responsible for examining applicants and  certifying qualified candidates, while the ALJ agency is responsible for  identifying the number of new ALJs they require and appointing individual  ALJs from OPM\u2019s list of certified candidates. As required by the APA, OPM  sets the three levels of pay for ALJs, determines the qualifications required  for appointment to each level, assigns each of the agency\u2019s ALJ positions  to one of the pay levels, and determines the time-in-service required to  advance to a higher pay level. OPM must provide prior approval before an  ALJ agency can appoint retired annuitants, pay an ALJ applicant a higher  rate of pay due to superior qualifications, promote ALJs to higher pay  levels, or execute noncompetitive placements (e.g. transfers), intra-agency  details or temporary assignments. Once the ALJ is employed, OPM and the  ALJ agency share responsibility for managing the ALJ\u2019s performance. For  example, OPM defines those management practices that ALJ agencies may  not perform, such as issuing performance ratings and awards and the ALJ  agency is responsible for day-to-day management. According to its  implementing regulation, OPM shares the responsibility with the ALJ  agency for ensuring the ALJ\u2019s decisional independence. The APA divides  the responsibility for disciplining of ALJs between the ALJ agency and the  MSPB. The APA permits the agencies to take serious disciplinary action  against an ALJ only for good cause as established and determined by the  MSPB on the record, after an opportunity for hearing before the board.", "Policymakers, ALJ agencies, and other stakeholders have been discussing  aspects of ALJ management for decades. Over the years, several options  have been proposed to change the roles and responsibilities for the  administration of the ALJ program. Three of these options are described in  more detail later in this report. Over this same timeframe, to help support  deliberations on ALJ issues, we have issued more than 10 reports where  the focus was either on ALJs at specific agencies or on the federal ALJ  program (see list of related GAO products at the end of this report).

For  example, agencies must comply with the veterans\u2019 preference requirement  and the \u201crule of three\u201d\u2014agencies must select from the highest scoring  three candidates available to serve in a given location. SSA and HHS  officials told us that it took 8 to15 weeks from the date the agency  requested an OPM certificate of candidates until a selected candidate  reported to work.", "Despite their satisfaction with the quality of the ALJ candidates, SSA and  HHS officials stated that the ALJ hiring process should have more  flexibility in order for them to appoint candidates that best meet their  agency-specific needs. According to SSA officials, OPM uses a one-size- fits-all approach in establishing its register of candidates. SSA officials\u2019  reported position was that OPM\u2019s ALJ examination of applicants should  also weigh the specialized knowledge and skills needed to adjudicate SSA  cases such as the ability to manage a large docket because SSA ALJs  adjudicate a high volume of cases, and the temperament to work on non- adversarial cases with unrepresented claimants. SSA was also concerned  about the process for assessing whether an ALJ candidate on an OPM list  of certified candidates was actually suitable for selection and  appointment. SSA officials told us that they currently try to assess the  specialized abilities and the potential suitability of ALJ candidates through  SSA\u2019s ALJ interviewing process and investigating the candidates\u2019  backgrounds. SSA officials told us that, in their opinion, the process was  laborious, and requested that OPM assess the suitability of candidates  listed on the certificates provided to agencies. Lastly, SSA raised concerns  about the adequacy of the register to meet their hiring needs. Given SSA\u2019s  plans to hire more than 226 ALJs during fiscal year 2010, SSA officials  reported to us their concern that the register would not provide an  adequate number of suitable candidates to consider for selection. SSA  requested that OPM refresh the register with new candidates as soon as  possible and plan to do so, on a regular basis.", "The Chief ALJ of HHS\u2019s Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (OMHA)  also noted that OPM\u2019s examination process does not provide HHS with  candidates who have specialized knowledge important for adjudicating  cases in HHS. He thought, for example, that having 3 years of Medicare  experience would be an asset for an incoming OMHA ALJ. He suggested  that there should be a more flexible process to enable the agency to select  candidates who might be a better fit for the agency\u2019s work. The Chair of  HHS\u2019s Departmental Appeals Board did not have specific comments  regarding the current hiring process. This board had not had an ALJ  vacancy to fill from 2003 through 2008, and thus, had not hired an ALJ  from the OPM register in 2007 or 2008.", "The OPM official responsible for the competitive examination process  reported that OPM experts concluded that having certain specialization or  expertise would not produce a better cadre of ALJs. In OPM\u2019s view, the  most important characteristic that ALJs need is the ability to master lots of  facts rather than specialized knowledge. Consideration of any additional  flexibility in ALJ hiring must await the conclusion of pending litigation.", "With regard to SSA\u2019s interest in assessing the suitability of all ALJ  candidates on the register, OPM reported in July 2009 that it was reviewing  the documentation SSA provided regarding specific candidates. OPM  noted that the suitability review process encompassed both a background  investigation and an adjudication, either at the hiring agency or at OPM,  depending upon the nature of any issues identified during the  investigation. Agencies are required to reimburse OPM for each  background investigation it conducts. Although ALJ agencies could  request OPM undertake a suitability investigation at any point in the  process, selecting officials usually commence the suitability assessment  process only when the agency is ready to make a selection because of the  expense associated with conducting a proper suitability investigation.  OPM indicated that there was no appropriate mechanism whereby OPM  could undertake suitability assessments in advance on all the candidates  on the ALJ register, and has not received an appropriation to conduct  investigations at its own expense.", "Regarding SSA\u2019s request for a routine refreshment of the ALJ register,  OPM indicated that it refreshes its register of ALJ candidates by offering  its ALJ examination to new applicants and completing its examination of  the applicants. As examining ALJ applicants requires significant assistance  of retired and sitting ALJs, OPM does not want to overburden these ALJs  by offering the examination too frequently. According to OPM, the ALJ  register was most recently refreshed in March 2009. The timing for  opening the examination is based on several considerations, such as future  hiring needs. OPM regularly queries agencies about their projected ALJ  hiring needs and uses the agencies\u2019 responses to plan when to re- administer the ALJ examination. As of July 2009, they anticipated they  could issue certificates that would provide an ample number of choices  from which to select candidates to meet the agencies\u2019 reported hiring  needs.

As of September 2008, at 9 of the  25 ALJ agencies, all of the ALJs were already eligible to retire and at 21 of  the agencies half or more of the ALJs were eligible to retire.

In contrast, as of 2005, the average age of the federal  workforce governmentwide was about 46 with about 15 years of service.", "Despite the widespread retirement eligibility of the ALJ workforce, most  ALJs do not retire immediately upon becoming eligible to retire. In 2007,  about 72 percent of administrative law judges were still in the federal  workforce more than 5 years after their eligibility date. Overall, the ALJ  program has experienced a low annual retirement rate, ranging from 2 to 5  percent from 2002 through 2006, which was about the same as the total  federal workforce, which we noted is younger and generally has fewer  years of service.", "ALJ retirements could significantly affect agencies\u2019 adjudication capacities  in two ways. First, retirements could significantly affect those agencies  employing a small ALJ workforce. For the 15 agencies employing fewer  than 5 ALJs, one retirement represents a loss of 25 percent or more of  their ALJ capacity, at least temporarily. Secondly, ALJ retirements could  also have a more pronounced effect at those agencies facing increasing  case workloads because the agency would be losing experienced ALJs at a  time when demand for their services is increasing. For example, in 2008,  SSA hearing offices received nearly 590,000 claims, an increase of about 6  percent from 2006. In March 2009, the SSA Commissioner projected that,  due to the economic downturn, SSA would receive approximately 50,000  more hearing requests in fiscal year 2009 than in fiscal year 2008. HHS\u2019s  Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals has also experienced an  increasing workload in recent years. In January 2009, the HHS Inspector  General reported that, from July 2006 to May 2008, the office\u2019s caseload  increased 37 percent to over 28,000 cases, while the number of cases with  the 90-day decision requirement more than tripled, from 6,079 to 20,720  cases.", "Although it appears there are abundant candidates to fill vacant positions,  we have reported that retiring employees can leave gaps in institutional  knowledge and technical skills. These gaps can arise because, among  other reasons, it can take several months for new hires to become fully  productive. For example, at SSA, it takes 1 to 2 months to train a new ALJ,  plus an additional 9 months of on-the-job experience, before SSA  considers a new ALJ to be fully productive.", "While actual ALJ retirements lag eligibility by several years, the agencies  cannot rely on either the low ALJ retirement rate or the lag between  eligibility and retirement to remain constant. According to OPM, although  demographic factors such as age and years of service can help predict time  of retirement, other factors that are not available are likely to have a much  larger impact on retirement decisions. Such factors include familial  situations, illness, caretaker status, children in college, the cost of tuition  for their children, and others. The lack of data for some of these factors  may limit the accuracy of retirement forecasts.", "OPM is the lead agency in guiding federal human capital management at  executive branch agencies. To assess federal agencies\u2019 human capital  management, OPM established the Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework (HCAAF). One of the assessment standards  relates to ensuring agencies have the talented staff that their mission  requires. To meet this standard, OPM requires agencies to make  meaningful progress toward closing skills, knowledge, and competency  gaps in all occupations used in the agency. Furthermore, the standard  requires the agencies particularly to close skills, knowledge, and  competency gaps in mission-critical occupations. For example, SSA\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2009-2011 Strategic Human Capital Plan, SSA identified ALJs  as a mission-critical occupation and developed a set of ALJ-specific  competencies to guide its ALJ recruitment, retention, and workforce  development initiatives.

According to OPM\u2019s  performance management guidance, employee performance management  in the federal sector generally includes planning work and setting  expectations, continually monitoring performance, developing the  capacity to perform, periodically rating performance in a summary  fashion, and rewarding good performance. However, in order to ensure  that an ALJ is not unduly influenced by his or her employing agency,  renders impartial decisions, and appears impartial, the APA and OPM  regulations do not permit the employing agency to rate or tie an ALJ\u2019s  compensation to the ALJ\u2019s performance.", "Nevertheless, SSA and HHS managers reported that they employed a  variety of practices other than ratings to directly and indirectly manage  ALJ performance.

Within this context, agency  managers reported using a wide variety of practices to either directly  influence ALJ performance, or to indirectly influence ALJ performance by  addressing hearing office performance. The practices focused on such  areas as hearing office management and staffing, case management,  quantity and quality of adjudications, tools to expedite adjudication,  workplace privileges, and progressive discipline.

AALJ and FALJC did not  raise concerns about specific ALJ management practices at either HHS  office.", "At SSA, however, ALJ performance management was of much greater  concern among ALJ stakeholders, especially pertaining to ALJ  productivity. In 2007, in order to help SSA reduce its disability hearing  backlog, the Chief ALJ requested the ALJs to manage their dockets in such  a way that they would be able to issue 500-700 legally sufficient decisions  each year. As of July 2009, SSA reported that the request had been an  effective tool, among several others, in helping to raise ALJ productivity.  Officials from the AALJ and FALJC questioned the use of a productivity  goal as a major tool to manage ALJ performance for several reasons,  including their view that SSA had not conducted a systematic study to  validate the appropriateness of the numerical range of cases in the goal.  According to AALJ, FALJC, and ABA officials, SSA\u2019s emphasis on  productivity is detrimental to maintaining or improving other important  dimensions of ALJ performance, such as the quality of ALJ decision  making. In addition, AALJ and the Social Security Advisory Board raised  concerns that the agency\u2019s emphasis on ALJ productivity may result in  unintended consequences. For example, the AALJ and the Social Security  Advisory Board noted an increase in the number of favorable decisions.  The Advisory Board found that as the number of decisions increases, the  percentage of favorable decisions tend to increase. The AALJ and the  Social Security Advisory Board expressed concern because rendering a  decision favorable to a party appealing an agency determination requires  less ALJ time than rendering an unfavorable decision. SSA\u2019s emphasis on  ALJ productivity may lead to more favorable decisions and result in  increasing long-term costs to the federal government. The Social Security  Advisory Board suggested SSA monitor the correlation between the  number of decisions and the number of favorable decisions. In contrast,  SSA reported in December 2009 that the rate of favorable decisions  (allowance rate) had not changed significantly from fiscal year 2001  through the first quarter of fiscal year 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competencies Provide a Fuller Picture of Performance", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that high-performing organizations both in the United  States and abroad have applied, among other strategies, a set of  competencies in their employee performance management to provide a  fuller picture of performance.

These advantages include helping managers to  structure their performance discussions, enhancing consistency in  performance, and ensuring an objective, balanced review of all the areas  significant to the performance of the individual. Lastly, we have reported  that high-performing organizations that actively involve employees and  stakeholders in developing the performance management systems and  provide ongoing training on the systems help increase their employees\u2019  understanding and ownership of the organizational goals and objectives.", "OPM and SSA have developed competencies to support other aspects of  ALJ employment. As noted earlier, OPM uses a set of competencies in its  examination of ALJ applicants, while SSA uses a set of ALJ competencies  to assist in their workforce planning. However, OPM has not established  performance competencies to guide ALJ agencies in their day-to-day  management of ALJs. As noted earlier, APA and OPM regulations prohibit  ALJ agencies from issuing performance ratings and awards to ALJs. Yet,  recently, the ALJ associations urged OPM to implement a particular set of  performance standards. Particularly, in 2006, the presidents of several ALJ- related associations, including AALJ and FALJC, urged OPM to support  codifying into law or regulation ABA\u2019s Model Code of Judicial Conduct as  a standard for satisfactory ALJ conduct and performance to which ALJs  must adhere. That same year, the ABA stated that they believed ALJs  should be subject to, and accountable under, appropriate ethical standards  adapted from its Model Code of Judicial Conduct. We did not assess the  appropriateness or relative strengths of these different sets of  competencies or standards.", "The use of competencies might also help OPM and the ALJ agencies to  ensure the ALJs\u2019 decisional independence, a responsibility unique to ALJ  management and which OPM and the ALJ agency share. Even though the  competencies may not be used to influence compensation, a set of  validated competencies would help managers and ALJs to define the skills  and supporting behaviors that ALJs need to effectively contribute to  organizational results, and thereby a shared framework for discussing  employee performance and management practices. Moreover, a set of  validated competencies would also help ensure objective and balanced  discussions between managers and ALJs regarding performance, and  enhance the consistency of ALJ performance. Furthermore, OPM has  expertise in providing performance management consulting to federal  agencies.", "Without the systematic application of standards or competencies and  other safeguards to employee performance management, contention over  managing performance, such as at SSA, can arise and persist. For example,  we have previously reported on the use of performance standards related  to the quality and quantity of ALJ decisions to evaluate ALJ performance,  first recommending their use in 1978. In 1990, we noted that the lack of a  study to support SSA\u2019s use of an ALJ performance goal (case dispositions  per month) led to long-standing conflict between SSA and its ALJs. In  setting its ALJ productivity expectation in October 2007, SSA officials  indicated that they relied on recent historical ALJ productivity data, rather  than conducting a systematic study. Officials from AALJ reported to us  that SSA did not consult with them prior to issuing their ALJ productivity  goal in October 2007.

They also interviewed officials from three regional ODAR offices,  two state Disability Determination Services (DDS) offices, one program  service center, one SSA field office, and related professional associations.  We collated from these interviews those responses germane to ALJ hiring  and performance and added them to those comments obtained directly  through this engagement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Proposed Options", "paragraphs": ["To identify the proposed options to improve ALJ performance  management, we reviewed those options that had been proposed to  Congress over the last 30 years. We drew on information collected through  interviews, and our review of related reports, legislation and proposals  from OPM, SSA, HHS, the three associations, and the Social Security  Advisory Board (SSAB). Given the scope of our data collection, it is not  clear if the concerns that prompted the proposals are shared across all ALJ  agencies or ALJs. We selected the ALJ Corps, ALJ Conference and SSAB  options because, collectively, they contained the major design features of  other more narrowly focused options. We did not assess the relative  strengths or weaknesses of these proposed options."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, William Doherty, Assistant  Director; Patricia Farrell Donahue, analyst-in-charge; Sara Daleski; Sharon  Hogan; Sabrina Streagle; Gregory Wilmoth; Melanie Papasian; and William  Trancucci made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard: Administrative Law Judge Program Contains Elements  Designed to Foster Judges\u2019 Independence and Mariner Protections  Assessed Are Being Followed.
