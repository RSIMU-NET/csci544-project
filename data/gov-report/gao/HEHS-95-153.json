An additional 50 million adults are likely to encounter some problems functioning in society and need improved literacy skills.", "The Adult Education Act (AEA) is administered by the Department of Education. The act represents the primary federal effort to alleviate problems in adult literacy and provides the basic legislative authority and largest source of federal funds for programs that benefit educationally disadvantaged adults. The act\u2019s largest program is the Adult Education State-Administered Basic Grant Program (State Grant Program). In fiscal year 1995, federal funding for this program was $252 million, while state and local sources provided $890 million, or 78 percent of the program\u2019s total budget. For the first 15 years of the State Grant Program (1966 to 1980), federal expenditures exceeded total state and local contributions; however, total state and local contributions have since surpassed federal expenditures. (See table I.2 in app. I for total annual expenditures.) Figure 1.1 compares federal expenditures with state and local expenditures since the AEA\u2019s passage in 1966.", "Although total state and local contributions currently far exceed federal expenditures, federal dollars still total more than half the funds for adult education in almost half of the states. The contribution of each state relative to the federal contribution varies widely, depending on each state\u2019s commitment to providing adult education services. For example, in fiscal year 1991, state and local contributions ranged from a low of 21 percent to a high of 96 percent; conversely, federal expenditures ranged from 4 to 79 percent. Since 1992, the AEA has restricted the federal share of each state\u2019s expenditure to no more than 75 percent. (See table I.4 in app. I for further information on expenditures by state.)", "The AEA makes grants to states and requires that they be used in accordance with federally approved state plans. In developing their plans, states must assess the needs of adults, including educationally disadvantaged adults, and the capability of programs and institutions to meet those needs. The Department of Education annually makes its grants to states on the basis of the number of individuals in each state who are at least 16 years old, not enrolled in school, and lack a high school degree or General Educational Development (GED) credential. Local adult education providers then apply to the states for funds.", "Following are the three most common types of instruction offered under the State Grant Program:", "Adult Basic Education (ABE), which is instruction designed for adults functioning below the eighth grade level;", "Adult Secondary Education (ASE), which is instruction designed for adults functioning at the secondary level that may culminate in a high school diploma or may serve as preparation for the GED examination; and", "English as a Second Language (ESL), which is instruction designed to teach English to non-English speakers.

Consequently, the AEA and employment training legislation require coordination among these programs to avoid duplication and enhance service delivery.", "The National Literacy Act of 1991 amended the AEA and authorized several new programs.

He was a machine operator with an eleventh grade education who planned to earn his GED and become a bilingual teacher. A 45-year-old unemployed mother of four with a third grade education was enrolled in an English as a Second Language (ESL) class. Having done seasonal work in the past, her goal was to obtain a GED and find work in the nursing field.", "In an urban Connecticut program, a 19-year-old mother on welfare wanted to complete high school and become a cosmetologist. Although she had a tenth grade education, she needed the basic skills taught in an Adult Basic Education (ABE) class. In the same program, a 62-year-old immigrant who had been an accountant in Russia was attending ESL classes. Her goal was to become a U.S. citizen. In a suburban program in Connecticut, a 28-year-old part-time stock clerk was enrolled in an ASE class. He had a ninth grade education and lived with his parents.

These proposals may also make the coordination among adult education, welfare, and employment training programs even more critical. Some states are already implementing their own welfare reform efforts that require certain welfare clients to obtain adult education or employment training services to receive assistance. For example, California\u2019s JOBS program requires that welfare recipients have opportunities to remedy basic skill deficiencies and earn a high school diploma or GED credential. The state is currently required to provide adult education to its JOBS clients with low assessment scores and to continue to provide education until clients attain a specified level of proficiency.", "Connecticut has piloted a welfare reform program that targets certain welfare recipients. Individuals in the pilot can receive needed remedial services, such as adult education or vocational training, for 2 years before being required to find jobs. According to a state official, the pilot was limited to two communities because of concerns about the state\u2019s ability to provide remedial services to all needy individuals, particularly adult education services. If a client has only 2 years to seek remedial services and faces a waiting list for adult education services, both the client and the entire program are at risk, explained the official.", "Similarly, Iowa\u2019s JOBS program has a goal of moving people off welfare within 2 years by providing remedial education and employment training. This welfare reform effort has increased the percentage of welfare recipients required to participate in the JOBS program from 24 to 88 percent. This increase is achieved, in part, by exempting fewer welfare recipients from participating in the JOBS program.

These grants have the advantage of allowing service providers to deal with a single planning process and a single request for proposal.

Services from these many programs are often administered by staff who are both located at the college and operate within the same department. This arrangement facilitates coordinated program planning, service delivery, and referral of clients to multiple programs. At one college, administrators from the adult education, JTPA, and VOC ED programs told us that their close proximity enabled them to review a client\u2019s total needs and provide the maximum allowable services.

Adult education programs that serve the state\u2019s JOBS clients receive adult education and JOBS funds and may also draw funds from an 8-percent set-aside of JTPA funds for education programs that are matched by the state. In some counties, the state\u2019s JOBS program pays for adult education programs to meet JOBS\u2019 data collection and reporting requirements, which include administering the same competency-based assessment to all state JOBS clients.

Others might focus on whether adults can read street signs or the newspaper.

These assessments tend to focus on either academic skills or functional literacy. Academic tests, such as the Tests of Adult Basic Education (known as \u201cTABE\u201d), focus on measuring such basic skills as reading comprehension, vocabulary, language expression, and mathematical proficiency. Functional literacy or competency-based tests, such as the Comprehensive Adult Student Assessment System (CASAS), focus on the ability to perform literacy-related tasks in situations faced by adults in everyday life at home, at work, or in the community.", "Experts have questioned the validity of both the academic and functional literacy tests used in adult education programs. For example, two recent reviews point to a lack of normative data for the age ranges of participants in most adult education programs. Functional literacy tests may lack validity because they are not derived from theoretical models of ability but from everyday literacy tasks. According to a recent review, without further analyses, the instructional implications of test performance are unclear.", "Thus, these assessments may not provide useful information about the skills and needs of adult students.", "A more serious problem affecting the validity of assessments is the lack of research examining the long-term retention of learning gains in adult education programs. According to one researcher, a comprehensive search did not uncover a single published study on the effectiveness of adult education programs in helping adults retain the skills they may have acquired during instruction. This being the case, improved test scores may not necessarily mean that adults will be better equipped for high- skilled jobs, function better as parents, or participate more fully as citizens.", "However, officials in the three states we visited felt that competency-based assessment systems could be useful in measuring progress in local adult education programs and, thus, strongly advocated these systems. California had developed CASAS and required its use in a sample of one-third of its adult education programs.

Some said they thought that the information they are required to report does not accurately reflect the accomplishments of their adult education students.", "Difficulties in obtaining accurate data can also be attributed to attendance patterns of adult students and the limited capacity and expertise of local program staff. The open-entry/open-exit feature of many programs adds to the difficulty of tracking adult students.

States were also required to develop and implement their own indicators, which might or might not correspond to the federal model, and use them to evaluate state and local programs.", "The Department of Education developed model indicators by (1) reviewing adult education indicators already being developed by various states and indicators used by other federal programs, (2) meeting with experts and adult educators, (3) commissioning background papers by experts in the field, and (4) conducting workshops for state directors who would be responsible for developing and implementing the state indicators. The resulting eight model indicators of program quality are listed in table 3.1. The indicators cover student outcomes, that is, learner progress toward attainment of basic skills and competencies and learner advancement in the program. They also focus on recruiting and retaining adult education students and other indicators of program quality\u2014planning, curriculum and instruction, staff development, and provision of support services.", "The Department did not attempt to set performance standards for adult education programs but limited its work to developing indicators and providing some sample measures for each indicator. The Department defined an indicator as a variable that reflects effective and efficient program performance. It is to be distinguished from a specific measure used to determine the quantitative level of performance for the indicator. For example, to measure learner progress, states could use standardized test score gains, teacher reports of gains in communication competencies, or alternative assessment methods (such as portfolio assessments, student reports of attainment, or improvements in specific employability or life skills). An indicator is also to be distinguished from a performance standard, which defines acceptable performance in terms of a specific numeric criterion.", "The National Literacy Act also required states to adopt indicators by July 1993 and use them to evaluate local programs. States were required to adopt, at a minimum, indicators for recruitment, retention, and student learning outcomes. However, decisions about whether to adopt the Department\u2019s model indicators, what measures to use, and whether to develop performance standards were left to the states. A review of amendments to state adult education plans submitted in July 1993 showed that for the most part states had adopted indicators similar to the Department\u2019s model, especially in the areas of student outcomes, recruitment, and retention. However, states were less consistent in how they measured indicators. The review found that states were using different standardized tests to measure learner progress and had defined learner advancement in different ways. A 1995 survey of state adult education directors showed that 16 states had implemented standards and 8 states had developed but not yet implemented standards.", "Each of the three states we visited had developed standards for student outcomes, but not all of these standards were readily quantifiable. California had developed standards for seven levels of language proficiency for ESL students (the majority of adult education students in the state) but had not yet quantified performance on specific assessment measures. Standards for other kinds of adult education students in California had not yet been completed. Connecticut had set standards for educational gains expected over a specific time period and measured their achievement using test scores and the number of course credits or competencies attained. Iowa had set standards for grade level increases on standardized tests and for the performance of GED graduates on the GED exam. Since Iowa had not yet determined a specific strategy for competency-based education, the state had not yet established standards for competency-based tests.", "Experts as well as federal and state officials with whom we spoke disagreed about whether developing indicators would improve accountability and program quality. Some were concerned that the indicators do not move the field forward because they do not specify the types of results the federal government expects from state and local programs. One federal official doubted whether the indicators alone would help state and local programs collect higher quality data. However, other experts told us that they thought the indicators were a good first step. Still others said that the federal government should not be setting standards for states because states\u2019 literacy problems and clientele differ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Too Soon to Assess Efforts to Enhance Accountability and Program Quality", "paragraphs": ["It is too soon to tell whether state-developed indicators, measures, and performance standards will result in the collection of more useful data or help states evaluate local programs since the 1993-94 program year was the first year in which indicators were to be used for evaluation. One state we visited planned to use information collected during the 1993-94 program year as baseline data and begin to hold local programs accountable for performance on the state\u2019s indicators in subsequent years.", "Other federal efforts have been initiated to help states develop better accountability systems. Two of these efforts are designed to help build the capacity and expertise of state adult education staff to evaluate local programs. In 1993, the Department hired a contractor for a 3-year technical assistance effort designed to assist state education agencies with assessment, evaluation, and the development of performance standards and measures. And, in 1993, the National Institute for Literacy awarded grants to five states to develop performance measurement systems for literacy, with a specific focus on integrating systems used by different agencies that provide literacy services.", "Department officials also told us that they were acting to improve the quality of data collected on adult education programs. In concert with state adult education directors, the Department has been examining whether to modify the existing federal reporting requirements. They have held several meetings but have not yet issued any recommendations. In addition, the Department has developed and tested an automated management information system that would allow programs to collect data on individual students and a computer program that would help states more easily convert data they collected to the statistical reports required by the Department. A field test of the management information system in selected local programs in five states revealed that local staff appreciated the system\u2019s report-writing capabilities but remained highly resistant to performing data collection and entry.", "In addition to these efforts, the requirement that states set aside a portion of their federal funds for demonstration projects and training may also help states move toward better accountability systems. Although the Department has not completed an ongoing national evaluation of the use of these funds, state officials asserted that the set-aside was critical to their efforts to improve program quality. All three states had used these federal funds, in part, to develop competency-based instruction and assessment systems; they had also used the funds to address state-specific issues. California had developed a training institute for ESL teachers, Connecticut had used some of the funds to help implement a new statewide management information system, and Iowa had held a state literacy conference to examine how to better measure adult student progress through qualitative assessments."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Agency Comments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The broad goals and flexibility of the AEA and its State Grant Program have resulted in a federal program that is serving many different populations, yet has difficulty determining its target populations, objectives, or a means to measure program results.

This poses a challenge for developing accountability measures.", "The program has had difficulty ensuring accountability for results\u2014that is, being able to clearly or accurately say what program funds have accomplished. Although the Department of Education relies on federal reporting requirements and program quality indicators to provide this information, the data the Department receives are of questionable value.
