GAO was asked to examine DHS's ammunition purchases and management of ammunition and firearms. This report addresses trends in DHS's ammunition purchases since fiscal year 2008, how DHS's purchases compare with DOJ's, and what factors affect DHS's purchase decisions. GAO analyzed data from six DHS and three DOJ components that have law enforcement missions, require agents and officers to carry firearms, and purchase ammunition themselves or through their respective departments. Specifically, GAO analyzed data on ammunition purchases, usage, costs, and inventories, among other things, for fiscal years 2008 through 2013 for DHS, and for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 for DOJ. GAO assessed the reliability of these data and found them sufficiently reliable. Data on DOJ ammunition purchases prior to fiscal year 2011 were not readily available; therefore, GAO excluded them, as discussed in the report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) annual ammunition purchases have declined since fiscal year 2009 and are comparable in number to the Department of Justice's (DOJ) ammunition purchases. In fiscal year 2013, DHS purchased 84 million rounds of ammunition, which is less than DHS's ammunition purchases over the past 5 fiscal years, as shown in the figure below. DHS component officials said the decline in ammunition purchases in fiscal year 2013 was primarily a result of budget constraints, which meant reducing the number of training classes, and drawing on their ammunition inventories. From fiscal years 2008 through 2013, DHS purchased an average of 109 million rounds of ammunition for training, qualification, and operational needs, according to DHS data. DHS's ammunition purchases over the 6-year period equates to an average of 1,200 rounds purchased per firearm-carrying agent or officer per year. Over the past 3 fiscal years (2011-2013), DHS purchased an average of 1,000 rounds per firearm-carrying agent or officer and selected DOJ components purchased 1,300 rounds per firearm-carrying agent or officer.", "DHS ammunition purchases are driven primarily by firearm training and qualification requirements. Most DHS firearm-carrying personnel are required to qualify four times per year, though requirements vary by component, as do the number of rounds of ammunition typically used for training and qualification. DHS components also reported considering other factors when making ammunition purchase decisions, such as changes in firearms, usage rates, and ammunition inventories. DHS components maintain inventories of ammunition to help ensure they have sufficient ammunition for the training and operational needs of their officers, as there can be months-long delays between placing an order for ammunition and receiving it. As of October 2013, DHS estimates it had approximately 159 million rounds in inventory, enough to last about 22 months to meet the training and operational needs of its firearm-carrying personnel. Ammunition inventory data provided by DOJ components indicated that inventory ranged from about 13 months' worth to about 20 months' worth."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and five of its  components\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), National  Protection and Programs Directorate/Federal Protective Service (FPS),  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation  Security Administration (TSA), and the U.S. Secret Service (USSS)\u2014 have homeland security and law enforcement responsibilities and  missions that require law enforcement agents and officers to carry and be  proficient in the use of firearms and ammunition. DHS employs more  firearm-carrying law enforcement personnel than any other department\u2014 more than 70,000, according to DHS data, and DHS components  purchase ammunition for these personnel. Firearm-carrying personnel at  DHS include Border Patrol agents, federal air marshals, and Secret  Service agents, among others. In addition, another DHS component\u2014the  four interagency training sites that constitute the Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC)\u2014also purchases ammunition.  FLETC trains an average of over 66,000 federal, state, local, tribal, and  international law enforcement personnel every year, according to DHS  officials. Ammunition purchased by FLETC is utilized by all students who  train on firearms at its facilities. For comparison, the Department of  Justice (DOJ) and its components\u2014including the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI); U.S. Marshals Service; Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA);  and the Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2014have the second largest number of  federal personnel authorized to carry firearms, with approximately 69,000  agents and officers authorized to carry firearms as of October 2013,  according to DOJ data.", "At both DHS and DOJ, federal law enforcement agents and officers are  authorized to carry firearms, and are required to train in their use and  pass certain firearms qualification standards. Firearms proficiency is a  key component of an officer\u2019s ability to successfully fulfill the component\u2019s  mission and protect life and public safety. To help ensure the firearms  proficiency of their firearm-carrying workforce, these agencies purchase a  variety of types of ammunition for training, qualifications, and operational  purposes.", "Because DHS\u2019s law enforcement missions require the department,  through its components, to purchase ammunition and manage various  types of firearms, effective management and oversight of ammunition and  firearms is an important aspect of DHS\u2019s overall mission. It is incumbent  upon agencies to ensure the effective and efficient management of  ammunition and firearms as stewards of taxpayer resources. You asked  us to examine DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases and its management of both  ammunition and firearms. This report addresses the following questions:  1.  What are the trends in DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases since fiscal year  2008, what factors affect its purchase decisions, and how do DHS\u2019s  purchases compare with DOJ\u2019s?  2.  What policies and guidance does DHS have for managing firearms  and ammunition inventories?", "To address our first question, we obtained available data from DHS and  DOJ law enforcement components with firearm-carrying personnel  regarding their ammunition purchases, costs, usage, inventory, and the  size of the authorized firearm-carrying workforce. We also obtained data  on DHS planned ammunition purchases for fiscal year 2014. Specifically,  we selected all DHS law enforcement components with firearm-carrying  personnel\u2014CBP, ICE, TSA, USSS, FPS, as well as FLETC. We  excluded the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014a DHS component with firearm-carrying  personnel\u2014because the U.S. Coast Guard does not procure ammunition  through DHS; rather, the U.S. Coast Guard procures its ammunition  through Department of Defense contracts. Similarly, we selected all DOJ  law enforcement components with firearm-carrying personnel. However,  the Federal Bureau of Prisons could not provide ammunition purchase  data comparable to that of the other components based on its method of  record keeping and data retention policy. We determined that data from  the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) were not sufficiently reliable  for our purposes, because DEA could only provide estimates of  purchases. Therefore, the DOJ components included in our review are  ATF, FBI, and U.S. Marshals Service. We included these DOJ law  enforcement agencies in our review to provide context to help understand  DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases relative to those of other federal law  enforcement agencies.", "We selected fiscal year 2008 as the starting point for our analysis  because data on DHS ammunition purchases, cost, and usage were not  readily available or reliable prior to 2008, according to DHS officials.  Nevertheless, obtaining data going back 5 fiscal years provides historical  perspective on DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases and use over time, and  allows for comparisons with purchases in fiscal year 2013 and planned  purchases for fiscal year 2014. We analyzed the data to identify any  changes in the amount of ammunition purchased or used year to year  and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials to understand the  reasons why changes occurred. For each fiscal year, we calculated the  amount of ammunition purchased per agent and officer authorized to  carry firearms at each DHS and DOJ component in our review, using  component-provided data on the amount of ammunition purchased and  the number of firearm-carrying personnel. We calculated the average  number of rounds purchased per agent or officer per year for fiscal years  2008 through 2013 at DHS, excluding FLETC, by determining the  average amount of ammunition purchased across DHS law enforcement  components in each fiscal year and dividing that by the average number  of agents or officers at DHS for each fiscal year. We determined that  ammunition purchase data for DOJ components were not sufficiently  reliable prior to 2011 for all components, so we used data from fiscal  years 2011 through 2013 to do the same calculation. We analyzed the  amount of ammunition purchased per agent or officer authorized to carry  firearms to account for the varying sizes of the different departments and  components. We selected ammunition purchases by DOJ to provide a  comparison with DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases as DOJ has the second  largest number of personnel authorized to carry firearms. However, our  DOJ analysis is not to suggest that the department represents a model or  standard against which DHS is assessed. Differences in the amount of  ammunition purchased per firearm-carrying agent or officer reflect a  number of factors, including unique mission requirements and training  needs.", "To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed DHS ammunition  procurement contract files and interviewed knowledgeable officials at  DHS and DOJ responsible for collecting and reporting these data. In  addition, for the data we obtained from DHS components on ammunition  purchases and costs, we compared the data with corroborating evidence,  such as information from the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS),  to determine data consistency and reasonableness. We found the data on  ammunition purchase, usage, cost, and inventory, as well as workforce  data, to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes, with caveats and  exceptions noted throughout the report. We also interviewed DHS  component officials from each of the components in our review  responsible for overseeing the ammunition procurement process and  determining ammunition requirements at the component level. We also  discussed the purpose of quality testing the ammunition, and to  understand the context of why proficiency among firearm-carrying  personnel is important. Finally, for additional context, we visited the ICE  National Firearms Testing Lab, which performs quality control testing on  ammunition and firearms, and maintains an inventory of ammunition and  firearms for distribution to DHS field locations.", "To address our second question, we reviewed DHS-wide and DHS  component-level policy documents, such as acquisition and personal  property management directives, and firearms and ammunition guidance  and operating procedures. We interviewed knowledgeable officials from  the DHS Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, CBP, FLETC, FPS, ICE,  TSA, and USSS regarding their management and oversight of  ammunition and firearms and the related policies and procedures for DHS  and its components. We also reviewed available DHS Inspector General  audit and component inspection reports related to the oversight over  ammunition and firearms.

DHS developed its first  strategically sourced ammunition procurement in 2005. DHS\u2019s strategic  sourcing contract vehicles include contracts or agreements that have  been established for use by two or more components, and these types of  contracts have been used by DHS components to procure ammunition.  The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement  Policy has cited DHS\u2019s efforts among best practices for implementing  federal strategic sourcing initiatives, and we have also reported on DHS\u2019s  strategic sourcing initiatives.", "DHS procures ammunition using two types of contracts\u2014strategic  sourcing and individual contracts. The decision of whether to use a  strategic sourcing contract is driven by collective component needs,  according to DHS officials. That is, if more than one component needs a  specific type of ammunition, then that ammunition procurement is a  candidate for strategic sourcing. Most of DHS\u2019s ammunition contracts,  whether strategically sourced or individual contracts, are indefinite  delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts, which are typically  negotiated for a base year with additional options for purchasing  ammunition up to a certain maximum number of rounds, or contract  ceiling. These IDIQ contracts allow components to lock in the price,  specifications, delivery costs, and other requirements and then place  purchase orders throughout the negotiated time frame of the contract  (e.g., indefinite delivery) for varying quantities as needed (e.g., indefinite  quantity), rather than placing a single order for large amounts of  ammunition. DHS orders based on the contracts as needed and pays for  the ammunition on delivery. DHS is required to buy only a minimum that  represents about 1 month of the projected DHS requirement, according to  DHS officials.", "In August 2012, DHS began requiring components to use strategic  sourcing contract vehicles for procurements, including ammunition,  unless procurements met certain exceptions, such as specialized types of  ammunition not commonly used across components or ammunition  requiring certain technical specifications. Ammunition that is either not  commonly used or has specifications needed by a single component can  be acquired through individual component contracts according to DHS  officials. Within the DHS Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, the  Strategic Sourcing Program Office helps components develop,  implement, and maintain sourcing strategies to enhance acquisition  efficiency. According to DHS officials, the strategic sourcing process for  procuring ammunition for multiple components has saved an estimated  $2 million since fiscal year 2008.

Rather than have  each component procure ammunition and weapons individually or draw  exclusively on its own history for best practices, the members of WACC,  as shown in figure 1, are to meet monthly to explore ways to maximize  procurement savings, according to DHS officials. According to DHS  officials, to further coordinate ammunition and weapons procurements,  DHS is exploring the feasibility of broadening the scope of WACC to also  track and approve ammunition purchases across the department.

According to senior DHS officials, the decline in ammunition  purchases in fiscal year 2013 is the result of budget constraints, reduced  training, and in one case the expiration of an ammunition contract. These  officials said that although ammunition purchases declined in fiscal year  2013, DHS components relied on their ammunition inventories to maintain  basic qualification and operational needs. In fiscal year 2014, DHS plans  to purchase about 75 million rounds of ammunition (see fig. 2). According  to DHS contract data as of October 1, 2013, the 29 existing DHS  ammunition contracts extend over the next 4 fiscal years and have a  remaining contract limit of approximately 704 million rounds (for various  ammunition types), if every option for purchasing ammunition were  exercised into fiscal year 2018. The total contract dollar ceiling on these  29 active contracts is about $285 million.

CBP\u2014which has the most firearm-carrying personnel of the DHS  components\u2014purchased the largest amount of ammunition, on average,  from fiscal year 2008 through 2013, accounting for approximately 46  percent of DHS\u2019s average purchases of ammunition for this time period.  The average amount of ammunition purchased by components from fiscal  years 2008 through 2013 ranged from approximately 50 million rounds of  ammunition for CBP to a low of approximately 1.9 million rounds of  ammunition for FPS.", "A number of factors contribute to variation in ammunition purchases from  year to year by component, such as changes in the size of the firearm- carrying workforce. For example, CBP and ICE increased their firearm- carrying workforces in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, which also increased  ammunition needs for those components, as new hires needed to be  trained to gain firearms proficiency prior to entering the field for duty.  According to CBP data, new Border Patrol agents each use  approximately 3,300 rounds during training and qualification, compared  with experienced officers who might use about 600 rounds. DHS  components provided data on the amount of ammunition typically used by  a new law enforcement hire, which ranged from 2,000 to 5,000 rounds.  From fiscal years 2008 through 2013, the DHS components in our review  trained thousands of new law enforcement agents and officers, according  to DHS data. Other factors that account for changes in ammunition  purchases year to year include qualification and training requirements  and amount of ammunition in inventory, as discussed later in this report.  In addition, it is important to note that components purchase ammunition  throughout the year, and orders placed in 1 fiscal year might not arrive or  be used until future years, which can also contribute to variation in  purchases from year to year.", "The amount of ammunition each component purchases for its firearm- carrying personnel also varies. We analyzed DHS data on ammunition  purchases and the size of the firearm-carrying workforce for fiscal years  2008 through 2013 and found the average number of rounds of  ammunition purchased per year per firearm-carrying agent or officer by  component for this time period ranged between approximately 1,000 and  2,000 rounds, as shown in table 2. This variation exists because each  component independently decides, based on its operational needs, how  much ammunition to allocate to its firearm-carrying personnel for training  and qualification each year. For example, FPS provides each officer 250  rounds per quarter per handgun for firearm qualification, while ICE  provides 100 rounds per quarter per handgun for firearm qualification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training and Qualification Are the Biggest Drivers of DHS\u2019s Ammunition Purchase Decisions; Few Rounds Are Actually Fired in the Line of Duty", "paragraphs": ["When determining annual ammunition requirements, the primary  consideration for DHS components is the amount of ammunition needed  to support the training and qualification of the firearm-carrying workforce,  according to DHS officials.

Failure to  qualify on firearms may result in the denial, suspension or revocation of  credentials to carry firearms. Depending on how rigorous a component\u2019s  qualification requirements are and how many firearms an officer is  authorized to carry, each DHS component may require a larger or smaller  supply of ammunition to conduct its qualifications. Officers generally carry  one or more firearms and must qualify on each firearm they carry. For  example, a component may allow an officer to carry a personally owned  firearm in addition to his or her duty-issued firearm, and the officer must  qualify on both weapons, using ammunition provided by the relevant DHS  component. DHS law enforcement officers across the department are  typically required to perform quarterly firearms qualifications on their  issued weapons (e.g., handgun), and in some cases demonstrate  familiarity and proficiency on long guns, such as rifles and shotguns, even  if they are not required to carry a long gun as part of their duties. For  some officers, depending on the DHS component and the requirements of  their unit, more frequent qualifications or advanced firearms training is  required. For example, advanced firearms training may include \u201cdown and  disabled\u201d firearms training or reduced light firearms training, among  others. DHS components also may have specialized units, such as  tactical teams, that may require hundreds or thousands of rounds of  ammunition during training activities.

Officials from all DHS components within our  review reported time lags between placing orders for ammunition and  receiving them. For example, the time lag can range from 3 to 18 months.  Senior DHS component officials said that the Department of Defense gets  first priority for ammunition orders from manufacturers, and supplying the  military can delay orders for DHS and other federal law enforcement  agencies, not only because of military priority, but also because  production of other types of ammunition may be halted while  manufacturers work to produce the ammunition needed by the  Department of Defense. These officials also stated that while the  ammunition they purchase comes from the same manufacturers that  provide ammunition for commercial supply, the ammunition DHS  purchases is manufactured according to DHS contract specifications, and  is higher quality than commercial off-the-shelf ammunition. Senior  component officials said they take this into account when determining  how much and when to order ammunition, including when ammunition  inventories need to be replenished. While awaiting delivery of ordered  ammunition, DHS components reported using their existing ammunition  inventories to meet mission requirements, such as for training and  qualification.", "Ammunition quality and testing are also factors in developing annual  ammunition requirements for DHS. Components, such as USSS, ICE,  and FLETC, have testing facilities to help ensure the ammunition ordered  meets the specifications outlined in contracts with manufacturers. For  example, ICE\u2019s National Firearms Tactical and Training Unit (NFTTU)\u2014 which purchases ammunition on behalf of ICE, CBP, and FPS, and  provides technical assistance to TSA\u2014operates a ballistics laboratory for  the testing of ammunition, among other purposes. This unit conducts  quality tests on a sample of each ammunition order before approving the   According to  acceptance and distribution of the total ammunition order.the Assistant Director of ICE\u2019s NFTTU, if the ammunition tested does not  meet NFTTU\u2019s quality standards, the batch is returned to the  manufacturer and the total order is not accepted and approved until the  ammunition meets standards. According to NFTTU data, this has  occurred 17 times from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013,  representing 3 percent of total tested batches.", "Changes in firearms and ammunition types: Another factor  components consider when developing their annual ammunition  requirements is changes in the types of firearms and ammunition used by  components, according to senior DHS officials. When these changes  occur, additional ammunition is required to ensure officers\u2019 proficiency on  the new firearm or ammunition. For example, in August 2011, ICE  management made changes to the types of authorized weapons officers  could carry as their primary weapon\u2014expanding the list of authorized 9  millimeter (mm) firearms. Prior to this change, the standard duty firearm  was a .40 caliber firearm. After authorizing more 9 mm firearms, ICE  experienced a 60 percent increase in the amount of 9 mm ammunition  consumed, according to ICE, which resulted in ICE\u2019s inventory of 9 mm  ammunition to be depleted. According to ICE officials, ICE needed to  amend the existing contract for 9 mm ammunition to allow for additional  purchases of ammunition to ensure officers who chose to use those 9 mm  firearms had sufficient ammunition for firearms qualification and  operations. As this change came at the end of fiscal year 2011,  purchases increased in fiscal year 2012, as previously shown in figure 3.", "Historical usage rates: Historical usage rates\u2014that is, the amount of  ammunition used in previous years\u2014is also a factor components consider  to determine how much ammunition to purchase, according to senior  DHS component officials. DHS component officials told us they estimate  how much ammunition they have used by reviewing how much  ammunition they purchased in previous years, the number of authorized  firearm-carrying personnel, and related training and qualification  requirements. According to our analysis of estimated ammunition usage  data provided by DHS components, for fiscal years 2008 through 2013,  DHS components in our review estimated using, on average,  approximately 110 million rounds of ammunition per fiscal year, with a  high of about 141 million rounds in fiscal year 2009 to a low of about 89  million rounds in fiscal year 2013 (see figure 4).", "Ammunition inventory: The amount of ammunition components have in  inventory is also a factor to determine how much and when to order more  ammunition, according to DHS component officials. DHS components  determine how much ammunition to keep in inventory, and when to  replenish ammunition inventories. The six DHS components in our review  stated they strive to maintain about 12 to 24 months\u2019 of ammunition  inventory to meet the training, qualification, and operational ammunition  needs of firearm-carrying personnel. As stated earlier, there can be  months-long delays between placing an order for ammunition and  receiving it. To help ensure components have sufficient ammunition on  hand to support the training and operational needs of their officers, DHS  components maintain inventories of ammunition. For example, TSA  officials said they try to keep a large ammunition inventory on hand,  because the FFDOs (trained and armed pilots) are allowed to provide as  little as 24 hours notice to perform their qualification, based on their  fluctuating schedules.", "Ammunition is stored in limited supply in the field offices of the various  components, as DHS component officials have said there is limited  storage for ammunition in the field. Officials added that while ammunition  is typically shipped directly from the manufacturers to the field offices that  placed the orders, there are occasions when production delays require  components to ship ammunition from their reserves stored in armories to  resupply the field. It is important to note that inventory levels reflect a  point in time and that inventory fluctuates throughout the year as  ammunition orders arrive from manufacturers and ammunition is used for  firearms qualification and other purposes in the field. Therefore, it is not  possible to provide an average ammunition inventory for a year or past  years, because the inventory is constantly fluctuating. Table 3 shows how  much ammunition DHS components had in inventory (in both estimated  rounds and approximate number of months\u2019 supply) at three different  points in time between November 2012 and October 2013, as reported to  us by DHS components. We provide these estimates at three points in  time to show, by component, how ammunition inventory fluctuates over  the course of 1 year.", "Each component is responsible for maintaining and recording its own  ammunition inventory, and, according to senior DHS component officials,  ammunition balances may not always be up to date and generally are  estimates. For example, a field location may show more ammunition in  inventory than other field offices, but that could reflect that the officers  have not yet completed a quarterly firearms qualification or the inventory  tracking system has not yet been updated to reflect changes. In addition,  components may also consider ammunition that has been ordered, but  not yet arrived, to be part of their \u201ccurrent\u201d inventory. For example, TSA  reported an inventory level of almost 30 million rounds in November 2012,  but TSA officials said that number included ammunition orders that had  been placed with the manufacturer, but were not yet in physical inventory.  According to TSA, the quantity of ammunition in TSA\u2019s physical  possession at the time of the inquiry was approximately 19 million rounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Components Cited Similar Factors in Determining Ammunition Requirements for Personnel Authorized to Carry Firearms and Annual Ammunition Purchases are Comparable to Those of DHS", "paragraphs": ["Similar to DHS, the DOJ components in our review also purchase  ammunition to ensure their personnel authorized to carry firearms are  equipped to carry out their various law enforcement missions. For the  three DOJ components in our review, ammunition purchases are driven  primarily by the firearms training and qualification requirements for their  firearm-carrying workforce. According to DOJ data, DOJ component  firearm qualification requirements range from semi-annual to quarterly,  depending on the component; however, most require quarterly firearms  qualification on an officer\u2019s primary weapon. As shown in table 4, the  approximate number of rounds of ammunition purchased per firearm- carrying agent or officer for the three DOJ law enforcement agencies in  our review for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 were similar to the amounts  for DHS components in our review.", "For DOJ components, the average number of rounds of ammunition  purchased per authorized firearm-carrying agent or officer per year  across fiscal years 2011 through 2013 was approximately 1,300 rounds.", "For DHS, the average number of rounds of ammunition purchased per  authorized firearm-carrying agent or officer per year for fiscal years 2011  through 2013 was approximately 1,000 rounds.", "Senior DOJ officials also reported similar considerations when making  ammunition purchases, such as ammunition delivery lead time, quality  issues, and the amount of ammunition in inventory. As with DHS officials,  DOJ officials reported that the type of ammunition they use is  manufactured to a higher standard than ammunition purchased by the  civilian market and is not considered off-the-shelf. According to DOJ  component officials, the ammunition purchased by DOJ is produced after  an order is placed with a manufacturer, and the time between placing an  order and receiving it can be several months. Quality testing of  ammunition is also part of DOJ components\u2019 procurement process, to  help ensure ammunition performs as expected in the field. Additionally,  DOJ components also consider the amount of inventory on hand when  determining ammunition requirements. According to officials from the  DOJ components in our review, the amount of inventory components try  to maintain ranged from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 24  months. Ammunition inventory data provided by two of the three DOJ  components indicated that inventory ranged from about 13 months\u2019 worth  to about 20 months\u2019 worth.DHS components."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Policies and Guidance for Firearms and Ammunition Inventory Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Components Have Inventory Management Policies and Procedures and Are in the Process of Implementing Revised DHS Firearms Asset Policy", "paragraphs": ["Each of the DHS components in our review has policies, procedures, and  processes that describe the requirements and guidance necessary to  ensure inventory management, control and accountability for firearms and  ammunition.

For  example, FLETC requires the firearms and weapons custodian to perform  a daily audit of all ammunition issues and receipts occurring at specified  issue points. TSA requires supervisors to conduct unannounced  employee firearm inspections and recommends that TSA offices conduct  random, selective, periodic, or unannounced internal audits to ensure  proper inventory controls and accountability.

We reviewed prior GAO reports and a Congressional  Research Service memorandum on DHS acquisition and procurement.  We also reviewed contracts for ammunition purchases and related pre- award documentation, including acquisition plans, market research, and  cost estimates, but we did not review whether components\u2019 ammunition  procurements complied with the FAR, HSAR, or HSAM. We interviewed  the Director for Procurement Policy and Oversight, the Director for  Oversight and Strategic Sourcing, and the acquisition and program  officials from six DHS components including U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.

We reviewed relevant policies and guidance, examined  department and component documentation, and interviewed officials from  the DHS Office of the Chief Procurement Officer and components on  practices they employ and contracts they have leveraged. Specifically, we  interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s strategic sourcing program office, as well  as all six components, to gain an understanding of DHS\u2019s strategic  sourcing processes, the availability of strategic sourcing contracting  vehicles for ammunition, and the potential of establishing component- specific strategic sourcing goals for procuring ammunition. We also  interviewed Office of the Chief Procurement Officer Oversight and Pricing  Branch officials regarding their tri-annual reviews of procurement  operations.", "To determine any trends in DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases since fiscal  year 2008, we obtained available data from DHS law enforcement  components with firearm-carrying personnel regarding their ammunition  purchases, costs, usage, and the size of the authorized firearm-carrying  workforce for fiscal years 2008 through 2013.

Because we determined that it is not  possible to provide an average ammunition inventory for a year or past  years, as ammunition inventory is constantly fluctuating, we selected  these points in time based on data that was previously reported by DHS  to Congress prior to our review as well as data available at the start and  end of our review. In addition, DHS components\u2019 records may not always  reflect the exact quantities of the ammunition inventory. For example,  depending on how often components update their inventory data, the time  lag may result in differences between quantities of ammunition actually  available and those reflected on the inventory records.

We  also excluded the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014a DHS component with firearm- carrying personnel\u2014because the Coast Guard does not procure  ammunition through DHS; rather, the U.S. Coast Guard procures its  ammunition through Department of Defense contracts.", "Similarly, we selected all DOJ law enforcement components with firearm- carrying personnel regarding their ammunition purchases, costs, usage,  and size of the workforce authorized to carry firearms for fiscal years  2011 through 2013. The specific DOJ law enforcement components  included in our review are the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives (ATF), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and U.S.  Marshals Service. The Federal Bureau of Prisons could not provide  ammunition purchase data comparable to that of the other components  based on its method of record keeping and data retention policy. We  determined that data from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)  were not sufficiently reliable for our purposes, because DEA could only  provide estimates of purchases. We, therefore, excluded both agencies  from our scope.

We selected DOJ to provide a  comparison with DHS\u2019s ammunition purchases as it has the second  largest number of personnel authorized to carry firearms. However, our  DOJ analysis is not to suggest that the department represents a model or  standard against which DHS is assessed. Differences in the amount of  ammunition per firearm-carrying personnel reflect a number of factors,  including unique mission requirements and training needs.", "To assess the reliability of the data we obtained from DHS components  on ammunition purchases and costs, we reviewed the extent to which the  components have procedures and controls for ensuring that the data are  consistent and accurate, and interviewed knowledgeable officials  responsible for collecting and reporting the data. In addition, for the data  we obtained from DHS components on ammunition purchases and costs,  we compared it with corroborating evidence to determine data  consistency and reasonableness. Specifically, we obtained information on  ammunition procurements using obligations data from fiscal years 2008  through 2012, and part of fiscal year 2013 from the Federal Procurement  Data System (FPDS), which tracks all contracts using appropriated funds  government-wide. We used the obligations data from the FPDS and  compared ammunitions obligations for DHS with the sum of ammunition  costs as provided to us by each of the components. We also compared  estimated ammunition used with ammunition purchased under the  assumption that in a given year, components would purchase ammunition  to replace what was used. We calculated how much ammunition DHS  components might be expected to use in a given year using data,  provided by DHS, on the size of the firearm-carrying workforce, the  number of staff qualified on various types of firearms, and the number of  rounds of ammunition typically allotted for training and qualifications. We  also reviewed selected DHS ammunition procurement contracts, which  were readily available, for information on ammunition purchases, costs,  and stated requirements. We found the data on ammunition purchases  and costs for the DHS components to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To assess the reliability of the data we obtained from DHS components  on ammunition inventory, we reviewed the extent to which the agencies  have procedures and controls for ensuring that the data are consistent  and accurate, and interviewed knowledgeable officials responsible for  collecting and reporting the data.
