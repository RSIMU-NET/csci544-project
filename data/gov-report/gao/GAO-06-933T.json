At the four port locations GAO visited, federal and nonfederal stakeholders said that the newly formed committees were an improvement over previous information-sharing efforts. The types of information shared included assessments of vulnerabilities at port locations and strategies the Coast Guard intends to use in protecting key infrastructure. GAO's ongoing work indicates that these committees continue to be useful forums for information sharing. Interagency operational centers also allow for even greater information sharing because the centers operate on a 24-hour-a-day basis, and they receive real-time information from data sources such as radars and sensors. The Coast Guard has developed its own centers--called sector command centers--at 35 port locations to monitor information and to support its operations planned for the future. As of today, the relationship between the interagency operational centers and the sector command centers remains to be determined. In April 2005 the major barrier hindering information sharing was the lack of federal security clearances for nonfederal members of committees or centers. In April 2005, Coast Guard issued guidance to field offices that clarified their role in obtaining clearances for nonfederal members of committees or centers. In addition, the Coast Guard did not have formal procedures that called for the use of data to monitor application trends. As of June 2006, guidance was put in place and according to the Coast Guard, was responsible for an increase in security clearance applications under consideration by the Coast Guard. Specifically, as of June 2006, 188 out of 467 nonfederal members of area maritime security committees with a need to know received some type of security clearance. This is an improvement from February 2005, when no security clearances were issued to 359 nonfederal members of area maritime security committees members with a need to know security information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the improvements made in the  practice of sharing maritime-related security information. Securing the  nation\u2019s ports against a potential terrorist attack has become one of the  nation\u2019s security priorities since the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001. Factors that make ports vulnerable to a terrorist attack include their  location near major urban centers, their inclusion of critical  infrastructures such as oil refineries and terminals, and their importance  to the nation\u2019s economy and trade. Although no port-related terrorist  attacks have occurred in the United States, terrorists overseas have  demonstrated their ability to access and destroy infrastructure, assets, and  lives in and around seaports.", "Ports are sprawling enterprises that often cross jurisdictional boundaries;  therefore, the need to share information among federal, state, and local  agencies is central to effective prevention and response. Since the  September 11 terrorist attacks, the federal government has taken a  number of approaches designed to enhance information sharing. One of  these approaches provides the Coast Guard with the authority to create  area maritime security committees at the port level. These committees\u2014 with representatives from the federal, state, local, and private sectors\u2014 offer a venue to identify and deal with vulnerabilities in and around ports,  as well as a forum for sharing information on issues related to port  security. Another approach developed to share information is the creation  of interagency operational centers at certain port locations. These centers  are command posts that tie together intelligence and operational efforts of  various federal and nonfederal participants. Often information regarding  port security is classified, and requires security clearances for those who  need access to this information. Lacking access to such information  through a security clearance can disadvantage officials in their efforts to  respond to or combat a terrorist threat.", "My testimony today is a summary of and update to our April 2005 report,  Maritime Security: New Structures Have Improved Information  Sharing, but Security Clearance Processing Requires Further Attention,  GAO-05-394.

It was led by  DOJ, and its membership included 4 federal agencies and 16 state and  local agencies. The San Diego center had a more general purpose, so it had  multiple missions to include not just port security, but search and rescue,  environmental response, drug interdiction, and other law enforcement  activities. It was led by the Coast Guard, and its membership included 2  federal agencies and 1 local agency. The Norfolk center had a port security  purpose, but its mission was focused primarily on force protection for the  Navy. It was led by the Coast Guard, and its membership included 2  federal agencies and no state or local agencies. As a result, the Charleston  center shared information that focused on law enforcement and  intelligence related to port security among a very broad group of federal,  state, and local agency officials. The San Diego center shared information  on a broader scope of activities (beyond security) among a smaller group  of federal and local agency officials. The Norfolk center shared the most  focused information (security information related to force protection)  among two federal agencies.", "The centers also shared different information because of their  technologies and resources. The San Diego and Norfolk centers had an  array of standard and new Coast Guard technology systems and access to  Coast Guard and various national databases, while the Charleston center  had these as well as additional systems and databases. For example, the  Charleston center had access to and shared information on Customs and  Border Protection\u2019s databases on incoming cargo containers from the  National Targeting Center. In addition, Charleston had a pilot project with  the Department of Energy to test radiation detection technology that  provided additional information to share. The Charleston center was  funded by a special appropriation that allowed it to use federal funds to  pay for state and local agency salaries. This arrangement boosted the  participation of state and local agencies, and thus information sharing  beyond the federal government, according to port stakeholders in  Charleston.
