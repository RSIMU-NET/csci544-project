To identify the potential benefits and problems with expanding the preference, GAO interviewed officials with knowledge of this issue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that the Department of Defense (DOD) did not apply the U.S. contractor preference in accordance with the current statute from October 2010 through May 2014. The fiscal year 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act directs that military construction contracts valued over $1 million and located in countries bordering the Arabian Sea, U.S. territories in the Pacific, and the Kwajalein Atoll, be awarded to a U.S. contractor unless their price is 20 percent higher than the price from a competing non-U.S. contractor with an equally responsive and responsible bid. However, DOD incorrectly applied the preference to countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, which is geographically distinct from the Arabian Sea (see figure). DOD officials were unaware the statute changed the preference from \u201cArabian Gulf\u201d to \u201cArabian Sea\u201d in 2002 and therefore had not updated DOD's acquisition guidance. DOD's application, however, included the geographic area in which the majority of military construction in the Arabian Sea and Arabian Gulf locations took place from October 2010 through May 2014. GAO also found that due to other factors that are also considered, such as a contractor's experience, the preference potentially only affected 2 of the 35 award decisions for military construction contracts since fiscal year 2011. DOD updated its guidance during GAO's review, but it could become outdated, again, if a congressional bill becomes effective, as the bill would change the locations subject to the preference in fiscal year 2015.", "GAO also found that DOD and State Department officials identified potential benefits and problems with expanding the statute to include all of the countries within the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. For example, according to the officials, one potential benefit of contracting with U.S. firms would be greater familiarity with U.S. contracting and construction procedures. However, these officials also told GAO the 20 countries in the CENTCOM area vary widely in their local capacities, economies, and strategic concerns. Therefore, an expansion may run counter to specific U.S. policy goals in certain locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The current U.S. contractor preference provision appears in  Section 112 of the Department of Defense title within the fiscal year 2014  Consolidated Appropriations Act (hereafter referred to as Section 112).  Section 112 provides that  None of the funds made available in this title for military construction  in the United States territories and possessions in the Pacific and on  Kwajalein Atoll, or in countries bordering the Arabian Sea, may be  used to award any contract estimated by the Government to exceed  $1,000,000 to a foreign contractor: Provided, That this section shall  not be applicable to contract awards for which the lowest responsive  and responsible bid of a United States contractor exceeds the lowest  responsive and responsible bid of a foreign contractor by greater than  20 percent: Provided further, That this section shall not apply to  contract awards for military construction on Kwajalein Atoll for which  the lowest responsive and responsible bid is submitted by a  Marshallese contractor.", "Congress is considering expanding this preference to apply to all  countries within the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) area of  responsibility, a region consisting of 20 countries where, according to  DOD, the department is planning an estimated $699.5 million in military  construction from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2021. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations  Act for Fiscal Year 2014 mandated that we examine the potential benefits  and problems of expanding the geographical area for the U.S. contractor  preference from the current 5 countries that border the Arabian Sea to the  20 countries within the CENTCOM area of responsibility. This report (1)  examines the extent to which DOD has awarded contracts for military  construction projects in accordance with Section 112 since fiscal year  2011 and (2) describes DOD and Department of State (State) officials\u2019  observations of the potential benefits and problems with expanding the  Section 112 preference to include all countries in the CENTCOM area of  responsibility.", "To examine the extent to which DOD has awarded military construction  contracts in accordance with Section 112 since fiscal year 2011, we  reviewed the statute and DOD\u2019s implementing regulations to identify and  develop criteria for assessing the department\u2019s actions. Using the Federal  Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation and in coordination with  DOD officials, we then identified the DOD military construction contracts  that were awarded from October 2010 through May 2014 that met the  dollar value and geographic location requirements of the preference.those contracts, we then worked with the DOD agencies responsible for  awarding the contract to determine whether the project was funded with  appropriations that were subject to the preference.", "We then obtained and analyzed contract documentation for those awards  to determine (1) whether DOD included the preference language, (2)  whether the 20 percent preference was applied to the proposed offers of  competing non-U.S. firms in these contracts, and (3) whether the  preference affected the award. We interviewed DOD officials who have  knowledge of these contracts about the extent to which the Section 112  preference was applied to these contracts and whether the preference  was a contributing factor in awarding the contracts. We assessed the  reliability of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation and  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers data by reviewing related documentation,  interviewing knowledgeable officials, and testing the data for obvious  errors and completeness. We concluded the data were sufficiently reliable  to determine the extent to which DOD awarded military construction  contracts in accordance with Section 112 since fiscal year 2011.", "To describe DOD and State officials\u2019 observations of the potential benefits  and problems of expanding the Section 112 preference to include all  countries in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, we identified and  reviewed guiding principles of the federal acquisition system as stated in  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). These principles include (1)  delivering the best value product or service to the customer in a timely  manner using contractors with successful track records or superior ability  to perform; (2) promoting competition; (3) minimizing administrative costs;  (4) promoting openness, integrity, and fairness; and (5) fulfilling public  policy objectives. To identify the potential benefits and problems of  expanding the preference, we interviewed officials in the following offices  and asked them about the effect of the preference on those guiding  principles: five U.S. Army Corps of Engineers field offices located in  countries bordering the Arabian Sea, bordering the Arabian Gulf, or within  the CENTCOM area of responsibility that had military construction  projects within the time frame of our review; U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers headquarters and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Middle East  District; two offices within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense;  U.S. State Department headquarters; and six embassies located in an  Arabian Gulf border country, an Arabian Sea border country, or within  CENTCOM; and a private-sector association with knowledge about this  issue. This report focuses on DOD\u2019s views of the U.S. contractor  preference for military construction contracts. We have included only  those comments made by State officials that focus on potential diplomatic  benefits and challenges since (1) officials at four embassies referred us to  DOD officials for comment, and (2) State headquarters officials deferred  to DOD since this report focuses on military construction. We also asked  officials about their general views on the preference as it has been  applied and the potential expansion of the preference to all countries  within the CENTCOM area of responsibility. While the information from  these interviews is not generalizable, it provides varying perspectives  about potential benefits and problems related to the U.S. contractor  preference.

For fiscal year 1996,  Congress decreased the threshold for the preference from $5 million to  $1 million, the current threshold, and included countries bordering the  Arabian Gulf as countries covered by the preference. In fiscal year 2002  legislation, Congress modified the preference provision to change the  locations where the preference was to be applied. Instead of the Arabian  Gulf, the preference was to be applied to construction located in countries  bordering the Arabian Sea, which is a geographically distinct area. The  Pacific locations and the dollar value at which the preference would apply  to a contract remained the same.

As  shown in figure 4, the remaining 48 contracts were not military  construction contracts and therefore not eligible for the preference.", "For the 29 contracts that were subject to the preference in accordance  with DFARS, we then obtained and analyzed contract documentation for  those awards to determine (1) whether DOD included the preference  language, (2) whether the 20 percent preference was applied to the  proposed offers of competing non-U.S. firms, (3) whether the preference  affected the award.the preference in accordance with DFARS, we found a military  construction\u2013operations and maintenance contract that the Army Corps of  Engineers had incorrectly applied the preference to; however, we did not  include this contract in our analysis since this type of contract was not  covered by either Section 112 or the DFARS provision\u2014and was thus  outside of the scope of our engagement.", "In addition to these 29 contracts that were subject to  To determine the extent to which DOD awarded military construction  contracts on U.S. territories in the Pacific and on the Kwajalein Atoll in  accordance with Section 112 we requested data from Naval Facilities  Engineering Command and Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Honolulu District,  which are responsible for military construction in those respective  locations. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command identified two  construction projects awarded in Guam that were subject to the U.S.  contractor preference provision. The Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Honolulu  District identified four military construction contracts associated with  projects on Kwajalein Atoll that were subject to these provisions.", "We assessed the reliability of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013 Next Generation and Army Corps of Engineers data by reviewing related  documentation, interviewing knowledgeable officials, and testing the data  for obvious errors and completeness. We concluded the data were  sufficiently reliable to determine the extent to which DOD awarded military  construction contracts in accordance with Section 112 since fiscal year  2011.", "We interviewed the following U.S. government offices during this  engagement:", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy;", "Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology", "Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Middle East District;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Kuwait Area Office;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Bahrain Area Office;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Qatar Area Office;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013United Arab Emirates / Central Asian", "Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Division\u2013Afghanistan;", "Army Corps of Engineers\u2013Honolulu District;", "U.S. Air Force Civil Engineer Center;", "U.S. Pacific Command Headquarters;", "U.S. Central Command Headquarters;", "Naval Facilities Engineering Command;", "U.S. Department of State Headquarters;", "U.S. Embassy Oman;", "U.S. Embassy Bahrain;", "U.S. Embassy Afghanistan;", "U.S. Embassy United Arab Emirates;", "U.S. Embassy Kyrgyzstan;", "U.S. Embassy Turkmenistan; and", "U.S. Agency for International Development\u2013Kabul.", "To describe DOD and Department of State (State) officials\u2019 observations  on potential benefits and problems to expanding Section 112 to include all  countries in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, we reviewed and  identified guiding principles of the federal acquisition system as stated in  the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These principles include (1)  delivering the best-value product or service to the customer in a timely  manner using contractors with successful track records or superior ability  to perform; (2) promoting competition; (3) minimizing administrative costs;  (4) promoting openness, integrity, and fairness; and (5) fulfilling public  policy objectives. To identify the potential benefits and problems of  expanding the preference, we interviewed officials from DOD, State, and   and asked  a private-sector association with knowledge about this issue,them about the effect of the preference on those guiding principles. We  also asked officials about their general views on the preference as it has  been applied and the potential expansion of the preference to all  countries within the CENTCOM area of responsibility.
