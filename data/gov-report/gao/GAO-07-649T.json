By creating the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) in 2003, and appointing a  Chief Operating Officer (COO) to head ATO, FAA established a new  management structure and adopted more leading practices of private  sector businesses to address the cost, schedule, and performance  shortfalls that have plagued its air traffic control modernization efforts.  For example, FAA has taken steps to improve its acquisition workforce  culture and work toward a results-oriented, high-performance  organization.

I will highlight just a few of those areas in this  testimony. First, JPDO has taken several actions that are consistent with  practices that facilitate interagency collaboration\u2014an important point  given how critical such collaboration is to the success of JPDO\u2019s mission.  For example, the JPDO partner agencies worked together to develop a  high level plan for NextGen along with eight strategies that broadly  address the goals and objectives for NextGen. JPDO has since issued two  annual updates to this plan, as required by Congress. Also, JPDO\u2019s  organizational structure involves federal and nonfederal stakeholders  throughout. This structure includes a federal interagency senior policy  committee, an institute for nonfederal stakeholders, and eight integrated  product teams that bring together federal and nonfederal experts to plan  for and coordinate the development of technologies that will address  JPDO\u2019s eight broad strategies. JPDO has also begun leveraging the  resources of its partner agencies in part by reviewing their research and  development programs, identifying work to support NextGen, and working  to minimize duplication of research programs across the agencies. For  example, one opportunity for coordination involves aligning aviation  weather research across FAA, NASA, and the Departments of Commerce  and Defense, developing a common weather capability, and integrating  weather information into NextGen.", "In addition to developing and updating its high-level integrated plan, first  published in December 2004, JPDO has been working to develop several  critical documents that form the foundation of NextGen planning,  including a draft concept of operations and an enterprise architecture.   The concept of operations describes how the transformational elements of  NextGen will operate in 2025. It is intended to establish general  stakeholder buy-in to the NextGen end state, a transition path, and a  business case. The enterprise architecture follows from the concept of  operations and will describe the system in more detail (using the federal  enterprise architecture framework). It will be used to integrate NextGen  efforts of the partner agencies. The draft concept of operations has been  posted to JPDO\u2019s Web site for stakeholder review and comment.   According to JPDO, an expanded version of the enterprise architecture is  expected in mid-2007.", "Progress has also been made in improving the collaboration and  coordination between JPDO and FAA\u2014the agency largely responsible for  the implementation of NextGen systems and capabilities. FAA has  expanded and revamped its Operational Evolution Plan (OEP)\u2014renamed  the Operational Evolution Partnership\u2014to become FAA\u2019s implementation  plan for NextGen. The OEP is being expanded to apply to all of FAA and  is intended to become a comprehensive description of how the agency will  implement NextGen, including the required technologies, procedures, and  resources. An ATO official told us that the new OEP is to be consistent  with JPDO\u2019s key planning documents and partner agency budget guidance.  According to FAA, the new OEP will allow it to demonstrate appropriate  budget control and linkage to NextGen plans and will force FAA\u2019s research  and development to be relevant to NextGen\u2019s requirements. According to  FAA documents, the agency plans to publish the new OEP in June 2007.", "In an effort to further align FAA\u2019s efforts with JPDO\u2019s plans for NextGen,  FAA has created a NextGen Review Board to oversee the OEP. This  Review Board will be co-chaired by JPDO\u2019s Director and ATO\u2019s Vice  President of Operations Planning. Initiatives, such as concept  demonstrations or research, proposed for inclusion in the OEP, will now  need to go through the Review Board for approval. Initiatives are to be  assessed for relation to NextGen requirements, concept maturity, and risk.  An ATO official told us that the new OEP process should also help identify  some smaller programs that might be inconsistent with NextGen and  which could be discontinued.  Additionally, as a further step towards  integrating ATO and JPDO, the administration\u2019s reauthorization proposal  calls for the JPDO Director to be a voting member of FAA\u2019s Joint  Resources Council and ATO\u2019s Executive Council."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges for JPDO Include Institutionalizing Interagency Collaboration and Exploring Potential Gaps in Research and Development Needs for NextGen", "paragraphs": ["Although JPDO has established a framework for collaboration, it has faced  a challenge in institutionalizing this framework. As JPDO is a coordinating  body, it has no authority over its partner agencies\u2019 key human and  technological resources needed to continue developing plans and system  requirements for NextGen. For example, JPDO has been working to  establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with its partner  agencies to more clearly define partner agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities  since at least August 2005. As of March 16, 2007, however, the MOU  remained unsigned. Another key activity for strengthening the  collaborative effort will be synchronizing the NextGen enterprise  architecture with the partner agencies\u2019 enterprise architectures. These  types of efforts, which would better institutionalize JPDO\u2019s collaborative  framework throughout the partner agencies, will be critical to JPDO\u2019s  ability to leverage the necessary funding for developing NextGen.  Institutionalization would help ensure that, as administrations and staffing  within JPDO change over the years, those coming into JPDO will have a  clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities and of the time and  resource commitments entailed.", "JPDO faces a challenge in developing a comprehensive cost estimate for  the NextGen effort. In its recent 2006 Progress Report, JPDO reported  some cost estimates related to FAA\u2019s NextGen investment portfolio, which  I will discuss in more detail later in this statement. However, JPDO is still  working to develop an understanding of the future requirements of its  other partner agencies and the users of the system. JPDO stated that it  sees its work in estimating costs as an ongoing process. The office notes  that it will gain additional insight into the business, management, and  technical issues and alternatives that will go into the long-term process of  implementing NextGen as it continues to work with industry, and that it  expects its cost estimates to continue to evolve.", "Another challenge facing JPDO is exploring potential gaps in the research  and development necessary to achieve some key NextGen capabilities and  to keep the development of new systems on schedule. In the past, a  significant portion of aeronautics research and development, including  intermediate technology development, has been performed by NASA.  However, our analysis of NASA\u2019s aeronautics research budget and  proposed funding shows a 30 percent decline, in constant 2005 dollars,  from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2011. To its credit, NASA plans to focus  its research on the needs of NextGen. However, NASA is also moving  toward a focus on fundamental research and away from developmental  work and demonstration projects. FAA is currently assessing its capacity  to address these issues. Currently it is unknown how all of the significant  research and development activities inherent in the transition to NextGen  will be conducted or funded.", "Still another challenge facing JPDO is ensuring that all relevant  stakeholders are involved in the effort. Some stakeholders, such as current  air traffic controllers and technicians, will play critical roles in NextGen,  and their involvement in planning for and deploying the new technology  will be important to the success of NextGen. In November 2006, we  reported that air traffic controllers were not involved in the NextGen  planning effort. Controllers are beginning to become involved as the  controllers\u2019 union is now represented on a key planning body. However,  technicians are currently not participating in NextGen efforts. Input from  current air traffic controllers who have recent experience controlling  aircraft and current technicians who will maintain the new equipment is  important is considering human factors and safety issues. Our work on  past air traffic control modernization projects has shown that a lack of  stakeholder or expert involvement early and throughout a project can lead  to cost increases and delays.", "Addressing human factors issues is another key challenge for JPDO. For  example, the NextGen concept of operations envisions that pilots will take  on a greater share of the responsibility for maintaining safe separation and  other tasks currently performed by controllers\u2014raising human factors  questions about whether pilots can safely perform these additional duties.  According to JPDO, the change in the roles of controllers and pilots is the  most important human factors issue involved in creating NextGen but will  be difficult to research because data on pilot behavior are not readily  available for use in creating models.", "Finally, we reported in November 2006 that establishing credibility was  viewed by the majority of the expert panelists we consulted as a challenge  facing JPDO. This view partially stems from past experiences in which the  government has stopped some modernization efforts after industry  invested in supporting technologies. Stakeholders\u2019 belief that the  government is fully committed to NextGen will be important as efforts to  implement NextGen technologies move forward. Another credibility  challenge for JPDO is convincing stakeholders that the collaborative effort  is making progress toward facilitating implementation. To address this  challenge, the new Director of JPDO is planning to implement some  structural and procedural changes to the office. For example, the Director  has proposed changing JPDO\u2019s integrated product teams into \u201cworking  groups\u201d that would task small teams with exploring specific issues and  delivering discrete work products. These changes have not yet been  implemented at JPDO and it will take some time before the effectiveness  of these changes can be evaluated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FAA Faces Challenges in Transitioning to NextGen", "paragraphs": ["FAA is a principal player in JPDO\u2019s efforts and will be the chief  implementer of NextGen. Successful implementation will depend, in part,  on how well FAA addresses its challenges of institutionalizing its recent  improvement in managing air traffic control modernization efforts,  addressing the cost challenges of implementing NextGen while safely  maintaining the current air traffic control system, and obtaining the  expertise needed to implement a system as complex as NextGen. I turn  now to these challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Faces the Challenge of Institutionalizing Recent Progress in Managing Air Traffic Control Modernization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["A successful transition to NextGen will depend, to a great extent, on FAA\u2019s  ability to manage the acquisition and integration of multiple NextGen  systems. Since 1995, we have designated FAA\u2019s air traffic control  modernization program as high risk because of systemic management and  acquisition problems. In recent years, FAA has taken a number of actions  to improve its management of acquisitions. Realization of NextGen goals  could be severely compromised if FAA\u2019s improved processes are not  institutionalized and carried over into the implementation of NextGen,  which is an even more complex and ambitious undertaking than past  modernization efforts.", "To its credit, FAA has taken a number of actions to improve its acquisition  management. By creating the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) in 2003, and  appointing a Chief Operating Officer (COO) to head ATO, FAA established  a new management structure and adopted more leading practices of  private sector businesses to address the cost, schedule, and performance  shortfalls that have plagued air traffic control acquisitions. ATO has  worked to create a flatter organization, with fewer management layers,  and has reported reducing executive staffing by 20 percent and total  management by 16 percent. In addition, FAA uses a performance  management system to hold managers responsible for the success of ATO.  More specifically, to better manage its acquisitions and address problems  we have identified, FAA has    established strategic goals to improve its acquisition workforce culture  and build towards a results-oriented, high-performing organization;   developed and applied a process improvement model to assess the  maturity of its software and systems acquisitions capabilities resulting in,  among other things, enhanced productivity and greater ability to predict  schedules and resources; and reported that it has established a policy and guidance on using Earned  Value Management (EVM) in its acquisition management system and that  19 of its major programs are currently using EVM.", "Institutionalizing these improvements throughout the agency (i.e.,  providing for their duration beyond the current leadership by ensuring that  reforms are fully integrated into the agency\u2019s structure and processes and  have become part of its organizational culture) will continue to be a  challenge for FAA. For example, the agency has yet to implement its cost  estimating methodology, although, according to the agency, it has  provided training on the methodology to employees.  Furthermore, FAA  has not established a policy to require use of its process improvement  model on all major acquisitions for the national airspace system. Until the  agency fully addresses these legacy issues, it will continue to risk program  management problems affecting cost, schedule, and performance. With a  multi-billion dollar acquisition budget, addressing these issues is as  important as ever."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutionalizing Change within FAA Will Require Continued Strong Leadership", "paragraphs": ["While FAA has implemented many positive changes to its management  processes, it currently faces the loss of key leaders. We have reported that  the experiences of successful transformations and change management  initiatives in large public and private organizations suggest that it can take  5 to 7 years or more until such initiatives are fully implemented and  cultures are transformed in a sustainable manner. Such changes require  focused, full-time attention from senior leadership and a dedicated team.  FAA\u2019s management improvements are relatively recent developments, and  the agency will have lost two of its significant agents for change\u2014the  Administrator and the COO\u2014by the end of September. The administrator\u2019s  term ends in September 2007; the COO left in February 2007, after serving  3 years. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the current Director  of JPDO is also new, having assumed that position in August 2006. For the  management and acquisition improvements to further permeate the  agency, and thus provide a firm foundation upon which to implement  NextGen, FAA\u2019s new leaders will need to demonstrate the same  commitment to improvement as the outgoing leaders. This continued  commitment to change is critical over the next few years, as foundational  NextGen systems begin to be implemented. Expeditiously moving to find a  new COO will help sustain this momentum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Faces a Cost Challenge of Implementing NextGen while Sustaining the Current Air Traffic Control System", "paragraphs": ["JPDO recently reported some estimated costs for NextGen, including  specifics on some early NextGen programs. JPDO believes the total  federal cost for NextGen infrastructure through 2025 will range between  $15 billion and $22 billion. JPDO also reported that a preliminary estimate  of the corresponding cost to system users, who will have to equip with the  advanced avionics that are necessary to realize the full benefits of some  NextGen technologies, ranges between $14 and $20 billion.  JPDO noted  that this range for avionics costs reflects uncertainty about equipage costs  for individual aircraft, the number of very light jets that will operate in  high-performance airspace, and the amount of out-of-service time required  for installation.", "In its Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2008-2012, FAA includes  estimated expenditures for eleven line items that are considered NextGen  capital programs. The total 5-year estimated expenditures for these  programs are $4.3 billion. In fiscal year 2008, only six of the line items are  funded for a total of roughly $174 million; funding for the remaining five  programs would begin with the fiscal year 2009 budget. According to FAA,  in addition to capital spending for NextGen, the agency will also spend an  estimated $300 million on NextGen-related research and development  from fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Also, the administration\u2019s budget for  fiscal year 2008 for FAA includes $17.8 million to support the activities of  JPDO.", "It is important to note that while FAA must manage the costs associated  with the NextGen transformation, it must simultaneously continue to fund  and operate the current national airspace system. In fact, the Department  of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General has reported that the majority of  FAA\u2019s capital funds go toward the sustainment of current air traffic  systems and that, over the last several years, increasing operating costs  have crowded out funds for the capital account. Efforts to sustain the  current system are particularly important given the safety concerns that  could be involved with system outages\u2014the number of which has  increased steadily over the last few years as the system continues to age.", "For example, the adequacy of FAA\u2019s maintenance of existing systems was  raised following a power outage and equipment failures in Southern  California that caused hundreds of flight delays during the summer of  2006. Investigations by the DOT Inspector General into these incidents  identified a number of underlying issues, including the age and condition  of equipment. Nationwide, the number of scheduled and unscheduled  outages of air traffic control equipment and ancillary support systems has  been increasing (see fig. 1). According to FAA, increases in the number of  unscheduled outages indicate that systems are failing more frequently.  FAA also notes that the duration of unscheduled equipment outages has  also been increasing in recent years from an average of about 21 hours in  2001 to about 40 hours in 2006, which may indicate, in part, that  maintenance and troubleshooting activities are requiring more effort and  longer periods of time. However, the agency considers user impact and  resource efficiency when planning and responding to equipment outages,  according to an FAA official. As a result, although some outages will have  longer restoration times, FAA believes that they do not adversely affect air  traffic control operations. It will be important for FAA to monitor and  address equipment outages to ensure the safety and efficiency of the  legacy systems and a smooth transition to NextGen.", "As part of managing the costs of system sustainment and system  modernization, FAA is seeking ways to reduce costs by introducing  infrastructure and operational efficiencies. For example, FAA plans to  produce cost savings through outsourcing and facility consolidations. FAA  is outsourcing flight service stations and estimates a $2.2 billion savings  over 12 years. Similarly, FAA is seeking savings through outsourcing its  planned nationwide deployment of Automatic Dependent Surveillance- Broadcast (ADS-B), a critical surveillance technology for NextGen. FAA is  planning to implement ADS-B through a performance-based contract in  which FAA will pay \u201csubscription\u201d charges for the ADS-B services and the  vendor will be responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure.  (FAA also reports that the ADS-B rollout will allow the agency to remove  50 percent of its current secondary radars, saving money in the ADS-B  program\u2019s baseline.) As for consolidating facilities, FAA is currently  restructuring its administrative service areas from nine offices to three  offices, which FAA estimates will save up to $460 million over 10 years.", "We have previously reported that FAA should pursue further cost control  options, such as exploring additional opportunities for contracting out  services and consolidating facilities. However, we recognize that FAA  faces challenges with consolidating facilities, an action that can be  politically sensitive. In recognition of this sensitivity, the administration  has proposed in FAA\u2019s reauthorization proposal that the Secretary of  Transportation be authorized to establish an independent, five-member  Commission, known as the Realignment and Consolidation of Aviation  Facilities and Services Commission, to independently analyze FAA\u2019s  recommendations to realign facilities or services. The Commission would  then send its own recommendations to the President and to Congress. In  the past, we have noted the importance of potential cost savings through  facility consolidations; however, it must also be noted that any such  consolidations must be handled through a process that solicits and  considers stakeholder input throughout, and fully considers the safety  implications of any proposed facility closures or consolidations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Needs to Explore Whether It Has the Technical and Contract Management Expertise Necessary to Implement NextGen", "paragraphs": ["In the past, a lack of expertise contributed to weaknesses in FAA\u2019s  management of air traffic control modernization efforts, and industry  experts with whom we spoke questioned whether FAA will have the  technical expertise needed to implement NextGen. In addition to technical  expertise, FAA will need contract management expertise to oversee the  systems acquisitions and integration involved in NextGen. In November,  we recommended that FAA examine its strengths and weaknesses with  regard to the technical expertise and contract management expertise that  will be required to define, implement, and integrate the numerous complex  programs inherent in the transition to NextGen. In response to our  recommendation, FAA is considering convening a blue ribbon panel to  study the issue and make recommendations to the agency about how to  best proceed with its management and oversight of the implementation of  NextGen. We believe that such a panel could help FAA begin to address  this challenge.", "To conclude, transforming the national airspace system to accommodate  much greater demand for air transportation services in the years ahead  will be an enormously complex undertaking.
