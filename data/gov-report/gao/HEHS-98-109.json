As specified in the law, the objectives of TANF are to provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives; end the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage; prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.", "All these goals are to be accomplished by providing states increased flexibility to design their own programs, thus allowing states to build on the initiatives they began experimenting with before federal reform. However, the law sets some parameters: to avoid financial penalties, states must impose work requirements for adults, meet steadily rising rates of caseload participation in work activities, and enforce a 5-year lifetime limit on the receipt of federally funded assistance, along with several other provisions. To enable HHS to monitor states\u2019 progress in meeting key program objectives, the law also requires states to meet new data reporting requirements. On November 20, 1997, HHS issued proposed regulations for implementing TANF in accordance with the new federal law; however, as of May 1998, these regulations had not yet been finalized."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Welfare System Before Reform", "paragraphs": ["Under AFDC, states were required to provide benefits to all economically needy families with children who applied and were eligible under federal law and whose income and assets were within state-prescribed limits. In fiscal year 1996, over $20 billion in combined federal and state funds were paid in cash assistance to a nationwide caseload that averaged about 4.6 million families a month. Within AFDC, states were required to establish welfare-to-work programs, called Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS), to ensure that AFDC families obtained the education, training, and employment that would help them avoid long-term welfare dependence. Federal matching funds for JOBS were available as a capped entitlement set at $1 billion in fiscal year 1996. Historically, many families were exempt from participating in JOBS, and less than a third of those required to participate actually were able to participate because of limited state funding. In addition, within AFDC, unlimited federal matching funds were available for states opting to provide emergency assistance for families to avoid the destitution of a child or to provide for a child\u2019s living arrangements. Emergency assistance could be authorized for up to 30 days in any 12-month period, and eligibility criteria often differed from those of the regular AFDC program. As of 1995, all states but Alaska and Mississippi had implemented emergency assistance programs, spending about $3.2 billion on these programs nationwide in fiscal year 1996. To ensure states adhered to the goals and requirements of the law governing these programs, HHS was given oversight responsibility to be exercised through its approval, review, and audit functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most States\u2019 Reform Efforts Preceded Federal Reform", "paragraphs": ["Before passage of the new federal welfare reform law, HHS had authority to waive certain statutory program requirements for AFDC, and most states had begun experimenting with various reforms intended to move more recipients from welfare to work. Between January 1987 and the passage of welfare reform in August 1996, 46 states had received approval to implement waivers affecting their AFDC and JOBS programs\u2014in some cases, statewide; in others, only in selected sites. These waiver initiatives included time limits, strengthened work requirements, and teen-parent requirements related to school attendance and living in supervised settings\u2014provisions similar to those subsequently embodied in the new federal law. (See app. II for a summary of states\u2019 waiver provisions approved before passage of the federal welfare reform act.)", "Because these waivers had been approved and implemented at different times, states were in different stages of implementing their reform efforts when the federal reform law was enacted. Some states continued their waiver programs implemented before federal reform, while other states enacted new legislation to redesign their programs after passage of the new federal law. Oregon, for example, enacted legislation in 1995 and implemented its welfare reform program statewide in July 1996. In contrast, California did not pass welfare reform legislation until mid-1997, with statewide implementation of its new program effective in January 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Provisions of Federal Reform", "paragraphs": ["The 1996 federal welfare reform law made sweeping changes to the nation\u2019s cash assistance program for needy families with children. Title I of the law ended the entitlement of families to welfare benefits and replaced the AFDC program, including JOBS and emergency assistance, with block grants to the states under TANF. The fixed amounts of states\u2019 grants under the new law are based on the amount of their grants received in specified fiscal years under prior law, supplemented for population increases under certain circumstances. For fiscal year 1997, federal grants available to the states ranged from $21.8 million in Wyoming to over $3.7 billion in California, totaling $16.7 billion nationwide. With respect to state funding, the federal reform law included a \u201cmaintenance-of-effort\u201d provision requiring states to provide 75 to 80 percent of their historic level of funding. Subsequent legislation provided additional federal funds totaling $3 billion over 2 years for Welfare-to-Work Grants to be allocated to states for increased support of activities helping to place and keep individuals in unsubsidized jobs.", "Federal law also makes federal funding available to states for child care subsidies for low-income families, authorizing $2.9 billion for fiscal year 1997 and up to $3.7 billion in the year 2002. Under the new reform law, states are required to ensure that a significant percentage of these funds are used to provide child care assistance to current or potential TANF recipients.", "The federal welfare reform law also made significant changes to Medicaid\u2014a federal/state-funded program that provides medical assistance to low-income families. Before welfare reform, AFDC recipients were automatically enrolled in Medicaid on the basis of their eligibility for cash assistance under AFDC. The new law severed the connection between eligibility standards for Medicaid and cash assistance, allowing states to set their own eligibility standards for Medicaid within certain parameters. However, most families who would have been eligible for Medicaid before welfare reform continue to qualify for services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Moving From Dependency to Self-Reliance", "paragraphs": ["Because of congressional concern that welfare had become a way of life for some recipients, a key purpose of the new law was to promote work over welfare and self-reliance over dependency. In support of this goal, the law provides that states must require able-bodied recipients to participate in work or work-related activities and must impose a 5-year lifetime limit on federal assistance.", "States must require adults in families receiving TANF-funded assistance to participate in work or work-related activities after receiving assistance for 24 months, or sooner, as defined by the state. If recipients fail to participate as required, states must at least reduce the families\u2019 grant and may opt to terminate the grant entirely.", "To avoid financial penalties, states must ensure that a certain specified minimum percentage of their caseloads are participating in work or work-related activities each year. These percentages are referred to as \u201cminimum mandated participation rates.\u201d To count toward states\u2019 mandated rates, adult recipients in families must participate a certain minimum number of hours in work or a work-related activity as prescribed in the law\u2014such as job readiness workshops; on-the-job training; and, under certain circumstances, education. The required number of hours of participation and the percentage of a state\u2019s caseload that must participate to meet mandated rates increase over time, as shown in table 1.1.", "Finally, to help ensure the temporary nature of assistance and to provide further impetus for moving recipients to self-reliance, the law prohibits the use of TANF funds to provide assistance for families with adults who have received assistance for more than 5 years, cumulative over their lifetimes. Families with no adult receiving assistance (commonly referred to as \u201cchild-only\u201d cases) are not subject to this limit, and up to 20 percent of a state\u2019s average monthly caseload may be exempt on the basis of hardship or having been subjected to domestic violence. States with time-limit waivers inconsistent with these provisions may delay implementing the 5-year lifetime limit until their waivers expire. Also, states may opt to continue to provide assistance beyond the 5-year limit using state funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Out-of-Wedlock Pregnancies", "paragraphs": ["To address concerns about the growing number of children born to unwed mothers and the impact on welfare caseloads, another key purpose of the new law was to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies and encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. To this end, the law included provisions requiring HHS and the states to establish goals and take action to reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, especially among teens, and to provide annual progress reports to the Congress beginning this month.", "In addition, citing studies that indicate that the increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls has been particularly severe and linked to predatory sexual practices of men who were significantly older, the law also requires states to conduct programs to provide education and training on the problem of statutory rape. To expand their reach to males, these programs are to be provided through law enforcement agencies, the education system, and other relevant counseling services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Increased State Flexibility and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Instead of prescribing in detail how programs are to be structured, the new law authorizes states to use their block grants in any manner reasonably calculated to accomplish the purposes of TANF. For example, states are allowed to set forth their own criteria for defining who will be eligible and what assistance and services will be available, provided states ensure fair and equitable treatment. States may opt to deny assistance altogether for noncitizens, drug felons, minor teen parents, or those determined to be able to work. Alternatively, these groups could be provided a different array of assistance and services funded by TANF or a separate state-funded program. States may also choose when to require adults to participate in work activities, what types of activities are allowed, whom to grant good cause for failure to participate, and whether or not to terminate grants to entire families for noncompliance.", "The law balanced this increase in state flexibility, however, with an increase in state accountability for working toward the goals of reform and HHS\u2019 responsibilities for tracking state performance and family outcomes. To enable HHS to rank the states annually on performance and make decisions concerning bonuses and penalties, states are required to submit a detailed quarterly data report. Using the state-reported data, HHS is required to rank the states annually according to the most and least successful work programs, taking into account (1) placements in long-term private sector jobs, (2) overall caseload reductions, (3) diversion of individuals from applying for and receiving assistance, (4) the number of children living in poverty, and (5) the amount of federal assistance provided to the state. HHS is also required to rank the states annually on the basis of the percentage of out-of-wedlock births in families receiving assistance and the reductions in the percentage of out-of-wedlock births from the prior year.", "These state-reported data also provide the basis for awarding financial bonuses to the states to promote key program objectives. The federal reform law provides $200 million per year for 5 years for bonuses to reward states with high performance in achieving the goals of TANF. States may be awarded bonuses in amounts up to 5 percent of their grants in fiscal years 1999 through 2003. The law also provides $100 million per year for 4 years for bonuses to reward states that demonstrate net decreases in the number of out-of-wedlock births. Up to five states may be awarded these bonuses of $20 million in fiscal years 1999 through 2002. (If fewer than five states qualify, bonuses are increased to $25 million.) The law specifies that the reduction in the number of out-of-wedlock births is to be determined for the most recent 2-year period for which such information is available and that only those states with no increase in abortion rates since 1995 are eligible for the bonuses.", "Data from the quarterly report are also to be used to determine whether or not the state will be assessed a penalty. The law, as amended, specifies 14 grounds for penalties, including failure to meet the maintenance-of-effort state funding requirement, failure to satisfy the minimum mandated participation rates, failure to implement the 5-year lifetime time limit, and failure to submit a quarterly data report. The total penalty in a single year can range up to 25 percent of a state\u2019s grant. (See app. III for a description of all 14 penalties.) Under some circumstances, HHS may determine that a state has \u201creasonable cause\u201d for failing to meet some requirement and will not impose a penalty. Proposed regulations indicate, however, that if a state diverts cases to separate state programs or is continuing with inconsistent provisions under waiver, it may not be able to avoid a penalty through a reasonable cause exception.", "In addition to the quarterly report, states are required to submit their child poverty rates annually, along with a corrective action plan if the rate increases by 5 percent or more from the prior year. And beginning in 1999, HHS is required to submit annual reports on the circumstances of families reaching their time limits and families headed by teen parents.", "To ensure evaluation of states\u2019 programs under welfare reform, HHS is mandated to conduct research on the costs and benefits of operating different state programs, including effects on welfare dependency, illegitimacy, teen pregnancy, employment rates, child well-being, and any other area deemed appropriate. HHS must also evaluate any innovative approaches it assists states in developing and may help fund states\u2019 evaluation efforts.

Under prior law, limited numbers of AFDC recipients were referred to the JOBS program to prepare for and accept employment. Beginning under waivers and culminating with the enactment of TANF, the AFDC and JOBS programs have been replaced by a single, integrated program. Now, in many states, when people apply for welfare, they are simultaneously enrolling in a welfare-to-work program, and welfare offices across the country are being transformed into job placement centers. In an effort to place individuals as quickly as possible into jobs, these new work-focused welfare programs generally require participation in activities leading more directly to employment, require a higher percentage of recipients to participate, require participation sooner, and impose more stringent sanctions for failure to participate.", "In implementing this transformation of welfare programs to a more work-focused approach, states have encountered numerous challenges. For example, increasing the percentage of recipients required to participate in work-related activities has required states to change caseworker roles from emphasizing eligibility determination to helping recipients address barriers to work by providing more and different services to those previously exempted from work requirements. How states have changed their programs to meet these challenges is discussed further in chapter 3."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recipients Are Being Required to Participate in Activities Tied to Employment", "paragraphs": ["Under most states\u2019 welfare reform programs, recipients are expected to participate in work or work-related activities leading more directly to employment, such as job readiness and job search. In response to TANF\u2019s restrictions on the types of activities that count toward minimum mandated participation rates, some states are shifting participants from education and training activities to community service.

The typical sequence of activities involved initial assessment; development of an \u201cemployability plan\u201d; then assignment to an activity such as education, job skills training, job readiness, or job development and placement. Under states\u2019 reform programs, and consistent with the new federal law, greater emphasis is being placed on employment. Many states now require recipients to \u201ctest the job market\u201d for a specified length of time before investing in costly assessments or vocational training programs\u2014an approach commonly referred to as \u201cwork first.\u201d Under these \u201cwork first\u201d programs, recipients typically are provided an orientation and assistance in searching for a job; they may also receive some readiness training. Only those unable to find a job after several weeks of job search are then assessed for placement in other activities, such as remedial education or vocational training.", "Among our case study states, all but Louisiana have adopted a \u201cwork first\u201d approach. In Oregon, officials told us that among those participating in a 4-week job readiness and job search program, 40 to 50 percent report finding jobs by the end of the 4 weeks. Even in sites such as Santa Clara County, California, that had traditionally placed a strong emphasis on education and training under JOBS, officials told us they have found that approach unsuccessful in moving recipients into work and self-sufficiency and that they, too, have embraced the \u201cwork first\u201d approach. While encouraging recipients to find jobs as quickly as possible, however, Santa Clara officials said they have continued to emphasize the importance of education. They estimated that about 25 percent of the county\u2019s recipients are able to find jobs with a livable wage, but as many as 75 percent will need to combine work with further training to obtain the skills necessary to move toward self-sufficiency. In Louisiana, officials told us that they have not adopted a \u201cwork first\u201d approach because a large percentage of their caseload has very low education and skill levels and is not job-ready."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Activities That Count Toward Participation Have Been Restricted", "paragraphs": ["The increased emphasis on employment is reflected in the new federal law\u2019s list of activities that count toward minimum mandated participation rates\u2014a more restricted list than that allowed previously under JOBS (see fig. 2.1). For example, under JOBS, families could participate in job readiness and education-oriented activities indefinitely, with few restrictions. Under TANF, however, job readiness activities may count for no more than 6 weeks per recipient; vocational educational training cannot count for more than 12 months for any individual; and education other than high school or its equivalent counts only if it is directly related to employment. In addition, not more than 30 percent of the number of individuals counted as engaged in work may be in vocational education or attending school as teen parents.", "Federal law also specifies the minimum number of hours families must participate to count toward the mandated rates. The adult recipient in a single-parent family must participate in countable activities an average of at least 20 hours a week (escalating to 25 hours in 1999, and to 30 hours in 2000 and thereafter). Adult recipients in a two-parent family must participate for a combined total of at least 35 hours a week.

Available 1994 data from the previous JOBS program compared with more recent data under TANF indicate that assignment to job placement activities has increased while assignment to education and training activities, including vocational education, has decreased in most states. While these data reflect various months and may not be comparable across states, they provide a rough indication of the shift taking place within each state. Among our seven case study states, this shift is best exemplified by Connecticut and Louisiana, where the percentage assigned to job placement activities increased more than fourfold between 1994 and 1997, not including those who found unsubsidized jobs (see fig. 2.2). The shift is least apparent in Oregon, which had begun implementing reforms in 1992 and already had a large percentage of recipients assigned to job placement activities in the base year, and in California, which had not yet implemented its reform program but nevertheless doubled the percentage assigned to job placement by 1997.", "All states had increased the percentage of active participants assigned to job placement activities as compared with education and training activities, although the types of work-related activities assigned those not working in unsubsidized jobs varied greatly among our case study states (see table 2.1). For example, in 1997, all states except Louisiana had assigned more than a quarter of their active participants to job search and job readiness activities. In Maryland, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin, over half the active participants not in unsubsidized jobs had been assigned to such activities.", "In addition, Connecticut, Louisiana, and Maryland had assigned a significant proportion of participants to community service and work experience placements. According to a Louisiana official, many participants were being shifted from education and training activities to community work experience because of TANF provisions that limit the extent to which recipient participation in education and training activities can be counted toward meeting the state\u2019s mandated participation rate. Louisiana officials told us that many of their recipients need remedial training before they can be assigned to vocational education programs, however, and voiced concerns about the limitations TANF places on counting recipients assigned to these activities. In contrast, other states placing fewer recipients in community service activities told us they viewed such placements as a last resort, useful only to provide recipients with little or no work history the necessary experience to obtain an unsubsidized job, or to comply with a state requirement to use such placements once a certain length of time had elapsed without finding a job.", "Offering subsidies to employers who hire and pay wages to recipients or who provide on-the-job training is one option states can use to help create job opportunities and move recipients into work when more training is needed. In the past, however, such programs have been criticized for subsidizing jobs for participants who could have been hired into unsubsidized jobs. While 37 states indicated in their TANF plans as of November 1997 that they would provide employer subsidies, we found such subsidized employment placements were not widely used. Among our five case study states with subsidized employment programs (California, Maryland, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin), state officials told us widespread use of such placements is generally not encouraged because they are expensive and often difficult to negotiate with employers. Maryland had implemented only a small pilot project using subsidized employment in the city of Baltimore, while Texas had implemented a project only in the Corpus Christi area. According to Texas officials, an evaluation of the Corpus Christi project will be completed before the project is expanded to other areas. Oregon had used subsidized employment placements most frequently but, even so, had assigned less than 10 percent of its participants to this activity in 1997.", "To the extent that such placements are used, job developers generally screen recipients carefully and attempt to secure positions that are likely to result in the recipient\u2019s being hired to an unsubsidized position. For example, Oregon\u2019s \u201cJOBS Plus\u201d program subsidizes employers to hire recipients who lack job skills and experience, but it is a relatively small part of Oregon\u2019s welfare-to-work program. Job developers prescreen recipients before referring them for specific openings; nevertheless, only about half the placements result in unsubsidized jobs, and few big companies are willing to participate in the program. Similarly, Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cTrial Jobs\u201d component is designed for certain clients who lack sufficient work experience to be able to move directly to unsubsidized employment. Trial Jobs reimburses employers up to $300 per month to offset some of the initial costs of new employee training and supervision. Such on-the-job training placements are made for up to 3 months, with a possible 3-month extension in some circumstances, and are expected to result in unsubsidized employment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few States Are Opting to Exceed Minimum Hourly Requirements", "paragraphs": ["At least initially, most states adopted the federal minimum standard of 20 hours of participation per week for most recipients in single-parent families, and 35 hours of participation for two-parent families. However, a few states have used the flexibility under TANF to increase the number of hours recipients in single-parent families are required to participate to better reflect hours comparable to full-time employment. For example, in Wisconsin, program requirements call for adult recipients to be assigned up to 40 hours of activities per week, and families receive grant amounts that are prorated by applying a sanction for hours missed without good cause multiplied by the federal minimum wage. In Oregon, the goal is to require 40 hours per week for every adult recipient, but those in certain situations are sometimes allowed to do less. California requires its counties to increase the number of hours of participation per week from 20 to 32 by July 1999, or sooner at county option. Among the three counties we visited, only Fresno had opted to require 32 hours immediately. As discussed further in chapter 4, some state officials noted that tracking actual hours of participation in the various activities has created a huge increase in workload for staff."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "More Recipients Are Being Required to Participate", "paragraphs": ["Under states\u2019 welfare reform programs, a higher percentage of adult recipients are being required to participate in work activities and find jobs. Before reform, parents or caretaker recipients caring for a child under age 3 (or under age 1, at state option), along with those living in remote areas or with mental or physical impairments, were generally not required to participate in JOBS. Now, many states\u2019 reform programs have lowered the age-of-youngest-child exemption to 1 year or even younger and require other traditionally exempt recipients to address their barriers, engage in work activities, and look for jobs.", "The new federal reform law generally allows states to exempt whomever they choose from participating in their welfare-to-work programs.However, virtually all adult recipients except for single custodial parents caring for a child under 1 year of age are to be included in the calculation of the state\u2019s participation rate. As a result, the extent to which states exempt recipients for other reasons could affect states\u2019 ability to meet prescribed minimum participation rates and avoid financial penalties. Nevertheless, nearly all states are continuing to provide exemptions from participation requirements under some circumstances. In a shift away from blanket exemptions of broad categories of recipients, however, about half the states are making such determinations on a case-by-case basis or describing exemptions as deferrals, delays, or temporary exclusions that will end with resolution of the problem.", "Among our seven case study states, the percentage of adult recipients required to participate in work activities increased from an average of 44.2 percent in 1994 to 64.8 percent in 1997 (see fig. 2.3).

Percentages were lowest in states such as California, where the state\u2019s welfare reform program had not yet been implemented, and Texas, where the age-of-youngest-child exemption is higher than in most other states.", "Some case study states are requiring recipients with significant barriers to participate but are allowing a broader range of activities and fewer hours of participation than specified under TANF. For example, in California, Oregon, and Wisconsin, program rules allow recipients with a mental health or substance abuse problem to be assigned initially to treatment or counseling programs, and those with very young children to be assigned fewer than 20 hours of participation per week. In California, as long as such recipients comply with their assigned requirements, they are eligible to continue to receive assistance under TANF up to the 5-year time limit, but they are not counted when determining the state\u2019s participation rate. In Oregon, proposed rules would allow such recipients to receive assistance under TANF as well as count toward the participation rate because of the state\u2019s waiver, which will not expire until the year 2002.

Two of our seven case study states have adopted the 24-month federal maximum (Louisiana and Maryland), and five require recipients to participate immediately if they are not exempt (California, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin).

Under JOBS, if a recipient failed to comply with work requirements without good cause, grants could be reduced only by the amount attributable to the noncomplying recipient, and conciliation processes were required to try to secure cooperation before the sanction could be imposed. Now, in many states, program rules call for terminating the entire family\u2019s grant, and conciliation processes have been streamlined or, in some cases, eliminated.", "The new federal reform law stipulates that if an adult recipient refuses to engage in work activities as assigned, the state must, at a minimum, reduce the family\u2019s grant by an amount prorated on the basis of the individual\u2019s failure to participate; the state may opt to reduce the grant more, up to and including terminating the entire family\u2019s grant. Under waivers prior to federal reform, 26 states had implemented provisions to terminate the entire family\u2019s grant for failure to participate, commonly referred to as \u201cfull family sanctions.\u201d According to a summary of state plans compiled by the Urban Institute, a total of 36 states have adopted such provisions under TANF.

Because Louisiana had only implemented its policy in March 1998, calling for a partial sanction for 3 months followed by a full-family sanction for continued failure to comply, no Louisiana families had received a full-family sanction at the time of our review. In the remaining four states, full-family sanctions had been adopted previously under waivers and had been in effect for at least a year. In these states, we found the number of cases in which full-family sanctions were imposed for failure to comply with work requirements varied widely but that the number never exceeded 1 percent of each state\u2019s total caseload per month (see table 2.2). Nationwide data on full-family sanctions imposed under TANF have not yet been issued by HHS and may differ significantly from the experiences of these states.", "The structure of states\u2019 sanction and conciliation policies varies. For example, Wisconsin\u2019s policy requires providing cash assistance prorated by applying a sanction for hours missed without good cause, multiplied by the federal minimum wage, and the conciliation process has been eliminated. When initially implemented in March 1996, the policy also required providing no cash assistance if families\u2019 participation fell below 25 percent of scheduled hours. After initial implementation, a relatively high number of Wisconsin families received no cash assistance as a result of sanctions, in part, because no effort was made to contact the families and resolve any barriers to participation before denying assistance. Effective June 1997, Wisconsin eliminated the portion of its policy that required providing no cash assistance to families when participation fell below 25 percent of scheduled hours without good cause, and the number of full-family sanctions imposed has dropped significantly. In October 1997, 220 Wisconsin families received no cash assistance as a result of sanctions, compared with an average of about 550 per month during initial implementation. Wisconsin officials told us they believe their policy of reducing grants on a prorated basis for work hours assigned and not performed and eliminating the conciliation process before imposing sanctions work well as motivators that mirror the real world.", "In contrast, county officials in Maryland told us their rigorous conciliation processes resulted in fewer terminations of families\u2019 grants, and Oregon officials told us they had terminated very few grants for the same reason.", "While the threat of grant termination served as a motivator to some extent, welfare office workers in these states said that conciliation processes take the teeth out of sanctions if they provide families an opportunity to keep their grants simply by agreeing to cooperate. Workers said they hoped their conciliation processes would be changed to shorten the process and to prevent recipients from \u201cgaming the system\u201d by agreeing to cooperate and then failing to do so.", "In Connecticut, relatively few families had their grants terminated after initial implementation, primarily because of the state\u2019s program structure of graduated sanctions. While only 83 families received full-family sanctions during the first 9 months of implementation, 377 families received full-family sanctions over the next 3 months. However, more recent sanction data indicate that the number of sanctions may be subsiding now that the program has been fully implemented. In May 1997, only three cases received full-family sanctions, compared with an average of as many as 126 a month earlier in the implementation process. The early peak in the number of sanctions most likely reflects the conversion of the state\u2019s existing caseload to the new program rules, as well as initial doubts among both recipients and caseworkers that grants actually would be cut off.", "In imposing full-family sanctions, on the one hand, state officials maintain that if families are experiencing hardship caused by the loss of cash assistance, all they have to do is cooperate to have their grant reinstated. On the other hand, states have usually taken steps to address concerns raised by welfare advocacy groups about the well-being of children in families whose entire grant has been terminated for noncooperation. For example, states have generally adopted safeguards to ensure that families fully understand the implications of their actions, that services are available to help them participate, and that exemptions may be provided under certain circumstances. To ensure the children are not at risk of placement in foster care if grants are terminated, some states, such as Oregon, require a home visit before terminating a family\u2019s grant for noncooperation and may continue to pay rent and utilities directly on behalf of a family to prevent destitution.", "In other states, including three of our case study states, such concerns have resulted in continuing with only a partial reduction in grant amounts for noncooperation instead of imposing full-family sanctions. All three of these states nevertheless strengthened their sanction processes in other ways. For example, both Louisiana and Texas eliminated conciliation.", "California shortened its conciliation process and required assistance to be provided as vouchers for rent and utilities for those families sanctioned for more than 3 months. In California\u2019s San Bernardino County, families accepting a reduced grant rather than attempting to participate were automatically referred to the fraud unit for investigation of possible unreported sources of income. Despite these changes, officials we spoke with were skeptical about whether reduced grants alone would be a sufficient motivator for recipients to participate and were concerned that their inability to terminate such cases might affect their state\u2019s ability to meet minimum mandated participation rates over time.

As a result, reforms to increase incentives for families to choose work over welfare were among the first reforms that states began making under waivers. Under TANF, states are provided broad discretion in defining policies to help make work pay, such as determining how to calculate payment amounts and grant levels and whether to provide services to those not receiving monthly cash assistance.", "To be eligible for assistance, families must have income and resources below certain limits defined by the states and referred to as income standards. In determining a family\u2019s eligibility and calculating the amount of the cash assistance payment, allowances can be made for certain assets, such as a home or a car, and if a family member is employed, a portion of earned income can be excluded, or \u201cdisregarded,\u201d in the calculation.", "Under AFDC, the limits on a family\u2019s earnings, savings, and other assets were widely viewed as too low, creating a barrier to families\u2019 attempts to move toward self-reliance. For working families with incomes low enough to still qualify for assistance, after 12 months the AFDC grant would be reduced dollar for dollar for earnings, except for a $90 monthly allowance for work expenses. As a result, to help families prepare for a future without monthly assistance payments, and as part of a general move to \u201cmake work pay,\u201d many states adopted waivers to increase their asset limits and change their \u201cearnings disregard\u201d policies to allow families to keep more of their grants when working, or to keep them longer.According to states\u2019 TANF plans as of October 1997, 39 states had increased their countable asset limits, 48 states had increased their vehicle allowances, and 42 states had changed their earnings disregard policies, as compared with what was allowed under AFDC. All our case study states have implemented changes to their asset limits, vehicle allowances, or earnings disregard policies to help make work pay (see table 2.3).", "Under the new federal welfare reform law, states can also opt to allow recipients to establish individual development accounts to accumulate assets for further education, purchasing a home, or starting a business and not have these assets count in determining their eligibility for assistance. According to TANF plans as of October 1997, 22 states had opted to allow recipients to accumulate assets under restricted savings accounts of some type, including 3 of our 7 case study states: California, Louisiana, and Oregon (see table 2.3).

For example, Oregon and Wisconsin provide child care services primarily on the basis of income, regardless of an individual\u2019s status as a welfare recipient or nonrecipient, and Oregon uses state funds to make income-based medical coverage available to low-wage workers who do not meet Medicaid eligibility criteria. In states with policies to provide services on the basis of income rather than welfare status, families may no longer have an incentive to stay on welfare simply to gain better access to such services, and some families may be diverted from receiving monthly cash assistance, as discussed later in this chapter.", "Also, when clients attend orientation sessions in some states, they are presented with charts to illustrate how they could be better off working for wages than they are receiving welfare grants\u2014financially as well as psychologically.

Furthermore, those families enrolling in TANF who are determined to be \u201cjob-ready\u201d may receive case management services in addition to these other services, but they are not eligible to receive monthly cash payments (see fig. 2.6).", "Providing families assistance with job search and requiring applicants to engage in job search activities before making them eligible to receive monthly cash payments also may enable applicants to find jobs and be diverted from the welfare rolls. For example, under Texas\u2019 welfare reform program, most applicants are required to attend workforce orientations provided by the employment services agency or local workforce development board providers before they are approved to receive TANF cash payments. Applicants may access services available through the workforce centers to assist them in obtaining employment. Under Maryland\u2019s welfare reform program, applicants are required to participate in up-front job search as a condition of eligibility, and, on the basis of partial data, at least 9 percent of all job placements in fiscal year 1997 were for applicants who never received cash assistance. Under Oregon\u2019s program, most applicants are required to be engaged in job search for 30 days before being fully screened for TANF eligibility. In Wisconsin, applicants judged to be \u201cjob-ready\u201d are assigned to the unsubsidized job component and are required to engage in job search activities with no cash assistance (see fig. 2.6 above). If an applicant is unable to find work, caseworkers review the case for barriers to employment and may assign the family to another program component that would include cash assistance. In California, we found that in two of the three counties we visited, applicants were required to participate in such activities, and, if they failed to do so, their applications would not be processed or would be denied, and no cash assistance would be provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stronger Program Requirements Also Result in Diversions", "paragraphs": ["Some potential recipients are also being diverted from pursuing their applications simply by learning of the stronger work and child support enforcement requirements at orientation.

HHS data from fiscal year 1992 indicate that about 11 percent of welfare applicants failed to complete their applications after the initial orientation process. Under welfare reform, most states are strengthening their work requirements and child support requirements and imposing these requirements sooner.

In Connecticut, the Department of Social Services hired the Connecticut Business and Industry Association to determine what incentives and services would encourage small businesses to hire welfare recipients. The Association conducted pilot projects in three regions of the state and tested employer incentives, such as training subsidies and tax credits, and services, such as prescreening recipients\u2019 education and skills; peer mentoring; and hiring through the use of temporary agencies, chambers of commerce, and business consortiums.", "The lack of job growth in some locations has stimulated efforts to promote economic development.

However, California and Texas, which accounted for 96 percent of the two-parent cases in our study states, indicated that they had fallen short of meeting their required rates by wide margins.Caseworkers noted that two-parent cases often have mental health and substance abuse problems that make participation in job placement programs difficult.", "For fiscal year 1998, three of the seven states have dramatically lower required two-parent participation rates because of large declines in their two-parent caseloads.

State officials cited various reasons for the decline in two-parent caseloads, including an improving economy resulting in more two-parent families finding work; stronger work requirements; and the redefinition of two-parent families to exclude those with a disabled parent, as allowed under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. On the other hand, Connecticut and Texas, which have expanded their eligibility rules since fiscal year 1995, have experienced an increase in their two-parent caseloads and therefore may not receive any reduction in the 75-percent required participation rate for fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States Voiced Concerns Over Focus on Participation Rates", "paragraphs": ["TANF participation rates and their associated financial penalties were designed to serve as an incentive for states to increase the percentages of their caseloads participating in work activities.

These officials maintained that the law\u2019s provisions regarding countable activities and required number of hours were too restrictive and that tracking and reporting these elements to enable participation rates to be calculated was burdensome and distracted staff from helping recipients find jobs and become self-sufficient.

Moreover, how do children fare after losing assistance because their parents did not comply with new program requirements? Little information is available to begin answering such important questions.

For example, Maryland is tracking a random sample of over 2,000 families that exited welfare during the first 12 months of the state\u2019s welfare reform program (Oct. 1996 to Sept. 1997).Maryland has issued two reports with interim findings. Oregon has been tracking welfare recidivism to provide data for one of the state\u2019s performance measures: the percentage of families that remain off welfare for 18 months after case closure because of employment. California law mandates an evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of the state\u2019s welfare reform program, including effects related to employment, earnings, and self-sufficiency as well as those pertaining to child well-being, such as entries into foster care, at-risk births, school achievement, child abuse reports, and rates of child poverty.", "Data on welfare recidivism indicate that some families are returning to welfare, but it is too early to determine whether recidivism patterns differ from those under AFDC. In tracking families that left welfare because of job placements, Oregon found that 35 percent of families had returned to cash assistance sometime within 18 months but that only 10 percent were receiving cash assistance 18 months after case closure. According to Oregon officials, it sometimes takes two or three job placements before recipients are able to hold a job and remain off welfare. This is reflected by findings from an evaluation of Oregon\u2019s Post-Employment Services Demonstration, which found that after the first year of the demonstration (1994-95), 61 percent of participants were no longer at their first job because they had left for a better job, quit without other job prospects, or been fired or laid off. The 1998 Maryland study found that 19 percent of all families who left welfare returned to the rolls within 3 months and 23 percent returned within 12 months, which suggests that families who return tend to do so fairly quickly. The study also found that families whose cases were recorded as closed because they started work or because their incomes exceeded eligibility limits had significantly lower 3-month recidivism rates: 3 percent and 11 percent, respectively.", "Little is known about the well-being of children and families after they leave states\u2019 welfare reform programs. The 1998 Maryland study found that of the cases that closed during the first 9 months of the program, 51 percent of adults reported earnings in the quarter after they left welfare. The average earnings of these adults were about twice as high as Maryland\u2019s maximum cash assistance payment for a family of three. Among our case study states that tracked the average wage for job placements in 1997, wages ranged from $5.60 to $6.60 an hour. A low-wage job combined with the earned income tax credit, food stamps, and subsidized child care may lift a family above the federal poverty line, but families may continue to be hard-pressed, especially in areas with high housing costs and in states that limit transitional child care and medical assistance to 1 year. Prior research on the AFDC program has indicated that recipients on average experienced little rise in wages over time.However, Oregon officials have found some evidence in the state\u2019s welfare reform program that those placed in jobs who have remained employed have experienced a growth in wages. Oregon matched job placements with data on employer-reported wages between 1993 and 1996 and found that those who remained employed 3 years later had a wage growth averaging 14 percent per year.", "Early results from the 1998 Maryland study indicate that case closures have not been associated with significant increases in the size of foster care caseloads. Of the 3,467 children in families that left welfare in the first 11 months of the program, only 15 children (0.4 percent) were placed in foster care after their families left welfare.

While the formula for fiscal years 1999 to 2003 has not been finalized, HHS issued guidance to states in March 1998 on the performance measures that will be used for fiscal year 1998. In addition to job placements, these measures include job retention and wage progression, which would provide information on the economic stability of families after they are placed in jobs. The welfare law also directs HHS to conduct research on the benefits, effects, and costs of the state programs funded under TANF to determine effects on welfare dependency, illegitimacy, and other areas. HHS is also required to evaluate innovative programs designed to decrease welfare dependency and increase child well-being. A key element in HHS\u2019 pursuit of this research mandate is its continued funding of evaluations of state waiver programs, which assess the impacts of provisions such as time-limited assistance and work requirements.

At the same time, states are modifying their programs to better support welfare recipients in meeting these expectations, such as by expanding the role of welfare workers to include job counseling, transforming local welfare offices into job centers, enhancing support services, expanding efforts to establish partnerships with employers and other organizations, and giving local administrative entities more flexibility to tailor programs to local needs.", "The confluence of a strong national economy and the availability to most states of greater budgetary resources under TANF than they would have received under prior law has created an optimal time for states to reform their welfare programs.

As a result, even under continued favorable economic conditions, states\u2019 initial successes with moving applicants and recipients into employment will probably slow over time. In response, states will need to adjust their approaches to better enable families with a range of problems to take steps toward becoming more self-supporting. Although states can exempt up to 20 percent of TANF families from the federal time limit on assistance on the basis of hardship, even with more intensive supports, there may be some recipients who cannot be placed in the workforce because of the severity of their problems. In addition, there may be some adults whose lack of compliance with program requirements, for whatever reasons, puts their children at risk of a range of negative outcomes.

While they could be eligible for unemployment insurance, some could once again apply for cash assistance after their unemployment insurance ran out.
