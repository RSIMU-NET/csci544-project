However, GAO identified opportunities for DOD to enhance its efforts in several areas.", "DOD lacks complete and consistent data on historic properties. Specifically, GAO identified data gaps and discrepancies between the data reported at the installation and department levels for fiscal year 2017. For example, for one installation, GAO found that 150 more historic properties were listed in its installation data than were listed in department-level data for that installation. In November 2018, GAO reported on issues concerning DOD's data and made recommendations to improve the data quality. DOD concurred and reported actions it plans to take to improve data quality. Doing so would help DOD to ensure it has complete information on properties of historic significance and prevent further data discrepancies.", "DOD has limited visibility of privatized homes that could be historic. When the military departments transferred military homes to private developers, DOD officials said they also transferred the responsibility to identify and evaluate homes for historic significance to the private developers. However, the military departments do not verify that private developers are doing so. Private developers at seven of the nine installations with privatized housing that GAO visited said they do not identify or evaluate homes for historic significance. Taking steps to verify that private developers carry out this responsibility could help DOD ensure that renovations or repairs are not made to privatized properties that could compromise their historic nature.", "Additionally, DOD does not routinely assess the condition of its historic properties and a lack of guidance on training could hamper maintenance and preservation efforts. First, inventories of historic properties, including physical inspections, required every 3 years, are not being conducted at six of the 10 installations GAO visited.

Second, while each installation GAO visited had an established process for approving maintenance work orders, DOD officials reported problems with the maintenance of historic properties at these installations, ranging from maintenance personnel not addressing issues, to maintenance being conducted improperly. At nine of the 10 installations GAO visited, individuals who work in historic buildings said that they believed maintenance personnel did not know what maintenance could or could not be done to the historic buildings, and installation officials expressed concerns about a lack of training related to historic preservation.

We also met with U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers and DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services to further  understand their roles in historic property maintenance. We interviewed  major developers who have, under the Military Housing Privatization  Initiative, leased military housing from DOD and analyzed the process  that is used to manage and maintain historic properties.

Five out of  the 10 cultural resource managers noted that maintaining a good working  relationship with their SHPO made the consultation process more  efficient. Officials we interviewed for two of the four SHPOs stated that  being involved early in the consultation process with installation officials is  more efficient and makes historic preservation an easier process by  enabling them to receive feedback on proposed projects on historic  properties, approval of programmatic agreements, and concurrence on  their Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plans (ICRMPs) in a  timely manner. For example, DOD officials at one military installation said  they were able to use non-historic materials during renovations on a  historic property in place of more costly period-accurate materials  because the agreement with that SHPO facilitated such a solution.  According to officials at this installation, SHPOs generally prefer the use  of period-accurate materials on historic properties when conducting  repairs and renovations. The officials, however, stated that they began  consultations with the SHPO early in the process and were able to reach  agreement that the historic nature of the property would not be adversely  affected if non-historic materials were used. See figure 3 below.", "Officials from two of the four SHPOs said that due to positive working  relationships between the installation and the SHPO, a programmatic  agreement has been put in place to help manage the installation\u2019s historic  properties. These programmatic agreements can be used to address  routine maintenance activities for historic properties that can be carried  out by the installation with no further consultation with the SHPO. In the  four states that we visited, SHPO officials said they executed  programmatic agreements with some installations that can save time and  reduce the number of required consultation meetings. According to  officials from two of the four SHPOs we interviewed, having programmatic  agreements in place can increase the efficiency of the historic  preservation process. Generally, these programmatic agreements can  include the following:", "Standard operating procedures. Programmatic agreements can  include a number of routine maintenance plans pre-approved by the  SHPO (such as the replacement of historic windows, repairing leaking  historic roofs, and painting historic buildings) that an installation  cultural resource manager can then follow without having to go  through the consultation process.", "Inventories of relevant properties. Programmatic agreements can  include inventories of historic properties that are relevant to the  agreement. Generally, the procedures outlined in the programmatic  agreement would apply to all of the properties listed in the inventory.", "Dispute resolution and emergency plans. Programmatic agreements  can also include dispute resolution mechanisms between parties to  the agreement and contingency plans for the maintenance and repair  of historic properties in the event on an emergency.", "DOD Instruction 4715.16 on cultural resource management states that  installations should adapt and reuse existing structures at their installation  before disposal, new construction, or leasing. Installations typically  consult with the SHPO before renovation work can proceed on historic  properties, but, according to officials at one installation, alternative  solutions can be reached if there is a good working relationship. In the  figure below, at one military installation we visited, a historic property  formerly used by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  and now used by the installation is in the process of being renovated and  converted into additional office space. The concrete dome was used to  test the aerodynamics of some of NASA\u2019s satellite and spaceship  components and is being converted into a new conference room after the  SHPO approved the installation\u2019s plan. See figure 4 below.", "While all of the installation cultural resource managers we spoke to told  us they regularly communicate with their SHPO and five of these cultural  resource managers said that good working relationships with the SHPO  made the consultation process more efficient, installation officials may still  experience challenges when trying to address historic preservation  concerns. For example, maintenance officials at four of the 10  installations expressed some concerns about a backlog of consultations  due in part to the increased time that they felt it takes to conduct these  consultations. According to these officials, consultation backlogs caused  delays to maintenance projects on historic properties at their installations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: DOD Installation Maintenance and Work Order Review Processes", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials from every military service stated that each installation has  a process for reviewing maintenance requests and work orders, including  those involving historic properties. These procedures, articulated in  installations\u2019 Integrated Cultural Resource Management Plans (ICRMPs),  vary by installation. For example, at seven of the 10 installations we  visited, the ICRMPs state that all maintenance requests and work orders  are reviewed by a board (or other body of internal stakeholders)  composed of maintenance personnel, cultural resources staff (including  the cultural resources manager), and other installation personnel. Officials  from the military departments said that these boards are responsible for,  among other duties, regularly identifying maintenance requests and work  orders that affect historic properties and ensuring that the proper steps  are carried out before addressing a maintenance request. Decisions by  the board, results of SHPO consultations, and programmatic agreement  requirements are then, according to officials from the military  departments, passed down to maintenance personnel before they begin  work on the historic property. At two of the other installations we visited,  the installations\u2019 department of public works reviews all maintenance  requests and work orders, and at the remaining installation, the cultural  resources manager reviews them, according to installation officials.", "During our visits to the military installations, cultural resource managers  from eight of the 10 installations stated that they play a role in their  installation\u2019s maintenance request/work order review process and that  maintenance personnel are typically included in the process. For  example, one installation we visited set up a work induction board  composed of staff from the installation\u2019s Environmental Security Division  (which handles cultural resources), maintenance staff, and other internal  stakeholders. The senior official within the Environmental Security  Division at this installation said the board meets on a weekly basis to  determine whether proposed projects (such as maintenance requests and  work orders) will affect historic properties at the installation. If the project  involves a historic property, the installation\u2019s cultural resources manager  becomes involved and determines the extent of the affect to the  property\u2019s historic nature. This senior official also told us that the board  also checks in regularly on ongoing projects and monitors work being  done on historic properties. Officials at another installation we visited said  they treat any building that is aged 50 or older in their database as  historic and the maintenance division sends every new project to their  installation\u2019s historic preservation division to ensure a review of potential  impacts of the maintenance requests or work orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Brian Lepore, Director (retired);  Maria Storts, Assistant Director; Whitney Allen; Ronnie Bergman; Aaron  Chua; Christopher Gezon; Alexandra Gonzalez; Lori Kmetz; Amie Lesser;  Emily Martin; Natalia Pe\u00f1a; Clarice Ransom; Jodie Sandel; Monica  Savoy; and John Van Schaik made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["High-Risk Series: Substantial Efforts Needed to Achieve Greater  Progress on High-Risk Areas.
