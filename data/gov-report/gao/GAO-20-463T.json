VA projects demand for long-term care will continue to increase, driven in part by growing numbers of aging veterans and veterans with service-connected disabilities. Expenditures for long-term care are projected to double by 2037, as shown below. According to VA officials, VA plans to expand veterans' access to noninstitutional programs, when appropriate, to prevent or delay nursing home care and to reduce costs.", "VA currently faces three key challenges meeting the growing demand for long-term care: workforce shortages, geographic alignment of care (particularly for veterans in rural areas), and difficulty meeting veterans' needs for specialty care. VA's Geriatrics and Extended Care office (GEC) recognizes these challenges and has developed some plans to address them. However, GEC has not established measurable goals for these efforts, such as specific staffing targets for programs with waitlists or specific targets for providing telehealth to veterans in rural areas.

Veterans\u2014like millions of  other Americans\u2014rely on long-term care to help meet their health and  personal care needs. Long-term care can address a broad spectrum of  needs, from providing occasional help around the house to extensive,  round-the-clock clinical care. VA provides or pays for long-term care  through a range of institutional and noninstitutional programs for eligible  veterans. Institutional programs, such as nursing homes, typically provide  acute skilled nursing care in a residential facility. Noninstitutional  programs, such as the Home-Based Primary Care program, provide care  to veterans in their homes or communities. In fiscal year 2018, VA  provided or paid for long-term care for over 500,000 veterans.", "As one of the largest health care systems in the United States, VA faces  challenges similar to other health care providers when seeking to meet  the growing need for long-term care as the U.S. population ages \u2013 for  example shortages in nursing assistants and home health aides that are  critical for supporting long-term care programs. VA recognizes it faces  challenges meeting the demand for long-term care and has taken some  steps to address these challenges in its strategic planning process, for  example by proposing to expand access to long-term care services  through telehealth.", "My testimony today highlights key findings from our February 2020 report,  which described the (1) use of and spending for VA long-term care, and (2) challenges VA faces to meet veterans\u2019 demand for long-term care and  examines VA\u2019s plans to address those challenges. We made three  recommendations in our report aimed at strengthening VA\u2019s efforts to  address long-term care challenges. VA concurred with our  recommendations.", "To describe the use of and spending for VA long-term care, we reviewed  VA data on the utilization of and obligations for long-term care for fiscal  years 2014 through 2018 and projections of utilization and expenditures  developed by VA\u2019s Enrollee Health Care Projection Model (EHCPM) for  fiscal years 2017 through 2037. To discuss the challenges VA faces in  meeting veterans\u2019 demand for long-term care, we reviewed relevant VA  documents and interviewed VA officials about VA\u2019s capacity to provide  long-term care, including officials from VA\u2019s Geriatrics and Extended Care  office (GEC) which oversees the long-term care programs, and officials  from the Office of Policy and Planning.

A veteran\u2019s  eligibility for fully or partially covered nursing home care is determined by  the veteran\u2019s priority for care, which is generally based on the veteran\u2019s  service-connected disability status. VA must cover the full cost of nursing  home care for veterans who need this care for a service-connected  disability and for veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 70  percent or more. Veterans\u2019 placement into particular long-term care  programs may depend on their clinical needs, disability ratings,  preferences, and the availability of VA programs. When funds are limited,  the agency may prioritize program placement based on veterans\u2019 service- connected disability ratings.

Officials also noted that expanding veterans\u2019  access to noninstitutional care programs is less costly than institutional  care, and veterans prefer to delay or reduce the amount of institutional  care they receive.

GEC officials told us that  this fragmentation hinders standardization and the ability to get  veterans the appropriate care.", "VA also identified that VAMCs use different approaches to assess the  amount of noninstitutional long-term care services veterans need.  While GEC has developed a tool to improve the consistency in these  determinations, VA has not required the tool be used in all VAMCs, as  of October 2019. As a result, decisions about the amount of services  veterans receive may vary by VAMC.", "To address these issues, we recommended that GEC leadership set time  frames for and implement (1) a consistent GEC structure at the VAMC  level and (2) VAMC-wide standardization of the tool for assessing  noninstitutional program needs of veterans.
