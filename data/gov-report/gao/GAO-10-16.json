TARP is still a work in progress, and many uncertainties and challenges remain. For example, while some CPP participants had repurchased over $70 billion in preferred shares and warrants as of September 25, 2009, whether Treasury will fully recoup TARP assistance to the automobile industry and American International Group Inc., among others, remains uncertain. Moreover, other programs, such as the Public-Private Investment Program and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) are still in varying stages of implementation. As of September 25, 2009, Treasury had disbursed almost $364 billion in TARP funds; however, Treasury has yet to update its projected use of funds for most programs in light of current market conditions, program participation rates, and repurchases. Without more current estimates about expected uses of the remaining funds, Treasury's ability to plan for and effectively execute the next steps of the program will be limited. Amid concerns about the direction and transparency of TARP, the new administration has attempted to provide a more strategic direction for using the remaining funds. TARP has moved from investment-based initiatives to programs aimed at stabilizing the securitization markets and preserving homeownership, and most recently at providing assistance to community banks and small businesses. While some programs, such as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, appear to have generated market interest, others, such as HAMP, face ongoing implementation and operational challenges. Related to transparency, Treasury has taken a number of steps to improve communication with the public and Congress, including launching a Web site and preparing to hire a communications director for OFS to support these efforts. Treasury has also made significant progress in establishing and staffing OFS; however, it must continue to focus on filling critical leadership positions, including the Chief Homeownership Preservation Officer and Chief Investment Officer, with permanent staff. Treasury's network of contractors and financial agents that support TARP administration and operations has grown from 11 to 52. While Treasury has an appropriate infrastructure in place, it must remain vigilant in managing and monitoring conflicts of interests that may arise with the use of private sector sources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About a year ago, when the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008  (the act) that authorized the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was  enacted, the U.S. financial system was facing the most severe financial  crisis since the Great Depression. The crisis, which threatened the  stability of the financial system and the solvency of many financial  institutions, prompted the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to  request and Congress to authorize Treasury to buy or guarantee up to $700  billion of the \u201ctroubled assets\u201d that were deemed to be at the heart of the  crisis, including mortgages and mortgage-based securities, and any other  financial instrument Treasury determined it needed to purchase to help  stabilize the financial system.", "When the act was signed on October 3, 2008, financial markets were in  significant turmoil. The dramatic correction in the U.S. housing market  had precipitated a decline in the price of financial assets associated with  housing, in particular mortgage assets based on subprime loans that lost  value as the housing boom ended and the market underwent a dramatic  correction. Some institutions found themselves so exposed that they were  threatened with failure\u2014and some failed\u2014because they were unable to  raise the necessary capital as the value of their portfolios declined. Other  institutions, ranging from government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) such  as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to Wall Street firms, were left holding  \u201ctoxic\u201d or \u201clegacy\u201d assets that became increasingly difficult to value, were  illiquid, and potentially had little worth. Moreover, investors not only  stopped buying securities backed by mortgages but also became reluctant  to buy securities backed by many other types of assets. Because of  uncertainty about the financial condition and solvency of financial entities,  the prices banks charged each other for funds rose dramatically, and  interbank lending effectively came to a halt. The resulting credit crunch  made the financing on which businesses and individuals depend  increasingly difficult to obtain as cash-strapped banks held on to their  assets. By late summer of 2008, the potential ramifications of the financial  crisis ranged from the continued failure of financial institutions to  increased losses of individual savings and corporate investments and  further tightening of credit that would exacerbate the emerging global  economic slowdown that was beginning to take shape.", "The act requires GAO to report at least every 60 days on the status of  TARP. As the act required, our reports have focused on (1) findings  resulting from our oversight of TARP\u2019s performance in meeting the  purposes of the act; (2) the financial condition and internal controls of  TARP, its representatives, and agents; (3) the characteristics of both asset  purchases and the disposition of assets acquired, including any related  commitments that are entered into; (4) TARP\u2019s efficiency in using the  funds appropriated for the program\u2019s operation; (5) TARP\u2019s compliance  with applicable laws and regulations; (6) efforts to prevent, identify, and  minimize conflicts of interest of those involved in TARP\u2019s operations; and  (7) the efficacy of contracting procedures.", "This report assesses the program\u2019s impact over the last year.

In the  interviews, officials discussed their processes for recruiting individuals  with the skill sets and competencies needed to administer TARP, including  steps taken to find permanent replacements to fill key leadership  positions. To examine changes in the composition of staff since the office  was established, we reviewed past GAO reports on TARP and various  documents that OFS provided to us, including OFS\u2019s updated  organizational chart.

To  assess OFS\u2019s processes for (1) management and oversight of contractors\u2019  and financial agents\u2019 performance, and (2) managing conflicts of interest  of contractors and financial agents supporting TARP administration and  operations, we reviewed applicable documents that had become available  from OFS since our June 2009 report.

We consulted Treasury officials and other experts and analyzed available  data sources and the academic literature. We selected a set of indicators  that offered perspectives on different facets of credit and financial  markets, including perceptions of risk, cost of credit, and flows of credit to  businesses and consumers. We assessed the reliability of the data upon  which the indicators were based and found that, despite certain  limitations, they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To update the  indicators in this report, we primarily used data from Thomson Reuters  Datastream, a financial statistics database. As these data are widely used,  we conducted only a limited review of the information but ensured that  the trends we found were consistent with other research. We also relied  on data from Inside Mortgage Finance, Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the  Chicago Board Options Exchange, the Securities Industry and Financial  Markets Association, and Global Insight. We have relied on data from  these sources for past reports and determined that, considered together,  they are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of presenting and analyzing  trends in financial markets. The data from Treasury\u2019s survey of lending by  the largest CPP recipients (as of July 31, 2009, the latest available survey)  are based on internal reporting from participating institutions, and the  definitions of loan categories may vary across banks. Because these data  are unique, we are not able to benchmark the origination levels against  historical lending or seasonal patterns at the institutions. Based on  discussions with Treasury and our review, we found that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of documenting trends in lending.  Lastly, we collected data on loan balances from the Consolidated Financial  Statements for Bank Holding Companies Y-9C Report Forms, the primary  analytical tool that regulators use to monitor financial institutions. We  verified that the input process did not result in data entry errors. Because  the Y-9C is the primary source for balance sheet data and can be  corroborated to some extent by audited financial statements, we  conducted only a limited review of this data.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to October 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Within 2 weeks of  enactment, however, following similar action by several foreign  governments and central banks, Treasury\u2014through the newly established  OFS\u2014announced that it would make $250 billion available to U.S.  financial institutions through purchases of preferred stock to provide  additional capital that would help enable the institutions to continue  lending. This effort was coordinated with a number of foreign  governments as part of a global effort to stabilize financial markets. In the  United States, the Federal Reserve and FDIC also announced concurrent  coordinated actions that were intended to increase confidence in the U.S.  financial system. Treasury\u2019s decision to change its strategy raised  questions about TARP\u2019s transparency, and the fact that the funds were  disbursed before a comprehensive system of internal control had been  established raised issues of accountability.

Some of our recommendations applied to TARP in general,  while others, such as CPP and HAMP, were program specific. Our  recommendations to Treasury generally fell into three broad categ (1) transparency, reporting, and accountability; (2) management  infrastructure; and (3) communication. Other TARP oversight entitie such as the Special Inspector General for TARP (SIGTARP)  and the  Congressional Oversight Panel, have also made numerous  recomm TARP.  endations aimed at improving the implementation and oversight of  Transparency, reporting, and accountability. We made a series of  recommendations aimed at improving the transparency and accountability  of TARP and its programs. Initially, we made a series of recommend ations  aimed at improving the transparency of CPP. As a result, OFS now  requires all CPP participants to participate in some form of monthly  lending survey. We recommended that OFS report publicly the monies,  such as dividends, paid to Treasury by TARP participants, something OF started doing in June 2009. Similarly, Treasury took steps to implement  our recommendations aimed at making the warrant repurchase proc more transparent. Finally, we made a number of recommendations  addressing the basis and design of HAMP\u2019s Home Price Decline Protection  program and the need to routinely review and update the key assumptions  that underlie Treasury\u2019s projection of the number of borrowers likely to be  assisted. Treasury has started to address many of these recommendations.", "Management infrastructure. To ensure that OFS established a robust  management structure, comprehensive system of internal control, and assessment process, we made a series of recommendations aimed at  addressing challenges associated with establishing a federal progra short period of time including challenges associated with staffing,  contractor oversight, and internal controls. For example:    We recommended that Treasury expedite its hiring efforts to help ensure  that OFS had the needed personnel throughout the implementation phase of the program and that key OFS leadership positions were filled during  and after the transition to the new administration. In certain areas,  challenges remain, and most recently we recommended that Treasu staff vacant positions in the Homeownership Preservation Office\u2014 including filling the position of Chief Homeownership Preservat with a permanent placement\u2014and evaluate staffing levels and  competencies.", "We recommended that OFS take a number of actions to ensure an  appropriate oversight infrastructure to manage contractors and addres conflicts of interest, including ensuring that sufficient personnel  were  s  assigned and properly trained to oversee the performance of all  contractors. We recommended that OFS issue regulations on conflicts of  interest involving Treasury\u2019s agents, contractors, and their employees and  related entities as expeditiously as possible. We also recommended issu guidance requiring that key communications and decisions concerning  p otential or actual vendor-related conflicts of interest be documented.", "More broadly, we recommended that Treasury continue to develop a  comprehensive system of internal control over TARP, including policies,  procedures, and guidance that were robust enough to protect taxpayer s\u2019  interests and ensure that the program objectives were being met. For  example, we recommended improvements in documenting certain internal control procedures and in updating the guidance available to the public on determining warrant exercise prices so that it was consistent with OFS\u2019s  actual practices. Finally, we recommended that OFS expe a comprehensive system of internal control over HAMP.", "We also recommended that Treasury develop a process to monitor status of programs and identify any potential risk that announced  programs would not have adequate funding. Most recently, we also  recommended that OFS develop a means of systematically assess servicers\u2019 capacity to meet HAMP requirements during program  admission.", "Communication. In light of the backlash from Congress and other regarding Treasury\u2019s initial shift in the program from purchases of  mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to capitalization of financia institutions, we made a series of recommendations over the past year  aimed at improving OFS\u2019s communication with Congress and the public.  While the theme has been constant, the recommendations have attempte to help ensure that Treasury develops a comprehensive communication  strategy and clearly articulated vision for the program that goes beyon d  just providing information. We have recommended, for instance, that  Treasury develop a communication strategy that includes building an  understanding and support for the various components of the program Treasury continues to take steps to address these recommendations,  including hiring a communications officer, integrating communicatio into TARP operations, scheduling regular and ongoing contact with  congressional committees and members, and attempting to leverage  technology.  .", "We made one recommendation that was not directed to Treasury.

Because Treasury must borrow the funds disbursed, TARP and other  actions taken to stabilize the financial markets increase the federal debt  and result in related borrowing costs in the form of interest. Because  Treasury manages its cash position and debt issuances from a  governmentwide perspective, it is generally not possible to match TARP  disbursements with specific debt securities issued by Treasury and the  related borrowing costs. Moreover, Treasury typically does not calculate  the federal government\u2019s borrowing cost related to specific disbursements,  including the net disbursements for TARP. However, Treasury provided us  with an unaudited estimate of approximately $2.3 billion in borrowing  costs based on certain assumptions relating to the net disbursements for  TARP from TARP\u2019s inception through September 30, 2009. Using  different assumptions would result in different estimated borrowing costs.

Also, federal  banking regulators\u2019 data show that over 1,800 applications have been  withdrawn since the start of the program. The number of approved  institutions withdrawing increased earlier this year, in part because of  uncertainties about program requirements (e.g., changes to executive  compensation). Anecdotally, some of the reasons cited have included  increased confidence in the financial condition of banks and, for smaller  institutions, the relatively high cost of closing CPP transactions. We are  continuing to review the process used to assess applications for CPP  funding to determine the extent to which Treasury consistently applied  established criteria and adequately documented the regulators\u2019  recommendations and its final decisions.

Specifically:    Using its new monthly lending surveys, in February 2009 Treasury began  to publish detailed information for the 20 largest CPP institutions. In April  2009, it added questions addressing their small business lending activity to  the survey. In June Treasury began to publish basic information from all  CPP participating institutions. The monthly surveys are an important step  toward greater transparency and accountability for institutions of all sizes.

Specifically, we found that:  the cost of credit and perceptions of risk declined significantly in  interbank, corporate debt, and mortgage markets; the decline in perceptions of risk (as measured by premiums over  Treasury securities) in the interbank market could be attributed in part to  several federal programs aimed at stabilizing markets that were  announced on October 14, 2008, including CPP; and institutions that received CPP funds in the first quarter of 2009 saw more  improvement in their capital positions than banks outside the program.", "Acting on GAO\u2019s recommendation that Treasury collect information about  the impact of its investments on participants\u2019 lending activities, Treasury  implemented a monthly survey.

Chief among these intended effects was to stabilize and  return confidence to the financial system. We paid particular attention to  developments in the interbank market by monitoring the London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is the cost of interbank credit, and  the TED spread, which captures the risk perceived in interbank markets  and gauges the willingness of banks to lend to other banks (see fig. 3). As  figure 3 shows, LIBOR increased significantly in September 2008, and  more importantly banks began to pay an even higher premium for loans to  compensate for the perceived increase in default risk. After widening  somewhat after the first major subprime mortgage write-down and the  Bear Stearns rescue, the TED spread increased significantly in the days  following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and other adverse events,  exceeding 4.5 percent at its highest point (450 basis points). However,  since the announcement of CPP and other interventions in October 2008,  the 3-month LIBOR and TED spread have fallen by more than 430 basis  points. About 60 basis points of that decline occurred after the  announcement of the stress test results associated with CAP in May 2009.", "To examine whether the decline in the TED spread could be attributed in  part to TARP, we conducted additional analysis using a simple  econometric model, which took into account the possibility that the  spread would have narrowed without the intervention. We did not  attempt to account for all the important factors that might influence the  TED spread. Because the TED spread reached extreme values leading up  to the CPP announcement (more than 450 basis points), it could have  declined even in the absence of CPP, simply because extreme values have  a tendency to return to normal levels. Even when we accounted for this  possibility and for other factors that might influence the interbank market,  we found that the October 14, 2008, announcement of the CPP had a  statistically significant impact on changes in the TED spread.  Nevertheless, the associated improvement in the TED spread (or LIBOR)  cannot be attributed solely to TARP because the October 14, 2008,  announcement was a joint announcement that also introduced the Federal  Reserve\u2019s Commercial Paper Funding Facility program and FDIC\u2019s  Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.", "More broadly, the programs established under TARP, if effective, should  have jointly resulted in improvements in general credit market conditions,  including declining risk premiums and lower borrowing costs for nonbank  businesses and consumers. In the month leading up to the CPP  announcement, market interest rates and spreads reflected a significant  tightening in credit conditions as investors, worried about the health of the  economy, became increasingly risk averse. The indicators that we have  been monitoring illustrate that since mid-October 2008 the cost of credit  and perceptions of risk (measured by premiums over Treasury securities)  have declined significantly, not only in interbank markets but also in  corporate debt and mortgage markets (see table 6). Recent trends in  these measures are consistent with those for other indicators that we and  other researchers have monitored. For example, stock market volatility  has fallen considerably, and the credit default swap index for the banking  sector has declined significantly since TARP actions began. Even taken  collectively, though, changes in these indicators are an imperfect way to  measure TARP\u2019s impact, as they may also be influenced by general market  forces and cannot be exclusively linked to any one program or action.", "One of the intentions of TARP, and specifically of CPP, was to improve  banks\u2019 balance sheets, enhance lenders\u2019 ability to borrow, raise capital,  and lend to creditworthy borrowers. Capital ratios at institutions that  received CPP capital in the first quarter of 2009 rose more than capital  ratios at non-CPP institutions between December 31, 2008, and March 31,  2009. This difference holds across several measures of capital adequacy  (see table 7). Improved confidence in the interbank market may to some  degree reflect the increased capital ratios at institutions that received CPP  funding, as these ratios are important indicators of solvency\u2014that is, the  higher the ratio, the more solvent the institution. As we have discussed in  previous reports, tension exists between promoting lending and improving  banks\u2019 capital position. We noted that some institutions likely would use  CPP capital to improve their capital ratios by holding the additional capital  as treasuries or other safe assets rather than leveraging it to support  additional lending. Using the capital in this manner could allow  institutions to absorb losses or write down troubled assets.", "Recent trends in lending suggest that CPP capital infusions may have  made participating banks somewhat more willing and able to increase  lending to creditworthy businesses and consumers, although lending  standards for consumer and business credit remain tight. Our analysis of  Treasury\u2019s loan surveys showed that these CPP recipients reported an  increase in new lending to consumers and businesses to, on average, $287  billion a month in the second quarter of 2009, up $47 billion from $240  billion a month in the fourth quarter of 2008 (see fig. 4). These findings  are consistent with the trends in aggregate mortgage originations, which  more than doubled between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the end of the  second quarter of 2009 to $550 billion.", "Table 8 documents the total amount of new consumer and business  lending for each institution that received CPP funds. Despite tight lending  standards and the usual drop in credit flows during recessions, collectively  the top 21 institutions participating in CPP have reported extending almost  $2.3 trillion in new loans since receiving CPP capital totaling $160 billion.  While lending typically falls during a recession, recent research by the  Federal Reserve concluded that through the first quarter of 2009, the  contraction in commercial mortgages, nonfinancial business credit, and  consumer credit did not appear to be particularly severe relative to  contractions in these types of lending in other downturns. However, the  contraction in residential mortgage lending has exceeded past downturns.", "Data limitations may prevent a reliable comparison of lending volumes  across institutions of different sizes and between CPP and non-CPP  participants. For the hundreds of smaller financial institutions receiving  CPP funds, the only lending information provided was based on the value  of loan balances and thus was not comparable to the more detailed data  for large CPP recipients. Similarly, only comparative balance sheet data is  available for non-CPP institutions. Although balance sheet data\u2014which is  available for all banking institutions\u2014could be useful for comparing  capital ratios, our quantitative work suggests that loan balances may not  be a good proxy for lending activity, at least for the third quarter of 2008 to  the first quarter of 2009. Specifically, we found the correlations between  new lending and changes in loan balances to be relatively low over this  period. A number of factors can affect loan balances that are unrelated to  new lending, including merger activity, changes in the value of existing  loans (e.g., realizing losses on a loan portfolio), and loan payoffs as  borrowers attempt to reduce debt burdens. Banks could, for example,  undertake significant origination activity and still see a drop in the total  value of loans that they held.

While aggregate  issuance is still down significantly from 2007, non-mortgage-related ABS  issuance rose to $47.9 billion in the second quarter of 2009 from $3.3  billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. ABS backed by home equity loans,  which are not eligible for TALF assistance, increased to just $71 million  from $17 million over the same period, although whether a significant  increase would be expected given the turmoil in mortgage markets is not  clear.", "As we discussed in previous reports, TALF support to securitization  markets should, if effective, increase the availability of new credit to  consumers and businesses, lowering rates on credit card, automobile,  small business, student, commercial mortgage, and other types of loans  traditionally facilitated by securitization. From November 2008 to May  2009, the average rate on automobile loans from finance companies  declined significantly (296 basis points) to 3.5 percent, well below the  bank rate, which fell only 26 basis points to 6.8 percent. While these  declines correlate with the launching of TALF, the federal government\u2019s  support of GM and Chrysler also likely played a role in alleviating liquidity  constraints at finance companies. Because stand-alone auto finance  companies rely more heavily on securitization than commercial banks, the  differences in the trends in their automobile loan rates could partially  reflect the issues in securitization markets that TALF was intended to  address. After initially providing funding to certain holders of AAA-rated  ABS backed by newly and recently originated consumer and small  business loans, TALF has been expanded to other assets, including  commercial MBS. We will continue to monitor ABS activity, interest rates  on consumer and business loans and other TALF-eligible securities, as  well as ABS spreads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Is Too Soon to Expect Results from More Recently Implemented TARP Programs", "paragraphs": ["In future reports, we will address the effectiveness of the more recently  initiated financial stability programs, using indicators and auxiliary  quantitative work. These programs are intended to address rising  foreclosures and the condition of the housing market (HAMP) as well as  the legacy loans and securities that are widely held to be the root cause of  the deteriorating conditions of many financial institutions (PPIP).  Foreclosure data, although also influenced by general market forces such  as falling housing prices and unemployment, should provide an indication  of the effectiveness of HAMP. Although it is too soon to expect any HAMP- related improvements, because HAMP was only recently implemented, we  have monitored foreclosure rates over the past year. While the average  foreclosure rate from 1979 to 2006 was less than 1 percent, the percentage  of loans in foreclosure reached an unprecedented high of 4.3 percent at  the end of the second quarter of 2009, up from 3.3 percent in the fourth  quarter of 2008 (see table 6). Over the same period, the foreclosure rate on  subprime loans rose to 15.1 percent from 13.7 percent (the rate for  adjustable-rate subprime loans is now more than 24 percent).", "As discussed in our March 2009 report, Treasury introduced PPIP to  facilitate the purchase of legacy loans and securities. PPIP\u2019s impact will  depend largely on the pricing of the purchased assets. Sufficiently high  prices will allow financial institutions to sell assets, deleverage, and  improve their capital adequacy, but overpaying for these assets could have  negative implications for taxpayers. In addition to providing more  transparent pricing for assets, PPIP\u2014if it is effective\u2014should improve  solvency at participating institutions and others holding those assets,  reduce uncertainty about their balance sheets, and improve investor  confidence. If it does, the institutions will be able to borrow and lend at  lower rates and raise additional capital from the private sector. But PPIP is  in the initial stages of implementation, and it is too early to expect effects  on related markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Assessing TARP\u2019s Effect on the Economy Remain", "paragraphs": ["While TARP\u2019s activities could improve market confidence in participating  banks and have other beneficial effects on credit markets, we have also  noted in our previous reports that several factors will complicate efforts to  measure any impact. For example, any changes attributed to TARP could  well be changes that:    would have occurred anyway;    can be attributed to other policy interventions, such as the actions of  FDIC, the Federal Reserve, or other financial regulators; or   were enhanced or counteracted by other market forces, such as the  correction in housing markets and revaluation of mortgage-related assets.", "Consideration of market forces is particularly important when using bank  lending as a measure of CPP\u2019s and CAP\u2019s success, because it is not clear  what would have happened in the absence of TARP. Weaknesses in the  balance sheets of financial intermediaries, a decline in the demand for  credit, reduced creditworthiness among borrowers, and other market  fundamentals suggest lower lending activity than would be expected.  Similarly, nonbank financial institutions, which have accounted for a  significant portion of lending activity over the last two decades, have been  constrained due to weak securitization markets. Lastly, because the  extension of credit to less-than-creditworthy borrowers appears to have  been an important factor in the current financial crisis, it is not clear that  lending should return to precrisis levels. Similar difficulties arise in using  foreclosure data as a measure of HAMP\u2019s success, especially given the  rising unemployment rate and the number of homeowners who may have  taken on mortgage-related debt beyond prudent levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury Should Consider a Number of Indicators and Measures to Provide a Basis for Future TARP Actions", "paragraphs": ["While Treasury is beginning to establish a case for exiting from some  emergency programs and maintaining others, it has not fully established a  comprehensive framework that will provide a basis for making transparent  decisions about which TARP-specific actions are necessary or how those  programs will be evaluated. Treasury\u2019s authority to purchase or insure  additional troubled assets will expire on December 31, 2009, unless the  Secretary submits a written certification to Congress explaining why an  extension is necessary and how much it is expected to cost. For this  reason, Treasury will need to make decisions about providing new funding  and maintaining existing funding for TARP programs in the next few  months. It will need to do this in light of current and expected market  conditions, and it will need to communicate its determinations to  Congress and the American people.", "Treasury has recently released a report that begins to discuss the next  phase of its stabilization and rehabilitation efforts\u2014a discussion that may  be a starting point for deciding whether any further actions are necessary  to stabilize financial markets and the first step in establishing a framework  for such actions. The report describes the drop in utilization of some  programs as financial conditions normalize and confidence in financial  markets improves and identifies a number of financial market indicators.  Treasury also notes that it will need to ensure the continuation of some  policies and programs that it believes are needed for financial and  economic recovery. However, Treasury has yet to take all the steps needed  to provide a basis for deciding whether or not to provide new funding for  TARP. For example, while some rationale is provided for continued HAMP  and TALF action, none is provided for PPIP. Without a robust analytic  framework, Treasury may be challenged in effectively carrying out the  next phase of its programs.", "For the decision-making process to be viewed as credible, Treasury will  need to document and communicate the basis for its decisions. Although  qualitative factors should be given serious consideration, to the extent that  Treasury can relate its decision making to a set of quantitative measures or  indicators, its case can be more convincing. In addition, Treasury would  add further credibility to the process by announcing ahead of time the  indicators or measures it plans to use. Doing so would help to disarm  potential criticism that it had selectively chosen indicators or measures to  justify its decisions after the fact. While indicators of credit market  conditions can suggest the extent to which, for example, credit costs and  lending have returned to levels consistent with the stability of financial  markets, measures of program effectiveness can offer insight into the  potential benefits of additional TARP expenditures. The Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) guidance for cost-benefit and regulatory  analyses suggests, among other things, making assumptions explicit,  characterizing the uncertainties involved, varying assumptions to  determine the sensitivity of estimated outcomes (sensitivity analysis), and  considering alternative approaches. If Treasury adopts a more formal  cost-benefit framework, additional principles may also be applicable,  including the use of net present value measures, an enumeration of  benefits and costs, and the quantifying of benefits and costs whenever  possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In establishing this new program, Treasury faced a number of operational  challenges. Not only did it have to implement the program in the midst of  the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression, but Treasury also  had to adjust the program as events continued to unfold. As TARP\u2019s focus  shifted from making a number of capital purchases as investments in  individual institutions to one geared toward restarting securitization  markets and preserving homeownership, its management infrastructure  had to change as well.", "While progress has been made in establishing TARP, much remains  uncertain about the program, including whether it will pay for itself or  prove to be a cost to the taxpayers. The reasons for the uncertainty  include the following:    Some programs remain in their infancy, while others are winding down.", "Therefore, determining the overall impact and costs of the programs will  take time.", "TARP funds were invested in a variety of institutions, some of which were  less risky than others.", "Some TARP programs may generate some returns for Treasury through  interest and dividend payments and sales of warrants, while others\u2014such  as HAMP\u2014are expenditure programs aimed at helping homeowners  modify their mortgages.", "To help Treasury meet the challenges associated with implementing a  program while concurrently establishing a comprehensive system of  internal control, we have made 35 recommendations to Treasury aimed at  improving the accountability, integrity, and transparency of TARP. As  discussed in appendix I, Treasury has taken action to address most of  them. And while much important progress has been made, a number of  areas warrant ongoing attention as Treasury moves into the next phase of  the program and contemplates a possible extension.", "First, we continue to believe that Treasury should work with the Chairmen  of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the  Acting Director of OTS to help ensure that the primary federal regulators  use generally consistent criteria when considering repurchase decisions  under TARP. While we understand that the final repurchase decision rests  with a participant\u2019s primary federal regulator, Treasury has a responsibility  to ensure that these regulators are applying generally consistent criteria  when reviewing TARP participants\u2019 requests to repurchase their preferred  shares.", "Second, Treasury has yet to finalize its implementation of an oversight  program for asset managers covering CPP and the other capital-based  programs, such as TIP and AGP. While Treasury now has asset managers  to help manage its equity investments, it must also ensure that the federal  government\u2019s interests are protected and that the asset managers are  performing as agreed.", "Third, Treasury has yet to implement our recommendation aimed at  strengthening its efforts to help preserve homeownership and protect  home values. As we previously recommended, Treasury should routinely  update projections of the number of homeowners who can be helped  under HAMP by reviewing key assumptions about the housing market and  the behavior of mortgage holders, borrowers, and servicers. In addition,  Treasury should develop a means of systematically assessing servicers\u2019  capacity to make HAMP modifications and meet program requirements, so  that Treasury can understand and address any risks associated with  individual servicers\u2019 ability to fulfill program requirements.", "Fourth, in the area of management infrastructure, OFS has continued to  make progress in establishing a management infrastructure to administer  TARP and oversee contractors and financial agents, but some challenges  remain. Though OFS now has close to 200 staff, some key senior positions  have not been permanently filled, such as the Chief Homeownership  Preservation Officer and Chief Investment Officer. Bringing on board  permanent staff for these key positions is important in helping Treasury  effectively administer TARP activities and ensuring accountability for  program outcomes. Treasury has strengthened its management and  oversight of contractors as its reliance on them to support TARP has  grown over the past year. OFS continues to make progress in developing a  comprehensive system of internal control. As we complete our first audit  of OFS\u2019s annual financial statements for TARP, we will be able to provide  a more definitive view of TARP\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting.", "Fifth, in the area of communication, the program has evolved and  continues to evolve. Treasury viewed its initial shift toward capital  investments in the first weeks of the program as a more effective way to  stabilize fragile financial markets. This shift in strategy, however, caught  Congress and the public by surprise, and has created long-term challenges  for the program, and, some would argue, ultimately impacted the  effectiveness of the program. Concerns about this shift in structure  highlight the communication challenges that continue to confront the  program. And as Treasury continues to improve its communication efforts  and formalize its communication strategy, Treasury must ensure that its  ongoing efforts include keeping Congress adequately informed about  TARP and its strategy, including its exit strategy for the various programs  created under TARP. Furthermore, formalizing the communication  strategy and hiring a communications director will help ensure that  communication is given sufficient attention on an ongoing basis.", "Finally, because TARP has been part of a broader effort that has included  the Federal Reserve and FDIC, measuring the effectiveness of TARP\u2019s  programs has been an ongoing challenge. We developed a set of indicators  that we used to track conditions of financial markets over the past year.  These indicators show that a number of the anticipated effects of TARP  have materialized. However, changes in these metrics are an imperfect  way to measure TARP\u2019s impact, as they may also be influenced by general  market forces and cannot be exclusively linked to any one program or  action. As a result, isolating and assessing TARP\u2019s effect on the economy  remains a challenging endeavor.", "Treasury has not fully established a comprehensive analytic framework for  assessing the need for additional actions and evaluating program results in  a transparent manner. In a recent report on the next phase of the federal  government\u2019s stabilization efforts, Treasury began to lay the foundation for  an analytic framework for determining whether to extend TARP and also  provided a number of financial indicators. Although TARP expires on  December 31, 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury may extend the program  to October 3, 2010, and Treasury will need to make a determination  regarding such an extension. As Treasury considers whether to extend the  program, the Secretary\u2019s determination must be made in light of actions  taken and planned by the Federal Reserve and FDIC and their winding  down of certain programs and continuation of others that were also  established to help stabilize markets. In addition, any continued action  under TARP should be based in part on quantitative measures of program  effectiveness, such as performance indicators, in order to weigh the  benefits of TARP programs against the cost of using additional taxpayer  resources. However, Treasury has not fully established a comprehensive  analytic framework for assessing the future direction of the programs or  determining whether additional actions are warranted. Moreover, as it  finalizes the next phase of the program, Treasury will need to document its  decision-making process and communicate its reasoning to Congress and  the American people in order for its decisions to be viewed as credible.", "Finally, with the exception of AGP and AIFP, Treasury has not updated its  projected use of funds for the TARP programs in light of current market  conditions and program participation rates since March 2009. Based on  changes in the markets, repurchases, participation levels in certain  programs, and the implementation status of others, a thorough review of  Treasury\u2019s existing estimates of its projected use of TARP funds is  warranted in light of the need to make a determination about whether to  extend the program.

Concerning our recommendation that Treasury  update its projected use of funds estimates and if the program is extended,  regularly re-evaluate them, Treasury commented that it regularly evaluates  funding needs for TARP programs and announces revisions as decisions  are made. However, with the exception of AGP and AIFP, Treasury had  not publicly affirmed its projected use estimates since March 2009. As it  continues to evaluate these estimates, Treasury should disclose this  information periodically, including reconciling estimates to actual results.

CAP is designed to help ensure that qualified financial institutions have  sufficient capital to withstand severe economic challenges.

A key  component of CAP is the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  (SCAP), which the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies (those with  risk-weighted assets of $100 billion or more as of December 31, 2008) were  required to participate in. Specifically, federal bank regulators, led by the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, conducted capital  assessments or \u201cstress tests\u201d to determine whether the largest bank  holding companies have enough capital to absorb losses and continue  lending even if conditions were worse than expected between December  2008 and December 2010. Institutions deemed not to have sufficient  capital were given 6 months to raise private capital or to access capital  through CAP. Institutions with less than $100 billion in risk-weighted  assets were not required to complete a stress test but are also eligible to  obtain capital under CAP.

According to Treasury, HAMP\u2019s primary goal is to help up to  three to four million borrowers who are struggling to make their mortgage  payments by reducing their monthly payments to an affordable level (loan  modification), thereby preventing unnecessary foreclosures and helping to  stabilize home prices in the neighborhoods hit hardest by foreclosures. To  implement the program, Treasury has delegated significant responsibilities  to its financial agents, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to act as the program  administrator and compliance agent for HAMP, respectively. Under HAMP,  Treasury will use Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to share  the cost of reducing monthly payments on first-lien mortgages with  mortgage holders and investors, and provide financial incentives to  servicers, borrowers, and mortgage holders and investors for loans  modified under the program. Under HAMP, Treasury also plans to (1)  provide additional incentives to mortgage holders/investors to modify,  rather than foreclose on, loans in areas where home price declines have  been most severe; (2) provide incentives to modify or pay off second-lien  loans of borrowers whose first mortgages were modified under HAMP;  and (3) provide incentives to servicers and borrowers to pursue  alternatives to foreclosure (short sales and deeds-in-lieu) to homeowners  who do not qualify for a HAMP modification or cannot maintain payments  during the trial period or modification. As of September 25, 2009, 63  servicers have signed up to participate in the program, covering  approximately 85 percent of U.S. mortgage loans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding", "paragraphs": ["Treasury has announced that up to $50 billion of funds from TARP may be  used for HAMP. Most of these funds are directed to the modification of  first-lien mortgages held by borrowers in danger of foreclosure (first-lien  modification program). To monitor HAMP\u2019s funding needs, Treasury has  estimated the funding requirements, or caps, for each participating  servicer based on the number of modifications they are expected to  perform during the entire duration of the program. The caps include  maximum payable incentives associated with modifying borrowers\u2019 first- lien mortgages, including incentive payments to borrowers, servicers, and  mortgage holders and investors. According to Treasury, cap allocations  are initially set based on publicly available information and are updated  using more complete data on the servicers\u2019 mortgage portfolios. Treasury  has been reassessing each servicer\u2019s cap on a quarterly basis, using data  on the actual number of modifications made by the servicer under the  program. As of September 25, 2009, Treasury had allocated a total of $22.3  billion through the caps on its 63 participating servicers, of which about  $946,000 has been paid out in servicer and investor incentive payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Most of Treasury\u2019s efforts to develop HAMP have been directed to the  first-lien modification program. Treasury has designed the first-lien  program to target borrowers in default (defined as 60 days or more  delinquent on their mortgage payments) or in imminent danger of default  (borrowers that are current on their mortgages but facing hardships such  as job loss or interest rate increases on their adjustable rate mortgages).  Treasury has established several eligibility requirements for borrower  participation in HAMP, including that the property be an owner-occupied,  single-family residence (one to four units) that is the borrower\u2019s primary  residence and that the mortgage loan amount not exceed specified dollar  thresholds. Additionally, borrowers cannot participate in HAMP if they  have non-GSE loans unless their servicers have signed participation  agreements with Fannie Mae\u2014Treasury\u2019s administrator for the program.  According to Treasury, as of September 25, 2009, the following HAMP  progress has been made related to loans not owned or guaranteed by  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:    63 servicers had signed participation agreements for the first-lien    More than 1.3 million solicitation letters for HAMP loan modifications to    More than 328,000 HAMP trial modification offers to borrowers;    More than 209,000 HAMP trial modifications had started; and    1,080 borrowers had successfully completed the trial period and received  HAMP modifications.", "Of the three other subprograms that were announced as part of HAMP in  the March 4, 2009, program guidelines, Treasury has recently begun to  implement the Home Price Decline Prevention (HPDP) program but has  not implemented the other two. Treasury issued official guidance on  HPDP in late July 2009 and began implementing the program on  September 1, 2009. As of that date, the net present value model used to  calculate borrowers\u2019 eligibility for HAMP took into account the additional  incentive payments available through HPDP to investors in areas of the  country where price declines had been large. However, the extent to  which HPDP will increase the number of modifications made remains  unclear. In our July 2009 report, we recommended that Treasury re- evaluate the basis and design of the HPDP program to ensure that HAMP  funds are being used effectively. Treasury released detailed guidelines on  the second-lien modification component of HAMP on August 13, 2009.  However, these guidelines require that servicers sign participation  agreements with Fannie Mae on or before December 31, 2009, to be  eligible for the program. As of September 25, 2009, no servicers have  signed such participation agreements. Finally, Treasury had not released  any detailed guidelines on the foreclosure alternatives component of  HAMP.", "We previously reported that although the central program\u2014the first-lien  modification program\u2014had been implemented, many of its administrative  processes and its internal control policies and procedures were not yet  finalized. Fannie Mae, as HAMP administrator, has mapped operational  processes and identified points of control for multiple aspects of HAMP,  such as servicer registration and servicer set-up in HAMP\u2019s electronic  system, servicer data reporting, trial and official modifications, and the  steps of the payment process administered by Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae has  also drafted procedures to carry out many of these processes and internal  controls. According to Fannie Mae, processes, controls and procedures  have not been finalized for a planned servicer call center, and the  budgeting and billing of Fannie Mae\u2019s work under the HAMP financial  agent agreement. Processes and controls designed by Fannie Mae to date  were to be tested by September 30, 2009, according to Fannie Mae  officials. In addition, Freddie Mac, as HAMP compliance agent, has  mapped out the overall compliance program, working with OFS and  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and is developing policies and procedures  to carry it out. In a related effort, Freddie Mac has described to us its  methods for testing compliance for 233 program requirements. In addition,  according to Treasury, Treasury and its financial agents have formalized a  charter for a HAMP Compliance Committee. Treasury also noted that the  Committee is finalizing a policy for addressing remedies for identified  instances of noncompliance among servicers. However, while Treasury  has drafted performance measures to evaluate HAMP, these measures  have not been fully developed and have yet to be implemented.", "On August 4, 2009, Treasury released its first report on the performance of  participating servicers under HAMP. The Monthly Servicer Performance  Report showed significant variations among the servicers in the  percentage of delinquent borrowers in their servicing portfolios that had  been offered or received trial modifications. For example, for servicers  that had signed up to participate in the program before May 31, 2009, the  percentage of delinquent borrowers who had been offered HAMP trial  modifications ranged from 0 percent to 45 percent, and the percentage of  their delinquent borrowers who had started HAMP trial modifications  ranged from 0 percent to 25 percent. Such variations have highlighted  potential issues with servicers\u2019 capacity to implement HAMP. In our July  2009 report, we expressed concern that Treasury was not fully vetting  servicers signing HAMP loan modification participation agreements and  recommended that Treasury develop a means of systematically assessing  servicers\u2019 capacity to meet program requirements during program  admission. As compliance agent for HAMP, Freddie Mac has developed  several different types of reviews intended to be conducted after a servicer  has signed up to participate in the program that touch on issues of servicer  capacity. Freddie Mac is currently working with Treasury to refine these  procedures, which include:  \u201cfull\u201d on-site reviews, which are 1-week reviews that include a detailed  management interview about all HAMP processes, walk-throughs of each  of these processes, and file reviews of a sample of the servicer\u2019s loan files;   walk-through reviews, which are 1- to 2-day reviews that can occur sooner  than a \u201cfull\u201d review and that go into less detail on loss mitigation,  collections, and investor accounting processes; and \u201csecond look\u201d reviews, which are off-site loan file reviews that look for  servicer errors in evaluating borrowers for HAMP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key activities under HAMP", "paragraphs": ["February 18, 2009: Treasury announced HAMP, a national loan  modification program intended to offer assistance to up to three to four  million homeowners by reducing monthly payments to sustainable levels.", "March 4, 2009: Treasury issued official guidance for loan modifications  under HAMP and announced that servicers could begin conducting  modifications that conform to the guidelines.
