Partly in response to concerns about card issuer practices and rising student credit card debt, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009.

The number of affinity card agreements declined from 1,045 in 2009 to 617 in 2012 (41 percent). More than 70 percent of the agreements in 2012 were with institutions of higher education or alumni organizations, and one issuer\u2014FIA Card Services, a subsidiary of Bank of America\u2014had 67 percent of all agreements. Affinity card issuers paid $50.4 million to all organizations in 2012, 40 percent less than in 2009. In most cases, payments were based on numbers of cardholders and the amount spent on the cards. The card agreements covered contractual obligations related to such things as marketing practices, target populations, use of the organization's logo or trademark, terms of payment, and, in some cases, service standards.", "Student-focused marketing of affinity and student cards on campus appears to have declined. Four large affinity card issuers GAO interviewed (representing 91 percent of cardholders) said that they primarily targeted alumni and no longer marketed affinity cards directly to students. In interviews with GAO, institutions of higher education and affiliated organizations agreed that affinity card marketing directly to students had ceased. In addition, five of the nine largest overall credit card issuers that also issue college student credit cards told GAO they no longer actively marketed these cards (such as through direct mail, e-mail, or on-campus activity), but rather relied upon websites and bank branches. Representatives of five institutions with large affinity card agreements told GAO that they generally noticed a decline in on-campus credit card marketing in recent years. Consistent with these observations, available data show a decline in card solicitations to students in recent years. For example, a survey of students in 2013 by Student Monitor, a research firm, found that 6 percent of students reported obtaining a credit card as a result of a direct mail solicitation, compared with 36 percent in 2000.", "Data are not available to definitively determine the effect that affinity cards and college student credit cards have had on student credit card debt. For affinity cards, the effect may be limited because fewer students appear to hold such cards. For college student credit cards, the effect is difficult to determine because data are available for credit cards in general but not for student credit cards in particular. However, students' overall use of credit cards appears to have declined in recent years. For example, Student Monitor reported 33 percent of students owned credit cards in 2013 versus 53 percent in 2004, a trend corroborated by several other studies that GAO identified. But Student Monitor found that students with credit cards in their names increasingly obtained the cards before starting college. In addition, it found that in 2013, students charged an average of $171 monthly on their cards, 80 percent of the cards had a credit limit of $1,000 or less, and 72 percent of students said they paid their outstanding charges in full each month. Student Monitor also reported that one quarter of students in 2013 paid a late payment fee at least once since they acquired the credit card, with almost half of those paying more than once."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Institutions of higher education and affiliated organizations, such as  alumni associations, sometimes have agreements with credit card issuers  for \u201ccollege affinity cards.\u201d These cards often bear the name or logo of the  school or organization, and, in return, the issuer pays a portion of the  proceeds of the credit card to the school or organization.

We assessed the reliability of these databases by  interviewing Federal Reserve and CFPB officials knowledgeable about  the data and checking the data for illogical values or obvious errors. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for describing the general  characteristics and trends of the affinity card marketplace.

The sample included the agreements with the largest number of  cardholders overall, for each issuer, and for institutions of higher  education. Collectively, the agreements in our sample covered about 38  percent of all cardholders associated with affinity credit cards in 2011,  which allows us to make statements of context and describe multiple  factors relating to college credit card agreements. Findings from this  limited review cannot be generalized to the overall population of all  agreements for college affinity cards in 2011. We also interviewed  representatives of six institutions of higher education and affiliated  organizations, including those party to three of the four largest  agreements, as determined by number of cardholders.

Furthermore, we  interviewed representatives of seven credit card issuers, which included  the five largest general credit card issuers as determined by portfolio size  in 2011. Four of these seven issuers offered affinity credit cards,  representing 91 percent of the affinity card market in 2012, as measured  by number of cardholders.

We use \u201ccollege affinity card\u201d to refer to a credit card  issued in conjunction with an agreement between a credit card issuer and  an institution of higher education or an affiliated organization (such as an  alumni association or foundation). We use \u201ccollege student credit card\u201d to  refer to a credit card established for and targeted to college students.", "To identify the trends and general characteristics associated with college  affinity card agreements, we reviewed the 2010 and 2011 Report to the  Congress on College Credit Card Agreements, which the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) issued, and  the 2012 and 2013 College Credit Card Agreements: Annual Report to  Congress, which the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (also  known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB) issued.  These reports provide summary information, such as the total number of  agreements in effect and number of accounts open at the end of the  year.", "To determine the characteristics of the agreements, we first reviewed and  analyzed affinity card agreements between issuers and schools or  affiliated organizations from calendar years 2009-2012. We downloaded  information for all those agreements in effect during those years from  public databases managed by the Federal Reserve and CFPB. We analyzed the agreements to identify general trends and characteristics.  We assessed these data by interviewing Federal Reserve and CFPB staff  knowledgeable about the data and checking the data for illogical values  or obvious errors. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for  describing the general characteristics and trends of the affinity card  marketplace.", "Because we were most interested in current agreements, we focused our  analysis on the agreements from 2011, the most recent year for which  information was available. Twenty providers issued these agreements.  For a more thorough analysis, we selected a nonprobability sample of 39  agreements from 574 agreements identified as being in effect as of  January 1, 2012. We determined the sample by applying three criteria to  the agreements. First, we included the 25 largest agreements overall, as  measured by the number of cardholders. Second, we included the largest  agreement from each issuer that provided affinity credit cards. Third, we  included the five largest agreements with institutions of higher education,  as measured by the number of cardholders under those agreements.  These numbers do not add to 39 because agreements could meet criteria  for inclusion under more than one category. We selected these criteria  because we wanted to capture a large proportion of affinity cardholders  as well as any potential variation among issuers or organizational type.  We included the five largest institutions of higher education because we  anticipated that those agreements could be more likely to include  students as cardholders, a topic of specific interest. See table 8 for the list  of reviewed agreements.", "Collectively, the agreements included in our sample covered about 38  percent of all cardholders in 2011. Twenty-six of the reviewed  agreements were with alumni associations, 8 were with institutions of  higher education, 3 were with foundations, and 2 were with other  organizations.", "We reviewed these agreements and collected information using a data  collection instrument (DCI) to gather characteristics such as their effective  date, duration, allowed marketing practices and target populations,  payments to the organization, consumer protections, and service  standards. Findings from this limited review of 39 agreements cannot be  generalized to the overall population of agreements in 2011.", "We developed the DCI after reviewing some of the 2011 agreements,  focusing on items such as the scope, consumer protections, marketing  practices, payments, terms, and fees. We converted the DCI to a pdf  format for direct data entry. Three team members entered information on  two agreements each using the DCI and discussed their experiences. We  revised some questions for clarity and deleted others to avoid duplication.  This version of the DCI was reviewed by a GAO survey specialist and an  expert who surveyed students regarding their credit card use and  conducted a similar review of the credit card agreements, and we  incorporated minor changes. We further clarified that the review of  agreements would focus on the most recent full agreement or  amendment and those items that were still in effect as of January 1, 2012.  Two team members then entered information about the agreements into  the DCI. We verified our coding by comparing the original coder\u2019s DCI  responses with those of the second coder. For each comparison set, we  compared the coding for 59 data elements and found discrepancies in  fewer than 10 percent of the entries. This was determined to ensure a  base level of reliability in the information collected. While the results of  our review of the 39 agreements cannot be projected nationwide, they  provide context and information related to the contents of the 39  agreements.", "To address the second and third objectives, we reviewed documents and  interviewed representatives of credit card issuers, organizations and  schools with affinity card agreements, and federal agencies, as well as  academics and other individuals who have studied credit cards and their  use by students. We reviewed studies\u2014such as those by Sallie Mae (a  financial services company specializing in education), Student Monitor (a  market research firm that specializes in the college student market), and  U.S. Public Interest Research Group (a consumer advocacy  organization)\u2014on student credit card use. We identified these studies  through the Econ Lit database and general Internet searches using terms  such as \u201ccollege credit cards.\u201d We focused on several years of Sallie  Mae\u2019s How America Pays for College studies and on Student Monitor\u2019s  Financial Services \u2013 Spring 2013 report, as well as recent reports by  CFPB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. We assessed the  quality of the survey data by interviewing Student Monitor and Sallie Mae  officials knowledgeable about the data and checked the data for illogical  values or obvious errors. We found the data to be of sufficient quality and  reliability for providing general information on student credit card use.  According to the Student Monitor, the estimates from the 2013 study had  a 2.4 percent margin of error at the 95 percent confidence level.  Because  surveys are based on self-reporting of payment behaviors and estimated  credit card debt levels, they may be prone to biases and not accurately  represent actual behaviors and debt levels. The surveys were not  designed to verify that information. Some researchers maintain that  respondents sometimes underreport the quantity or level of  characteristics that could be considered unflattering, such as the amount  of outstanding credit card debt. We also reviewed marketing materials  issuers used to market the cards. Lastly, we reviewed provisions of the  Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009  related to affinity credit cards and credit card use by those under 21.", "We interviewed representatives of four issuers of affinity credit cards\u2014 Bank of America (FIA Services), Capital One, Chase, and U.S. Bank\u2014 that had 91 percent of such cardholders in 2012.

These six organizations were chosen because they had among the  largest number of affinity cards (as determined by number of  cardholders), had cards from the three affinity card issuers with the most  agreements, and included one organization (Washington University) that  had previously chosen to end its affinity agreement.
