Serious financial problems can adversely affect unit morale and readiness as well as servicemembers' credit history and military career. DOD has tools such as off-limits lists to help curb the use and effects of predatory loans. GAO answered two questions: (1) To what extent do active duty servicemembers use consumer loans considered to be predatory in nature? and (2) Are DOD and active duty servicemembers fully utilizing the tools that DOD has to curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which active duty servicemembers use consumer loans considered to be predatory and the effects of that borrowing are unknown. The only DOD-wide data come from surveys. In a 2004 survey, 12 percent of servicemembers said they or their spouse had used, during the last 12 months, at least one of four types of loans: payday, rent-to-own, automobile title pawn, or tax refund, which DOD says can often be associated with predatory lending practices. DOD is unable to quantify the extent to which the loans have associated predatory practices, the frequency of such borrowing, the amounts borrowed, or the effects of the loans. Although not generalizable, participants in GAO's 60 focus groups at 13 bases in the United States and Germany identified problems resulting from the use of short-term consumer loans, but other participants described the loans as quick, easy, and obtainable by servicemembers with bad credit. Privacy concerns and the reluctance of servicemembers to reveal financial problems make it difficult to quantify the use and effects of predatory lending. DOD and active duty servicemembers are not fully utilizing DOD's tools for curbing the use and effects of predatory lending practices. At some of the installations that we visited, the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board--a panel that can recommend to an installation commander that a business be placed off-limits to servicemembers--had not met in over a year. Fort Drum's board, for example, had not met in about 4 years, even though the New York Attorney General had filed two lending-related lawsuits against businesses on behalf of servicemembers and some of their family members at Fort Drum. DOD officials told us the reasons for boards not meeting or making recommendations include high deployment levels and the effort required to place a business on an off-limits list. Other commanders effectively changed businesses' predatory practices by using their board's recommendations to place or threaten to place the businesses off-limits. In addition, DOD is not always providing a clear message regarding advertising in installation publications. Participants in GAO's focus groups said they were confused because DOD-provided financial management training (described in our 2005 report, Military Personnel: More DOD Actions Needed to Address Servicemembers' Personal Financial Management Issues) warned them against using payday lenders but some installation newspapers carried advertisements for such businesses. These problems occur even though a DOD instruction requires (1) a disclaimer indicating that the advertisement does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. government and (2) a review by public affairs staff to determine if the advertisement might be detrimental to servicemembers. Our review of some installation newspapers showed possible reasons for the confusion; the disclaimers were often not prominently displayed or were located away from the advertisements. DOD also offers servicemembers free legal review of contracts and other financial transactions, but servicemembers often do not use the reviews until problems result. Recently, DOD began exploring additional on-installation alternatives to payday loans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has expressed continuing concerns  about servicemembers\u2019 use of predatory consumer loans. These loans can  result in financial problems that may lead to severe negative consequences  for the military as a whole (e.g., decreases in unit readiness and morale) as  well as for the servicemembers themselves (e.g., criminal and adverse  personnel actions, including possible discharge from the military).  \u201cPredatory lending\u201d has no precise definition, but is generally used to  describe cases in which a lender takes unfair advantage of a borrower,  sometimes through deception, fraud, or manipulation, to make a loan that  contains terms that are disadvantageous to the borrower. DOD policy  officials have expressed concerns over certain types of high-cost, short- term consumer loans that are typically provided by lenders who lie outside  the system of federally insured financial institutions. These include payday  loans, rent-to-own loans, automobile title pawn loans, and tax refund loans.", "DOD has a number of tools to address the use and effects of loans that it  considers predatory. These tools include: (1) the Armed Forces  Disciplinary Control Boards, which can make recommendations to  installation commanders who can then use or threaten to use their  \u201coff-limits\u201d authority to prohibit servicemembers from using a business that  engages in predatory lending practices; (2) free legal assistance with  contracts and other financial transactions; and (3) personal financial  management (PFM) programs that offer servicemembers assistance, such  as financial management training and counseling. In addition, DOD has  encouraged servicemembers to seek, for example, payday loan alternatives  available from on-installation banks, on-installation credit unions, and  service-affiliated relief/aid societies.", "This report supplements the information we provided to you in our  February 2004 report on bankruptcies among active duty servicemembers,  and our April 2005 report on the financial conditions of deployed  servicemembers and the financial management assistance and training  provided to servicemembers. For this report, we agreed with your staff to  answer two questions: (1) To what extent do active duty servicemembers  use consumer loans considered to be predatory in nature? and (2) Are DOD  and active duty servicemembers fully utilizing the tools that DOD has to  curb the use and effects of predatory lending practices?", "In addressing these two questions, we limited the scope of our work to  active duty personnel and emphasized junior enlisted servicemembers (i.e.,  pay grades E1 to E4) because DOD and service officials have indicated that  this subgroup\u2014whose basic pay currently ranges from about $1,200 to  $1,900 per month\u2014is most likely to encounter financial problems.  Numerous methods were used to gather and assess information for this  work. We examined DOD and service policies and tools for assisting  servicemembers with their financial management, establishing and using  Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards, and advertising in installation  publications. In addition, we reviewed reports by GAO, other congressional  research offices, DOD, and other organizations. We contacted the Federal  Trade Commission to ascertain what data were available through Military  Sentinel regarding the types of consumer complaints servicemembers filed  against businesses. We interviewed DOD and service policy officials and  officials from organizations such as the Consumer Federation of America\u2014 a consumer advocacy group\u2014and the Community Financial Services  Association of America\u2014a payday lending association\u2014to understand the  different perspectives about servicemembers\u2019 use of short-term consumer  loans. During site visits to 13 military installations in the United States and  Germany, we requested documents pertaining to predatory lending such as  guidance or instructions regarding predatory lending activities at the  installations and training materials; used structured questionnaires to  gather data from a variety of personnel on the 13 installations: command  leaders, PFM program managers, command financial counselors, legal  assistance attorneys, senior noncommissioned officers (pay grades E8 to  E9), chaplains, and staff from the military relief/aid societies; and  conducted 60 focus groups composed of over 400 junior (pay grades E1 to  E4) and senior (pay grades E5 to E9) enlisted servicemembers, company  grade officers (pay grade O1 to O3), and servicemembers\u2019 spouses. In  addition, we administered a questionnaire to participants in the focus  groups to collect supplemental information. While data from these four  types of homogeneously composed focus groups are not generalizable to  the entire DOD population of active duty servicemembers, the data provide  context for understanding lending/borrowing and PFM issues. In addition,  we conducted group interviews of personnel affiliated with the PFM  programs while they attended a November 2004 conference. We reviewed  14 installation newspapers and examined the disclaimers and  advertisements in these newspapers during the course of our review. We  reviewed information in DOD\u2019s August 2004 active duty survey related to  findings for four types of loans: payday, rent-to-own, automobile title pawn,  and tax refund, which DOD says may include predatory practices. The  August 2004 survey had a response rate of 40 percent. DOD has conducted  and reported on research to assess the impact of this response rate on  overall estimates. They found that, among other characteristics, junior  enlisted personnel (E1 to E4), servicemembers who do not have a college  degree, and members in services other than the Air Force were more likely  to be nonrespondents. We found the data sufficiently reliable to address  our objectives. We performed our work from March 2004 through February  2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials have expressed concern that servicemembers are often the  victims of predatory lending practices by certain types of lenders who  typically lie outside the system of traditional financial institutions such as  banks. These lenders offer alternative access to cash for consumers with  low incomes or poor credit records, and generally do so without standard  credit checks. The fees charged for these alternative loans are generally  much higher than those charged by traditional financial institutions, and  other terms and conditions of such loans are often unfavorable to the  borrower. As a result, some federal, state, and consumer advocacy agencies  have expressed concern that many of these alternative loans could include  predatory practices. The most common of these loans include the  following:  Payday loans, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their  next paycheck or deposit of funds. These loans typically have high fees  and are often rolled over repeatedly, which can make the cost of  borrowing\u2014expressed as an annual percentage rate\u2014extremely high.", "Rent-to-own loans, according to the Federal Trade Commission, provide  immediate access to household goods (such as furniture and  appliances) for a relatively low weekly or monthly payment, typically  without any down payment or credit check. Consumers have the option  of purchasing the goods by continuing to pay \u201crent\u201d for a specified  period of time\u2014however; the effective cost of the goods may be two to  three times the retail price.", "Automobile title pawns provide short-term loans to borrowers who give  the lender the title to their car as collateral for the loan. Effective  interest rates are generally very high.", "Tax refund loans provide cash loans against the borrower\u2019s expected  income tax refund.", "Senior DOD and service officials have noted that such loans may have  associated predatory lending practices, which can be detrimental to  servicemembers who choose these loans as a way to overcome immediate  needs for cash. The fees for loans such as the payday loans provide a  general indication of the loans\u2019 potential detrimental financial effects on  servicemembers\u2019 finances. The Community Financial Services Association  of America, a payday-advance trade association, which says that it  represents more than half of the payday advance industry, developed a set  of best practices for its member companies. Among other things, the  association\u2019s best practices limit the number of extensions for outstanding advances. Association representatives noted that borrowers select payday  loans over other alternatives for a number of reasons. For example, in  some instances, the officials stated that the individual may not have the  good credit history required to borrow from a bank or credit union. In other  instances, an individual might use a payday loan to avoid a bounced check  fee, late payment penalty, or reconnection fees associated with the late  payment of a utility bill. The Congressional Research Service estimated  that the number of payday loan offices nationwide increased from  approximately 300 in 1992 to almost 15,000 in 2002, and the total dollar  volume of payday loans in 2002 was about $25 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Consumer Loans That Are Considered Predatory Is Unknown, but Sources Say Predatory Lenders May Be Targeting Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["The extent to which active duty servicemembers use consumer loans  considered to be predatory and the effects of such borrowing are unknown,  but many sources suggest that predatory lenders may be targeting  servicemembers.

The only DOD-wide statistics on servicemembers\u2019 use of  loans are obtained from surveys. In the August 2004 DOD survey,  12 percent of servicemembers indicated that, during the last 12 months,  they or their spouse had used at least one of the four specified types of  financial loans that DOD says may have associated predatory practices.  Seven percent of servicemembers indicated they (or their spouse) had  obtained payday loans; 4 percent had obtained rent-to-own loans, 1 percent  had obtained automobile title pawn loans, and 6 percent had obtained tax  refund loans. While only 2 percent of the officers had used any of the four  financial transactions, 14 percent of the junior and 13 percent of the senior  enlisted servicemembers had used at least one such loan. Although not  generalizable to all active duty servicemembers and their spouses, some of  the more than 400 participants in our 60 focus groups reported  encountering problems when they used the short-term consumer loans;  while other servicemembers said such loans have positive elements such as  being quick, easy, and obtainable even if servicemembers had a bad credit  history (see app. II for example comments).", "DOD\u2019s efforts to assess predatory lending are hampered by the lack of a  precise definition of predatory lending\u2014a problem shared with other  organizations attempting to quantify the use and effects of predatory loans.  The lack of precision in the definition is found in DOD\u2019s acknowledgement  that the four types of loans may (i.e., not always) contain predatory lending  practices, but other DOD statements state that payday lending is predatory,  without including a qualifier. Imprecision in the definition and the way the  questions are asked on surveys can affect results. For example, the  percentage of servicemembers who reported using the various types of  loans may be larger than the percentage of servicemembers who would  have said they obtained a predatory loan, had the question been oriented  somewhat differently. Other important issues not addressed in the survey  but needed to quantify the extent and effects of borrowing from lenders  that may use predatory lending practices include questions on the  frequency of use, amounts borrowed, negative and positive effects of the  loans, and any problems encountered during the transactions.", "DOD, service, and installation officials maintained that obtaining data on  the use and effects of predatory lending are also hampered because of  privacy considerations and the reluctance of most servicemembers to  discuss their financial difficulties with their command. Installation officials  told us that they are likely to learn about servicemembers\u2019 use of the  previously cited types of loans only when a situation has become serious  enough to warrant creditors contacting the command or servicemembers  contacting either financial counselors or legal assistance attorneys on the  installations.

The report further suggested that deploying servicemembers are more  vulnerable targets than their nondeploying peers because the former often  must get their finances in order quickly and leave behind spouses who may  not know how to manage the family\u2019s finances. The report noted several  financial practices that it considered \u201cconsumer scams\u201d aimed at  servicemembers. These included payday loans, rent-to-own transactions,  and automobile title pawns.", "Some state officials have also suggested that payday lenders\u2014a type of  predatory lending according to DOD\u2014target servicemembers. For  example, the Georgia General Assembly has recently determined as part of  its new antipayday lending legislation that despite its illegality, payday  lending was growing in Georgia and having an adverse effect on servicemembers and others in the state. Similarly, the Florida governor\u2019s  2004 statement to the Committee on Senate Armed Services, Subcommittee  on Personnel, noted that Florida had regulated activities of payday loan  and check cashing businesses that traditionally target servicemembers. In  2004, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness posted  an issue paper on its Web site to the National Governors Association that  addressed payday lending and other personnel issues. Regarding payday  lending, the Under Secretary stated that \u201cPayday lending practices have  proven to be detrimental to servicemembers who have chosen these loans  as a way of overcoming immediate needs for cash\u2026Statutes that cap small  loan interest rates and establish usury ceilings help protect vulnerable  servicemembers from the usury nature of payday loans and their  associated predatory practices.\u201d", "According to a 2004 Consumer Federation of America study, 15 states  prohibit or limit payday lending through laws on interest rate caps for small  loans, usury laws, or specific prohibitions for check cashers.

Figure 1 shows these 15  states identified by the Consumer Federation of America, along with  information on the number of active duty servicemembers on installations  in each state. Even in those states that prohibit or otherwise regulate  payday loans, servicemembers may be able to obtain such loans.

For example, at three of the installations, the  board had not met for more than a year and, therefore, may not have  adequately addressed whether actions were needed against businesses  whose practices negatively affected servicemembers. The board at Fort  Bragg, North Carolina, had not met for over a year and the board at Fort  Stewart, Georgia, had not met since 2003 because the Directors for both  boards had deployed to Iraq. The board at Fort Drum, New York, had not  met in about 4 years because the board\u2019s Director did not see a reason to  convene. He was not aware of two recent, lending-related lawsuits filed by  the New York Attorney General that had connections with Fort Drum  servicemembers.", "The Attorney General settled a lawsuit in 2004 in behalf of 177  plaintiffs\u2014most of whom were Fort Drum servicemembers\u2014involving  a furniture store that had improperly garnished wages pursuant to  unlawful agreements it had required customers to sign at the time of  purchase.", "The Attorney General filed a lawsuit in 2004 involving catalog sales  stores. He characterized the stores as payday-lending firms that charged  excessive interest rates on loans disguised as payments toward catalog  purchases. Some of the servicemembers and family members at Fort  Drum fell prey to this practice. The Attorney General stated that he  found it particularly troubling that two of the catalog stores were  located near the Fort Drum gate.", "The Garrison Commander at Fort Drum and a representative of the board  said that had they known about these cases, they would have considered  placing the businesses on the off-limits list. Legal assistance attorneys at  Fort Drum were, however, aware of the legal actions by the New York  Attorney General. By not making full use of the boards, commanders may  not be doing all they can to help servicemembers avoid businesses that  employ predatory practices.", "According to officials at the installations we visited, the boards might not  be used as a tool for dealing with predatory lenders for a variety of reasons.  First, high deployment levels have resulted in commanders minimizing  some administrative duties, such as convening the boards, in order to use  their personnel for other purposes. Second, as long as the lenders operate  within state laws, the boards may determine they have little basis to  recommend placing or threatening to place businesses on the off-limits  lists. Third, significant effort may be required to put businesses on off- limits lists. At the installations we visited, the boards\u2019 composition included  representatives from functional areas like public works, family community  services, legal counsel, safety, and public affairs.", "In contrast, businesses near two other installations we visited changed  their lending practices after boards recommended that commanders place  or threaten to place businesses on off-limits lists. The Commander of the  Navy Region Southwest\u2019s board identified actions that were based on the  board\u2019s recommendations against businesses committing illegal acts or  taking unfair advantage of servicemembers. For example, in October 2002,  a company was placed off-limits because it represented itself as a  government agency when arranging loan-repayment allotments with  servicemembers, threatened debtors with court-martial for nonpayment,  and wrote loans that had interest rates of 60 percent. Similarly, the board at  Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, threatened to take action against a lender  that was charging 33.1 percent interest and requiring servicemembers to  waive their rights set forth by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The  business avoided being placed on the installation\u2019s off-limits list by  terminating two employees and changing some of its business practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advertising in Installation Newspapers Could Confuse Servicemembers about Whether the Military Endorses Payday Lenders", "paragraphs": ["In some instances, DOD is not providing a clear message about whether it  endorses advertisers in official installation newspapers. Some  servicemembers in our focus groups said they were confused about  whether the military endorses the businesses that advertise in installation  newspapers, and the confusion could lead servicemembers to use a type of  business that DOD has labeled as potentially having predatory lending  practices. Earlier, a 2003 Army publication stated that payday loan  advertisements appear in official and unofficial military publications, and  readers often incorrectly assume that military officials have approved the  businesses and their claims. A DOD instruction requires installation  publications to run disclaimers warning readers that advertisements do not  constitute endorsement by the U.S. government. The instruction also  requires public affairs staffs to oversee the appropriateness of  advertisements in installation publications. Among other things, the  public affairs staff is to review advertisements and identify any that may be  detrimental to DOD personnel or their family members. If an advertisement  is found to be detrimental, the public affairs staff is to take steps to either  have the advertisement removed by the publisher or report the situation to  the installation commander who can act to preclude distribution of the  publication on the installation.", "Servicemembers\u2019 confusion about businesses\u2019 advertisements may have  multiple causes. First, readers may not see the advertising disclaimer. We  reviewed 14 installation newspapers and found that all of them contained a  disclaimer; however, we also observed that the disclaimers were typically  (1) included only once in the newspaper, (2) listed with other  administrative notices such as statements identifying the publisher and the  availability of advertised items, and (3) located remotely from many of the  advertisements. Second, advertisements for some types of businesses may  run contrary to official DOD statements about the use of those businesses.  Servicemembers participating in our focus groups said they were confused  because DOD officials and information provided during PFM training  warned against using payday lenders but such lenders were allowed to  advertise in installation newspapers. We observed two such advertisements  for a payday lender during our review of the 14 installation newspapers,  and PFM program managers wrote comments about this issue when  responding to a GAO survey of all PFM managers. Third, there is confusion  about which businesses do and do not use predatory lending practices. For  example, the PFM program manager at one installation identified a  particular car financing business as predatory, but the PFM program  manager at another installation sometimes directs servicemembers to this  same business when they have had past credit problems that limit their  loan options. Fourth, legal assistance attorneys on some of the installations  we visited told us that lenders and other businesses are free to advertise in  the newspapers. A potential negative effect of the confusion regarding  whether businesses are approved and endorsed by the installation is that  servicemembers may use types of businesses that DOD policy officials  have determined to be predatory, rather than seeking assistance through  alternatives such as military relief/aid societies identified by the installation  PFM program manager and staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Servicemembers Do Not Make Full Use of Free DOD- Provided Legal Assistance for Financial Issues", "paragraphs": ["Servicemembers do not take full advantage of free DOD-provided legal  assistance on contracts and other financial documents.

One credit union that we visited advertised a loan alternative  called QuickCash, which had an annual percentage rate of 18 percent.

The Army Emergency Relief Society has  attempted to address the time and intrusiveness concerns with its test  program, Commander\u2019s Referral, for active duty soldiers lacking funds to  meet monthly obligations of $500 or less.

Furthermore, although military installations  appear to be meeting current requirements regarding disclaimers for  advertisements in installation publications, the location of the disclaimer  has resulted in unclear messages to some servicemembers about whether  inclusion of certain advertisements constitutes approval or endorsement of  the business by DOD. In addition, some servicemembers have been  confused when the content of some advertisements is contrary to official  DOD statements regarding the use of lenders who may use predatory  lending practices. This confusion is particularly problematic because it  may harm DOD\u2019s efforts to reduce the use and effects of predatory lending  practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense:  To improve DOD\u2019s ability to curb the use and effects of predatory  lending practices, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to amend  existing regulations to require installation commanders to convene the  Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards at least semiannually to  investigate and make recommendations to commanders on matters  related to eliminating conditions which adversely affect the health,  safety, morals, welfare, morale, and discipline of the Armed Forces, to  include servicemembers\u2019 use of lenders who may use predatory lending  practices.", "To ensure DOD provides servicemembers a clear message about  whether it endorses advertisers in official installation newspapers that  may use predatory lending practices, we recommend that the Secretary  of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs to  clarify the regulations pertaining to advertisements in installation  publications by requiring disclaimers to be more prominent and taking  steps to ensure advertisements reflect stated DOD policies regarding  what it considers to be predatory lending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with our  recommendation to clarify regulations pertaining to advertisements in  installation publications and partially concurred with our recommendation  to amend regulations to require at least semiannual meetings of the Armed  Forces Disciplinary Control Boards.", "In its comments, DOD noted that it is in the initial stages of staffing and  coordinating changes to the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards\u2019  joint regulations and will take two actions\u2014require boards to meet four  (instead of two) times a year and direct that businesses on the off-limits list  for one service be off-limits for all services.  Although DOD\u2019s comments  dealt primarily with the issue of payday lending, the intent of our  recommendation was to address all types of consumer predatory lending  encountered by servicemembers.  Moreover, DOD\u2019s actions will go even  further than our recommendation suggested.  DOD also noted that the  boards\u2019 process would be an ineffectual deterrent against payday lenders  for several reasons.  For example, it stated that the boards\u2019 process would  be ineffectual because of the difficulty in providing adequate oversight of  all payday lending businesses and noted that installation commanders may  have to develop criteria outside of state statutes for the 35 states where  payday lending is legal.  Our draft report had already noted that boards may  have little basis for recommending or threatening to place businesses on an  off-limits list when lenders operate within state laws.  Our recommendation  will (1) require the boards to meet regularly and (2) provide installation  commanders additional focus and oversight into conditions that may  adversely affect servicemembers on their installations.  Implementing our  recommendation does not require installation commanders to monitor all  payday lending businesses; instead, it is intended to provide commanders  with a routine process for reviewing and taking appropriate action against  those lenders that adversely affect servicemembers on the commanders\u2019  installation.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III.

While performing our work, we visited  13 installations with high deployment levels, as identified by service  officials (see table 1). During these site visits to installations in the United  States and Germany, special emphasis was given to ascertaining the  financial conditions of junior enlisted servicemembers because the  Department of Defense (DOD) and service officials have reported that this  subgroup is more likely to encounter financial problems.", "To address servicemembers use of consumer loans considered to be  predatory in nature, we reviewed and analyzed laws, policies, and  directives\u2014such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulation 7000.14R, Volume7A. We also reviewed  and analyzed lending-related findings and perspectives contained in  publications issued by GAO, DOD, Congressional Research Service,  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, Federal Trade Commission, state government officials,  consumer groups (Consumer Federation of America and National  Consumer Law Center), and an association that says it represents around  50 percent of payday lenders (Community Financial Services Association  of America). We reviewed a 2004 Consumer Federation of America study,  which cited 15 states that prohibit or limit payday lending through laws on  interest rate caps for small loans, usury laws, or specific prohibitions for  check cashers. We did not independently verify that these 15 states, in fact,  do prohibit this activity, nor did we review laws in the other 35 states. We  also contacted the Federal Trade Commission and ascertained that its  Military Sentinel database has little information on servicemembers\u2019  complaints against businesses. We interviewed DOD and service policy  officials, as well as representatives of consumer groups and a payday  association. During our 13 site visits, we developed and used structured  questionnaires for interviews with seven types of officials: installation  leaders, personal financial management (PFM) program managers,  command financial counselors, senior noncommissioned officers (pay  grades E8 to E9), legal assistance attorneys, chaplains, and relief/aid  societies. We used a structured protocol for conducting 60 focus groups  with over 400 individuals who met in four homogeneous types of groups:  junior enlisted servicemembers (pay grades E1 to E4), noncommissioned  officers (pay grades E5 to E9), company-grade officers (pay grades O1 to  O3), and spouses of servicemembers. In addition, we constructed,  pretested, and administered a survey to participants in the focus groups to  collect supplemental information that may have been difficult to collect in  a group setting. We also obtained data from an August 2004 DOD-wide  survey to assess its reliability and determine prevalence rates for four  types of loans that DOD says may contain predatory practices. The August  2004 survey had a response rate of 40 percent. DOD has conducted and  reported on research to assess the impact of this response rate on overall  estimates. They found that, among other characteristics, junior enlisted  personnel (E1 to E4), servicemembers who do not have a college degree,  and members in services other than the Air Force were more likely to be  nonrespondents. We have no reason to believe that potential non-response  bias in the estimates, not otherwise accounted for by DOD\u2019s research, is  substantial for the variables we studied in this report.  Therefore, we  concluded the data to be sufficiently reliable to address our objectives. We  found the data sufficiently reliable to address our objectives. This  information was supplemented with information obtained from three group  discussions with a total of 50 personnel affiliated with the PFM programs  while they attended a November 2004 conference.", "To assess whether DOD was fully utilizing the tools that it has to curb the  use and effects of predatory lending practices, we obtained information  from the laws, policies, directives, and reports that were used to address  servicemembers\u2019 use of loans that DOD considered to be predatory in  nature. DOD and service policy officials identified DOD\u2019s primary tools for  curbing the use and effects of predatory loans. These individuals also  supplied their perspectives on how fully utilized those tools were. Similarly,  individual interviews and focus groups with others who supplied  information on the question related to servicemembers\u2019 use of consumer  loans also provided their perspectives on how fully the tools were used, the  effects of underutilizing the tools, and possible reasons that some tools  were not used more fully. In addition, we examined official installation  newspapers to determine whether they contained disclaimers and  advertisements for loans that DOD officials say may contain predatory  practices. This examination of newspapers was just a cursory review and  was not based on any sort of random sampling. Interviews with  representatives of on-installation credit unions and national military  relief/aid societies provided input about alternatives to payday loans.", "We performed our work from March 2004 through February 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Predatory Lending Findings from GAO-Led Focus Groups Held at 13 Installations", "paragraphs": ["We held focus group sessions at the 13 military installations we visited  during the course of this engagement to obtain servicemembers\u2019  perspectives on a broad range of topics, including the impact of  deployment on servicemembers\u2019 finances and the types of lenders military  families use, along with the personal financial management (PFM) training  and assistance provided to servicemembers by the Department of Defense  (DOD) and service programs (see app. I for a list of installations visited).  Servicemembers who participated in the focus groups were divided into  three groups: junior enlisted personnel (pay grades E1 through E4), senior  enlisted personnel (pay grades E5 through E9), and junior officers (pay  grades O1 through O3). Although we requested to meet with  servicemembers who had returned from a deployment within the last  12 months, some servicemembers who had not yet deployed also  participated in the focus groups. At some installations, we also held  separate focus groups with spouses of servicemembers. Most of the focus  groups consisted of 6 to 12 participants.", "We developed a standard protocol, with seven central questions and  several follow-up questions, to assist the GAO moderator in leading the  focus group discussions. The protocol was pretested during our first  installation visit, and, after minor changes, was used at the remaining 12  installations. During each focus group session, the GAO moderator posed  questions to participants who, in turn, provided their perspectives on the  topics presented. We essentially used the same questions for each focus  group, with some slight variations to questions posed to the spouse groups.  Questions and sample responses are listed below.", "We sorted the 2,090 summary statements resulting from the 60 focus  groups into categories of themes through a systematic content analysis.

Before the question was asked we attempted to provide  participants with a general context for answering the question by reading  the following information: \u201cNow we would like to talk about specific  problems with predatory lenders. These include lenders that charge  excessive fees and interest rates and those that lend without regard to  borrowers\u2019 ability to repay\u2014usually lending to those with limited income  or poor or no credit. Some payday lenders and fast checking places that  charge high interest rates may fall into this category.
