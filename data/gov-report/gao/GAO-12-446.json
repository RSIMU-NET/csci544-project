The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires GAO to study the administration of the CHS program, including a focus on the allocation of funds. IHS uses three primary methods to determine the allocation of CHS funds to the 12 IHS geographic area offices: base funding, which accounts for most of the allocation; annual adjustments; and program increases, which are provided to expand the CHS program. GAO examined (1) the extent to which IHS\u0092s allocation of CHS funding varied across IHS areas, and (2) what steps IHS has taken to address funding variation within the CHS program.

Per capita CHS funding for fiscal year 2010 also varied widely, ranging across the areas from $299 to $801 and was sometimes not related to the areas\u0092 dependence on CHS inpatient services, as determined by the availability of IHS-funded hospitals. The allocation pattern of per capita CHS funds has been generally maintained from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2010. This is due to the reliance on base funding\u0097which incorporates all CHS funding from the prior year to establish a new base each year\u0097and accounts for the majority of funding. In fiscal year 2010, when CHS had its largest program increase and base funding was the smallest proportion of funding for any year, base funding still accounted for 82 percent of total CHS funds allocated to areas. Further, allocations of program increase funds are largely dependent on an estimate of CHS service users that is imprecise. IHS counts all users who obtained at least one service either funded by CHS or provided directly from an IHS-funded facility during the preceding 3-year period. This count therefore includes an unknown number of individuals who received IHS direct care only and who had not received contract health services.", "IHS has taken few steps to evaluate funding variation within the CHS program and IHS\u0092s ability to address funding variations is limited by statute. IHS officials told GAO that the agency has not evaluated the effectiveness of base funding and the CHS Allocation Formula. Without such assessments, IHS cannot determine the extent to which the current variation in CHS funding accurately reflects variation in health care needs. While IHS has formed a workgroup to evaluate the existing formula for allocating program increases, the workgroup recommended, and the Director of IHS concurred, that the CHS Allocation Formula for distributing program increases would not be evaluated until at least 2013. The workgroup members maintained that the CHS program had only begun receiving substantial increases in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and the full impact of these increases needed to be reviewed before making recommendations to change the formula. However, GAO found that IHS has used the formula to allocate program increases, at least in part, in 5 years since 2001. GAO also concluded that, because of the predominant influence of base funding and the relatively small contribution of program increases to overall CHS funding, it would take many years to achieve funding equity just by revising the methods for distributing CHS program increase funds. Further, federal law restricts IHS\u0092s ability to reallocate funding, specifically limiting reductions in funding for certain tribally-operated programs, including some CHS programs, and imposing a congressional reporting requirement for proposed reductions in base funding of 5 percent or more.

For example, in 1982, we recommended that IHS abandon its  reliance on base funding in order to distribute its funds more equitably;  IHS did not agree with the recommendation.

IHS, among other things, sets program policy for  and allocates CHS program funds to the area offices. The area offices  distribute funds to individual federally operated and tribally operated CHS  programs that purchase contract care services from outside providers.  There can be multiple individual CHS programs within an area. Tribes  currently administer 177 of the 243 (73 percent) individual CHS programs  and receive about 54 percent of IHS\u2019s funding for CHS. In addition to  receiving federal funding through IHS, the tribes may provide  supplemental funds to the CHS programs they administer.", "Patients must meet certain eligibility, administrative, and medical priority  requirements to have their services paid for by the CHS program.  Generally, to be eligible to receive services through the CHS program,  patients must reside on a reservation or within a reservation\u2019s federally  established CHS Delivery Areas and be members of a tribe or tribes  located on that reservation or maintain close economic and social ties  with that tribe or tribes. In addition, if there are alternate health care  resources available to a patient, such as Medicaid and Medicare, these  resources must pay for services first because the CHS program is  generally the payer of last resort. If a patient has met these  requirements, a program committee (often including medical staff), which  is part of the local CHS program, evaluates the medical necessity of the  service. IHS has established four broad medical priority levels of health   and each area office is required to  care services eligible for payment,establish priorities that are consistent with these medical priority levels.  Because IHS typically does not have enough funds to pay for all CHS  services requested, federal CHS programs pay first for emergency and  acutely urgent medical care to the extent funds are available. They may  then pay for all or only some of the lower-priority services they fund, funds  permitting. Tribal CHS programs must use medical priorities when making  funding decisions, but unlike federal CHS programs, they may develop a  system that differs from the set of priorities established by IHS.", "There are two primary paths through which patients may have their care  paid for by the federal CHS program. First, a patient may obtain a  referral from a provider at an IHS-funded health care facility to receive  services from an external provider. That referral is submitted to the CHS  program for review. If the patient meets the requirements and the CHS  program has funding available, the services in the referral are approved  by the CHS program and a purchase order is issued to the external  provider and sent to IHS\u2019s fiscal intermediary. Once the patient receives  the services from the external provider, that provider obtains payment for  the services in the approved referral by sending a claim to IHS\u2019s fiscal  intermediary. Second, in the case of an emergency, the patient may seek  care from an external provider without first obtaining a referral. Once that  care is provided, the external provider must send the patient\u2019s medical  records and a claim for payment to the CHS program. At that time, the  CHS program will determine if the patient met the necessary program  requirements and if CHS funding is available for a purchase order to be  issued and sent to the fiscal intermediary.

IHS uses these methods sequentially. Base funding is the  amount of CHS funds that equal the total amount of all CHS funds that  each area received in the prior fiscal year. When appropriations for CHS  are higher than the amount needed for base funding, IHS uses national  measurements of population growth and inflation to determine annual  funding adjustments. Each IHS area office receives the same percentage  increase for the annual adjustments. Since 2001, when IHS has also  received additional funding for what it refers to as \u201cprogram increases,\u201d  IHS has used the CHS Allocation Formula to determine how to allocate  those program increases to the 12 area offices. According to IHS officials,  IHS established the CHS Allocation Formula in part to ensure that  American Indians and Alaska Natives had equitable access to contract  health funds. The Allocation Formula is based on a combination of  factors, including variations in the number of people using health care  services, geographic differences in the costs of purchasing health care  services, and access to IHS or tribally operated hospitals.", "Most CHS funding, which IHS refers to as \u201cbase funding,\u201d is allocated  based on past funding history. Each year, each of the 12 IHS area offices  receives an allocation of base funding equal to the total amount of all  CHS funds they received the previous fiscal year. According to IHS, base  funding is intended to maintain existing levels of patient care services in  all areas. Because of adjustments or funding increases that are received  in most years, a new level of base funding is created in those years. IHS  officials have told us they do not know the exact origins of the base  funding policy, but that it dates back to the 1930s, when the health  programs were under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1954, Congress  transferred responsibility for the maintenance and operation of hospitals  and health facilities for Indians from the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the  Department of the Interior to what is now IHS in HHS.", "When appropriations for CHS are above the previous fiscal year\u2019s level,  IHS allocates each area office an additional amount to adjust for overall  population growth and inflation. The population growth funding  adjustment is based on national population increases determined by the  U.S. Census Bureau with annual adjustments made for changes based  on state birth and death data provided by the National Center for Health  Statistics. The inflation adjustment is based on the prevailing Bureau of  Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Price Index for medical costs. IHS gives each  area the same percentage increase to its base funding regardless of any  population growth or cost-of-living differences among areas. IHS receives increases in CHS funding that are large enough that the  agency can allocate at least some for annual adjustments, even if not the  full amount. The funding adjustments for population growth and inflation  provided to the area offices are incorporated into the next year\u2019s base  funding.", "In fiscal year 2009, each individual CHS program received a 1.5 percent adjustment for  population growth and a 3.8 percent adjustment for inflation.

It is based on a price index derived from the American  Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association Regional Cost of  Living index, which provides regional comparative costs for inpatient  and outpatient services. The price index for each CHS program is  multiplied by the active user population for each program to determine  the value of the cost adjustment factor.", "The access to care factor provides an additional increase only for  those individual CHS programs that do not have access to an IHS or  tribally operated hospital. IHS area officials determine if individual  CHS programs meet two qualifying criteria for this factor: (1) the  individual CHS program has no IHS or tribally operated hospital with  an average daily patient load of five or more, and (2) the individual  CHS program does not have an established referral pattern to an IHS  or tribally operated hospital within the area. These additional funds  are allocated to each program where there is no access to an IHS or  tribally operated hospital in an amount proportional to the cost  adjustment factor.", "To allocate the program increase funding, IHS first designates 75 percent  of the funds for increases based on the cost adjustment factor at each  individual CHS program and 25 percent of the funds for the increases  based on the access to care factor at each individual CHS program.

On average, areas were allocated about three times as much in per  capita direct care funding as they were in per capita CHS funding. We  also found that, in general, the areas that were allocated higher amounts  of per capita direct care funding were also allocated higher amounts of  per capita CHS funding, and those areas that were allocated lower  amounts of per capita direct care funding were also allocated lower  amounts of per capita CHS funding. The notable exceptions were Alaska,  which was allocated much more in per capita direct care funding than  average, and Portland and Tucson, which were allocated much less in  per capita direct care funding than average. Alaska was allocated per  capita direct care funding ($3,340) that was about six times more than its  per capita CHS funding ($548) and was the highest per capita direct care  funding of all the areas, nearly double that of the area with the second  highest per capita funding (Nashville, $1,869). Direct care funding for  Alaska reflects the unique health care challenges that Alaska faces due to  its remoteness and vast distances, which result in some of the highest  costs for health care services in the United States. In contrast, the lower  per capita direct care allocations to Tucson and Portland were somewhat  offset by relatively higher levels of per capita CHS funding. Tucson was  allocated the lowest per capita direct care funding ($1,324) but it received  the third highest per capita CHS funding ($664). Similarly, Portland\u2019s per  capita direct care funding ($1566) was relatively low, but its per capita  CHS funding ($799), was the second highest.", "In addition to variation in funding across IHS area offices, variation in  funding may exist among individual CHS programs within area offices of  which IHS headquarters is not aware. Some IHS area offices use  methods other than the CHS Allocation Formula to distribute CHS  program increases and IHS does not require the area offices to report  these variations to headquarters.

The standards  further state that an agency must have reliable and timely  communications relating to internal events to run and control its  operations. IHS allows area offices, in consultation with the tribes, to  distribute program increase funds to local CHS programs using different  criteria than the CHS Allocation Formula to meet health care needs in  local communities, but does not require that the areas inform IHS  headquarters.

IHS has not developed policies and  procedures in the Indian Health Manual for its headquarters and field staff  employees on how to conduct assessments of the CHS program funding  methodologies, nor has it included goals, measures, and time frames for  assessing the CHS program funding allocation performance within areas,  which would potentially help IHS and the area offices identify and allocate  CHS program funds to areas and local CHS programs with the greatest  need.", "In March 2010, the Director of IHS formed the Director\u2019s Workgroup on  Improving CHS to review tribal input to improve the CHS program, to  evaluate the existing formula for allocating program increases using the  CHS Allocation Formula, and to recommend improvements in the way  CHS business operations are conducted. The workgroup members  agreed that their recommendations would apply only to program  increases and not to base funding. In February 2011, the Director of IHS  reported that she concurred with the four recommendations made by the  workgroup in October 2010.", "The workgroup recommended that a technical subcommittee be  created and charged with calculating the current CHS need and  estimates of future CHS need. Such information would be essential to  understanding the variation in CHS funding. However, we previously  reported that IHS data on denials and deferrals that IHS used to  estimate program need are incomplete and inconsistent.", "The workgroup recommended convening 12 Area Work Sessions to  review and make recommendations about current CHS policies and  procedures, which would then be used to revise the CHS chapter of  the Indian Health Manual, specifically relating to issues of evaluating  the cost of care and communication of CHS program requirements,  among others. These sessions have been completed and the  workgroup is developing a summary report.", "The workgroup recommended that an evaluation of the current CHS  Allocation Formula be postponed until at least fiscal year 2013. The  workgroup members said that the CHS program had only begun  receiving substantial increases in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and the  full impact of these increases needed to be reviewed before making  recommendations to change the formula. In contrast, we found that  IHS has used the formula to allocate program increases, at least in  part, in 5 years since 2001. Members of the workgroup we interviewed  told us that outcome measures for the evaluation have not yet been  defined. As part of this recommendation, they also suggested that a  subcommittee be created to review the CHS Allocation Formula for  equity across areas. An IHS representative to the workgroup told us  that the recommendations of the subcommittee will not be considered  by the full committee until the review of equity is complete.", "The workgroup recommended that the inpatient and outpatient  components of the Consumer Price Index be used for any new CHS  program increases that IHS may receive for fiscal year 2013 and  beyond.", "Members of the 2010 Director\u2019s Workgroup we spoke with expressed  concern that the CHS Allocation Formula does not differentiate between  large and small hospitals when determining the access to care factor,  although the workgroup did not make a recommendation concerning this  issue. Specifically, programs with access to small hospitals with minimal  services do not receive an adjustment for access to care, and are  therefore treated similarly to programs with access to large medical  centers where a range of specialty care services may be available. As a  result, the CHS Allocation Formula does not equitably compensate for  limitations in hospital access. When the CHS Allocation Formula was  created in 2001, its developers noted that the access to care factor  should be refined to better reflect the complexities of the IHS system of  health care. IHS has neither refined nor made any change to the way that  access to care is defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IHS\u2019s Ability to Address Funding Variations Is Limited by Statute", "paragraphs": ["Federal law restricts IHS\u2019s ability to reallocate funding should the agency  desire to do so. Specifically, IHS officials identified two statutory  provisions that limit IHS\u2019s ability to adjust funding allocations. The Indian  Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act currently prohibits  reductions in funding for certain tribally operated programs, including  some CHS programs, except for limited circumstances. In addition, the  Indian Health Care Improvement Act imposes a congressional reporting  requirement for proposed reductions in base funding for any recurring  program, project, or activity of a service unit of 5 percent or more.officials told us that no such proposal to reallocate base funding has been  transmitted to the Congress.", "IHS officials have told us that areas and tribes have resisted changes to  the current funding allocation methods, particularly base funding, as  consistent funding allows the areas and tribes to plan and manage their  resources. However, minutes from a 2010 session of the Director\u2019s  workgroup show that not all tribes agree with the CHS Allocation Formula  and that some workgroup members said that the current CHS Allocation  Formula was not sufficiently equitable. Concerns about IHS\u2019s funding  methods are longstanding. For example, in 1982, we concluded that  IHS\u2019s practice of funding programs based on the previous year\u2019s funding  level caused funding inequities and that IHS did not distribute funds to the  neediest programs in fiscal year 1981."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["There are wide variations in CHS funding across the 12 IHS areas, and  these variations are largely maintained by IHS\u2019s long-standing use of the  base funding methodology. IHS officials are unable to link variations in  funding levels to any assessment of health care need. As we have  reported in the past and found once again in this evaluation, IHS\u2019s  continued use of the base funding methodology undermines the equitable  allocation of IHS funding to meet the health care needs of American  Indians and Alaska Natives. Program increases for the CHS program  over the years have not significantly altered variations across the areas,  primarily because they are too small to have a strong impact on overall  funding. Funds from the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund, designed  to reduce funding disparities, also have had little impact because they are  relatively small and not targeted solely for the CHS program. Further,  federal law restricts IHS\u2019s ability to reallocate funding, principally by  prohibiting reductions for certain tribally operated CHS programs, which  account for more than half of total CHS funding. IHS also may be  unaware of additional variation in funding across individual CHS  programs because it does not require that area offices notify IHS  headquarters when they choose different funding methodologies than  those suggested by headquarters.", "IHS can improve the equity of how it allocates program increase funds to  areas through improvements in its implementation of the CHS Allocation  Formula, primarily by using counts of actual CHS users rather than by  using the current method of estimating the number of overall IHS users,  which now includes patients who never used a CHS service, and by  refining the access to care factor to account for differences in available  health care services at IHS and tribally operated facilities. However,  because of the predominant influence of base funding and the relatively  small contribution of program increases to overall CHS funding, it would  take many years to achieve funding equity just by revising the methods  for distributing CHS program increase funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure an equitable allocation of CHS program funds, the  Congress should consider requiring IHS to develop and use a new  method to allocate all CHS program funds to account for variations across  areas that would replace the existing base funding, annual adjustment,  and program increase methodologies, notwithstanding any restrictions  currently in federal law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To make IHS\u2019s allocation of CHS program funds more equitable, we  recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct the  Director of the Indian Health Service to take the following three actions for  any future allocation of CHS funds:  require IHS to use actual counts of CHS users, rather than all IHS  users, in any formula for allocating CHS funds that relies on the  number of active users;  require IHS to use variations in levels of available hospital services,  rather than just the existence of a qualifying hospital, in any formula  for allocating CHS funds that contains a hospital access component;  and develop written policies and procedures to require area offices to  notify IHS when changes are made to the allocations of funds to CHS  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments, which  are reprinted in appendix I.

HHS also concurred with our  recommendation to develop written policies to require area offices to  notify IHS when changes are made in the allocations of funds to CHS  programs.

HHS  stated that IHS\u2019s combined count of all users of IHS direct care services  and CHS users is intended to reflect the health care needs of those  eligible for CHS services. However, as we reported, IHS\u2019s own  Data/Technical Workgroup found that the current IHS active user count  does not measure the number of people who are eligible for CHS  services, in part because not all users of IHS direct care services are  eligible for CHS services. Further, as HHS acknowledged in its  comments, the current count of active users also does not reflect those  who actually received CHS services. Because CHS program increases  are intended to reflect variations in the numbers of CHS users among  areas, we continue to believe that IHS should use counts of actual CHS  users in determining program increases.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and  Human Services, Director of the Indian Health Service, appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested parties.
