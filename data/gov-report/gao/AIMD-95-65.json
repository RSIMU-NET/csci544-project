While considerable anecdotal data exist on how long the procurement process takes, very little validated and projectable data have been available on a governmentwide basis.", "To develop such data, we drew a statistically valid sample of all contract award notices published over a 2-year period in the Commerce Business Daily and sent detailed questionnaires to the relevant contracting officers. We received an 81 percent response rate, which represents 2,720 contracts worth almost $16 billion, and stratified the sample by the six agencies with the most contract award notices and by four different dollar ranges\u2014$25,000 to $250,000, $250,000 to $2.5 million, $2.5 million to $25 million, and $25 million and more. We used the data obtained to answer frequently asked questions about IT acquisitions. Details of our objectives, scope, and methodology are contained in appendix I. Statistics for individual agencies are presented in appendix II, and our questionnaire is reprinted in appendix III.", "The federal government spends at least $25 billion annually on IT. As documented in numerous GAO reports, the government often receives too little in improved service, increased efficiency, or lower costs as a result of this investment. While the acquisition process is the focus of much of the concern and frustration with government\u2019s poor return, this lack of success stems from several factors, including (1) ineffective management practices for proposing, selecting, and controlling technology investments, (2) not defining expected outcomes in terms of quality, delivery, and cost, and (3) poorly managing the acquisition process.", "This report addresses factors affecting the third problem area\u2014the IT acquisition process. It provides insights to those interested in this process by comparing key variables that affect the length of the process for the four discrete dollar value ranges and identifying issues requiring further study and analysis. However, care must be taken to ensure that the information provided here is not taken out of context. While this information can be useful in identifying and correcting problems specifically related to IT acquisition, it should be clearly understood that other factors, such as those mentioned above, will also affect how well agencies implement and use IT.", "As such, effectively implementing and using technology is a much broader issue than just the acquisition process. Our recent report on improving agency performance through the effective use of IT demonstrated that successful organizations generally adopt a series of critical management practices to help improve mission performance. We identified 11 of these critical practices, including making a top-level commitment to effectively using IT; establishing direct relationships among the planning, budgeting, and evaluation processes; upgrading skill and knowledge levels; focusing on process improvement; and managing information projects as investments. A critical point that was emphasized throughout the report was that these practices need to be deployed collectively. Improving the IT acquisition process is only one step toward the larger goal of improving the management of IT and ensuring that the full potential of these investments is realized."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The IT acquisition process extends from the initial determination of needs to the final implementation of the acquired product. This report addresses three IT acquisition stages\u2014presolicitation, solicitation, and source selection. During the presolicitation phase, contracting personnel develop specifications, prepare the acquisition plan, and apply for and receive a delegation of procurement authority (DPA). In the solicitation phase, agencies prepare and release the solicitation, respond to vendor questions, and close the solicitation. During source selection, agencies evaluate the proposals, may negotiate with vendors, call for best and final offers, and award the contract.", "Several laws and regulations, including the Brooks Act and the Warner Amendment, the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and the Federal Information Resources Management Regulation (FIRMR), govern these three phases.", "The Brooks Act, 40 U.S.C. 759, gives GSA exclusive authority to procure IT and the power to delegate this authority by issuing a DPA to other federal agencies. GSA has given agencies a blanket delegation, usually $2.5 million, below which they can procure IT resources without requesting a specific DPA from GSA. GSA will raise or lower this blanket authority based on an agency\u2019s history of acquiring IT. For any acquisition above the blanket delegation, agencies must obtain a DPA by submitting an agency procurement request (APR) to GSA.", "The Warner Amendment, 40 U.S.C. Section 759(a)(3)(C), exempts certain Defense IT procurements from the Brooks Act, and thus from the requirement to obtain procurement authority from GSA. These exempted procurements include those that support mission-critical, command and control, and intelligence activities.", "CICA, Public Law 98-369, establishes a policy of full and open competition for all federal procurements. The act requires that contracts with limited competition be formally justified. Such contracts are often awarded as sole source, compatibility limited, or limited to specific make and model.", "CICA also sets forth mechanisms for vendors to protest the government\u2019s procurement actions. Through CICA, protests may be made to the agency, GSA\u2019s Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) for IT resources, the General Accounting Office (GAO), the U.S. District Courts, or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Questions or objections having to do with certain small business or labor matters are reviewed by the Small Business Administration or the Department of Labor.", "The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, Public Law 103-355, was passed in 1994 to streamline the way the government buys goods and services, including IT. Among its provisions, the act authorized the simplified acquisition threshold at $100,000, established pilot programs to test alternative and innovative procurement techniques, promoted electronic commerce, encouraged the use of off-the-shelf purchases, and required contracting personnel to conduct more extensive debriefings to losing offerors. The executive branch is currently developing regulations to implement the act.", "The FAR is the body of procurement regulations that all executive agencies must follow when acquiring different types of supplies and services, including IT.

For those between $250,000 and $25 million, one or two additional steps\u2014the acquisition plan and best and final offer\u2014were sometimes added. Those that were $25 million and above generally had the first five steps plus four additional steps: the APR, DPA, acquisition plan, and best and final offer.", "No one step consistently took the most time. The acquisition steps that took the longest also varied by dollar strata. Specifically, contracts from $25,000 to $250,000 and $2.5 million to $25 million took the longest average time from the presolicitation notice to the release of the solicitation (57 days (36 percent) and 98 days (29 percent), respectively). Procurements of $25 million and above took comparatively more time from the solicitation closing to receipt of the best and final offers (186 days or 28 percent).

In addition to the time taken to resolve the protests, other factors, such as competition type and evaluation method, can also increase the contract award time. As shown in figures 3 and 7, full and open contracts take longer to award than sole source contracts and best value contracts take longer to award than lowest cost contracts. Of the protested contracts that were $25 million and more, 85 percent were full and open and none were sole source. Also, almost 70 percent of those protested contracts used the best value evaluation method. Furthermore, large dollar contracts are much more likely to be protested.
