In its review of 22 grant awards, GAO found that USAID made 13 through its competitive process, 7 through an abbreviated noncompetitive review, and 2 under authorities allowing an expedited emergency response. According to USAID, the agency follows a similar process for cost modification requests. Partners may propose cost or no-cost modifications for a variety of reasons, such as an increase in the number of beneficiaries or changing market conditions affecting food prices. In a review of 13 grant awards that had been modified, GAO found that 8 had cost modifications resulting in funding for all 13 awards increasing from about $91 million to $626 million. According to USAID, draft procedures for modifying awards are under review and will be incorporated into its guidance, but it could not provide a time frame. Until USAID institutes formal guidance, it cannot hold its staff and implementing partners accountable for taking all necessary steps to justify and document the modification of awards.

For projects in four case study countries, GAO found that neither USAID nor its implementing partners conducted comprehensive risk assessments to identify and mitigate financial vulnerabilities. Additionally, although USAID's partners had generally implemented financial controls over cash and voucher distributions that GAO reviewed, some partners' guidance for financial oversight had weaknesses, such as a lack of information on how to estimate and report losses. In addition, GAO found that USAID had limited guidance on financial control activities and provided no information to aid partners in estimating and reporting losses. As a result, partners may neglect to implement appropriate financial controls in areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, diversion, and misuse of EFSP funding."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to strengthen USAID's guidance for staff on approving award modifications and its guidance for partners on responding to changing market conditions.

If FFP  decides to move forward with a proposed concept paper, it will invite  partners to submit a proposal that addresses the design criteria  outlined in the APS.  3.

The committee includes at least two USAID officials,  who review and score the content of the proposal to determine  whether it sufficiently addresses the design criteria in the APS.", "The APS describes four categories of project design and evaluation  criteria: program justification; program design and description;  management and logistics; and past performance. Applicants must justify  their chosen delivery mechanism based on one or more of the following  criteria: appropriateness, timeliness, or cost-effectiveness. The program  design and description criteria cover several project design areas,  including three identified as good practices in cash-based programming:  (1) assessing beneficiary needs, (2) market analysis and impact, and (3)  coordination with other entities. Management and logistics criteria  establish the capabilities of the applicant to carry out the proposed  program based on staffing, infrastructure, and logistical arrangements.  Past performance criteria include accomplishments, quality of  performance, and demonstrated expertise in implementing programs  similar to the one proposed.", "After its review, the technical evaluation committee may submit an issues  letter to the partner, indicating areas where the proposal must be  improved to receive a recommendation for funding.

The implementing partner then considered switching from  distributing cash to in-kind food distributions when the price of  commodities that beneficiaries purchased in local markets neared the  cost of in-kind distributions. The implementing partner\u2019s Niger officials  reported that they switched from cash to in-kind distributions in certain  geographic areas but not in other areas where the prices of staple  commodities did not reach the cost of in-kind distributions.", "Somalia. In Baydhaba, we found that the price of key cereal commodities  increased significantly in mid-2011 (see fig. 10). By September 2011,  the UN had declared famine in seven regions in Somalia, including  Baydhaba. In November 2011, USAID signed a grant agreement with its  implementing partner to fund a cash-for-work project. By that time,  however, the prices of these key cereal commodities had declined from  their peaks earlier in 2011. USAID\u2019s implementing partner provided $72  per household each month during the period when prices of these key  cereal commodities declined. The partner then increased the amount to  $96 per household each month in June 2013. Our analysis also found  that the price of red sorghum and white maize increased significantly in  2014 (also shown in fig. 10). From April to July 2014, the price of red  sorghum increased by 77 percent and the price of white maize by 37  percent, large increases compared with historical price trends. However,  the implementing partner did not adjust the transfer rate during this  period. The implementing partner cautioned that adjusting the transfer  rate should be done in context of the wage rate in the labor market, the  general volatility of commodity markets in Somalia, and food being only a  part of the beneficiaries\u2019 expenditure basket. The implementing partner  stated that starting in late February 2015 it would be testing a new  methodology intended to establish the transfer rate at the subregional  level based on the cost of commodities, the wage rate in the labor market,  the available budget, and an assessment of the implications of adjusting  the transfer rate by examining short- and long-term trends. Once  established, the transfer rate would remain for approximately 2 to 3  months, comprising a round of distributions.", "Jordan and Kenya. In Jordan, we analyzed data from Jordan\u2019s  Department of Statistics and found that the price of food in Jordan did not  change significantly after an implementing partner started its project in  July 2012. In Kenya, the implementing partner established the transfer  rate based on the value of the standard food basket; it reviewed prices  every month and would change transfer amounts only in response to  price fluctuations, in either direction, of more than 10 percent. In Taita  Taveta, the site we visited in Kenya, the implementing partner informed  us that the transfer value had not been adjusted since June 2013  because retail food prices had not changed more than 10 percent.", "USAID Does Not Provide Guidance to Partners on When and How to  Modify Programs in Response to Changing Market Conditions  According to USAID officials, USAID does not have a standard for  identifying significant price changes, since the definition of significance is  specific to each country and region. In addition, we did not find guidance  addressing modifications in response to changing market conditions in  the APS for International Emergency Food Assistance. This lack of  guidance has resulted in inconsistent responses to changing market  conditions among different cash and voucher projects funded by USAID.  For example, an implementing partner in Kenya predetermined, as part of  its project design, when adjustments to cash transfer amounts would be  triggered by food price changes, while an implementing partner whose  project we reviewed in Niger relied on an ad hoc response. The  implementing partner in Kenya established the cash and voucher transfer  rate based on the value of the standard food basket; it reviewed prices  every month but would change cash and voucher transfer amounts only  in response to price fluctuations, in either direction, of more than 10  percent.", "Without clear guidance about when and how implementing partners  should modify cash-based food assistance projects in response to  changing market conditions, USAID runs the risk of beneficiaries\u2019 benefits  being eroded by price increases or inefficient use of scarce project  funding when prices decrease."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s Partners Had Generally Implemented Financial Controls in Projects We Reviewed; We Found Weaknesses in Risk Planning, Implementation, and Guidance", "paragraphs": ["USAID relies on its implementing partners to implement financial  oversight of EFSP projects, but it does not require them to conduct  comprehensive risk assessments to plan financial oversight activities\u2014 two key components of an internal control framework (see sidebar)\u2014and  provides little or no guidance to partners and its own staff on these two  components.

The financial directive states  that assessments should identify risks related to implementing food  assistance programs from a multifunctional perspective, involving offices  such as finance, program, logistics, and security, and that identified  macro risks, such as financial, economic, political, and environmental  risks, along with mitigating actions, shall be included in the country office  operational risk analysis.", "Somalia. Although the USAID implementing partner for the cash-for-work  project we reviewed in Somalia conducted a risk assessment and in  November 2011 developed a risk register that includes a number of  potential risks, including potential financial risks, such as the risks of  collusion and diversion of funds by the money vendor and subawardees,  it did not prepare a comprehensive risk register with clear mitigation plans  in accordance with its guidance and the international standards that it had  adopted. This partner\u2019s risk management guidance state that risk  assessment would provide staff and supervising management with a  shared, comprehensive view of the potential risks to the achievement of  objectives, together with a prioritized mitigation action plan, among other  things. However, this partner\u2019s risk register for its cash-for-work project in  Somalia did not identify, for example, counterfeiting of vouchers as a  potential risk.

In October 2011, before USAID provided its initial  EFSP funds, the implementing partner received allegations of fraud,  which resulted in its Office of Inspector General (OIG) initiating several  investigations. During the implementation of the project, the OIG  conducted multiple fraud investigations involving subawardees\u2019 and  money vendors\u2019 non- or under-implementation of cash-for-work activities  and money vendors\u2019 violations of contractual terms of disbursement,  including claiming fees for services not rendered.

According to the  implementing partner, its OIG investigated the allegations and concluded  that the financial loss to USAID was approximately $237,000; according  to the partner, it recovered about $188,000, resulting in a total financial  loss of about $49,000 to USAID. However, in one case, the OIG  concluded that because of security restrictions, it was unable to confirm  the financial loss. In addition, two new investigations that began in 2014  involving one of the money vendors were still ongoing as of December  2014, making it premature to conclude whether there was any financial  loss and whether USAID funds were affected.", "The implementing partner in Somalia suspended the cash-for-work  project in all locations from May to October 2012 because of the fraud  allegations and investigative findings. During the suspension of the  project, the partner said that it expanded and added other mitigation  measures to help ensure greater controls, such as expanding a call  center in Nairobi to verify payment to beneficiaries and conduct post- distribution surveys. However, many beneficiaries in south central  Somalia, a high-risk area, had unreliable phone connectivity or did not  own phones. This implementing partner also said that it provided  systematic training to its subawardees, including training on fraud  prevention measures and post-distribution assessment. Prior to  December 2014, post-distribution assessments were being done by the  same subawardees who were overseeing the cash-for-work project,  which is not considered good practice according to internal control  standards.

For example, the directive required the country office\u2019s finance  officer to reconcile bank accounts used for cash and voucher transfers on  a monthly basis. It also required that undistributed cash and unredeemed  vouchers be reconciled, receipted, and recorded before financial closure  of a project.

FFP officers we spoke with noted that U.S.  government security personnel had restricted travel in certain areas of  their host countries for prolonged periods. For example, the elections in  2013 meant that travel in Kenya was restricted for security reasons during  several months of the pre- and post-election season. Additionally,  following the 2013 Westgate shopping mall attack in Nairobi and other  terrorist incidents around the country, the coastal areas of Kenya were  declared off limits for routine field visits. As a result, at the time of our visit  in the fall of 2014, the FFP officer had not visited the cash-for-work  program for over a year in the coastal areas of Kenya. In Somalia, travel  to and within the country was highly restricted. For the project in Somalia  that we reviewed, USAID relied on the implementing partner to perform  oversight in-country. The implementing partner\u2019s access to certain areas  of the country was sometimes restricted; however, because of security  concerns, the degree of accessibility varied over time. For example, in  September 2014, about 40 percent of the households in Somalia were  inaccessible to the implementing partner, whereas in the first 2 weeks of  February 2015, 27 percent of the households were inaccessible.  Additionally, the implementing partner did not have an independent third- party entity to perform oversight in restricted areas of the country.  However, according to the implementing partner, it uses satellite imagery  and aerial photographs to verify rehabilitation of cash for work activities.  Because of security concerns, FFP staff had not been able to conduct  any site visits in person in Somalia as of October 2014, the time of our  field visit. In addition to access restrictions, routine security requirements  such as armed escorts sometimes made it difficult for USAID staff to  coordinate field visits. For example, in Niger, FFP program staff could not  visit project sites without armed escorts, which can comprise up to 18  soldiers. The armed escorts were required because of security concerns  arising from conflicts in neighboring countries. The coordination and the  cost of the armed escorts, which could reach several hundred dollars per  visit, made it difficult for staff to visit project sites. Faced with travel  restrictions and security requirements, several FFP officers we visited  reported they were overseeing cash and voucher projects in inaccessible  areas indirectly through communication with implementing partners and in  some instances hiring independent third-party oversight entities to make  site visits.", "Because of staff limitations and security-imposed constraints, FFP  officers primarily rely on implementing partners\u2019 reports from the field and  regular meetings with them, either in person or by teleconference, to  determine whether a project is being executed as intended. However,  USAID\u2019s guidance to its FFP officers and its implementing partners on  financial oversight and reporting is limited. For example, FFP staff in  Niger stated that they have had insufficient guidance and training on  financial oversight of cash-based food assistance projects. Furthermore,  the FFP officers told us that USAID is not prescriptive in the financial  oversight procedures it expects from its implementing partners.  Additionally, they noted that USAID has not set a quantitative target for  site visits by FFP officers. FFP officers in our four case study countries  told us that they use a risk-based approach to select which sites to visit.  For example, in Kenya, the FFP officer chooses project sites based on  acute need, investment, and risk. In Niger, the FFP officers have a plan  based on a risk assessment to visit projects periodically. Moving forward,  USAID is developing or putting into place several processes to help its  staff conduct financial oversight of EFSP programs. Examples include  developing policy and guidance for financial oversight and reporting and  hiring additional staff in Kenya to focus specifically on overseeing the  Kenya cash and food distribution program. By increasing its in-house staff  capacity, FFP officers hope to increase the number of field visits. USAID  plans to have these processes in place by the end of 2015. Also, realizing  the importance of performing oversight in high-risk areas, USAID recently  awarded a contract to a third party for Somalia that will provide  independent information about the implementation of projects funded by  FFP and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, including periodic  physical verification of project activities.", "Although USAID has taken steps to address concerns over its financial  oversight of cash and voucher programs, limited staff resources, security  restrictions, and lack of guidance hamper USAID\u2019s ability to identify  problems with cash and voucher distributions.

Cash and  vouchers can be distributed more quickly than food and provide recipients  with significant dietary diversity, among other advantages. Like its  implementing partners and other major food assistance donors, USAID  has significantly expanded its use of cash-based food assistance over the  past 5 years. However, cash and voucher options present a new set of  policy and financial control challenges that USAID needs to recognize  and address. Cash-based food assistance may be the most appropriate  option in certain situations, but this option requires additional layers of  analysis in terms of decision making, starting with the decision as to  which mechanism for delivering the assistance is best for a given  situation. Cash-based assistance requires the availability of timely and  reliable market information to know when and how modifications to the  project may be warranted in response to changing market conditions. In  addition, cash and vouchers present a very different set of financial  control challenges from overseeing the procurement and distribution of a  physical commodity.", "The success of USAID\u2019s use of cash-based interventions depends on  having appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure that grant proposals  are sound, that those partners who are implementing projects have a  good understanding of the underlying market conditions and the flexibility  to make adjustments when prices change dramatically, and that proper  financial controls and oversight are in place. We found that USAID  followed its grant approval process. However, a significant number of  grants we reviewed were modified after their initial approval, often with  large increases in the resources committed. Yet USAID does not have  formal guidance for reviewing and approving these modifications and thus  does not know whether USAID staff are taking all necessary steps to  justify the modification of awards. Efforts to review procedures and  improve formal guidance for modifying awards have lagged behind the  actual implementation of projects, without a time frame for completing  those efforts and when enhanced guidance will be finalized. Moreover,  USAID lacks formal guidance clearly delineating when and how  implementing partners are to modify cash-based food assistance projects  in response to changing market conditions, and thus it runs the risk that  beneficiaries\u2019 benefits may be eroded by significant price increases or  that implementing partners may use scarce project funding inefficiently if  prices decrease.", "While USAID relies on its implementing partners to oversee and ensure  the financial integrity of cash-based assistance, the agency does not  provide its partners with essential operational policy guidance on how  they should conduct financial oversight, nor does it have the resources to  monitor the implementing partners\u2019 efforts. As we noted in this report,  several instances of malfeasance have already surfaced in this program.  It is essential that USAID learn from these circumstances and implement  the necessary changes, including ensuring that comprehensive risk  assessments are conducted and that implementing partners are given  sufficient guidance and oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen its management of cash-based food assistance projects  and help ensure improved oversight of these projects, we recommend  that the USAID Administrator take the following five actions:  1.  Expedite USAID\u2019s efforts to establish formal guidance for staff  reviewing modifications of cash-based food assistance grant awards.  2.  Develop formal guidance to implementing partners for modifying cash- based food assistance projects in response to changes in market  conditions.  3.  Require implementing partners of cash-based food assistance  projects to conduct comprehensive risk assessments and submit the  results to USAID along with mitigation plans that address financial  vulnerabilities such as counterfeiting, diversion, and losses.  4.  Develop policy and comprehensive guidance for USAID staff and  implementing partners for financial oversight of cash-based food  assistance projects.  5.  Require USAID staff to conduct systematic financial oversight of  USAID\u2019s cash-based food assistance projects in the field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to USAID for comment.

USAID agreed that it should formalize guidance for staff reviewing  modifications of cash-based food assistance grant awards and stated that  it is taking steps to do so. USAID also agreed to develop formal guidance  to implementing partners on appropriate adjustments to adapt  programming of cash-based food assistance projects in response to  changing market conditions. In response to our recommendation to  require implementing partners to conduct comprehensive risk  assessments and submit the results to USAID with mitigation plans,  USAID stated that while it expected applicants to address risk and risk  mitigation within its application, it will formalize this requirement. With  regard to our recommendation to develop policy and comprehensive  guidance for USAID staff and implementing partners for financial  oversight of cash-based food assistance, USAID stated that it will work  with its implementing partners to improve financial oversight of cash- based food assistance projects, both through engagement on  implementing partners\u2019 policy, legal frameworks, and guidelines and  through the development of guidance for USAID staff and implementing  partners. Furthermore, to improve FFP officers\u2019 capacity to oversee cash- based food assistance projects, USAID stated that it is developing  training materials and will continue to explore the use of third-party  monitoring contracts where security and access prevent in-person  monitoring.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of USAID, and other interested parties.

In Washington, D.C., we interviewed officials from the Department  of State (State), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and USAID.  We also met with officials representing NGOs that were awarded USAID  EFSP grants to serve as implementing partners in carrying out U.S. food  assistance programs overseas or were the subawardees for USAID  grants awarded to the PIOs. In Rome, we met with officials from the U.S.  Mission to the United Nations, FAO, and WFP. We also met with the UN  permanent representatives for three major donors\u2014Canada, the  European Union, and the United Kingdom. We also selected four case  study countries that receive EFSP grants for review\u2014Jordan for the Syria  region, Kenya, Niger, and Somalia\u2014and conducted fieldwork in three of  these countries (Jordan, Kenya, and Niger) where we met with officials  from the U.S. missions, implementing partners, vendors, financial  institutions, and beneficiaries, among others. We selected these four  countries on the basis of several factors including the level of USAID  EFSP funding, the types of modalities and mechanisms used to transfer  the assistance, implementing partners, security concerns and risks, and  logistics and budget constraints. We cannot generalize our findings from  these four countries to the other countries where USAID has funded  cash-based food assistance projects. We interviewed staff from USAID  and its implementing partners in Niger and Jordan, as well as staff based  in Nairobi who had responsibility for oversight of the EFSP-funded  operations in Kenya and Somalia.", "To provide context and background, we analyzed data from USAID and  WFP to identify trends in U.S. funding for cash-based food assistance.  These data include approved EFSP awards from USAID and cash and  voucher amount from WFP by year. In addition, we reviewed studies,  evaluations, and other documents on cash-based food assistance\u2014its  benefits and challenges\u2014as well as various tools that USAID and its  implementing partners use to facilitate their determination of the  appropriate assistance delivery mechanism to address a given food  insecurity situation.", "To address our first objective regarding USAID\u2019s processes for awarding  and modifying cash-based food assistance projects, we reviewed  USAID\u2019s Annual Program Statements (APS), grant proposals, and  agreements; grant modifications; various directives and guidance,  including guidance on concept notes; evaluation committee reviews; and  scoring of proposals. Specifically, to determine whether USAID followed  the process established in its guidance for reviewing and deciding to fund  project proposals, we reviewed all 22 cash-based projects that were  newly awarded and active as of June 1, 2014, making them subject to the  requirements in the latest APS issued in May 2013. These awards  covered 14 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East; 11 of them  went to nongovernmental organizations, and 11 went to public  international organizations. For these 22 award files, we reviewed FFP\u2019s  files to determine whether it had documented the required program  decision steps outlined in the APS for competitive proposals: the partner\u2019s  concept paper, the partner\u2019s full proposal, and the evaluation committee\u2019s  review. For grants awarded under an expedited noncompetitive review  process, we reviewed the Office of Food for Peace\u2019s (FFP) files to  determine whether they contained the appropriate action memo or memo  of exception to competition. During our analysis, we found two instances  in which there were no action memos or memos of exception to  competition but the awards were justified under authorities in USAID\u2019s  main organization-wide guidance for expediting awards during  emergencies, and we report these as a separate category.", "In addition, to determine the types of award modifications and the  reasons for these modifications, we reviewed 21 EFSP grant awards that  were awarded and active as of January 2012 to June 2014 for the four  case study countries. This selection is not generalizable to the universe of  all ESFP awards. A significant portion of FFP resources is approved  through cost modifications, so a further review of these modifications was  done, including numerous modifications for the Syria regional award. To  assess the reliability of the cost modification data, we reviewed and  analyzed funding data on USAID\u2019s modification assistance awards and  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also  determined from a list prepared by FFP\u2019s independent management  contractor the types of documents (such as the program justification,  action memo, and technical evaluation report) that FFP submitted to the  contractor for the cost modifications we reviewed. We also examined a  version of draft guidance that USAID said it is currently reviewing as part  of an effort to improve, consolidate, and streamline procedures for  processing cost modifications, among other things.", "Furthermore, to identify periods of changing market conditions, we  analyzed data on the price of key staple commodities in five selected  markets in our case study countries from fiscal years 2010 through 2014.  These markets were selected as illustrative examples of changes in the  prices of key staple commodities, the effect on beneficiaries near those  markets, and USAID\u2019s implementing partners\u2019 responses, if any. These  markets are not meant to be representative of all other markets in our  case study countries or all other markets near areas served by USAID\u2019s  implementing partners\u2019 projects. We used data on prices from WFP\u2019s  Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping division, FAO\u2019s Food Security and  Nutrition Analysis Unit, and Jordan\u2019s Department of Statistics. To assess  the reliability of these data, we compared these data with data provided  by USAID\u2019s implementing partners, if available, and found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We adapted WFP\u2019s Alert for Price  Spikes methodology to identify significant changes in the prices of key  staple commodities. We reviewed USAID and its implementing partners\u2019  project documents and interviewed implementing partner officials to  assess how USAID\u2019s implementing partners responded to any significant  changes in the prices of key staple commodities. To the extent  information was available, we calculated the effect of significant changes  in the prices of key staple commodities on the cost of the beneficiaries\u2019  food baskets.", "To address our second objective regarding the extent to which USAID  and its implementing partners have implemented financial controls to help  ensure appropriate oversight of cash based food assistance projects, we  obtained the grant funding data from the grant award agreements and  compared them with the funding data provided by USAID and determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To select the  projects in our case study countries, we used a range of criteria, including  the grant award date, type of delivery mechanism, and funding level (see  table 1).", "For each project, we selected at least one distribution date that fell within  the period between when the grant was awarded and when the project  was completed. For example, for Jordan, the grant was awarded in July  2012 and ended in December 2014. We selected two paper voucher  distributions, one that occurred in January 2013 for a governorate and  one that occurred in April 2014 for a refugee camp.the areas selected for our review, like those for our case study countries,  are not generalizable to all areas in the selected countries or to the  broader universe of the implementing partners\u2019 operations. We then  assessed for each project selected distribution documentation and for the  grant key reports (quarterly and final financial reports, quarterly  performance reports, and final program reports) against the requirements  listed in relevant grant agreements; USAID Annual Program Statements  for 2011 and 2013; and the implementing partners\u2019 financial policies,  procedures, and guidance in place at the time of the distributions. For  example, in Kenya, we reviewed planned and actual beneficiary payment  distribution lists as well as reconciliation reports prepared by the  implementing partner and its financial service providers in order to  determine whether there were proper authorizations and segregation of  duties. Additionally, we assessed whether USAID\u2019s required reporting of  key reports was completed and submitted to USAID on a timely basis.", "GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, GAO/AIMD-00-21.3.1  (Washington, D.C.: November 1999). world. It is recognized as a leading framework for designing,  implementing, and conducting internal control and assessing the  effectiveness of internal control. COSO updated its framework in May  2013 to enhance and clarify the framework\u2019s use and application. These  internal control standards and frameworks describe the five components  of internal control\u2014control environment, risk assessment, control  activities, information and communication, and monitoring. To address  our objective, we focused on the control activities and risk assessment  components in order to assess the entities\u2019 financial oversight of cash- based food assistance projects. We did not assess the processes and  procedures against the other internal control components. To determine  the extent to which USAID and its implementing partners conducted  comprehensive risk assessments, we reviewed their risk registers, if  available, and other documents against their guidance and other  standards, such as the international risk management standards  published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a  worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies).  This International Standard (ISO 31000) Risk Management\u2014Principles  and Guidelines provides principles and generic guidelines on risk  management.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 to March 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
