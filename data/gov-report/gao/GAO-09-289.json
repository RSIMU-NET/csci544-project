When their disability is not stable, however, they may be placed on the military's Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL) and granted temporary benefits for as long as 5 years. GAO was asked to respond to concerns about TDRL caseloads, management, and impact on servicemembers. To address these concerns, we analyzed TDRL data; interviewed military officials; reviewed laws, regulations, and other relevant documents; and conducted 12 focus groups with temporary retirees. This report examines (1) recent trends in the TDRL caseload size, (2) recent trends in the characteristics of those placed on the TDRL, (3) disability retirement outcomes for TDRL placements, (4) the adequacy of TDRL management, and (5) the adequacy of information provided to TDRL retirees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TDRL caseloads within the Department of Defense (DOD) grew by 43 percent, from 9,983 in fiscal year 2003 to 14,285 in fiscal year 2007. Growth in caseloads could be attributable to a combination of increases in the number of cases going through the military's disability evaluation system, higher TDRL placement rates, and low numbers of cases removed from the TDRL relative to new cases added to the list. DOD-wide, servicemembers placed on the TDRL in each calendar year from 2000 through 2007 varied little with respect to their military status, years of service, and disabilities. In each of these years, most TDRL placements had been active duty personnel, although the small proportion who had been reservists grew considerably. Most TDRL placements in each year also had fewer than 20 years of service and, over time, their average years of service declined. The disabilities most prevalent among TDRL placements were musculoskeletal, mental, or neurological in nature. Among those with mental and neurological disabilities, the incidence of post traumatic stress disorder and conditions related to traumatic brain injury increased substantially across the services. Although the experiences of temporary disability retirees varied, some outcomes were more common than others. DOD-wide, very few who were placed on the list between calendar years 2000 and 2003 returned to military service. Further, about half received a final determination within 3 years and, of those who ultimately received permanent disability benefits, 73 percent had final disability ratings that were no different than their initial ratings. Finally, only 7 percent of TDRL placements, DOD-wide, received a final disability rating that qualified them for permanent disability payment amounts higher than their TDRL payments. DOD and the services do not effectively manage key aspects of the TDRL process. The military does not systematically examine physical evaluation board (PEB) stability decisions for accuracy and consistency or routinely compile information on TDRL outcomes to better inform its assessments of stability. According to TDRL administrative staff, ensuring that medical reexaminations are done in TDRL cases at least once every 18 months is often a challenge. However, the military does not monitor the extent to which this requirement is met. Moreover, there is limited use of nonmilitary physicians to perform reexaminations, which could reduce burdens on medical treatment facilities. Finally, military procedures do not ensure consistent enforcement of TDRL rules. Information about the TDRL that the services provide is not always clear or complete and can be difficult to access. PEB findings forms provided to temporary retirees do not fully explain why service members are placed on the list or what is required of them. Temporary retirees reported that counseling related to PEB decisions was inconsistent and lacking in followthrough. Information from military pamphlets, brochures, fact sheets, and Web sites is often incomplete or difficult to find. Temporary retirees participating in our focus groups expressed considerable confusion about and dissatisfaction with their limited access to information and points of contact."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the beginning of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom,  the number of servicemembers entering the military disability evaluation  system has grown, along with concerns that the system may not serve  returning wounded warriors very well. Recent evaluations by GAO and  others have found a number of problems, including lengthy case  processing times, inadequate staff training, inconsistencies in disability  ratings, and confusion and distrust on the part of servicemembers who  must navigate the system. In an effort to streamline military disability  determinations, the Department of Defense (DOD) is currently engaged in  a joint pilot with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to test the use of  VA medical examinations to inform military disability decisions, but  significant challenges to addressing weaknesses in the military\u2019s overall  disability evaluation system remain.", "The Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL) is one aspect of this system  that is currently receiving increased attention. Servicemembers may be  placed on the TDRL if they are found to be medically unfit for duty  (disabled) by a military Physical Evaluation Board (PEB), but their  service-related illnesses or injuries are not stable enough for the PEB to  assign them a permanent disability rating. A determination assigning  servicemembers to the TDRL temporarily retires and provides them with  disability retirement benefits for up to 5 years while they wait for their  disabling medical conditions to stabilize. Once a permanent disability  rating can be assigned, depending on the rating and the servicemember\u2019s  years of military service, the PEB may place those on the TDRL on the  Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL), grant them a one-time  severance payment, or find them fit to return to military service.", "Questions have been raised about the TDRL process, including whether it  is administered appropriately and consistently across all services, whether  the military provides adequate support and guidance to servicemembers  who are placed on the list, and whether individuals may be staying on the  list longer than necessary. To better understand the TDRL process and the  issues surrounding it, this report provides information on (1) recent trends  in the TDRL caseload size, (2) recent trends in the characteristics of  servicemembers placed on the TDRL, (3) disability retirement outcomes  for TDRL placements, (4) the adequacy of TDRL management, and (5) the  adequacy of information provided to temporary retirees.", "To determine trends in TDRL caseload size, we analyzed data from DOD\u2019s  Defense Manpower Data Center Retired Pay File and administrative data  maintained by PEBs in the Air Force, Army, and Navy. Data from these  files were also used to determine the characteristics and TDRL outcomes  of all those placed on the list each calendar year from 2000 through 2007.  We also reviewed and discussed with DOD officials the results of their  own recently issued study of the TDRL, which also examined TDRL  retirees\u2019 characteristics and outcomes. Based on information we obtained  from the military about how the data in these files were collected and  what measures were taken to assure their quality, we determined that  these data were adequately reliable for the purposes of this study. To  assess the adequacy of TDRL management, we reviewed relevant laws,  regulations, and procedures. In addition, we interviewed military officials  who are responsible for implementing these requirements across the  services, including PEB members, Medical Command representatives, and  PEB Liaison Officers (PEBLO) from military medical treatment facilities  across the services\u2014specifically, at three Air Force, four Army, and three  Navy facilities. We assessed the adequacy of existing TDRL procedures  relative to internal control standards for the federal government and the  requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. To  assess the adequacy of information provided to servicemembers who are  placed on the TDRL, we also reviewed each service\u2019s PEB decision forms  and other written materials, as well as information available on the  services\u2019 Web sites. We also obtained the experiences and views of TDRL  retirees across the services by conducting a series of 12 focus groups in  June and August 2008 with individuals who were on the TDRL. Focus  groups were conducted in Norfolk, Va., Quantico, Va., San Antonio, Tex.,  and Killeen, Tex., because collectively, these areas provided us with  access to a large pool of temporary retirees from each of the services.", "We conducted this review from March 2008 to April 2009 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. Additional information about our objectives, scope, and  methodology is provided in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The TDRL was established under the Career Compensation Act of 1949 to  allow for temporary disability retirement pay and benefits for any  servicemember who would be eligible for disability retirement benefits,  were it not for the fact that their disability was not of a permanent nature.  In 1986, the law was amended to allow the military to place individuals on  the TDRL if it is determined that their disabilities could be of a permanent  nature but are not stable enough to rate their severity. Under this criterion,  a disability is considered not stable if the medical evidence indicates its  severity will probably change enough sometime within the next 5 years to  warrant an increase or decrease in the disability percentage rating. For  example, cancer is a condition that may be determined to be permanent  and stable when the disease has progressed to the point where treatments  are unlikely to cure it, or determined to be permanent and unstable when  the disease is being treated and the prognosis remains uncertain.", "Consistent with how the military administers its overall disability  evaluation system, DOD gives each service responsibility for administering  its own TDRL process. DOD provides some guidance for administering the  TDRL, but gives the services broad latitude. Therefore, each service has  established more detailed guidance for its own day-to-day processes  related to the TDRL. The services have their own staff, or TDRL units, that  oversee and process TDRL cases. Figure 1 depicts the TDRL decision  process in detail.", "To qualify for permanent disability retirement benefits, or placement on  the Permanent Disability Retired List (PDRL), a servicemember must have  a service-related medical condition that renders him or her unfit for duty.  The condition must be compensable, and the severity of the condition,  expressed as a percentage rating, must be 30 percent or higher. Typically,  the percentage disability rating dictates the amount of monthly disability  retirement payments to which a servicemember is permanently entitled.  If, based on the medical evidence, the PEB determines that a  servicemember\u2019s disabling condition is unstable\u2014that the condition\u2019s  current percentage rating could change within the next 5 years\u2014the PEB  will place the servicemember on the TDRL. In effect, placement on the  TDRL postpones a final determination of the percentage rating and the  associated monthly disability payments to which the retiree may  eventually and permanently be entitled.", "Once placed on the TDRL, temporary retirees must undergo periodic  medical reexaminations and evaluations by a PEB at least once every 18  months. Under the law, assignment to the TDRL must end with a final  determination at the end of 5 years, or sooner if the results of a medical  reexamination indicate that the temporary retiree\u2019s condition is of a  permanent nature and stable or the servicemember\u2019s rating drops below 30  percent. Typically, temporary retirees receive medical reexaminations in  conjunction with PEB determinations. These examinations are usually  conducted at military treatment facilities (MTF). Each service\u2019s TDRL  administrative unit is responsible for determining when temporary retirees  are due for medical reexaminations, notifying them of upcoming medical  reexaminations and arranging for the examinations at MTFs, and following  up with temporary retirees who fail to keep appointments. Temporary  retirees are required to make sure the appropriate service\u2019s TDRL unit has  their current address. Temporary retirees are also required to report for  medical reexaminations at appointed times and places. Typically,  reexaminations are scheduled by the relevant service\u2019s MTF that is nearest  to the TDRL retiree\u2019s place of residence. If a temporary retiree is unable to  keep an appointment, he or she is required to make alternate  arrangements to complete the medical reexamination. If temporary  retirees refuse or fail to report for required reexaminations, the services  have the authority to terminate their temporary disability retirement pay.", "The benefits that servicemembers are entitled to while on the TDRL are  similar to those for servicemembers who are placed on the PDRL. In most  cases, the amount of TDRL monthly payments are calculated in the same  way as PDRL monthly cash payments: retirees with fewer than 20 years of  service receive their base pay at retirement, multiplied by the assigned  percentage rating for their disabling medical conditions; servicemembers  with 20 or more years of service receive the higher of either their base pay  at retirement, multiplied by either their assigned percentage rating, or 2.5  times their years of service\u2014whichever is higher. Regardless of years of  service, temporary retirees with a disability percentage rating of 50  percent or less are entitled to no less than 50 percent of their base pay at  retirement. Both TDRL and PDRL monthly cash payments are subject to a  cap of 75 percent of servicemembers\u2019 base pay and are subject to income  taxes. In addition to receiving cash payments, temporary retirees are  entitled to other military retirement benefits, including health insurance  coverage for themselves, their spouses, and eligible dependents, and  access to discounted goods and services through military exchange  facilities. Finally, temporary retirees are also eligible to apply for VA  disability compensation, which is not subject to income taxes.

Such policies,  procedures, and control mechanisms are an important part of an effective  system of internal controls.", "The accuracy and consistency of decisions to place servicemembers on  the TDRL are particularly important because of the significant impact  these decisions have on the military and on servicemembers\u2019 lives.  According to military officials, placing servicemembers on the TDRL  provides an opportunity for the military to recover some of its investment  in recruitment and training by returning servicemembers to duty, and  provides more time to make an appropriate disability determination in  cases where a condition is likely to improve or deteriorate. Despite these  potential benefits, many military officials noted that the TDRL is  administratively burdensome and contributes to the workload of an  already overburdened disability evaluation system. For servicemembers,  benefits of being on the TDRL may include potentially higher disability  payments or returning to military service. Conversely, many focus group  participants said that being on the TDLR limited their ability to move  forward in their lives, and they expressed confusion, uncertainty, and a  sense of being adrift while on the TDRL.", "To ensure uniformity in military disability case processing and decision  making, DOD requires each service to establish a quality assurance  process.

For  their part, the services do review some individual cases to ensure that the  medical evidence supports the determination. However, they do not  compare TDRL determinations made in cases with similar disabilities and  other characteristics.", "Military officials we spoke with acknowledged that instability is defined  broadly and can be open to different interpretations by the PEBs.  Specifically, some military officials said that predicting whether or not a  disability rating may fluctuate within 5 years is not always easy and can  involve considerable professional judgment. In fact, our analysis shows  that some services have been classifying disabilities as \u201cunstable\u201d more  often than other services. TDRL determinations have consistently  accounted for a larger proportion of all PEB determinations in the Navy  and Marine Corps than in the other services. (See fig. 7.) Specifically,  between fiscal years 2001 and 2007, TDRL determinations constituted 27  percent of all Navy PEB determinations and 26 percent of all Marine Corps  PEB determinations. In contrast, TDRL determinations accounted for 15  percent of all Army PEB determinations and 11 percent of all Air Force  PEB determinations.", "Another possible explanation for why some services classify disabilities as  unstable more often than other services, according to DOD officials, is that  there may be greater incidence of disabilities in some services that are  more likely to be unstable. Currently there are no data available from  either DOD or the services that could be used to determine why placement  rates vary. Further, DOD does not compare PEB instability decisions  across the services. As a result, DOD and the services have no way of  knowing the extent to which the military is making consistent decisions.", "Furthermore, although most TDRL disability ratings did not change even  after several years on the list, DOD and the services do not routinely  compile and study how TDRL outcomes are related to different types of  disabilities, even though this information could help inform future TDRL  placement and retention decisions. For example, such information could  shed additional light on which conditions are more likely to change over  time and which ones are not. Meanwhile, participants in our focus groups  often questioned the appropriateness of their placement on the TDRL, and  the perceived unfairness of TDRL placement and retention decisions was a  theme that emerged in each of our focus groups. Some of the military  physicians we spoke with also questioned the value of having placed  individuals with certain conditions, such as certain types of cancer, on the  TDRL.

They cited temporary retiree noncompliance, such as failure to update  contact information or to attend scheduled appointments, as an obstacle  to completing examinations on time. They also acknowledged that the  MTFs cannot always schedule examinations on time. This may be because  they do not always receive the reexamination package far enough in  advance from TDRL administrators or because appointment slots for  certain medical specialties, particularly mental health, are limited.

Currently, DOD\u2019s quality assurance procedures do not take  advantage of available data on outcomes in past TDRL cases to avoid  postponing final disability determinations for servicemembers with disabilities  whose severity is unlikely to change. Current quality assurance procedures also  do not provide for the systematic review of TDRL placement decisions.  Therefore, the DOD has no way of knowing whether these placements are  appropriate or consistent. Further, DOD does not have effective mechanisms  for holding staff accountable for the timeliness of TDRL reexaminations or  otherwise ensuring the overall efficiency of TDRL case processing. Without a  system for monitoring the timeliness of reexaminations, a clear policy for  addressing noncompliance, and a strategy for leveraging nonmilitary resources  to complete reexaminations, DOD cannot avoid sometimes lengthy delays in  final determinations in TDRL cases. Further, by failing to make a final  determination as soon as temporary retirees are removed from the TDRL, the  services are denying some temporary retirees benefits to which they are  entitled. Finally, inadequate information on PEB finding forms about why  individuals are placed on the TDRL and little or no access to a point of contact  that can address temporary retirees\u2019 questions about the process, make it less  transparent. This may generate distrust and frustration among many temporary  retirees and affect their ability and willingness to comply with TDRL  requirements. Without a better understanding of the information needs of  temporary retirees and more proactive contact with them, DOD is missing an  important opportunity to remove potential obstacles to temporary retirees\u2019  compliance with TDRL requirements.", "In addition to the TDRL management issues we identified, the outcomes  we found in TDRL cases raise questions about the list\u2019s design and  purpose. In most of the cases we reviewed, the temporary retiree received  a permanent disability rating well before the 5-year TDRL limit, which  suggests that the current TDRL time limit could be shortened. With only 1  in 100 temporary retirees returning to active duty, the TDRL also does not  appear to be a very effective mechanism for meeting the needs of the  military. Finally, most temporary retirees received a final rating equal to or  lower than their initial one, and very few were eventually eligible for  higher permanent disability payments.

More specifically, we compared TDRL  caseload sizes in the last month of each fiscal year (September) over time,  both within and across the services. We also compared the relative  proportion of former active duty and reserve servicemembers in the  annual TDRL caseload over time.", "To determine what could have contributed to the growth in TDRL  caseloads, we compared the trend in TDRL caseload size to the trend in  the (1) number of cases that received disability evaluation system  determinations, (2) TDRL placement rate, and (3) number of cases  removed from the TDRL each year, for fiscal years 2001 through 2007. We  obtained these data from  the Air Force Military Personnel Data System; the Army Physical Disability Case Processing System; and the Joint Disability Evaluation System, which captures Physical Evaluation  Board (PEB) case data for the Navy and Marine Corps.", "To assess the reliability of each of these systems, we reviewed  documentation related to each that provided information such as record  layout, data dictionary, how data were collected and stored, measures  taken to ensure data quality, and screens used to extract the data we  required. We also interviewed military personnel knowledgeable about  each system to obtain more detailed information about the system and the  data in it. Based on our assessment, we determined that data from each of  these systems were sufficiently reliable for our analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining the Characteristics of TDRL Placements", "paragraphs": ["To identify the characteristics of individuals placed on the TDRL each  month from January 2000 through December 2007 (see table 3), we  analyzed monthly transaction-level data DMDC had extracted for us from  its Retired Pay File, a database containing information on individual  retirees from the Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy.", "To determine the characteristics of temporary retirees placed on the TDRL  in calendar years 2000 through 2007\u2014including disability rating  percentages, their years of service, and the proportions who were formerly  active duty servicemembers and reservists\u2014we analyzed data for these  individuals the DMDC extracted for us from their Retired Pay File.", "To identify disabilities among temporary retirees placed on the TDRL in  calendar years 2000 through 2007, we obtained the Department of  Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) diagnostic  codes associated with each temporary retiree\u2019s case from the services\u2019  PEBs, and grouped these disabilities under the appropriate disability  categories provided in the VASRD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining TDRL Outcomes for Those Placed on the List", "paragraphs": ["We focused many of our analyses of TDRL outcomes on individuals placed  on the list in calendar years 2000 through 2003. At least 5 years (the  maximum amount of time someone can spend on the TDRL) had elapsed  since these individuals had been placed on the list, so a final disability  determination should already have been made in each case.", "To determine what final PEB disability determinations were for TDRL  placements from calendar years 2000 through 2007, we examined monthly  transactions from January 2000 through August 2008 for each case,  contained in the data we received from DMDC, to identify movement off  the TDRL due to (1) placement on the PDRL, (2) separation from the  service, (3) death, or (4) return to active duty. We counted the first of  these pay actions encountered after the date of placement on the TDRL as  the final disability determination in that case. We examined data we had  received from the relevant PEB in each case to determine which of those  separated from the service had received a disability severance payment  and which had been separated with no disability benefits.", "We also used the same DMDC monthly transaction data to determine how  long after placement on the TDRL temporary retirees received a final  disability determination. We counted the number of months, from the  month the individual in each TDRL case was initially placed on the list, to  the month that the individual was first removed from the TDRL due to (1)  placement on the PDRL, (2) separation from the service, (3) death, or (4)  return to active duty. In 1,004 cases, a separation from the service action  was followed in 1 or more months by a placed on the PDRL action. In  these cases, the time it took to receive a final disability determination was  based, instead, on the month in which placement on the PDRL occurred.", "Finally, data from the DMDC Retired Pay File on the initial and final  disability percentage ratings for TDRL placements in calendar years 2000  through 2003 were used to identify how these ratings differed, if at all. To  determine the amount of monthly benefits individuals would receive, we  multiplied the disability rating as a percentage of base pay. Thus, we  looked at the disability rating and applied the following pay guidelines to  determine what percentage of base pay TDRL retirees would be eligible to  receive: (1) TDRL payments are a minimum of 50 percent of base pay;   (2) the PDRL is not subject to any minimum payments; and (3) for both the  PDRL and the TDRL, the maximum payment is 75 percent of base pay. We  then compared the percentage of base pay individuals would be eligible  for while on the TDRL verses the percentage they would be eligible for on  the PDRL. From here, we could determine the number of TDRL retirees  whose monthly payments would increase, decrease, or stay the same once  they moved to the PDRL.", "To assess the reliability of data from DMDC\u2019s Retired Pay File, as well as  the TDRL caseload data we received from the DMDC, we performed initial  tests and checks on the data to verify that records matched our selection  criteria and were sufficiently reliable for our analyses. We obtained  documents from the military on the Retired Pay File edit file layout, the  record layout of the pay file, the definition of the data variables, how the  data in this file were collected, and the measures taken to assure data  quality. We also conducted interviews with DMDC staff to obtain more  specific information regarding the data, such as how they are stored and  maintained and how they should be interpreted and used. Based on our  assessment, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  our analyses.", "In addition to our own analysis, we reviewed and discussed with DOD  officials the results of their recent study of the TDRL, which also  examined TDRL retirees\u2019 characteristics and outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Adequacy of TDRL Management", "paragraphs": ["To assess the adequacy of TDRL management, we reviewed relevant laws,  regulations and procedures to determine    how TDRL decisions were made, monitored, and evaluated;    how reexaminations for TDRL were arranged and tracked for timeliness;    what use was made of reexaminations by nonmilitary physicians to reduce  the burden on MTFs; and   how TDRL requirements for temporary retirees were enforced.", "Specifically, we interviewed military officials and staff from each service  involved in the TDRL process, including PEB members and physicians,  Medical Command representatives, staff in each service\u2019s TDRL  administrative office or unit, Physical Evaluation Board Liaison Officers  (PEBLO), and staff at selected military treatment facilities (MTF)  responsible for scheduling and monitoring the completion of TDRL  reexaminations. We assessed the adequacy of what we learned about the  management of the TDRL based on (1) our review of TDRL laws,  regulations, and other written policies and guidance; (2) the results of our  interviews; and (3) its consistency with internal control standards for the  federal government and the requirements of the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993.", "For our discussions with PEBLOs, we selected MTFs across the services.  We also considered geographic diversity and facility size when selecting  these facilities. The information we obtained from PEBLOs at these  facilities is testimonial in nature and not intended to reflect the practices,  experiences, or opinions of PEBLOs at MTFs, in general. (See table 4.)", "To help assess the adequacy of TDRL management, we also examined the  experiences and views of temporary retirees from the Air Force, Army,  Marine Corps, and Navy. To obtain this information, we conducted a series  of 12 focus groups in June and August 2008 with individuals who were on  the TDRL. Three focus groups were conducted at each of four locations\u2014 Norfolk, Va.; Quantico, Va.; San Antonio, Tex.; and Killeen, Tex. These  locations were selected because each provided a large pool of temporary  retirees from which to draw focus group volunteers. Together, these  locations also enabled us to obtain the perspectives of temporary retirees  from each of the services.", "To recruit volunteers for these focus groups, we obtained a list of  temporary retirees who resided within a 50-mile radius of each location  from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. We attempted to  contact each temporary retiree on the list to invite them to participate in a  focus group conducted in their area. A total of 57 temporary retirees  participated in these focus groups. (See table 5.)", "Focus group participants had a wide range of characteristics. They had an  average of 12 years of military service, ranging from a minimum of 2, to a  maximum of 28 years. About three-quarters had been active duty, and  about one-quarter had been in the reserves. About one-quarter had served  in Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom.  To obtain information from the focus groups, we established a standard  protocol to facilitate the discussions. Each focus group covered several  major topics, including the overall disability evaluation process, placement  on the TDRL, periodic reexaminations while on the TDRL, and advantages  and disadvantages of being placed on the list. A GAO facilitator led each  discussion to keep participants focused on the specified issues within  discussion time frames. With the consent of focus group participants, we  recorded each discussion and had each recording professionally  transcribed.", "To summarize the results of our focus groups, we identified themes  participants raised that were common to more than one group. We verified  our analysis to ensure its reliability. While we identified a number of  common themes across the 12 focus groups, our results cannot be  generalized to the universe of all temporary retirees.", "Finally, we contacted six veterans\u2019 service organizations to obtain their  views about the TDRL process and how it affects servicemembers placed  on the list. We obtained written comments from the Disabled American  Veterans, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association, and the Military  Officers Association of America.  (See apps.
