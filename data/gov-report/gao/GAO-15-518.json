In response, DOL used the same 3-day employment workshops for the pilot that it provides to servicemembers on military bases as part of the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) in order to implement the pilot within time and resource constraints, according to DOL officials. DOL selected three states for the pilot\u2014Georgia, Washington, and West Virginia\u2014based on a number of factors, including two states with a high veteran unemployment rate, as required by law. DOL instructed each of the states to conduct five workshops\u2014West Virginia held an additional seven and Washington canceled one\u2014and delegated the responsibility for choosing locations and marketing the pilot to state workforce agencies. States held the workshops at locations other than military facilities and employed different marketing approaches to publicize the workshops, including flyers and e-mail. DOL officials said that time and resource constraints, such as implementing the pilot within its existing TAP budget, influenced the department's pilot implementation, including its decision to use the same TAP workshops, conducted over 3 consecutive days, and to offer five workshops per state.", "Officials in all three pilot states reported that the workshops benefitted veterans by enhancing their job search capabilities\u2014including resume writing and interviewing\u2014but states had difficulty attracting participants. The workshops generally fell short of DOL's attendance goals: a minimum of 10 participants and a preferred class size of 30-35 participants. A total of 250 participants attended the workshops and fewer than half of the workshops had 10 or more participants. Several state officials noted that it was difficult for veterans to schedule 3 consecutive business days to attend the workshop, and some suggested that shortening the course or offering night or weekend alternatives could have increased attendance.", "DOL's design of the pilot limits the ability to inform Congress about the feasibility and advisability of expanding the pilot. DOL's two annual reports to Congress on the pilot provided information on topics such as workshop attendance, participant demographics and satisfaction with the workshop, and noteworthy state practices and challenges. While such information is useful, DOL's pilot design leaves unanswered key questions about the need for the program, the pilot's role amid other federal programs, and the goals and objectives for measuring its progress. For example, sound pilot design practices call for agencies to conduct a needs assessment, which could have helped DOL identify the population best targeted by the pilot, given veterans' varied employment experience and limited federal resources. DOL officials said that they did not have the time and resources to do such an assessment. Additionally, DOL did not assess the extent to which such a program might fill gaps in existing federal employment programs available to veterans, as sound pilot practices suggest. As a result, it remains unclear whether, as DOL officials contend, this pilot unnecessarily duplicates other programs.

Officials from two veteran service organizations also  suggested the workshops could enhance DOL\u2019s employment programs.  Officials from one veteran service organization told us that veterans could  receive basic employment information through the workshops and then  focus on specific training needs when they access other DOL services. In  contrast, a DOL official told us that he had attended a workshop and  thought DOL\u2019s other employment and training programs covered all of the  topics in the workshop. Conducting a formal assessment of the extent to  which the pilot could either fill a service gap or enhance current programs  could have better positioned DOL to serve individuals whom existing  programs overlook or could serve in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Goals and Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Sound design principles indicate that goals and objectives can help an  agency define a pilot\u2019s need and scope, as well as help uncover any  differences in expectations and concerns program stakeholders have with  implementing the pilot. DOL officials told us that the goal of the pilot was  to test its feasibility. However, DOL did not create clear, measurable  goals\u2014as well as objectives that link to those goals\u2014that would define  what testing the pilot\u2019s feasibility meant. States, in turn, administered the  pilot based on their perception of the pilot\u2019s goals. For instance, West  Virginia officials said the purpose of the pilot was to help veterans get  \u201cjob-ready.\u201d Washington and Georgia officials said the purpose was to  serve individuals who did not take TAP.", "The lack of clearly and consistently defined goals and objectives limits  DOL\u2019s ability to measure the pilot\u2019s performance related to any expected  outcome or better inform decisions about its future. DOL\u2019s annual report  provides information on participant demographics, survey data, and  upcoming employment outcomes, but DOL cannot determine how well  the pilot performed against specific goals and objectives.

In embarking  on this effort, DOL\u2019s approach\u2014asking states to volunteer to participate  and making no modifications to the existing TAP workshop\u2014allowed it to  implement the pilot within 2 years and without additional funding. While  this approach was understandable given the time and resource  constraints DOL cited, the pilot design did not fully embrace certain sound  practices that would have enabled it to better inform congressional  decision-making about the advisability of expanding the pilot. Specifically,  questions about the need for offering the workshops to veterans and their  spouses, the program\u2019s role amid other existing federal programs, and  specific goals and objectives against which program performance could  be measured remain unanswered. The pilot has ended, but these  questions raise the issue of how to leverage the federal investment that  was made in the pilot as well as the efforts the states put into delivering  the workshops.", "In light of the low attendance levels of veterans in the pilot workshop,  information on the fundamental issue of whether such a workshop could  fill a niche for veterans that is not currently met by existing programs is  important.

DOL added that the assessment should compare the  services the AJC system provides to veterans and their spouses with the  information contained in DOL\u2019s veterans\u2019 employment workshops and  online curriculum. DOL also stated that the assessment should identify if  specific services provided within the AJC system require revision or  redesign to better meet the employment needs of veterans and their  spouses.

We also  interviewed officials from DOL\u2019s Veterans\u2019 and Employment Training  Service (VETS) about how they selected the states to test the pilot, what  steps were taken to set up the infrastructure of the workshops, such as  classroom requirements and training materials, and the extent to which  they collaborated with other federal and non-federal entities. We also  asked VETS officials about the types of performance data they planned to  collect and how they planned to report the results of the pilot. We  interviewed Department of Veterans Affairs and veteran service  organization officials about the extent to which DOL collaborated with  them during the design of the pilot and the extent to which DOL  collaborated with them in developing and implementing the pilot.", "To provide information on how the pilot was implemented and what state  officials reported regarding the benefits and challenges of the workshops  in the pilots, we conducted telephonic interviews with DOL and state  workforce agency officials in each of the pilot states: Georgia,  Washington, and West Virginia. During our interviews we asked these  officials what their roles and responsibilities were, how workshop  locations were selected, what marketing efforts states employed to  publicize the workshops, and the extent to which they collaborated with  other federal and non-federal entities. We also asked about the benefits  the veterans\u2019 employment workshops offered participants as they  searched for employment, the extent to which the workshops provided  information on veterans\u2019 benefits not offered by DOL, and any challenges  the states faced in delivering the workshops. We reviewed DOL  participant data, the results of DOL\u2019s survey of workshop participants, and  DOL\u2019s two annual reports on the pilot, including verifying the reports\u2019  workshop attendance figures with DOL and pilot states. To determine the  reliability of the data, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable of  DOL\u2019s data collection and reporting systems and reviewed agency  documentation. We concluded the participant data were sufficiently  reliable to describe certain demographic characteristics of the population  that took the workshops and were enrolled in DOL\u2019s American Job  Centers (AJC). To determine the reliability of the survey data, we  interviewed agency officials who developed the survey, reviewed agency  documentation, and consulted with GAO subject matter experts in survey  design. We determined that DOL\u2019s survey data were sufficiently reliable  for presenting qualitative response information.", "To identify how the pilot informs decisions about its possible expansion,  we reviewed how practices in pilot design can affect what an agency  learns in its evaluation of a pilot. We reviewed guidance from federal  agencies on program design and evaluation found during the course of  our research and guidance identified by subject matter experts. We  reviewed design and evaluation guidance from the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention because officials from DOL\u2019s Chief Evaluation  Office said they use that guidance for their evaluation practices. We  reviewed design guidance recommended by GAO subject matter experts  on program design and evaluation. We also reviewed GAO\u2019s Standards  for Internal Control, which identifies elements of effective internal controls  including management responsibility for defining objectives in specific and  measurable terms, communicating necessary information to achieve  objectives, and establishing and operating monitoring activities.  Moreover, we conducted an independent search for guidance to further  support the standards for program design noted in this report. We found,  for example, guidance supporting the standard of establishing and  maintaining clear communication channels with relevant stakeholders  from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health.  We found additional support for conducting a needs assessment  identifying whether a new program is needed from the Department of  Education and the Department of Transportation. GAO subject matter  experts in program design and evaluation verified the leading practices  and the extent to which the practices were relevant to our review of the  veterans\u2019 employment workshop pilot by comparing the criteria with steps  of evaluation design listed in our guide on program evaluations.
