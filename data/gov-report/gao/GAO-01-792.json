At the time SBA issued its fiscal year 2000 report, data were not yet available for the percentage increase of federal prime contracts to small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned businesses, and HUBZone small businesses.  SBA provided us with data that showed that it met only the small disadvantaged business goal.", "We had difficulty assessing SBA\u2019s progress for this outcome because SBA continues to use output measures without showing how strategies and measures relate to helping businesses succeed. In support of this goal, SBA lists four strategies, but does not provide an explanation as to how these strategies support the overall goal accomplishment of helping businesses succeed. In addition, SBA included several measures of the number of loans, but often did not correlate the impact of increasing the number of loans on small business success. For example, one goal is increasing the number of loans to veteran-owned businesses to 7,395. The narrative does not explain why this number is important. In the area of access to business development, SBA measures the number of clients being counseled or trained, but does not include outcome information on the impacts of the counseling or training. SBA\u2019s IG suggested that SBA redefine current output measures because inconsistencies in the methods used to count clients mean that one client may be counted more than once. SBA recognizes that it still relies on output measures, and that for future reports, it will make an effort to explain how the accomplishment of these output measures support the established outcome.", "In addition, two of the performance indicators \u2014 \u201cexpand research, analyses, and publication of information,\u201d and \u201cimprove small business impact analyses of regulatory alternatives\u201d \u2013 were stated as qualitative indicators and the actual performance stated as \u201cachieved\u201d at 100 percent.

These strategies were shown as goals in SBA\u2019s fiscal year 1999 report. Because of the lack of explanation in the plan and report regarding how these strategies relate to helping businesses succeed, we were unable to assess whether they are clear and reasonable.", "SBA\u2019s performance plan does not generally categorize its human capital or information technology strategies by outcome, so we could not determine specifically how this outcome of helping businesses succeed is impacted by these strategies. However, in its plan, SBA states that automation and asset sales will allow staff to shift their attention from the processing of transactions to using information to analyze programs, activities, and performance. SBA states that it plans to continue to develop and deliver training in marketing and outreach, commercial credit analysis, lender oversight, and lender relations. Additional strategies for human capital and information technology are discussed in the plan and reports as part of SBA\u2019s overall internal goal of \u201cimproving SBA management.\u201d In its performance plan, SBA provides a description of its use of interagency coordination as a strategy for this outcome.

For example, while SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 performance report shows that it met its 3-day field presence measure, SBA\u2019s IG determined that this measure has not consistently been applied by disaster area offices. For example, two disaster area offices defined field presence as the date they arrived at the disaster scene, while one area office defined the term as the date it was available to assist disaster victims. SBA did not address this discrepancy in its performance report. Also, for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, SBA\u2019s performance report shows that it met its underwriting compliance rate goal. However, SBA\u2019s IG reported that it did not consider the underwriting compliance rate to be an objective indicator. SBA did not provide a discussion on this issue in its fiscal year 2000 performance report.", "Furthermore, as shown in table 1, SBA adjusted its target goal annually for its measure of processing disaster loans within 21 days, depending on the extent to which the goal was accomplished in the previous year. In its performance report, SBA explained that its performance deteriorated because of the need to respond to widespread multiple disasters in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, including Hurricane Floyd, that affected 10 states along the East Coast and caused major widespread flooding in Texas. However, the report does not explain SBA\u2019s justification for changing its target goal rates in order to align them with their actual annual performance.", "SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2000 report acknowledges that SBA considers the disaster assistance goal difficult to achieve, due to the unpredictability of disaster activity. Our 2001 Performance and Accountability Series Report on SBA pointed out that one step that would assist SBA in stabilizing the indicator for this goal would be to modernize its loan processing in order to consistently meet its timeliness goals. Presently, few of the processes followed by SBA loan officers are automated in an integrated manner, and this lack of automation contributes to processing time. SBA officials said that they are taking various actions to revise and/or clarify the measures for the disaster assistance goal. For example, the 2002 performance plan states that SBA has developed a draft definition of \u201ceffective field presence\u201d to be applied by its Area Directors. Also, SBA plans to incorporate a \u201ccustomer satisfaction indicator\u201d as a measure for this goal, which will be designed to assess issues related to the quality and timeliness of services provided.", "In its 5-year strategic plan, SBA refers to two completed evaluations to assist in formulating its strategies for establishing this indicator. One survey evaluated customer satisfaction with the services provided to recipients of disaster loans approved after Hurricane George. Another survey was also done to measure the customer satisfaction level during the disaster loan making process. According to the strategic plan, the surveys indicated a high customer satisfaction rate. However, we identified the following limitations with the results from SBA\u2019s disaster loan making survey: (1) the survey population may not have been representative of all recipients, (2) those who were denied loans were not surveyed, (3) the survey response rate was low, and (4) the selection of response categories may have skewed the responses toward higher ratings.", "Neither SBA\u2019s plan nor its report discusses strategies for accomplishing this goal. However, SBA\u2019s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2001 through 2006 mentions strategies that include (1) developing a flexible infrastructure of resources that can be applied to a disaster area, (2) using the Internet to facilitate the disaster home loan application process, and (3) outsourcing disaster home loan servicing and carrying out asset sales. Since these strategies were not discussed in the plan and report, we could not determine how they relate directly to goal accomplishment.", "SBA\u2019s performance plan does not generally categorize its human capital or information technology strategies by outcome, so we could not determine specifically how this outcome of providing assistance to families and businesses recovering from disasters is impacted by these strategies.

However, SBA reported that it did not meet its measure of certifying a total of 12,000 small disadvantaged business firms as being eligible to receive price credits when bidding on prime contracts or to perform as subcontractors in certain industries. SBA said that it is reevaluating its goal for the number of small disadvantaged business firms it will certify because the number of firms seeking certification was much smaller than projected. SBA does not explain the strategies it is using to reevaluate this goal. SBA\u2019s original projection of the number of firms it would certify was based on the number of firms that had previously self- certified as small disadvantaged businesses. Our work has shown that a variety of factors, including uncertainty about the program, the administrative and financial burden of applying, and questions regarding the benefits of the program may have contributed to the number of small disadvantaged business certifications being lower than anticipated by SBA.", "It is not possible to determine SBA\u2019s progress in accomplishing the portion of its outcome that more eligible small disadvantaged businesses will become more successful because SBA\u2019s current success measure is not aligned with the mission of the 8(a) business development program, SBA\u2019s key program in this area. SBA\u2019s measure for the 8(a) business development program does not capture program success in terms of the number of competitive firms that exit the program without being unreasonably reliant on 8(a) and that can compete in the mainstream economy, as required by the Small Business Act, as amended. SBA\u2019s performance report states that it will measure achievement by the percentage of firms that are economically viable 3 years after graduation and states that SBA began capturing the data for this measure in fiscal year 2000. SBA\u2019s basis for reporting that it has just begun to collect this data is unclear because SBA reported on actual performance in previous years.", "SBA includes this outcome in its plan as a part of its outcome of helping businesses succeed. The strategies include: (1) developing methods to improve access to contracting opportunities for 8(a) firms; (2) working with other agencies to reform and improve the program; and (3) developing legislative, regulatory, and procedural documentation for the reform recommendations. In the human capital area, SBA noted, among other things, that it plans to provide sufficient financial and analytical training to Business Opportunity Specialists to help them more accurately evaluate a company\u2019s business profile and competitive potential.

Another strength of the 2000 report is that it concisely presents SBA\u2019s status in responding to management challenges identified by SBA\u2019s IG, documents ongoing and closed GAO and IG reviews, as well as the number of recommendations associated with each.", "However, several weaknesses we previously noted remain in SBA\u2019s report. For example, the 1999 performance report did not discuss data limitations that could affect the quality of data used by SBA to assess performance. Also, although the 1999 report generally discussed the reasons certain goals were not met, it did not include time frames or schedules for achieving the unmet goals. In comparison, the 2000 performance report did discuss data limitations, but did not include time frames or schedules for achieving the unmet goals. The 2000 performance report does include a narrative explanation of why the goal accomplishment fell short, but as with the 1999 report, it does not provide strategies for meeting unmet goals. In addition, SBA does not sufficiently link its strategies to indicators and measures and does not consistently provide summarized explanations about the data that are presented.", "Another limitation of the fiscal year 2000 report is that it did not provide a brief summarization in its section that addresses the number of indicators that were met. SBA did present this information in its fiscal year 1999 report. Although this information is included elsewhere in the report, we believe that such a narrative leading into the \u2018Performance Indicators\u2019 section for the 2000 report would have been helpful in determining SBA\u2019s approach in presenting these indicators. For example, in fiscal year 1999, SBA had a total of 59 indicators, and in 2000, it only had 16. Since the data are presented without SBA\u2019s explanation for the substantial reduction of indicators, we did not have any insight into SBA\u2019s rationale for doing so.
