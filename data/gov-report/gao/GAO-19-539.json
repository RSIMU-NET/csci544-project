Most agricultural lending is done by either commercial banks or the Farm Credit System, a network of lenders regulated by the Farm Credit Administration.

Comprehensive data on SDFRs' outstanding agricultural debt are not available because regulations generally prohibit lenders from collecting data on the personal characteristics of applicants for loans other than certain mortgages. A Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rulemaking pursuant to a provision in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that requires collection of such data in certain circumstances would modify this prohibition for certain loans, possibly including some agricultural loans. The bureau delayed the rulemaking in 2018 due to stated resource constraints and other priorities, but reported that it plans to resume work on the rule later in 2019. An annual USDA survey of farmers provides some insights into agricultural lending to SDFRs but, according to USDA, may underrepresent SDFRs compared to more inclusive estimates from the 2017 Census of Agriculture. In the 2015\u20132017 surveys, SDFRs represented an average of 17 percent of primary producers in the survey, but they accounted for 8 percent of outstanding total agricultural debt. Loans to purchase agricultural real estate accounted for most of SDFRs' outstanding debt (67 percent).", "SDFRs reportedly face a number of challenges that hamper their ability to obtain private agricultural credit. According to SDFR advocacy groups, lending industry representatives, and federal officials, SDFRs are more likely to operate smaller, lower-revenue farms, have weaker credit histories, or lack clear title to their agricultural land, which can make it difficult for them to qualify for loans. SDFR advocacy groups also said some SFDRs face actual or perceived unfair treatment in lending or may be dissuaded from applying for credit because of past instances of alleged discrimination. Additionally, they noted that some SDFRs may not be fully aware of credit options and lending requirements, especially if they are recent immigrants or new to agriculture.", "Private lenders and federal agencies conduct outreach to SDFRs, but the effectiveness of these efforts in increasing lending is unknown. For example, lenders have sponsored educational events targeted to SDFRs and translated marketing materials for non-English speakers. Farm Credit Administration regulations require Farm Credit System lenders to prepare marketing plans that include specific outreach actions for diversity and inclusion. The Farm Credit Administration examines these plans and indicated that it has prescribed corrective actions in some cases. However, the Farm Credit Administration does not require lenders to meet specific lending goals, and the regulatory data restrictions noted previously constrain the Farm Credit Administration's ability to assess the effect of outreach efforts. USDA conducts outreach to SDFRs and lenders about its loan programs and collects data on the personal characteristics of loan applicants.

For example, the 2017 questionnaire  asked for the names and demographic information of up to four producers  per farm (compared to three in 2012) and used a series of questions on  specific types of farm decisions to determine the primary producer (the  2012 questionnaire did not include these questions). Therefore,  comparisons between the two censuses regarding the number and  personal characteristics of producers and primary producers should be  considered with the 2017 revisions in mind.

In a January 2013 report, we found that large  banks were more likely to engage in transactional banking, which  focuses on highly standardized products that require little human input  to manage and are underwritten using statistical information. We  also found that small banks were more likely to consider not only data  models but information acquired by working with the customer over  time. Additionally, we found that by using this banking model, small  banks may be able to extend credit to customers who might not  receive a loan from a larger bank.

As previously discussed, SDFRs are more likely than other  farmers and ranchers to operate small farms, which can make it difficult  for them to qualify for private credit. According to data from the 2017  Census of Agriculture, SDFRs represented 30 percent of primary  producers but operated 39 percent of farms smaller than 50 acres and 16  percent of farms 500 acres or larger. Some SDFR advocates and  lending industry association representatives we interviewed said lenders  have several incentives to lend to larger farms. First, one advocate noted  that operators of smaller farms typically need smaller loans, and making  many small loans is more time- and resource-intensive than making  fewer, larger loans. Second, one industry association and one SDFR  advocate noted that large farms often produce major commodities such  as corn, soybeans, and beef cattle, while small farms often produce  specialty crops. The SDFR advocate said underwriting loans to large  farms that produce major commodities is easier and less risky because  more data are available on the market for those products. Third,  representatives of one SDFR advocacy group and one industry  association noted that programs such as crop insurance are geared  toward large, major-commodity farmers. They said these programs  mitigate repayment risk and make lenders more likely to approve a loan  or provide more favorable terms, such as lower interest rates.

Consistent with their smaller size, SDFR farms also  generate less revenue on average than non-SDFR farms. As previously  noted, SDFR primary producers accounted for a disproportionally small  portion (13 percent) of total agricultural product sales in 2017 relative to  their overall representation among primary producers (30 percent).  Additionally, according to one SDFR advocate, SDFRs may have more  difficulty than other farmers and ranchers in documenting their revenue  because they are more likely to sell their products through informal cash  transactions.", "Operating a lower-revenue farm and having limited documentation of  revenue can be hurdles to obtaining private credit because these factors  may negatively affect a lender\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s repayment  ability. Federal depository institution regulators have noted that farm  revenue is critical to demonstrating a borrower\u2019s capacity to repay an  agricultural loan. For example, in its risk management expectations for  agricultural credit, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  says banks should review borrower-prepared cash-flow statements to  identify potential repayment-ability problems. Lenders consider farm  revenue when calculating an applicant\u2019s debt-to-income ratio (the  percentage of income that goes to recurring debt payments), which is a  central underwriting criterion. In general, having lower income relative to  recurring debt payments indicates weaker repayment ability. Consistent  with this principle, Farm Credit Administration regulations require Farm  Credit System associations to have written policies and procedures that  include underwriting standards that demonstrate an applicant\u2019s  repayment capacity when approving a loan. Additionally,  representatives of one industry lending association said that revenue is  the most important factor that banks consider in underwriting agricultural  loans.", "Credit history. Some SDFRs may have relatively low credit scores or  limited credit histories, which can make it difficult to obtain agricultural  credit. Some SDFR advocates and lending industry association  representatives we interviewed said that some SDFR subgroups are  more likely than members of nondisadvantaged groups to have difficulty  meeting credit score standards for agricultural loans. Prior research  provides some evidence to support this view. For example, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System reported in 2007 that African  Americans and Hispanics had lower credit scores on average than non- Hispanic whites and Asians, although the study did not specifically  examine farmers and ranchers.", "While private agricultural lenders are not subject to federal statutory or  regulatory credit score requirements for approving agricultural loans,  federal depository institution regulators emphasize the importance of  evaluating applicants\u2019 creditworthiness in their lending guidelines. For  example, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2019s handbook on  agricultural lending states that current credit information is essential to a  bank\u2019s ability to evaluate borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. Lending industry  association representatives we interviewed also noted that underwriting  for agricultural lending is increasingly standardized and reliant on credit  scores. For example, representatives from the Farm Credit Council (the  trade association for the Farm Credit System) said approval decisions for  about one-half of the loans that Farm Credit System associations make  each year are made using credit scorecards. Credit scorecards are  algorithms that statistically quantify a borrower\u2019s probability of repayment  using inputs such as the borrower\u2019s credit score. Additionally, participation in the secondary market for agricultural loans may require  lenders to comply with credit score criteria. For example, the Federal  Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (commonly known as Farmer Mac)\u2014a  federal government-sponsored enterprise that purchases and securitizes  agricultural loans\u2014has minimum credit score standards that range from  660 to 720.", "Collateral. Some SDFRs face challenges using their agricultural land as  collateral. Many long-term agricultural loans require the borrower to  pledge land as collateral to secure the transaction. For example, long- term loans (up to 40 years) made by Farm Credit System associations  must be secured by a first-position lien on interests in real estate,  generally enabling the Farm Credit System to obtain ownership or control  of the land in the event of default. Federal regulators, lending industry  association representatives, and SDFR advocates we spoke with  identified several reasons why SDFRs, especially African Americans and  American Indians on tribal lands, have difficulty using agricultural land as  loan collateral.", "Some SDFRs do not have a clear title to their agricultural land because  the land was passed down informally from generation to generation  without a will. In addition, land passed down in this manner can result in  numerous heirs\u2014thousands in some cases\u2014owning the land in common  (that is, not physically divided among them). These circumstances can  limit use of the land as collateral because of lending requirements or  conventions that require formal proof of ownership or that disallow the  use of a partial ownership interest as security for a loan. SDFR  advocates and officials from the Farm Credit Administration told us these  issues have particularly affected African American farmers due to  historical factors that limited their access to legal services. In our May  2019 report about lending on tribal lands, we discussed how these issues  also have posed problems for American Indian farmers.", "As we also reported in May 2019, American Indian farmers on tribal lands  face additional challenges in using tribal land as collateral for agricultural  loans because of statutory restrictions and some lenders\u2019 concerns about  their ability to enforce a foreclosure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Farmer Advocates Report Additional Challenges for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Seeking Agricultural Credit", "paragraphs": ["SDFR advocates we spoke with said that in addition to difficulty meeting  loan underwriting standards, SDFRs face challenges related to historical  discrimination, ongoing unfair treatment by lenders, and a lack of  familiarity with some programs and technologies when trying to obtain  private agricultural credit.", "As the Congressional Research Service reported in 2013, allegations of  unlawful discrimination against SDFRs in the management of USDA  programs are long-standing and well-documented. For example, in  1965, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights found evidence of  discrimination in the delivery of USDA farm programs, including loan  programs. A subsequent report by the commission in 1982 and a report  by the USDA Civil Rights Action Team in 1997 found continuing problems  with the experience or treatment of SDFRs in USDA programs. USDA  has also settled several class action lawsuits that SDFRs filed for, among  other things, discrimination in the agency\u2019s farm assistance programs.  The allegations in these lawsuits included that USDA systematically  denied SDFRs agricultural credit and other program benefits in violation  of ECOA and failed to investigate complaints of discrimination, as  required by USDA regulations. The settlements made more than $4  billion in awards available to farmers and ranchers whose claims were  approved through administrative procedures.", "Some SDFR advocates told us that historical discrimination in agricultural  lending adversely affects SDFRs\u2019 current ability to obtain private credit in  several ways. First, they said SDFRs who were unfairly denied USDA  loans and other program benefits in the past have not been able to  develop their farms in the same ways as farmers and ranchers who did  receive loans, thus reducing their ability to obtain private credit today. The  advocates elaborated that USDA agricultural credit allows recipients to  expand operations and to purchase land and equipment that can later be  used as collateral, making it easier to get subsequent and larger loans.  Some SDFR advocates also stated that historical exclusion from credit  markets and farm programs has limited SDFRs\u2019 familiarity with lending  standards and resulted in less formal recordkeeping, which impairs their  ability to obtain private-sector credit. Finally, advocates said that historical  discrimination has led generations of SDFRs to distrust institutional  lenders, making them less likely to apply for credit.", "Some SDFR advocates we spoke with said that unfair treatment by  private lenders is also a barrier to SDFRs obtaining private agricultural  credit. One SDFR advocate said some lenders discriminate against  SDFRs in loan approval decisions but that they more frequently treat  SDFRs unfairly with respect to loan terms and conditions (for example,  interest rates, fees, and collateral requirements) and loan servicing (for  example, restructuring and foreclosure mitigation actions). Another noted  that adverse loan terms and conditions and servicing practices can  increase the risk that borrowers will lose their farm, house, and other  property by making the loan unaffordable or reducing the chances that  borrowers will catch up on payments if they fall behind. For example, this  SDFR advocate said they were aware of cases in which (1) lenders  required SDFRs to pledge potentially excessive collateral for loans, such  as the borrower\u2019s home in addition to the farm land, and (2) loan servicers  moved more quickly to foreclose on SDFR borrowers who were behind on  loan payments than on other borrowers and did not provide repayment  options that may have allowed them to continue their operations. One  SDFR advocate also stated that some SDFRs report not feeling welcome  at lending institutions based on the perception of having been repeatedly  dismissed by lender staff, while another said that in some cases, SDFRs  have not been provided timely or helpful information on the loan  application process. One SDFR advocate we spoke with said these  practices are prevalent in some agricultural credit markets and that they  had been or were currently involved in litigation related to these types of  practices.", "However, banking industry association representatives said they did not  believe that SDFRs are being treated unfairly and that denying loans to  qualified applicants would cause lenders to decrease profits in a  competitive market. They noted that lenders face significant competition,  which incentivizes them to make loans to all qualified borrowers, and that  lending decisions and loan terms are based only on the applicant\u2019s ability  to repay a loan and other underwriting criteria. We did not attempt to  independently verify claims of unfair treatment of SDFRs by private-sector  lenders, in part because data limitations discussed earlier limit the  identification and analysis of possible discriminatory practices.", "Some SDFR advocates also said that some SDFRs may not be obtaining  private agricultural credit because they are not aware of all potential credit  options and related programs and are not always familiar with the  technology needed to access them. For example, one advocate told us  some SDFRs may not be aware that they could qualify for private  agricultural loans, especially if they are recent immigrants or new to  agriculture. This problem may be particularly true for loans from the Farm  Credit System associations. Two advocates said SDFRs are not familiar  with these lenders, and representatives of the Farm Credit Council told us  people who did not grow up in farming tended not to know about the Farm  Credit System. SDFR advocates we spoke with said this issue is  exacerbated by limited outreach by private lenders to SDFRs, as  discussed in more detail later in this report. Advocates also noted that  historically disadvantaged groups are less likely to have access to or be  familiar with computer technology and the internet, and that credit  applications and related financial education programs are now provided  online."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lenders and Federal Agencies Conduct Some Outreach to Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers, but the Effectiveness of These Efforts Is Unknown", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Farm Credit System Outreach Is Not Specifically Targeted to Socially Disadvantaged Groups, and Data Collection Restrictions Prevent Assessment of Impact", "paragraphs": ["The Farm Credit System does not have a specific mandate to serve  SDFRs, but its associations conduct some outreach to SDFRs in  implementing the following statutory requirements and Farm Credit  Administration regulations.", "The Farm Credit Act of 1971 was amended in 1980 to require the  Farm Credit System to serve young, beginning, and small farmers.

The regulations, which first applied to 2013 business  plans, require Farm Credit System associations to develop marketing  plans describing, among other things, (1) the demographic groups in  their service areas, (2) ways to market their services to all qualified  farmers and ranchers, and (3) specific outreach toward diversity and  inclusion in each market segment.

Neither the Farm Credit Administration nor the Farm  Credit Council maintains aggregated information on the number or type of  completed outreach activities involving SDFR participants. However, our  nongeneralizable review of recent marketing plans from six Farm Credit  System associations in areas with relatively high proportions of SDFRs  identified some examples of outreach to SDFRs. For instance, some  associations have partnered with a nonprofit organization to provide  educational programs designed to strengthen women\u2019s roles in the  modern farm enterprise. Associations have also participated in  agricultural conferences at historically black colleges and universities and  translated marketing materials for non-English speakers.", "Despite some outreach, some SDFR advocates we spoke with said that  Farm Credit System associations\u2019 outreach has had limited effects on the  amount of credit provided to SDFRs and SDFRs\u2019 familiarity with the  system. One SDFR advocate we spoke with said that while some Farm  Credit System associations engage with socially disadvantaged  communities, the outreach has not increased the diversity of the system\u2019s  borrowers. Others said that Farm Credit System outreach to SDFR  communities has been insufficient and that some SDFRs are still not  aware of the Farm Credit System.

Accordingly,  the associations are not expected to quantify the extent to which they are  meeting their diversity and inclusion outreach plans in the information  they provide to their boards of directors. Moreover, Farm Credit  Administration officials said Regulation B, discussed earlier, prevents the  associations from collecting data on the race, ethnicity, and sex of loan  applicants that would be needed to assess the effects of outreach efforts  on lending to socially disadvantaged groups. In contrast, the officials  noted that Farm Credit System associations are required to set lending  targets for young, beginning, and small farmers; monitor outreach to  those groups; and report on performance results of their young,  beginning, and small farmer programs. In 2018, the Farm Credit System  reported that all direct-lender institutions with young, beginning, and small  farmer programs within the system were in compliance with these  requirements.", "While the Farm Credit Administration has not evaluated the impact of  outreach by Farm Credit System associations, its reviews of association  marketing plans have found that most of the plans comply with  requirements for outreach toward diversity and inclusion but that some  lack specificity.

Farm Credit Administration officials reviewed their examinations  from 2014 and 2017, the two scheduled examination cycles after the new  requirements were implemented in 2012. They found that 85 percent of  the 78 Farm Credit System associations examined in 2014 complied with  the marketing and outreach requirements, and 94 percent of the 71  associations examined in 2017 complied. In cases where examiners  identified deficiencies in marketing plans, the agency said it prescribed  corrective actions, including requiring associations to do the following: obtain sufficiently detailed information to analyze and understand develop specific action plans and outreach strategies to market the  institution\u2019s products and services to potentially underserved markets;  and ensure appropriate reporting on progress in accomplishing marketing  plan strategies and actions.", "Farm Credit Administration officials said they hold periodic discussions  with managers of Farm Credit System associations to monitor the status  of corrective actions and conduct follow-up examinations to determine the  adequacy of the corrective actions and, if applicable, the need for  additional enhancements.", "The results of our review of a nongeneralizable sample of association  marketing plans were broadly consistent with the Farm Credit  Administration\u2019s findings.

Further, we also reviewed illustrative examples of  outreach materials to SDFRs developed by USDA and the federal  depository institution regulators, and we interviewed officials from these  agencies about their outreach efforts.", "To gain further insight into challenges faced by and outreach efforts to  SDFRs, we interviewed (1) SDFR advocacy and research organizations,  (2) industry group representatives, and (3) federal agency officials. We  refer collectively to the entities we interviewed as stakeholders. To select  SDFR advocacy and research organizations, we used a snowball  sampling technique that identified organizations based on referrals  obtained during prior GAO studies and referrals from stakeholder  interviews during this study. We limited our interviews to organizations  that are national in scope and that focus on one or more socially  disadvantaged populations and on agricultural credit or finance. Based on  the snowball sampling, we identified and interviewed representatives from  the following five groups: Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers  Policy Research Center, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition,  National Black Farmers Association, Rural Coalition, and Rural  Advancement Foundation International-USA. The snowball sampling did  not identify a national advocacy organization focused on women  farmers\u2014the largest SDFR subgroup\u2014but we identified American Agri- Women based on an internet search, and we interviewed representatives  from that organization as well. Because the group of organizations we  interviewed was a nonprobability sample, the information they provided is  not generalizable.", "We also interviewed representatives from lending industry groups\u2014the  American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers of  America, and the Farm Credit Council\u2014that we selected to cover the  major types of private institutional lenders that make agricultural loans,  including large commercial banks, community banks, and the Farm Credit  System. Additionally, we contacted industry associations representing  insurance companies and community development financial institutions\u2014 both of which provide some agricultural credit\u2014but representatives from  these associations said they did not have information directly related to  our research topic.", "Finally, we interviewed officials from USDA and its Farm Service Agency,  the Farm Credit Administration, CFPB, and the federal depository  institution regulators.", "For our work on credit challenges faced by SDFRs, we also drew upon  information and analysis from our May 2019 report on agricultural lending  on tribal lands. Among other things, that report describes (1) what is  known about the agricultural credit needs of Indian tribes and their  members, (2) barriers stakeholders identified to agricultural credit on tribal  lands, and (3) Farm Credit System authority and actions to meet those  agricultural credit needs.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Steve Westley (Assistant  Director); Jeremy Anthony (Analyst in Charge); Katherine Carter; William  Chatlos; Tom Cook; Sam Portnow; Jennifer Schwartz; Jena Sinkfield;  Tyler Spunaugle; and Farrah Stone made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Can women and minorities get the loans they need to buy and operate farms?", "According to USDA survey data, these \"socially disadvantaged\" farmers and ranchers get a disproportionately small share of farm loans. More detailed information isn\u2019t available on farm lending to these groups because lenders generally aren't allowed to record an applicant's race or sex.", "Advocates, industry representatives, and federal officials told us socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers may have trouble getting loans because they have lower-revenue farms and weaker credit histories on average. Some advocates also allege ongoing discrimination in farm lending."]}
