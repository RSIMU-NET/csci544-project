The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), along with airports, is responsible for security at TSA-regulated airports. To guide risk assessment and protection of critical infrastructure, including airports, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). GAO was asked to examine the extent to which, for airport perimeters and access controls, TSA (1) assessed risk consistent with the NIPP; (2) implemented protective programs, and evaluated its worker screening pilots; and (3) established a strategy to guide decision making. GAO examined TSA documents related to risk assessment activities, airport security programs, and worker screening pilots; visited nine airports of varying size; and interviewed TSA, airport, and association officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although TSA has implemented activities to assess risks to airport perimeters and access controls, such as a commercial aviation threat assessment, it has not conducted vulnerability assessments for 87 percent of the nation's approximately 450 commercial airports or any consequence assessments. As a result, TSA has not completed a comprehensive risk assessment combining threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessments as required by the NIPP. While TSA officials said they intend to conduct a consequence assessment and additional vulnerability assessments, TSA could not provide further details, such as milestones for their completion. Conducting a comprehensive risk assessment and establishing milestones for its completion would provide additional assurance that intended actions will be implemented, provide critical information to enhance TSA's understanding of risks to airports, and help ensure resources are allocated to the highest security priorities. Since 2004, TSA has taken steps to strengthen airport security and implement new programs; however, while TSA conducted a pilot program to test worker screening methods, clear conclusions could not be drawn because of significant design limitations and TSA did not document key aspects of the pilot. TSA has taken steps to enhance airport security by, among other things, expanding its requirements for conducting worker background checks and implementing a worker screening program. In fiscal year 2008 TSA pilot tested various methods to screen airport workers to compare the benefits, costs, and impacts of 100 percent worker screening and random worker screening. TSA designed and implemented the pilot in coordination with the Homeland Security Institute (HSI), a federally funded research and development center. However, because of significant limitations in the design and evaluation of the pilot, such as the limited number of participating airports--7 out of about 450--it is unclear which method is more cost-effective. TSA and HSI also did not document key aspects of the pilot's design, methodology, and evaluation, such as a data analysis plan, limiting the usefulness of these efforts. A well-developed and well-documented evaluation plan can help ensure that pilots generate needed performance information to make effective decisions. While TSA has completed these pilots, developing an evaluation plan for future pilots could help ensure that they are designed and implemented to provide management and Congress with necessary information for decision making. TSA's efforts to enhance the security of the nation's airports have not been guided by a unifying national strategy that identifies key elements, such as goals, priorities, performance measures, and required resources. For example, while TSA's various airport security efforts are implemented by federal and local airport officials, TSA officials said that they have not identified or estimated costs to airport operators for implementing security requirements. GAO has found that national strategies that identify these key elements strengthen decision making and accountability; in addition, developing a strategy with these elements could help ensure that TSA prioritizes its activities and uses resources efficiently to achieve intended outcomes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent criminal incidents involving airport workers using their access  privileges to smuggle weapons and drugs into secured areas of commercial  airports and onto planes has heightened concerns about the risks posed by  workers and the security of airport perimeters and access to secured  areas. Moreover, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the  agency primarily responsible for securing the nation\u2019s civil aviation  system, has identified workers with access to secured airport areas as one  of the greatest potential threats to aviation and highlighted the need to  keep airport perimeters secure. Pursuant to the Aviation and  Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which was signed into law shortly  after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, TSA assumed primary  responsibility for implementing and overseeing security operations within  the nation\u2019s civil aviation system. This includes overseeing U.S. airport  operator efforts to maintain and improve the security of perimeters and  the access controls, as well as implementing measures to reduce risks  posed by workers at the nation\u2019s commercial airports. While airport  operators, not TSA, generally retain direct day-to-day operational  responsibility for these areas of security, TSA is responsible for  establishing and implementing measures to improve the security of airport  perimeters and access controls to secured areas within the airports and to  reduce the security risks posed by airport workers.", "In 2004 we reported that TSA had taken steps to enhance the security of  airport perimeters and access controls, but that it faced challenges in  identifying security weaknesses of the commercial airport system,  prioritizing funding to address the most critical security needs, and taking  steps to reduce the risks posed by airport workers. We recommended,  among other things, that TSA determine if and when additional security  requirements are needed to reduce the risks posed by airport workers.  TSA generally concurred with our findings and recommendations and has  taken steps to address these recommendations.", "Since it is not feasible to protect all assets and systems against every  possible threat, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has called  for using a risk management approach to prioritize its investments,  develop plans, and allocate resources in a risk-informed way that balances  security and commerce. Risk management calls for a cost-effective use of  resources and focuses on developing and implementing protective actions  that offer the greatest mitigation of risk for any given expenditure. A risk  management approach entails a continual process of managing risk  through a series of actions, including setting goals and objectives,  assessing risk, evaluating alternatives, selecting initiatives to undertake,  and implementing and monitoring those initiatives. In 2009 DHS updated  the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), which names TSA as  the primary federal agency responsible for coordinating critical  infrastructure protection efforts within the transportation sector and  establishes a risk management framework to guide security decisions.", "To respond to the threat posed by airport workers, the Explanatory  Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008, directed that  TSA use $15 million of its appropriation to conduct a pilot program to help  identify the potential costs and benefits of 100 percent worker screening  and other worker screening methods. TSA worked with airport  stakeholders to develop the program, and in May 2008 began to test  various methods of screening workers\u2014including 100 percent worker  screening\u2014at seven airports located throughout the nation. TSA issued a  final report on the results of the pilot program in July 2009.", "You requested that we examine TSA\u2019s actions since 2004 to strengthen the  security of commercial airport perimeters and access to secured airport  areas. This report evaluates to what extent TSA has    assessed the risk to airport security consistent with the NIPP risk  management framework;  implemented protective programs to strengthen airport security, and  evaluated its worker screening pilot program; and    established a national strategy to guide airport security decision making.", "To conduct our review, we examined documents related to TSA\u2019s risk  assessment and security activities and programs with regard to airport  security, such as TSA\u2019s Civil Aviation Threat Assessment. We also  reviewed documents related to TSA\u2019s airport perimeter and access  controls security\u2013related programs, such as standard operating  procedures for the Aviation Direct Access Screening Program (TSA\u2019s  random worker screening program), as well as relevant laws, presidential  directives, and TSA management directives. We compared this information  with criteria in DHS\u2019s NIPP, the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific  Plan (TS-SSP), TSA\u2019s risk management methodology, and our prior work  on risk management. We relied on TSA to identify its risk assessment  activities for airport security, and we examined how these individual  threat and vulnerability assessment activities addressed the security of  airport perimeter and access controls. Because of the scope of our work,  we did not assess the extent to which each of these activities met the NIPP  core criteria for individual threat and vulnerability assessments; however,  we examined the extent to which the various types of assessment  activities TSA identified, taken together, met the NIPP criteria for  completing a comprehensive risk assessment that combines threat,  vulnerability, and consequence assessments. We also compared TSA\u2019s  approach to securing the nation\u2019s airport perimeters and access to secured  areas with guidance on security strategies and planning that we previously  reported. We obtained data from TSA officials on vulnerability  assessment activities and, by obtaining information on the processes used  to schedule and track these activities, determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To better understand  how TSA has used this information, we interviewed TSA officials  responsible for risk management and security programs related to airport  perimeters and access controls. We also collected TSA data on security  breaches\u2014any violations of security requirements\u2014at commercial  airports; however, TSA could not distinguish the number of breaches  related only to airport perimeter and access control security from other  types of breaches. By obtaining information on the processes used to  collect, tabulate, and assess these data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to present contextual information regarding all  breaches to secured areas (including the airport perimeter).", "In addition, we asked TSA to identify agency-led activities and programs  for strengthening airport security, as well as procedures for developing  and issuing airport perimeter and access control security requirements  through security directives. We then assessed and summarized the  program information, operations directives, and standard operating  procedures provided by TSA to determine if the agency addressed relevant  statutory requirements and recommendations from our 2004 report. We  also evaluated TSA\u2019s final report on its worker screening pilot program,  including conclusions and limitations cited by the contractor\u2014the  Homeland Security Institute (HSI)\u2014TSA hired to assist with the pilot\u2019s  design, implementation, and evaluation. Further, we analyzed TSA and  HSI\u2019s documentation of the pilot program\u2019s methodology and  implementation, and compared it to criteria in standards for internal  control in the federal government and our previous work on pilot program  development and evaluation. At our request, TSA identified 25 security  directives and emergency amendments that imposed requirements related  to airport perimeter and access control security, which we examined to  identify specific areas of regulation. To obtain additional information on  TSA\u2019s efforts to strengthen airport security, we interviewed officials from  the two industry associations that support commercial airport operators  and their personnel, and conducted site visits at 9 of approximately 450  U.S. commercial airports. During these visits we toured airport facilities  and interviewed federal security directors (FSD) and airport security  coordinators. We selected these airports based on several factors,  including airport size, category, geographical dispersion, and  technological initiatives related to airport perimeter and access control  security (such as infrared intrusion detection systems). In addition, we  conducted interviews with officials from four airports that had voluntarily  implemented or were considering implementing additional worker  screening methods. While the experiences of these officials and airports  cannot be generalized to all airports and security officials, they provided  insight into how security efforts were chosen and developed. A more  detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is contained in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through September  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Among other things, ATSA directs TSA  to improve the security of airport perimeters and the access controls  leading to secured areas, and take measures to reduce the security risks  posed by airport workers. (See app. II for more specific details on ATSA  requirements and TSA\u2019s actions to address these requirements.) TSA has  158 FSDs who oversee the implementation of, and adherence to, TSA  requirements at the approximately 450 commercial airports nationwide. As  part of TSA\u2019s oversight role, it also conducts compliance inspections,  covert testing, and vulnerability assessments to analyze and improve  security.

For example, the  Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008,  directed that TSA allocate $15 million of its appropriation to a worker  screening pilot program. TSA does not track the amount of funds spent in  total for perimeter and access controls because related efforts and  activities can be part of broader security programs that also serve other  aspects of aviation security. In addition, airports may receive federal  funding for perimeter and access control security, such as through federal  grant programs or TSA pilot programs. (For more information on such  airport security costs and funding, see app. IV.)", "Airport operators have direct responsibility for day-to-day aviation  operations, including, in general, the security of airport perimeters, access  controls, and workers, as well as for implementing TSA security  requirements. Airport operators implement security requirements in  accordance with their TSA-approved security programs. Elements of a  security program may include, among other things, procedures for  performing background checks on airport workers, applicable training  programs for these workers, and procedures and measures for controlling  access to secured airport areas. Security programs may also be required to  describe the secured areas of the airport, including a description and map  detailing boundaries and pertinent features of the secured areas, and the  measures used to control access to such areas.", "Commercial airports are generally divided into designated areas that have  varying levels of security, known as secured areas, security identification  display areas (SIDA), air operations areas (AOA), and sterile areas.  Sterile areas, located within the terminal, are where passengers wait after  screening to board departing aircraft. Access to sterile areas is controlled  by TSA screeners at security checkpoints, where they conduct physical  screening of passengers and their property. Airport workers may access  the sterile area through the security checkpoint or through other access  points secured by the airport operator in accordance with its security  program. The SIDA and the AOA are not to be accessed by passengers, and  typically encompass baggage loading areas, areas near terminal buildings,  and other areas close to parked aircraft and airport facilities, as illustrated  in figure 1.", "Securing access to the sterile area from other secured areas\u2014such as the  SIDA\u2014and security within the area, is the responsibility of the airport  operator, in accordance with its security program. Airport perimeter and  access control security is intended to prevent unauthorized access into  secured areas\u2014either from outside the airport complex or from within the  airport\u2019s sterile area. Individual airport operators determine the  boundaries for each of these areas on a case-by-case basis, depending on  the physical layout of the airport and in accordance with TSA  requirements. As a result, some of these areas may overlap. Within these  areas, airport operators are responsible for safeguarding their airfield  barriers, preventing and detecting unauthorized entry into secured areas,  and conducting background checks of workers with unescorted access to  secured areas.", "Methods used by airports to control access through perimeters or into  secured areas vary because of differences in the design and layout of  individual airports, but all access controls must meet minimum  performance standards in accordance with TSA requirements. These  methods typically involve the use of one or more of the following:  pedestrian and vehicle gates, keypad access codes using personal  identification numbers, magnetic stripe cards and readers, turnstiles, locks  and keys, and security personnel.", "According to TSA officials, airport security breaches occur within and  around secured areas at domestic airports (see fig. 2 for the number of  security breaches reported by TSA from fiscal year 2004 through fiscal  year 2008). While some breaches may represent dry runs by terrorists or  others to test security or criminal incidents involving airport workers,  most are accidental. TSA requires FSDs to report security breaches that  occur both at the airports for which they are responsible and on board  aircraft destined for their airports. TSA officials said that they review  security breach data and report them to senior management as requested,  and provide data on serious breaches to senior management on a daily  basis, as applicable.", "According to a TSA official, the increase in known breaches from fiscal  years 2004 through 2005 reflects a change in the requirements for  reporting security breaches that TSA issued in December 2005. This  change provided more specific instructions to FSDs on how to categorize  different types of security incidents. Regarding increases in security  breaches from fiscal years 2005 through 2008, TSA officials said that while  they could not fully explain these increases, there could be several reasons  to account for this growth. For example, according to TSA officials,  changes in TSA management often trigger increases in specific types of  breaches reported, such as since 2004, when the priorities of the new  Administrator resulted in an increase in the reporting of restricted items.  TSA officials also stated that a report of a security breach at a major U.S.  airport is likely to cause security and law enforcement officials elsewhere  to subsequently raise the overall awareness of security requirements for a  period of time. In addition, TSA noted that certain inspections conducted  by TSA officials tend to produce heightened awareness by federal and  airport employees whose perimeter security and access control  procedures are being inspected for compliance with regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Management Approach Can Help Guide Homeland Security Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Risk management is a tool for informing policymakers\u2019 decisions about  assessing risks, allocating resources, and taking actions under conditions  of uncertainty.

Risk management, as applied in the transportation  security context, can help federal decision makers determine where and  how to invest limited resources within and among the various modes of  transportation. In accordance with Homeland Security Presidential  Directive (HSPD) 7, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated TSA as  the sector-specific agency for the transportation security sector, requiring  TSA to identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical  infrastructure and key resources within this sector and integrate risk  management strategies into its protective activities. In June 2006, in  accordance with HSPD-7 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS  released the NIPP, which it later updated in 2009. The NIPP developed a  risk management framework for homeland security. In accordance with  the NIPP, TSA developed the TS-SSP to govern its strategy for securing the  transportation sector, as well as annexes for each mode of transportation,  including aviation. The NIPP and TS-SSP set forth risk management  principles, including a comprehensive risk assessment process for  considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessments to  determine the likelihood of terrorist attacks and the severity of the  impacts.

Risk assessments also help decision  makers identify and evaluate potential risks so that countermeasures can  be designed and implemented to prevent or mitigate the potential effects  of the risks. The NIPP characterizes risk assessment as a function of three  elements:    Threat: The likelihood that a particular asset, system, or network will  suffer an attack or an incident. In the context of risk associated with a  terrorist attack, the estimate of this is based on the analysis of the intent  and the capability of an adversary; in the context of a natural disaster or  accident, the likelihood is based on the probability of occurrence.", "Vulnerability: The likelihood that a characteristic of, or flaw in, an  asset\u2019s, system\u2019s, or network\u2019s design, location, security posture, process,  or operation renders it susceptible to destruction, incapacitation, or  exploitation by terrorist or other to intentional acts, mechanical failures,  and natural hazards.", "Consequence: The negative effects on public health and safety, the  economy, public confidence in institutions, and the functioning of  government, both direct and indirect, that can be expected if an asset,  system, or network is damaged, destroyed, or disrupted by a terrorist  attack, natural disaster, or other incident.", "Information from the three elements used in assessing risk\u2014threat,  vulnerability, and consequence\u2014can lead to a risk characterization and  provide input for prioritizing security goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Assess Threats and Vulnerabilities for Airport Security, but Has Not Conducted a Comprehensive Risk Assessment to Help Identify Priorities and Allocate Resources", "paragraphs": ["While TSA has taken steps to assess risk, it has not conducted a  comprehensive risk assessment based on assessments of threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences.

TSA officials told us that they have not completed a comprehensive risk  assessment for airport security, although they said that they have prepared  and are currently reviewing a draft of a comprehensive, scenario-based air  domain risk assessment (ADRA), which officials said is to serve as a  comprehensive risk assessment for airport security. According to  officials, the ADRA is to address all three elements of risk for domestic  commercial aviation, general aviation, and air cargo. However, TSA has  not released it as originally planned for in February 2008. As of May 2009  TSA officials had not provided revised dates for when the agency expects  to finalize the ADRA, and they could not provide documentation to  demonstrate to what extent the ADRA will address all three components  of risk for airport perimeter and access control security.

The 2008 assessment characterized the insider  threat as \u201cone of the greatest threats to aviation,\u201d which TSA officials  explained is meant to reflect the opportunity insiders have to do damage,  as well as the vulnerability of commercial airports to an insider attack,  which these officials stated as being very high. As of May 2009, TSA had  no knowledge of a specific plot by terrorists or others to breach the  security of any domestic commercial airport.

Both Congress and the administration have  recognized uncertainty inherent in intelligence analysis, and have required  analytic products within the intelligence community to properly caveat  and express uncertainties or confidence in resulting conclusions or  judgments. As a result, the intelligence community and the Department of  Defense have adopted this practice in reporting threat intelligence. Since  TSA does not assign confidence levels to its analytic judgments, it is  difficult for TSA to correctly prioritize its tactics and investments based on  uncertain intelligence.

TSA officials told us that their primary measures for assessing the  vulnerability of commercial airports to attack are the collective results of  joint vulnerability assessments (JVA) and professional judgment. TSA  officials said that the agency plans to expand the number of JVAs  conducted in the future but, as of May 2009, did not have a plan for doing  so.", "According to TSA officials, JVAs are assessments that teams of TSA  special agents and other officials conduct jointly with the Federal Bureau  of Investigation (FBI) and, as required by law, are generally conducted  every 3 years for airports identified as high risk. In response to our 2004  recommendation that TSA establish a schedule and analytical approach  for completing vulnerability assessments for evaluating airport security,  TSA developed criteria to select and prioritize airports as high-risk for  assessment. TSA officials stated that in addition to assessing airports  identified as high risk, the agency has also assessed the vulnerability of  other airports at the request of FSDs. According to TSA\u2019s TS-SSP, after  focusing initially on airports deemed high risk, JVAs are to be conducted  at all commercial airports. TSA officials stated that JVA teams assess all  aspects of airport security and operations, including fuel, cargo, catering,  general aviation, terminal area and law enforcement operations, and the  controls that limit access to secured areas and the integrity of the airport  perimeter. However, officials emphasized that a JVA is not intended to be  a review of an airport\u2019s compliance with security requirements and teams  do not impose penalties for noncompliance. From fiscal years 2004  through 2008, TSA conducted 67 JVAs at a total of 57 airports\u2014about 13  percent of the approximately 450 commercial airports nationwide. In 2007  TSA officials conducted a preliminary analysis of the results of JVAs  conducted at 23 domestic airports during fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and  found 6 areas in which 20 percent or more of the airports assessed were  identified as vulnerable. Specific vulnerabilities included the absence of  blast resistant glass in terminal windows, lack of bollards/barriers in front  of terminals, lack of blast resistant trash receptacles, and insufficient  electronic surveillance of perimeter lines and access points. As of May  2009 TSA officials said that the agency had not finalized this analysis and,  as of that date, did not have plans to do so. TSA officials also told us that  they have shared the results of JVA reports with TSA\u2019s Office of Security  Technology to prioritize the distribution of relevant technology to those  airports with vulnerabilities that these technologies could strengthen.", "TSA characterizes U.S. airports as a system of interdependent hubs and  links (spokes) in which the security of all is affected or disrupted by the  security of the weakest one. The interdependent nature of the system  necessitates that TSA protect the overall system as well as individual  assets. TSA maintains that such a \u201csystems-based approach\u201d allows it to  focus resources on reducing risks across the entire system while  maintaining cost-effectiveness and efficiency. TSA officials could not  explain to what extent the collective JVAs of specific airports constitute a  reasonable systems-based assessment of vulnerability across airports  nationwide or whether the agency has considered assessing vulnerabilities  across all airports. Although TSA has conducted JVAs at each category of  airport, 58 of the 67 were at the largest airports. According to TSA data,  87 percent of commercial airports\u2014most of the smaller Category II, III,  and IV airports\u2014have not received a JVA. TSA officials said that because  they have not conducted JVAs for these airports, they do not know how  vulnerable they are to an intentional security breach. In 2004 we reported  that TSA intended to compile baseline data on airport security  vulnerabilities to enable it to conduct a systematic analysis of airport  security vulnerabilities nationwide. At that time TSA officials told us that  such analysis was essential since it would allow the agency to determine  the adequacy of security policies and help TSA and airport operators  better direct limited resources. According to TSA officials, conducting  JVAs at all airports would allow them to compile national baseline data on  perimeter and access control security vulnerabilities. As of May 2009,  however, TSA officials had not yet completed a nationwide vulnerability  assessment, evaluated whether the current approach to JVAs would  provide the desired systems-based approach to assessing airport security  vulnerabilities, or explained why a nationwide assessment or evaluation  has not been conducted. In subsequent discussions, TSA officials told us  that based on our review they intend to increase the number of JVAs  conducted at airports that are not categorized as high risk\u2014primarily  Category II, III, and IV airports. According to officials, the resulting data  are to assist TSA in prioritizing the allocation of limited resources.  However, TSA officials could not tell us how many additional airports they  plan to assess in total or within each category, the analytical approach and  time frames for conducting these assessments, and to what extent these  additional assessments, in combination with past JVAs, will constitute a  reasonable systems-based assessment of vulnerability across airports  nationwide. Standard practices for program management call for  establishing a management plan and milestones to meet stated objectives  and achieve results. It is also unclear to what extent the ADRA, when it is  completed, will represent a systems-based vulnerability assessment, an  assessment of airports nationwide, or both. Given that TSA officials  believe that the vulnerability of airports to an insider attack is very high  and the security of airports is interconnected, this vulnerability would  extend throughout the nationwide system of airports. Evaluating the  extent to which the agency\u2019s current approach assesses systems-based  vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities of smaller airports, would  better position TSA to provide reasonable assurance that it is identifying  and addressing the areas of greatest vulnerability and the spectrum of  vulnerability across the entire airport system.

According to TSA, each of its security actions\u2014or layers\u2014is capable of  stopping a terrorist attack, but when used in combination (what TSA calls  a layered approach), a much stronger system results. To better address  the risks posed by airport workers, TSA, in accordance with the  Explanatory Statement accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008,  initiated a worker screening pilot program to assess various types of  screening methods for airport workers.

(See app. V for more detailed information  on the pilot program, including locations and types of screening methods  used.) According to TSA, the objective of the pilot was to compare 100  percent worker screening and enhanced random worker screening based  on (1) screening effectiveness, (2) impact on airport operations, and (3)  cost considerations. TSA officials hired a contractor\u2014HSI, a federally  funded research and development center\u2014to assist with the design,  implementation, and evaluation of the data collected. In July 2009 TSA  released a report on the results of the pilot program, which included HSI\u2019s  findings. HSI concluded that random screening is a more cost-effective  approach because it appears \u201croughly\u201d as effective in identifying  contraband items\u2014or items of interest\u2014at less cost than 100 percent  worker screening. However, HSI also emphasized that the pilot program  \u201cwas not a robust experiment\u201d because of limitations in the design and  evaluation, such as the limited number of participating airports, which led  HSI to identify uncertainties in the results. Given the significance of these  limitations, we believe that it is unclear whether random worker screening  is more or less cost-effective than 100 percent worker screening.", "Specifically, HSI identified what we believe to be significant limitations  related to the design of the pilot program and the estimation of costs and  operational effects. Limitations related to program design include (1) a  limited number of participating airports, (2) the short duration of  screening operations (generally 90 days), (3) the variety of screening  techniques applied, (4) the lack of a baseline, and (5) limited evaluation of  enhanced methods. For example, HSI noted that while two of the seven  pilot airports performed complete 100 percent worker screening, neither  was a Category X airport; a third airport\u2014a Category X\u2014performed 100  percent screening at certain locations for limited durations. HSI also  reported that the other four pilot airports used a range of tools and  screening techniques\u2014magnetometers, handheld metal detectors, pat- downs\u2014which reduced its ability to assess in great detail any one  screening process common to all the pilot airports. In addition, HSI cited  issues regarding the use of baseline data for comparison of screening  methods. HSI attempted to use previous Aviation Direct Access Screening  Program (ADASP) screening data for comparison, but these data were not  always comparable in terms of how the screening was conducted. In  addition, HSI identified a significant limitation in generalizing pilot  program results across airports nationwide, given the limited number and  diversity of the pilot airports. HSI noted that because these airports were  chosen based on geographic diversity and size, other unique airport  factors that might affect worker screening operations\u2014such as workforce  size and the number and location of access points\u2014may not have been  considered.", "HSI also recognized what we believe to be significant limitations in the  development of estimates of the costs and operational effects of  implementing 100 percent worker screening and random worker screening  nationwide. HSI\u2019s characterization of its cost estimates as \u201crough order of  magnitude\u201d\u2014or imprecise\u2014underscores the challenge of estimating costs  for the entire airport system in the absence of detailed data on individual  airports nationwide and in light of the limited amount of information  gleaned from the pilot on operational effects and other costs. HSI noted  that the cost estimates do not include costs associated with operational  effects, such as longer wait times for workers, and potentially costly  infrastructure modifications, such as construction of roads and shelters to  accommodate vehicle screening. HSI developed high- and low-cost  estimates based on current and optimal numbers of airport access points  and the amount of resources (personnel, space, and equipment) needed to  conduct 100 percent and random worker screening. According to these  estimates, the direct cost\u2014including personnel, equipment, and other  operation needs\u2014of implementing 100 percent worker screening would  range from $5.7 billion to $14.9 billion for the first year, while the direct  costs of implementing enhanced random worker screening would range  from $1.8 billion to $6.6 billion.", "HSI noted that the random worker screening methods applied in the  worker screening pilot program were a \u201csignificant step\u201d beyond TSA\u2019s  ongoing worker screening program\u2014ADASP\u2014which the agency  characterizes as a \u201crandom\u201d worker screening program. For the four pilot  airports that applied random screening methods, TSA and airport  associations agreed to screen a targeted 20 percent of workers who  entered secured areas each day. TSA officials also told us that this 20  percent threshold was significantly higher than that applied through  ADASP, although officials said that they do not track the percentage of  screening events processed through ADASP. TSA officials told us that they  do not have sufficient resources to track this information.", "In addition to the limitations recognized by HSI, TSA and HSI did not  document key aspects of the design and implementation of the pilot  program. For example, while they did develop and document a data  collection plan that outlined the data requirements, sources, and collection  methods to be followed by the seven pilot airports in order to evaluate the  program\u2019s costs, benefits, and impacts, they did not document a plan for  how such data would be analyzed to formulate results. Standards for  Internal Control for the Federal Government states that significant events  are to be clearly documented and the documentation should be readily  available for examination to inform management decisions. In addition,  in November 2008, based in part on our guide for designing evaluations,  we reported that pilot programs can more effectively inform future  program rollout when an evaluation plan is developed to guide consistent  implementation of the pilot and analysis of the results. At minimum, a  well-developed, sound evaluation plan contains several key elements,  including measurable objectives, standards for pilot performance, a clearly  articulated methodology, detailed data collection methods, and a detailed  data analysis plan. Incorporating these elements can help ensure that the  implementation of a pilot generates performance information needed to  make effective management decisions. While TSA and HSI completed a  data collection plan, and generally defined specific measurable objectives  for the pilot program, they did not address other key elements that  collectively could have strengthened the effectiveness of the pilot program  and the usefulness of the results:    Performance standards. TSA and HSI did not develop and document  criteria or standards for determining pilot program performance, which  are necessary for determining to what extent the pilot program is effective.", "Clearly articulated evaluation methodology. TSA and HSI did not fully  articulate and document the methodology for evaluating the pilot program.  Such a methodology is to include plans for sound sampling methods,  appropriate sample sizes, and comparing the pilot results with ongoing  efforts. TSA and HSI documented relevant elements, such as certain  sampling methods and sample sizes, in both its overall data collection plan  for the program and in individual pilot operations plans for each airport  implementing the pilot. However, while officials stated that the seven  airports were selected to obtain a range of physical size, worker volume,  and geographical dispersion information, they did not document the  criteria they used in this process, and could not explain the rationale used  to decide which screening methods would be piloted by the individual  airports. Because the seven airports tested different screening methods,  there were differences in the design of the individual pilots as well as in  the type and frequency of the data collected. While design differences are  to be expected given that the pilot program was testing disparate  screening methods, there were discrepancies in the plans that limited  HSI\u2019s ability to compare methods across sites. For example, those airports  that tested enhanced screening methods\u2014as opposed to 100 percent  worker screening\u2014used different rationales to determine how many  inspections would be conducted each day. TSA officials said that this issue  and other discrepancies and points of confusion were addressed through  oral briefings with the pilot airports, but said that they did not provide  additional written instructions to the airports responsible for conducting  the pilots. TSA and HSI officials also did not document how they would  address deviations from the piloted methods, such as workers who  avoided the piloted screening by accessing alternative entry points, or  suspension of the pilot because of excessive wait times for workers or  passengers (some workers were screened through passenger screening  checkpoints). Further, TSA and HSI officials did not develop and  document a plan for comparing the results of the piloted worker screening  methods with TSA\u2019s ongoing random worker screening program to  determine whether the piloted methods had a greater impact on reducing  insider risk than ongoing screening efforts.", "Detailed data analysis. Although the agreement between TSA and HSI  also called for the development of a data analysis plan, neither HSI nor  TSA developed an analysis plan to describe how the collected data would  be used to track the program\u2019s performance and evaluate the effectiveness  of the piloted screening methods, including 100 percent worker screening.  For example, HSI used the number of confiscated items as a means of  comparing the relative effectiveness of each screening method. However,  HSI reported that the number of items confiscated during pilot operations  was \u201cvery low\u201d at most pilot airports, and some did not detect any. Based  on these data, HSI concluded that random worker screening appeared to  be \u201croughly\u201d as effective in identifying confiscated items as 100 percent  worker screening. However, it is possible that there were few or no  contraband items to detect, as workers at the pilot airports were warned  in advance when the piloted screening methods would be in effect and  disclosure signs were posted at access points. As a result, comparing the  very low rate\u2014and in some cases, nonexistence\u2014of confiscated items  across pilots, coupled with the short assessment period, may not fully  indicate the effectiveness of different screening methods at different  airports. If a data analysis plan had been developed during pilot design, it  could have been used to explain how such data would be analyzed,  including how HSI\u2019s analysis of the pilots\u2019 effectiveness accounted for the  low confiscation rates.", "Because of the significance of the pilot program limitations reported by  HSI, as well as the lack of documentation and detailed information  regarding the evaluation of the program, the reliability of the resulting data  and any subsequent conclusions about the potential impacts, costs,  benefits, and effectiveness of 100 percent worker screening and other  screening methods cannot be verified. For these reasons, it would not be  prudent to base major policy decisions regarding worker screening solely  on the results of the pilot program. HSI reported that the wide variation\u2014 such as size, traffic flow, and design\u2014of U.S. commercial airports makes it  difficult to generalize the seven pilot results to all commercial airports.  While we agree it is difficult to generalize the results of such a small  sample to an entire population, a well-documented and sound evaluation  plan could have helped ensure that the pilot program generated the data  and performance information needed to draw reasonable conclusions  about the effectiveness of 100 percent worker screening and other  methods to inform nationwide implementation. Incorporating these  elements into an evaluation plan when designing future pilots could help  ensure that TSA\u2019s pilots generate the necessary data for making  management decisions and that TSA can demonstrate that the results are  reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Steps to Strengthen Worker Security Programs, but Issues Remain", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aviation Direct Access Screening Program", "paragraphs": ["According to TSA officials, FSDs and others in the aviation community  have long recognized the potential for insiders to do harm from within an  airport.

According to TSA officials, ADASP serves as an  additional layer of security and as a deterrent to workers who seek to  smuggle drugs or weapons or to do harm. According to senior TSA  officials, FSDs decide when and how to implement ADASP, including the  random screening of passengers at the boarding gate or workers at SIDA  access points to the sterile area.", "TSA officials said that ADASP was initially developed as a pilot project at  one airport in March 2005 to deter workers from breaching access controls  and procedures for secured areas at that particular airport. According to  officials, after concluding that the pilot was successful in deterring airport  workers from bringing restricted items into secured areas, TSA began  implementing ADASP on a nationwide voluntary basis in August 2006  using existing resources. In March 2007, in response to several incidents of  insider criminal activity, TSA directed that ADASP be conducted at all  commercial airports nationwide. For example, on March 5, 2007, two  airline employees smuggled 14 firearms and 8 pounds of marijuana on  board a commercial airplane at Orlando International Airport (based on  information received through an anonymous tip, the contraband was  confiscated when the plane landed in San Juan, Puerto Rico).", "In its October 2008 report, the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)  found that ADASP was being implemented in a manner that allowed  workers to avoid being screened, and that the program had been applied  inconsistently across airports. For example, at most of the seven airports  the DHS OIG visited, ADASP screening stations were set up in front of  worker access points, which allowed workers to identify that ADASP was  being implemented and potentially choose another entry and avoid being  screened. However, at another airport, the screening location was set up  behind the access point, which prevented workers from avoiding being  screened. ADASP standard operating procedures allow ADASP screening  locations to be set up in front of or behind direct access points as long as  there is signage alerting workers that ADASP screening is taking place.  However, the DHS OIG found that the location of the screening stations\u2014 either in front of or behind direct access points\u2014affected whether posted  signs were visible to workers. The DHS OIG recommended that TSA apply  consistent ADASP policies and procedures at all airports, and establish an  ADASP working group to consider policy and procedure changes based on  an accumulation of best practices across the country.

TSA further augmented STAs in 2005 to include a citizenship  check to identify individuals who may be subject to coercion because of  their immigration status or who may otherwise pose a threat to  transportation security. In 2007 TSA expanded STA requirements beyond  workers with sterile area or SIDA access to apply to all individuals seeking  or holding airport-issued identification badges or credentials. Finally, in  June 2009 TSA began requiring airport operators to renew all airport  identification media every 2 years, deactivate expired media and require  workers to resubmit biographical information in the event of certain  changes, and expand the STA requirement to include individuals with  unescorted access to the AOA, among other things.", "TSA has taken steps to strengthen its background check requirements and  is considering additional actions to address certain statutory requirements  and issues that we identified in 2004.

However, as of May 2009, according to TSA officials, the  agency had not made a final decision on whether to require airports to  implement biometric access controls, but it intends to pursue a  combination of rule making and other measures to encourage airports to  voluntarily implement biometric credentials and control systems. While  TSA officials said that the agency issued a security directive in December  2008 that encourages airports to implement biometric access control  systems that are aligned with existing federal identification standards,  TSA officials also reported the need to ensure that airports incorporate up- to-date standards. These officials also said that TSA is considering  establishing minimum requirements to ensure consistency in data  collection, card information configuration, and biometric information.

For example, TSA officials said the agency has  assisted the aviation industry and RTCA, Inc., a federal aviation advisory  committee, in developing recommended security standards for biometric  access controls, which officials said provide guidelines for acquiring,  designing, and implementing access control systems. TSA officials also  noted that the agency has cooperated with the Biometric Airport Security  Identification Consortium, or BASIC\u2014a working group of airport  operators and aviation association representatives\u2014which has developed  guidance on key principles that it believes should be part of any future  biometric credential and access control system. In addition, TSA is in the  early stages of developing the Aviation Credential Interoperability Solution  (ACIS) program. ACIS is conceived as a credentialing system in which  airports use biometrics to verify the identities and privileges of workers  who have airport- or air carrier\u2013issued identification badges before  granting them entry to secured areas. According to TSA, ACIS would  provide a trusted biometric credential based on smart card technology  (about the size of a credit card, using circuit chips to store and process  data) and specific industry standards, and establish standard airport  processes for enrollment, card issuance, vetting, and the management of  credentials. Although these processes would be standardized nationwide,  airports would still be individually responsible for determining access  authority. According to TSA officials, the agency is seeking to build ACIS  on much of the airports\u2019 existing infrastructure and systems and has asked  industry stakeholders for input on key considerations, including the  population of workers who would receive the credential, program policies,  process, technology considerations, operational impacts, and concerns  regarding ACIS.", "However, as of May 2009, TSA officials could not explain the status of  ACIS or provide additional information on the possible implementation of  the program since the agency released the specifications for industry  comment in April 2008. As a result, it is unclear when and how the agency  plans to address the requirements of the Intelligence Reform and  Terrorism Prevention Act, including establishing minimum standards for  biometric systems and determining the best way to incorporate these  decisions into airports\u2019 existing practices and systems. As of May 2009 TSA  officials had not provided any further information, such as scheduled  milestones, on TSA\u2019s plans to implement biometric technology at airports.  Standard practices in program management suggest that developing  scheduled milestones can help define the scope of the project, achieve key  deliverables, and communicate with key stakeholders.

For  example, they noted that the requirements for airport-issued identification  badges are different from those for badges issued by an air carrier.  Workers employed by the airport, air carrier, or other entities who apply  for an airport identification badge granting unescorted access to a secured  area are required to undergo an immigration and citizenship status check,  whereas workers who apply through an air carrier, which can grant similar  unescorted access rights, are not. Both airport and air carrier workers  can apply to an airport operator for airport-issued identification badges,  but only air carrier workers can apply to their aircraft operator (employer)  for an air carrier\u2013issued identification badge. TSA officials told us that the  agency plans to address this inconsistency\u2014which has been in effect since  December 2002\u2014and is working on a time frame for doing so.", "Airport operator officials from eight of the nine airports we visited and  officials from two industry associations expressed concern that  requirements established through security directives related to airport  security are often issued for an indefinite time period. Our review of 25  airport security directives and emergency amendments showed that all  except one were issued with no expiration date. The two aviation industry  associations have expressed concerns directly to TSA that security  directive requirements should be temporary and include expiration dates  so that they can be periodically reviewed for relevancy.", "According to senior officials, TSA does not have internal control  procedures for monitoring and coordinating requirements established  through security directives related to airport perimeter and access control  security. In November 2008 TSA officials told us that the agency had  drafted an operations directive that documents procedures for developing,  coordinating, issuing, and monitoring civil aviation security directives.  According to officials, this operations directive also is to identify  procedures for conducting periodic reviews of requirements imposed  through security directives. However, while TSA officials told us that they  initially planned to issue the operations directive in April 2009, in May 2009  they said that they were in the process of adopting the recommendations  of an internal team commissioned to review and identify improvements to  TSA\u2019s policy review process, including the proposed operations directive.  In addition, as of May 2009, officials did not have an expected date for  finalizing the directive. TSA officials explained that because the review  team\u2019s recommendations will require organizational changes and upgrades  to TSA\u2019s information technology infrastructure, it will take a significant  amount of time before an approved directive can be issued. As a result, it  is unclear to what extent the operations directive will address concerns  expressed by aviation operators and industry stakeholders. Standard  practices in program management call for documented milestones to  ensure that results are achieved. Establishing milestones for  implementing guidance to periodically review airport security  requirements imposed through security directives would help TSA  formalize review of these directives within a time frame authorized by  management.", "In addition to the stakeholder issues previously discussed, representatives  from two prominent aviation industry associations have expressed  concern that TSA has not issued security directives in accordance with the  law. Specifically, these representatives noted that the Transportation  Security Oversight Board (TSOB) has not reviewed TSA\u2019s airport  perimeter and access control security directives in accordance with a  provision set forth in ATSA. This provision, as amended, establishes  emergency procedures by which TSA may immediately issue a regulation  or security directive to protect transportation security, and provides that  any such regulation or security directive is subject to review by the  TSOB. The provision further states that any regulation or security  directive issued pursuant to this authority may remain in effect for a  period not to exceed 90 days unless ratified or disapproved by the TSOB.  According to TSA officials, the agency has not issued security directives  related to airport perimeter and access control security under this  emergency authority. Rather, officials explained, the agency has issued  such security directives (and all aviation-related security directives) in  accordance with its aviation security regulations governing airport and  aircraft operators, which predate ATSA and the establishment of TSA.  FAA implemented regulations\u2014promulgated through the notice-and- comment rule making process\u2014establishing FAA\u2019s authority to issue  security directives to impose requirements on U.S. airport and aircraft  operators. With the establishment of TSA, FAA\u2019s authority to regulate civil  aviation security, including its authority to issue security directives,  transferred to the new agency. TSA does not consider ATSA to have  altered this existing authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A National Strategy for Airport Security Could Help Ensure Program Effectiveness, Inform Cost and Resource Decisions, Ensure Collaboration, and Increase Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Although TSA has developed a variety of individual protective actions to  mitigate identified airport security risks, it has not developed a unified  national strategy aimed at enhancing airport perimeter and access control  security.

For example, TSA has not developed goals and objectives  for related programs and activities, prioritized protective security actions,  or developed performance measures to assess the results of its perimeter  and access control security efforts beyond tracking outputs (the level of  activity provided over a period of time). Further, although TSA has  identified some cost information that is used to inform programmatic  decision making, it has not fully assessed the costs and resources  necessary to implement its airport security efforts.

Moreover, a strategy that outlines security goals, as well  as mechanisms and measures to achieve such goals, and that is  understood and available to all relevant stakeholders strengthens  implementation of and accountability to common principles.", "A national strategy to guide and integrate the nation\u2019s airport security  activities could strengthen decision making and accountability for several  reasons. First, TSA has identified airport perimeter and access control  security\u2014particularly the mitigation of risks posed by workers who have  unescorted access to secured areas\u2014as a top priority. Historically, TSA  has recognized the importance of developing strategies for high-priority  security programs involving high levels of perceived risk and resources,  such as air cargo security and the SPOT program. Second, in security  networks that rely on the cooperation of all security partners\u2014in this case  TSA, airport operators, and air carriers\u2014strategies can provide a basis for  communication and mutual understanding between security partners that  is fundamental for such integrated protective programs and activities. In  addition, because of the mutually dependent roles that TSA and its  security partners have in airport security operations, TSA\u2019s ability to  achieve results depends on the ability of all security partners to operate  under common procedures and achieve shared security goals. Finally,  officials from two prominent industry organizations that represent the  majority of the nation\u2019s airport operators said that the industry would  significantly benefit from a TSA-led strategy that identified long-term goals  for airport perimeter and access control security. In addition to providing  a unifying framework, a strategy that clearly identifies milestones,  developed in cooperation with industry security partners, could make it  easier for airport operators to plan, fund, and implement security  enhancements that according to industry officials can require intensive  capital improvements.", "While TSA has taken steps to assess threat and vulnerability related to  airport security and developed a variety of protective actions to mitigate  risk, TSA has not developed a unifying strategy to guide the development,  implementation, and assessment of these varied actions and those of its  security partners. TSA officials cited three reasons why the agency has not  developed a strategy to guide national efforts to enhance airport security.  First, TSA officials cited a lack of congressional emphasis on airport  perimeter and access control security relative to other high-risk areas,  such as passenger and baggage screening. Second, these officials noted  that airport operators, not TSA, have operational responsibility for airport  security. Third, they cited a lack of resources and funding.", "While these issues may present challenges, they should be considered in  light of other factors. First, Congress has long recognized the importance  of airport security, and has contributed to the establishment of a variety of  requirements pertaining to this issue. For example, the appropriations  committees, through reports accompanying DHS\u2019s annual appropriations  acts, have directed TSA to focus its efforts on enhancing several aspects of  airport perimeter and access control security. Moreover, developing a  strategy that clearly articulates the risk to airport security and  demonstrates how those risks can be addressed through protective actions  could help inform decision making. Second, though we recognize that  airport operators, not TSA, generally have operational responsibility for  airport perimeter and access control security, TSA\u2014as the regulatory  authority for airport security and the designated lead agency for  transportation security\u2014is responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and  coordinating protection efforts within aviation, including those related to  airport security. TSA currently exercises this authority by ensuring  compliance with TSA-approved airport operator security programs and,  pursuant to them, by issuing and ensuring compliance with requirements  imposed through security directives or other means. Finally, regarding  resource and funding constraints, federal guidelines for strategies and  planning include linking program activities and anticipated outcomes with  expected program costs. In this regard, a strategy could strengthen  decision making to help allocate limited resources to mitigate risk, which  is a cornerstone of homeland security policy. Additionally, DHS\u2019s risk  management approach recognizes that resources are to be focused on the  greatest risks, and on protective activities designed to achieve the biggest  reduction in those risks given the limited resources at hand. The NIPP risk  management framework provides guidance for agencies to develop  strategies and prioritize activities to those ends.", "A strategy helps to link individual programs to specific performance goals  and describe how the programs will contribute to the achievement of  those goals. A national strategy could help TSA, airport operators, and  industry stakeholders in aligning their activities, processes, and resources  to support mission-related outcomes for airport perimeter and access  control security, and, as a result, in determining whether their efforts are  effective in meeting their goals for airport security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Not Identified Security Goals or Priorities or Fully Assessed the Effectiveness of Its Actions to Strengthen Airport Security", "paragraphs": ["Our previous work has identified that an essential characteristic of  effective strategies is the setting of goals, priorities, and performance  measures.

However, according to TSA officials, the agency has not developed goals  and objectives for airport security, including specific targets or measures  related to the effectiveness of security programs and activities. TSA  officials told us that the agency sets goals for aviation security as a whole  but has not set goals and objectives for the airport perimeter and access  control security area. Developing a baseline set of security goals and  objectives that consider, if not reflect, the airport perimeter and access  control security environment would help provide TSA and its security  partners with the fundamental tools needed to define outcomes for airport  perimeter and access control security.

Decision makers can  also use performance information collectively, and, according to the NIPP,  examine a variety of data to provide a holistic picture of the health and  effectiveness of a security approach from which to make security  improvements. If significant limitations on performance measures exist,  the strategy might address plans to obtain better data or measurements,  such as national standards or indicators of preparedness.", "TSA officials told us that TSA has not fully assessed the effectiveness of its  protective activities for airport perimeters and secured areas, but they said  that the agency has taken some steps to collect certain performance data  for some airport security programs and activities to help inform  programmatic decision making. For example, TSA officials told us that  they require protective programs, such as ADASP and VIPR, to report  certain output data and descriptive program information, which officials  use to inform administrative or programmatic decisions. For ADASP, TSA  requires FSDs to collect information on, among other things, the number  of workers screened, vehicles inspected, and prohibited items  surrendered. TSA officials said that they use these descriptive and output  data to inform programmatic decisions, such as determining the number of  staff days needed to support ADASP operations nationwide. However, TSA  was not able to provide documentation on how such analysis has been  conducted. For VIPR, officials said that they require team members to  complete after-action reports that include data on the number of  participants, locations, and types of activities conducted. TSA officials said  that they are analyzing and categorizing this descriptive and output  information to determine trends and identify areas of success and failure,  which they will use to improve future operations, though they did not  provide us with examples of how they have done this. TSA officials also  told us that they require SPOT to report descriptive operations data and  situational report information, which are to be used to assign necessary  duties and correct problems with program implementation. However, TSA  officials could not tell us how they use these descriptive and output data  to inform program development and administrative decisions. While the  use of descriptive and output data to inform program development and  administration is both appropriate and valuable, leading management  practices emphasize that successful performance measurement focuses on  assessing the results of individual programs and activities.", "TSA officials also told us that while they recognize the importance of  assessing the effectiveness of airport security programs and activities in  reducing known threats, it is difficult to do so because the primary  purpose of these activities is deterrence. Assessing the deterrent benefits  of a program is inherently challenging because it involves determining  what would have happened in the absence of an intervention, or protective  action, and it is often difficult to isolate the impact of the individual  program on behavior that may be affected by multiple other factors.  Because of this difficulty, officials told us that they have instead focused  their efforts on assessing the extent to which each airport security activity  supports TSA\u2019s overall layered approach to security. We recognize that  assessing the effectiveness of deterrence-related activities is challenging  and that it continues to be the focus of ongoing analytic effort and policy  review. For example, a January 2007 report by the Department of  Transportation addressed issues related to measuring deterrence in the  maritime sector, and a February 2007 report by the RAND Corporation  acknowledged the challenges associated with measuring the benefits of  security programs aimed at reducing terrorist risk. However, as a feature  of TSA\u2019s layered security approach, many of its airport activities address  other aspects of security in addition to deterrence. Like other homeland  security efforts, TSA\u2019s airport security activities also seek to limit the  potential for attack, safeguard critical infrastructure and property, identify  wrongdoing, and ensure an effective and efficient response in the event of  an attack; the desired outcome of its efforts is to reduce the risk of an  attack. Deterrence is an inherent benefit of any protective action, and  methods designed to detect wrongdoing and measures taken to safeguard  critical infrastructure and property, for example, also help deter terrorist  attacks. There are a number of activities that TSA has implemented that  seek to reduce this risk, such as requiring security threat assessments for  all airport workers. Some of these activities serve principally to deter,  such as ADASP, while others are more focused on safeguarding critical  infrastructure and property, such as conducting compliance inspections of  aviation security regulations or installing perimeter fencing. Some  activities serve multiple purposes, such as VIPR, which seeks to provide a  visual deterrent to terrorist or other criminal activity, but also seeks to  safeguard critical infrastructure in various modes of transportation.  Examining the extent to which its activities have effectively addressed  these various purposes would enable TSA to more efficiently implement  and manage its programs.", "There are several methods available that TSA could explore to gain insight  on the extent to which its security activities have met their desired  purpose and to ultimately improve program performance. For example,  TSA could work with stakeholders, such as airport operators and other  security partners, to identify and share lessons learned and best practices  across airports to better tailor its efforts and resources and continuously  improve security. TSA could also use information gathered through covert  testing or compliance inspections\u2014such as noncompliance or security  breaches\u2014to make adjustments to specific security activities and to  identify which aspects require additional investigation. In addition, TSA  could develop proxy measures\u2014indirect measures or signs that  approximate or represent the direct measure\u2014to show how security  efforts correlate to an improved security outcome.

However, for programs that serve airport  security as well as other aspects of aviation security, TSA has not  identified the costs and resources devoted to airport security. For  example, TSA has identified its expenditures for compliance inspections  and other airport security\u2013related programs and activities, which  collectively totaled nearly $850 million from fiscal years 2004 through  2008. However, TSA has not identified what portion of these funds was  directly allocated for airport security activities versus other aviation  security activities, such as passenger screening. (For a more detailed  discussion of airport security costs, see app. IV.) Further, TSA has not fully  identified the resources it needs to mitigate risks to airport perimeter and  access control security. According to TSA officials, identifying collective  agency costs and resource needs for airport security activities is  challenging because airport security is not a separately funded TSA  program, and many airport security activities are part of broader security  programs. However, without attempting to identify total agency costs, it  will be difficult for TSA to identify costs associated with individual  security activities, and therefore it will be hindered in determining the  resources it needs to sustain desired activity levels and realize targeted  results. While TSA officials told us that they are starting to identify costs  for airport security activities and plan to complete this effort by the end of  2009, they could provide no additional information to illustrate their  approach for doing so.

According to these officials, the  agency does not have the resources and funds to collect cost information  from airport operators. However, TSA officials could not tell us how and  to what extent they had assessed the resources and funds needed to  collect this information or whether they had explored other options for  collecting cost data, such as working with industry associations to survey  airport operators.

However, officials could not demonstrate that they had attempted to  conduct cost-benefit analysis for programs and activities related to airport  security within the constraints of current resources, or explain how, or to  what extent, they had assessed the resources that would be needed to  conduct cost-benefit analysis. Further, TSA officials could not cite a  situation in which the need to take immediate action\u2014outside of issuing  security directives\u2014in response to a threat prevented them from  conducting cost-benefit analysis. TSA officials agreed that conducting  cost-benefit analysis is beneficial, but also said that it is not always  practical because of the difficulty in quantifying the benefits of deterrence- based activities. Because of this challenge, officials said that they have  used professional judgment, past experience, law enforcement principles,  and intelligence information to evaluate alternative airport security  activities to mitigate risks. While TSA\u2019s approach to identifying security  actions includes accepted risk reduction decision-making tools, such as  professional judgment, it does not provide a means to fully weigh the  benefits versus the costs of implementing alternative actions. However,  despite the challenges TSA cited to developing cost-benefit analysis, TSA  officials told us that as of January 2009, the agency was in the early stages  of investigating costs and benefits related to airport perimeter access  control.

Evaluating whether existing, select vulnerability assessments  reflect the network of airports will help TSA ensure that its actions  strengthen the whole airport system. If TSA finds that additional  assessments are needed to identify the extent of vulnerabilities  nationwide, then developing a plan with milestones for conducting those  assessments, and leveraging existing available assessment information  from stakeholders, would help ensure the completion of these  assessments and that intended results are achieved. In addition, although  the consequences of a successful terrorist breach in airport security have  not been assessed, based on the past events, the potential impact on U.S.  assets, safety, and public morale could be profound. For this reason,  assessing the likely consequences of an attack is an essential step in  assessing risks to the nation\u2019s airports. Further, a comprehensive risk  assessment that combines threat, vulnerability, and consequence would  help TSA determine which risks should be addressed\u2014and to what  degree\u2014and would help guide the agency in identifying the necessary  resources for addressing these risks.

Yet Congress, the  administration, and the aviation industry have emphasized the need to  move forward in implementing such technology to better control access to  sensitive airport areas. But until TSA decides whether, when, and how it  will mandate biometric access controls at airports, individual airport  operators will likely continue to delay investing in potentially costly  technology in case it does not comply with future federal standards.  Establishing milestones for addressing requirements would not only  provide airports with the necessary information to appropriately plan  future security upgrades, but give all stakeholders a road map by which  they can anticipate future developments.", "TSA uses security directives as a means for establishing additional security  measures in response to general or specific threats against the civil  aviation system, including the security of airport perimeters and the  controls that limit access to secured airport areas. Just as it is important  that federal agencies have flexible mechanisms for responding to the  adaptive, dynamic nature of the terrorist threat, it is also important that  requirements remain consistent with current threat information.

These various actions, however,  have not been fully integrated and unified toward achieving common  outcomes and effectively using resources. A national risk-informed  strategy\u2014that establishes measurable goals, priorities, and performance  measures; identifies needed resources; and is aligned and integrated with  related security efforts\u2014would help guide decision making and hold all  public and private security partners accountable for achieving key shared  outcomes within available resources. Moreover, a strategy that identifies  these key elements would allow TSA to better articulate its needs\u2014and  the challenge of meeting those needs\u2014to industry stakeholders and to  Congress. Furthermore, balancing estimated costs against expected  security benefits, and developing measures to assess the effectiveness of  security activities, would help TSA provide reasonable assurance that it is  properly allocating and prioritizing its limited resources, or those of  airports, in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of its airport security  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that TSA\u2019s actions in enhancing airport security are guided  by a systematic risk management approach that appropriately assesses  risk and evaluates alternatives, and that it takes a more strategic role in  ensuring that government and stakeholder actions and resources are  effectively and efficiently applied across the nationwide network of  airports, we recommend that the Assistant Secretary of TSA work with  aviation stakeholders to implement the following five actions:    Develop a comprehensive risk assessment for airport perimeter and  access control security, along with milestones (i.e., time frames) for  completing the assessment, that (1) uses existing threat and vulnerability  assessment activities, (2) includes consequence analysis, and   (3) integrates all three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability, and  consequence.", "As part of this effort, evaluate whether the current approach to  conducting JVAs appropriately and reasonably assesses systems  vulnerabilities, and whether an assessment of security vulnerabilities  at airports nationwide should be conducted.", "If the evaluation demonstrates that a nationwide assessment should be  conducted, develop a plan that includes milestones for completing the  nationwide assessment.

On September 24, 2009, DHS provided written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix VIII. In commenting on our  report, DHS stated that it concurred with all five recommendations and  identified actions planned or under way to implement them.", "In its comments to our draft report, DHS stated that the Highlights page of  our report includes a statement that is inaccurate. We disagree.  Specifically, DHS contends that it is not accurate to state that TSA \u201chas not  conducted vulnerability assessments for 87 percent of the nation\u2019s 450  commercial airports\u201d because this statement does not recognize that TSA  uses other activities to assess airport vulnerabilities, and that these  activities are conducted for every commercial airport. For example, DHS  stated that (1) every commercial airport must have a TSA-approved ASP,  which is to cover personnel, physical, and operational security measures;  (2) each ASP is reviewed on a regular basis by a FSD; and (3) such FSD  reviews \u201cinclude a review of security measures applied at the perimeter.\u201d  As we noted in our report, TSA identified JVAs, along with professional  judgment, as the agency\u2019s primary mechanism for assessing airport  security vulnerabilities in accordance with NIPP requirements. Moreover,  it is not clear to what extent the FSD reviews and other activities TSA cites  in its comments address airport perimeter and access control  vulnerabilities or to what extent such reviews have been applied  consistently on a nationwide basis, since TSA has not provided us with any  documentary evidence regarding these or other reviews. Finally, in  meeting with TSA, its officials acknowledged that because they have not  conducted a joint vulnerability assessment for 87 percent of commercial  airports, they do not know how vulnerable these airports are to an  intentional breach in security or an attack. Thus, we consider the  statement on our Highlights page to be accurate.    TSA also stated that \u201cas provided in our draft report\u201d the foundation of  TSA\u2019s national strategy is its individual layers\u2014or actions\u2014of security,  which, when combined, generate an exponential increase in deterrence  and detection capability. However, we did not evaluate TSA\u2019s layered  approach to security or the extent to which this approach provides  increased deterrence and detection capabilities.", "Regarding our first recommendation that TSA develop a comprehensive  risk assessment for airport perimeter and access control security, DHS  stated that TSA will develop such an assessment through its ongoing  efforts to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the transportation  sector. TSA intends to provide the results of the assessment to Congress  by January 2010. According to DHS, the aviation domain portion of the  sector risk assessment is to address, at the national level, nine airport  perimeter and access control security scenarios. It also stated that the  assessment is to integrate all three elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability  and consequence\u2014and will rely on existing assessment activities,  including JVAs. In developing this assessment, it will be important that  TSA evaluate whether its current approach to conducting JVAs, which it  identifies as one element of its risk assessment efforts, appropriately  assesses vulnerabilities across the commercial airport system, and  whether additional steps are needed. Since TSA has repeatedly stated the  need to develop baseline data on airport security vulnerabilities to enable  it to conduct systematic analysis of vulnerabilities on a nationwide basis,  TSA could also benefit from exploring the feasibility of leveraging existing  assessment information from industry stakeholders to inform this  assessment.", "DHS also agreed with our second recommendation that a well-developed  and well-documented evaluation plan should be part of TSA\u2019s efforts to  evaluate and implement future airport security pilot programs. In addition,  DHS concurred with our third recommendation that TSA develop  milestones for meeting statutory requirements for establishing system  requirements and performance standards for the use of biometric airport  access control systems. DHS noted that while mandatory use of such  systems is not required by statute, TSA is still considering whether it will  mandate the use of biometric access control systems at airports, and in the  meantime it will continue to encourage airport operators to voluntarily  utilize biometrics in their access control systems. We agree that  mandatory use of biometric access control systems is not required by  statute, but establishing milestones would help guide TSA\u2019s continued  work with the airport industry to develop and refine existing biometric  access control standards. In regard to our fourth recommendation that  TSA develop milestones for establishing agency procedures for reviewing  airport security requirements imposed through security directives, DHS  concurred that milestones are necessary.", "Finally, in regard to our fifth recommendation that TSA develop a national  strategy for airport security that incorporates key characteristics of  effective security strategies, DHS concurred and stated that TSA will  develop a national strategy by updating the TS-SSP. DHS stated that TSA  intends to solicit input on the plan from its Sector Coordinating Council,  which represents key private sector stakeholders from the transportation  sector, before releasing the updated TS-SSP in the summer of 2010.  However, given that the TS-SSP is to focus on detailing how the NIPP  framework will apply to the entire transportation sector, it may not be the  most appropriate vehicle for developing a national strategy that addresses  the various management issues specific to airport security that we  identified in our report. A more effective approach might be to issue the  strategy as a stand-alone plan, in keeping with the format TSA has used for  its air cargo, passenger checkpoint screening, and SPOT strategies. A  stand-alone strategy might better facilitate key stakeholder involvement,  focus attention on airport security needs, and allow TSA to more  thoroughly address relevant challenges and goals. But irrespective of the  format, it will be important that TSA fully address the key characteristics  of an effective strategy, as identified in our report. The intent of a national  strategy is to provide a unifying framework that guides and integrates  stakeholder activities toward desired results, which may be best achieved  when planned efforts are clear and sustainable, and transparent enough to  ensure accountability. Thus, it is important that the strategy fully  incorporate the following characteristics: (1) measurable goals, priorities,  and performance measures; (2) program cost information, including the  sources and types of resources needed; and (3) plans for coordinating  activities among stakeholders, integrating airport security goals and  activities with those of other aviation security priorities, and implementing  security activities within the agency.", "TSA also provided us with technical comments, which we considered and  incorporated in the report where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Secretary of Transportation, the Assistant Secretary of the  Transportation Security Administration, appropriate congressional  committees, and other interested parties.

We examined the extent to which TSA  generally conducted activities intended to assess threats, vulnerabilities,  and consequences to the nation\u2019s approximately 450 airports. We also  reviewed the extent to which TSA\u2019s use of these three types of  assessments met the NIPP criteria for completing a comprehensive risk  assessment. However, while we assessed the extent to which the  individual threat and vulnerability assessment activities that TSA identified  addressed the area of airport perimeter and access controls, the scope of  our work did not include individual evaluations of these activities to  determine whether they were consistent with the NIPP criteria for  conducting threat and vulnerability assessments. In addition, we reviewed  and summarized critical infrastructure and aviation security requirements  set out by Homeland Security Presidential Directives 7 and 16, the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), and other statutes and related  materials. We also examined the individual threat and vulnerability  assessment activities and discussed them with senior TSA and program  officials, to evaluate how TSA uses this information to set goals and  inform its decision making. We compared this information with the NIPP,  TSA\u2019s Transportation Security Sector-Specific Plan, and our past guidance  and reports on recommended risk management practices. In addition, we  obtained and analyzed data from TSA regarding joint vulnerability  assessments, which are conducted with the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), to determine the extent to which TSA has used this  information to assess risk to airport perimeter and access control security.  We also obtained information on the processes used to schedule and track  these activities to determine the reliability with which these data were  collected and managed, and we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. We interviewed TSA and FBI  officials responsible for conducting joint vulnerability assessments to  discuss the number conducted by TSA since 2004, the scope of these  assessments, and how they are conducted.", "In addition, we interviewed selected TSA officials responsible for risk  management and security programs related to airport perimeter and  access control to clarify the extent to which TSA has assessed risk in these  areas. We selected these officials based upon their relevant expertise with  TSA\u2019s risk management efforts and its airport perimeter and access  control efforts. We also analyzed TSA data on security breaches by  calculating the total number of security breaches from fiscal years 2004  through 2008. To determine that the data were sufficiently reliable to  present contextual information regarding all breaches to secured areas  (including airport perimeters) in this report, we obtained information on  the processes used to collect, tabulate, and assess these data, and  discussed data quality control procedures with appropriate officials and  found that the data were sufficiently reliable for this purpose. Because the  data include security breaches that occurred within any type of secured  areas, including passenger-related breaches, they are not specific to  perimeter and access control security. In addition, the data have not been  adjusted to reflect potential issues that could also influence or skew the  number of overall breaches, such as annual increases in the number of  passengers or specific incidences occurring within individual airports that  account for more breaches than others. Furthermore, because TSA does  not require its inspectors to enter a description of the breach when  documenting an incident, and general reports on breach data do not show  much variation between incidences unless a report includes a description  of the breach, we did not ask TSA for descriptive information on breaches  that occurred.", "To evaluate the extent to which TSA has implemented protective programs  to strengthen airport security consistent with the NIPP risk management  framework, we asked TSA to identify agency-led activities and programs  for strengthening airport security. For the purposes of this report, we  categorized TSA\u2019s responses into four main areas of effort: (1) worker  screening pilot program, (2) worker security programs, (3) technology,  and (4) general airport security. To determine the extent to which TSA  evaluated its worker screening pilot program, we analyzed TSA\u2019s final  report on it worker screening pilot program, including conclusions and  limitations cited by the contractor\u2014the Homeland Security Institute  (HSI)\u2014TSA hired to assist with the pilot\u2019s design, implementation, and  evaluation. We also reviewed standards for internal control in the federal  government and our previous work on pilot program development and  evaluation to identify accepted practices for ensuring reliable results,  including key features of a sound evaluation plan. Further, we analyzed  TSA and HSI\u2019s documentation of the worker screening pilot program  methodology to determine whether TSA and HSI had documented their  plans for conducting the program, whether each pilot was carried out in a  consistent manner, and if participating airports were provided with  written requirements or guidance for conducting the pilots. To evaluate  TSA\u2019s efforts for its worker security programs, we assessed and  summarized relevant program information, operations directives, and  standard operating procedures for the Aviation Direct Access Screening  Program (ADASP) and enhanced background checks. We also informed  this assessment with recent work by the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) regarding worker  screening. We reviewed the DHS OIG\u2019s methodology and analysis to  determine whether its findings were reliable for use in our report. We  analyzed TSA\u2019s documentation of its background checks to determine if  TSA sufficiently addressed relevant ATSA requirements and  recommendations from our 2004 report on airport security. We also  interviewed TSA officials responsible for worker background checks to  determine the agency\u2019s efforts to develop a plan to meet outstanding ATSA  requirements.", "With respect to perimeter and access control technology, we reviewed and  summarized TSA documentation and evaluations of the Airport Access  Control Pilot Program (AACPP), documentation related to the Airport  Perimeter Security (APS) pilot program, and the dissemination of  information regarding technology to airports. We interviewed officials  with the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology, the National Safe  Skies Alliance, and RTCA, Inc., regarding research, development, and  testing efforts, and challenges and potential limitations of applicable  technologies to airport perimeter and access control security. We selected  these entities because of their role in the development of such technology.  We also interviewed TSA Headquarters officials to obtain views on the  nature and scope of technology-related efforts and other relevant  considerations, such as how they addressed relevant ATSA requirements  and recommendations from our 2004 report, or how they plan to do so.  With regard to TSA\u2019s efforts for general airport security, we examined  TSA\u2019s procedures for developing and issuing airport perimeter and access  control requirements through security directives and other methods, and  analyzed the extent to which TSA disseminated security requirements to  airports through security directives. At our request, TSA identified 25  security directives and emergency amendments that imposed  requirements related to airport perimeter and access control security,  which we examined to identify specific areas of regulation. In addition, we  assessed and summarized relevant program information and  documentation, such as operations directives, for other programs  identified by TSA, such as the Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response  (VIPR) program, Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques  (SPOT) program, and the Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement  Program.", "To evaluate the extent to which TSA established a national strategy to  guide airport security decision making, we considered guidance on  effective characteristics for security strategies and planning that we  previously reported, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)  requirements, and generally accepted strategic planning practices for  government agencies. In order to evaluate TSA\u2019s approach to airport  security, we reviewed TSA documents to identify major security goals and  subordinate objectives for airport perimeter and access control security,  and relevant priorities, goals, objectives, and performance measures. We  also analyzed relevant program documentation, including budget, cost,  and performance information, including relevant information TSA  developed and maintains for the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  Performance Assessment Rating Tool. We compared TSA\u2019s approach with  criteria identified in NIPP, other DHS guidance, GPRA, and other leading  practices in strategies and planning. We also interviewed relevant TSA  program and budget officials, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  officials, and selected aviation industry officials regarding the cost of  airport perimeter and access control security for fiscal years 2004 through  2008.", "To determine the extent to which TSA collaborated with stakeholders on  airport security activities, and to obtain their insights on airport security  operations, costs, and regulation, we interviewed industry officials from  the Airports Council International-North America\u2014whose commercial  airport members represent 95 percent of domestic airline passenger and  air cargo traffic in North America\u2014and from the American Association of  Airport Executives\u2014whose members represent 850 domestic airports. We  selected these industry associations based on input from TSA and from  industry stakeholders, who identified the two associations representing  commercial airport operators. We also attended aviation association  conferences at which industry officials presented information on national  aviation security policy and operations, and we conducted a group  discussion with 17 officials representing various airport and aircraft  operators and aviation associations to obtain their views regarding key  issues affecting airport security. While the views expressed by these  industry, airport, and aircraft operator officials cannot be generalized to  all airport industry associations and operators, these interviews provided  us with additional perspectives on airport security and an understanding  of the extent to which TSA has worked and collaborated with airport  stakeholders.", "We also conducted site visits at nine U.S. commercial airports\u2014Orange  County John Wayne Airport, Washington-Dulles International Airport,  Miami International Airport, Orlando International Airport, John F.  Kennedy International Airport, Westchester County Airport, Logan  International Airport, Barnstable Municipal Airport, and  Salisbury/Wicomico County Regional Airport. During these visits we  observed airport security operations and discussed issues related to  perimeter and access control security with airport officials and on-site  TSA officials, including federal security directors (FSD). We selected these  airports based on several factors, including airport category, size, and  geographical dispersion; whether they faced problems with perimeter and  access control security; and the types of technological initiatives tested or  implemented. Because we selected a nonprobability sample of airports to  visit, those results cannot be generalized to other U.S. commercial  airports; however, the information gathered provides insight into TSA and  airport programs and procedures. In addition, at Miami International  Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport we conducted separate  interviews with airport officials to discuss their ongoing, or anticipated,  efforts to implement additional worker screening methods at their  respective airports. We also conducted telephone interviews with airport  officials and FSDs from four airports that had implemented, or planned to  implement, various forms of 100 percent screening of airport workers to  discuss their efforts. These were Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky  International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Denver  International Airport, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. While  the views of the officials we spoke with regarding additional worker  screening methods cannot be generalized to all airport security officials,  they provided insight into how airport security programs were chosen and  developed. We also conducted an additional site visit at Logan  International Airport to observe TSA\u2019s implementation of various worker  screening methods as part of the agency\u2019s worker screening pilot program.  While the experiences of this pilot location cannot be generalized to all  airports participating in the pilot, we chose this airport based on airport  category and the variety of worker screening methods piloted at this  location.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through September  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

According to TSA,  while regulatory compliance is just one dimension of airport security,  compliance with federal requirements allows TSA to determine the general  level of security within an airport. As a result, according to TSA,  compliance with regulations suggests less vulnerability within an airport  and, conversely, failure to meet critical compliance rates suggests the  likelihood of a larger problem within an airport and helps the agency  identify and assess vulnerabilities. TSA allows its inspectors to conduct  compliance inspections based on observations of various activities, such  as ADASP, VIPR, and local covert testing, and to conduct additional  inspections based on vulnerabilities identified through assessments or the  results of regular inspections.", "Covert tests are any test of security systems, personnel, equipment, and  procedures to obtain a snapshot of the effectiveness of that security  measure, and they are used to improve airport performance, safety, and  security. TSA officials stated that covert testing assists the agency in  identifying airport vulnerabilities because such tests are designed based  on threat assessments and intelligence to approximate techniques that  terrorists may use to exploit gaps in airport security. TSA conducts four  types of covert tests for airport access controls:    Access to security identification display areas (SIDA): TSA  inspectors not wearing appropriate identification attempt to penetrate  SIDA access points, such as boarding gates, employee doors, and other  entrances.", "Access to air operations areas (AOA): TSA inspectors not wearing  appropriate identification attempt to penetrate AOA via access points from  public areas, such as perimeter gates and cargo areas.", "Access to aircraft: TSA inspectors not wearing appropriate identification  (or not carrying valid boarding passes) attempt to penetrate passenger  access points that lead to aircraft from sterile areas, such as boarding  gates, employee doors, and jet ways.", "SIDA challenges: Once inside a SIDA, TSA inspectors attempt to walk  around these areas, such as the tarmac and baggage loading areas, without  displaying appropriate identification.", "TSA also requires FSDs to conduct similar, locally controlled tests of  access controls to ensure compliance and identify possible vulnerabilities  with airport security.

As a result, it is difficult to identify  what percentage of program costs has been expended on airport perimeter  and access control security activities. At our request, TSA officials  identified the estimated spending related to perimeter and access control  security programs from fiscal years 2004 through 2008 (see table 4).", "Airports can receive funding for purposes related to perimeter and access  control security via grants awarded through FAA\u2019s Airport Improvement  Program. TSA officials also told us that the agency generally does not  collect or track cost information for airport security efforts funded  through the Airport Improvement Program. This program is one of the  principal sources of funding for airport capital improvements in the United  States, providing approximately $3 billion in grants annually to enhance  airport capacity, safety, and environmental protection, as well as  perimeter security. According to FAA officials, many factors are  considered when awarding grants to airports for perimeter security  enhancements, although security projects required by statute or regulation  receive the highest priority. Projects that receive funding have included  computerized access controls for ramps, infrastructure improvements to  house central computers, surveillance systems, and perimeter fencing.  According to FAA, more than $365 million in airport perimeter and access  control\u2013related grants were provided through the Airport Improvement  Program for fiscal years 2004 through 2008.", "TSA officials also told us that the agency does not track funds spent by  individual airport operators to enhance or maintain perimeter and access  control security. In 2009 the Airports Council International-North  America\u2014an aviation industry association\u2014surveyed commercial airports  regarding the funding needed for airport capital projects from 2009 to  2013. As part of this effort, the association surveyed airport operators on  the amount of funds they planned to expend on airport security as a  percentage of their overall budgets. The association reported that planned  airport operator spending on airport security, as a percentage of total  spending, ranged from 3.8 percent (about $2 billion) for large hub airports  to 3.9 percent (about $230 million) for small hub airports. The association  surveys did not include information on the types of security projects  undertaken by airports. However, during our site visits we obtained data  from selected airport operators on the costs of perimeter and access  control security projects they had recently concluded or estimated costs  for projects in progress. Examples of airport spending on perimeter and  access control security include    $30 million to install a full biometric access system;   $6.5 million to install an over 8,000-foot-long blast/crash resistant wall  along the airport perimeter;    $8 million to install over 680 bollards in front of passenger terminals and  vehicle access points; and    $3 million to develop and install an infrared intrusion detection system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: TSA Worker Screening Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["From May through July 2008 TSA implemented worker screening pilots at  seven airports in accordance with the Explanatory Statement  accompanying the DHS Appropriations Act, 2008 (see table 5 for a  summary of text directing the worker screening pilot program). At three  airports, TSA conducted 100 percent worker screening\u2014inspections of all  airport workers and vehicles entering secure areas; at four others TSA  randomly screened 20 percent of workers and tested other enhanced  security measures. Screening of airport workers was to be done at either  the airport perimeter or the passenger screening checkpoints. TSA was  directed to collect data on the methods it utilized, and evaluate the  benefits, costs, and impacts of 100 percent worker screening to determine  the most effective and cost-efficient method of addressing and deterring  potential security risks posed by airport workers.", "The enhanced measures that TSA tested at the four airports not  implementing 100 percent screening are summarized below:    Employee training: TSA provided a security awareness training video,  which all SIDA badgeholders were required to complete. According to  TSA, the training intended reduce security breaches by increasing  workers\u2019 understanding of their security responsibilities and awareness of  threats and abnormal behaviors.", "Behavioral recognition training: TSA provided funding to participating  airports to teach select law enforcement officers and airport personnel to  identify potentially high-risk individuals based on their behavior. A  condensed version of the SPOT course, this training was intended to equip  personnel with skills to enhance existing duties, according to TSA  officials.", "Targeted physical inspections: TSA conducted random inspections of  vehicles and individuals entering the secured areas of airports to increase  the coverage of ADASP. Inspections consisted of bag, vehicle, and  identification checks; scanning bottled liquids; and random security  sweeps of specific airport areas.", "Deployment of technology: TSA employed additional technology at  selected airports to assist with the screening of employees, such as walk- through and handheld metal detectors, bottled liquid scanners, and  explosive detection systems.

VIPR was first implemented in 2005, and according  to TSA officials, VIPR operations are deployed through a risk-based  approach and in response to specific intelligence information or known  threats. In a VIPR operation, TSA officials, including transportation  security officers and inspectors, behavioral detection officers, bomb  appraisal officers, and federal air marshals work with local law  enforcement and airport officials to temporarily enhance aviation security.  According to TSA officials, VIPR operations for perimeter and access  control security can include random inspections of individuals, property,  and vehicles, as well as patrols of secured areas and random checks to  ensure that employees have the proper credentials. TSA officials told us  that although they do not know how many VIPR deployments have  specifically addressed airport perimeter and access control security, from  March 2008 through April 2009 TSA performed 1,042 commercial and  general aviation airport or cargo VIPR operations. According to TSA  officials, the majority of these operations involved the observation and  patrolling of secured airport areas and airport perimeters. As of May 2009  TSA officials also said that the agency is in the process of enhancing its  VIPR database to more accurately capture and track specific operational  objectives, such as enhancing the security of airport perimeters and access  controls, and developing an estimated time frame for completing this  effort.", "Since 2004 TSA has used SPOT\u2014a passenger screening program in which  behavior detection officers observe and analyze passenger behavior to  identify potentially high-risk individuals\u2014to determine if an individual or  individuals may pose a risk to aircraft or airports. Although SPOT was  originally designed for passenger screening, TSA officials stated that FSDs  can also use behavior detection officers to assess worker behavior as they  pass through the passenger checkpoint, as part of random worker  screening operations or as part of VIPR teams deployed at an airport.  However, TSA officials could not determine how often behavior detection  officers have participated in random worker screening or VIPR operations,  or identify which airports have used behavior detection officers for  random worker screening. According to TSA officials, the agency is in the  process of redesigning its data collection efforts and anticipates that it will  be able to more accurately track this information in the future, though  officials did not provide a time frame for doing so. TSA officials also told  us that when participating in random worker screening, behavior  detection officers observe workers for suspicious behavior as they are  being screened and may engage workers in casual conversation to assess  potential threats. According to TSA officials, the agency has provided  behavior detection training to law enforcement personnel as part of its  worker screening pilot program, as well as to selected airport security and  operations personnel at more than 20 airports. We currently have ongoing  work assessing SPOT, and will issue a report on this program at a later  date."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program", "paragraphs": ["TSA undertakes efforts to facilitate the deployment of law enforcement  personnel authorized to carry firearms at airport security checkpoints, and  in April 2002, the Law Enforcement Officer Reimbursement Program was  established to provide partial reimbursement for enhanced, on-site law  enforcement presence in support of the passenger screening checkpoints.  Since 2004, the program has expanded to include law enforcement support  along the perimeter and to assist with worker screening. According to  TSA, the program is implemented through a cooperative agreement  process that emphasizes the ability of both parties to identify and agree as  to how law enforcement officers will support the specific security  requirements at an airport. For example, the FSD, in consultation with the  airport operator and local law enforcement, may determine that rather  than implementing fixed-post stationing of law enforcement officers, it  may be more appropriate to implement flexible stationing of law  enforcement officers. TSA may also provide training or briefings on an as- needed basis on relevant security topics, including improvised explosive  device recognition, federal criminal statutes pertinent to aviation security,  and procedures and processes for armed law enforcement officers.  Awards made under the reimbursement program are subject to the  availability of appropriated funds, among other things, and are to  supplement not supplant state and local funding. According to TSA  officials, however, no applicant has been denied funds based on lack of  appropriated funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Alternative Methods Available to Assist TSA in Assessing the Effectiveness of Its Actions to Strengthen Airport Security", "paragraphs": ["Program evaluation methods exist whereby TSA could attempt to assess  whether its activities are meeting intended objectives. These methods  center on reducing the risk of both external and internal threats to the  security of airport perimeters and access controls, and seek to use  information and resources available to help capture pertinent information.", "First, recognizing that there are challenges associated with measuring the  effectiveness of deterrence-related activities, the NIPP\u2019s Risk Management  Framework provides mechanisms for qualitative feedback that although  not considered a metric, could be applied to augment and improve the  effectiveness and efficiency of protective programs and activities. For  example, working with stakeholders\u2014such as airport operators and other  security partners\u2014to identify and share lessons learned and best practices  across airports could assist TSA in better tailoring its efforts and resources  and continuously improving security. Identifying a range of qualitative  program information\u2014such as information gathered through vulnerability  assessment activities or compliance inspections\u2014could also allow TSA to  determine whether activities are effective. As discussed in appendix III,  compliance inspections and covert tests could be used to identify  noncompliance with regulations or security breaches within designated  secured areas. For example, TSA could use covert tests to determine if  transportation security officers are following TSA procedures when  screening airport workers or whether certain worker screening  procedures detect prohibited items. However, in order to improve the  usefulness of this technique, we previously recommended to TSA that the  agency develop a systematic process for gathering and analyzing specific  causes of all covert testing failures, record information on processes that  may not be working properly during covert tests, and identify effective  practices used at airports that perform well on covert tests.", "Second, as TSA has already begun to do with some activities, it could use  data it already collects to identify trends and establish baseline data for a  future comparison of effectiveness. For example, a cross-sectional  analysis of the number of workers caught possessing prohibited items at  specific worker screening locations over time, while controlling for  variables such as increased law enforcement presence or airport size,  could provide insights into what type of security activities help to reduce  the possession of prohibited items. Similarly, an examination of airport  workers apprehended, fired, or referred to law enforcement while on the  job could provide insights into the quality of worker background checks  and security threat assessments. Essentially, the these types of analyses  provide a useful context for drawing conclusions about whether certain  security practices are reasonable and appropriate given certain conditions  and, gradually, with the accumulation of relevant data, should allow TSA  to start identifying cause-and-effect relationships.", "Third, according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the use  of proxy measures may also allow TSA to determine how well its activities  are functioning. Proxy measures are indirect measures or indicators that  approximate or represent the direct measure. TSA could use proxy  measures to address deterrence, other security goals as identified above,  or a combination of both. According to OMB, proxy measures are to be  correlated to an improved security outcome, and the program should be  able to demonstrate\u2014for example, through the use of modeling\u2014how the  proxies tie to the eventual outcome. The Department of Transportation  has also highlighted the need for proxy measures when assessing maritime  security efforts pertaining to deterrence. For example, according to the  Department of Transportation, while a direct measure of access to  seaports might be the number of unauthorized intruders detected, proxy  measures for seaport access may include related information on gates and  guards\u2014combined with crime statistics relating to unauthorized entry in  the area of the port\u2014to support a broader view of port security. In terms  of aviation security, because failure to prevent a worker from placing a  bomb on a plane could be catastrophic, proxy measures may include  information on access controls, worker background checks, and  confiscated items. Proxy measures could also include information on  aircraft operators\u2019 efforts to secure the aircraft. In using a variety of proxy  measures, failure in any one of the identified measures could provide an  indication on the overall risk to security.", "Lastly, the use of likelihood, or \u201cwhat-if scenarios,\u201d which are used to  describe a series of steps leading to an outcome, could allow TSA to assess  whether potential activities and efforts effectively work together to  hypothetically achieve a positive outcome. For example, the development  of such scenarios could help TSA to consider whether an activity\u2019s  procedures could be modified in response to identified or projected  changes in terrorist behaviors, or if an activity\u2019s ability to reduce or  combat a threat is greater if used in combination with other activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Steve Morris, Assistant Director,  and Barbara Guffy, Analyst-in-Charge, managed this assignment.
