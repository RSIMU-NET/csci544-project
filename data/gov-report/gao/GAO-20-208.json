However, SEC has not yet implemented a 2013 GAO recommendation to validate its performance management system\u2014that is, to obtain staff input and agreement on the competencies, rating procedures, and other key aspects of the system. SEC plans to implement a new system in 2020, and validating this system would help ensure that it achieves its goals and identify changes needed to address employee dissatisfaction with performance management. In addition, a key feature of SEC's new performance management system will be a bonus program through which supervisors can nominate high-performing employees for a bonus of up to $10,000 once per fiscal year. However, SEC has not yet developed mechanisms for transparency and fairness for this new bonus program. GAO has previously highlighted the need for safeguards to better ensure fairness and transparency in performance management, particularly around systems affecting pay. Incorporating safeguards into the new bonus program\u2014such as including multiple levels of review and publishing aggregate data on award decisions\u2014would promote transparency and could increase employee confidence in the program.", "Since GAO's most recent review in 2016, SEC has taken actions to implement a more comprehensive workforce planning process and strengthen intra-agency communication and collaboration. For example, SEC conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify skills gaps in its workforce. It also improved the link between its budget formulation process and annual meetings in which the Office of Human Resources consults with each division and office on its workforce needs and priorities. Additionally, to strengthen communication and collaboration, SEC commissioned a study to identify relevant best practices and created formal mechanisms, such as working groups, to enhance collaboration across divisions and offices. For example, in 2018, SEC created its Operations Steering Committee through which senior operational leaders throughout the agency periodically meet to coordinate on cross-agency operational issues, including those related to human capital."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["SEC should develop and implement safeguards to better ensure transparency and fairness in its new incentive bonus program.

In addition, the  human capital review meetings are informed by data maintained in  SEC\u2019s new Workforce Supply Dashboard, which provides information  on the composition and demographics of SEC divisions and offices  and allows users to view data on hiring, attrition, and other workforce  indicators. For example, through this process, SEC recently  determined that it had an excess of certain positions, such as clerks  and assistants responsible for data processing and management. This  determination led SEC to request permission from OPM for a targeted  early retirement authority and incentives for individuals in such  positions.", "New succession planning processes. In 2016, we found that SEC\u2019s  succession planning lacked information on workforce attrition and a  fair and accurate process for identifying future leaders. Under SEC\u2019s  new succession planning process, the Office of Human Resources  tracks senior-level turnover to determine the level of attrition at senior  leadership levels and to determine whether SEC is filling these  positions internally or externally. In addition, the Office of Human  Resources created a standardized template that managers in each  division and office use to identify key leadership positions and  candidate pools. According to SEC, this more standardized approach  offers an extra level of precision and rigor to identify the specific  leadership strengths and risks across the largest divisions and offices.  In addition, since our 2016 report, SEC has improved processes for  analyzing its talent pool for new leaders. In 2017, the Office of Human  Resources surveyed employees to gauge their interest and intent in  progressing to higher levels of management responsibility, including  to the senior officer ranks. SEC is also developing a centralized  program to screen and select a cohort of high-potential leaders who  will be certified and available to fill senior officer positions as they  become vacant. SEC officials said they anticipate the program will be  launched in the second half of fiscal year 2020.", "The processes and tools described above are still new, and SEC is  continuing to integrate and develop them fully. For example, 2019 was  the first year SEC used its new workforce planning process, and SEC  officials told us that senior officers are still learning how they can best use  new tools, such as the new human capital dashboards. One SEC official  told us that SEC is still refining this new approach and plans to consider  additional enhancements to the dashboards, such as including more  forward-looking data to inform discussions of future workforce needs.  Although SEC continues to enhance its new process and practices, the  actions it has taken fully implement our two 2013 recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Improved Hiring and Promotion Practices", "paragraphs": ["SEC has taken steps to improve certain practices related to hiring and  promotions. For example, in 2016, we found that SEC had not identified  skills gaps among its hiring specialists and that these staff received  limited training. As a result, SEC lacked assurance that its hiring specialists had the necessary skills to hire and promote the most qualified  applicants. We recommended that SEC develop and implement training  for hiring specialists that is informed by a skills gap analysis. In response  to our recommendation, SEC\u2019s Talent Acquisition Group partnered with  SEC\u2019s training group to conduct a competency gap assessment for each  of the Talent Acquisition Group\u2019s five primary jobs. Based on the results  of this competency assessment, in 2018 SEC developed and prioritized a  2-year training plan for hiring specialists to address the identified skills  gaps and to better enable SEC to recruit, develop, and retain competent  staff. This skills gap analysis and the new training curriculum for hiring  specialists fully address our 2016 recommendation.", "SEC also made changes to policies for promotion announcements to  improve perceptions of fairness and transparency. For example, since  2016, a promotion opportunity can be limited to applicants within a single  division or office only if that division or office has at least 15 eligible  candidates. If there are fewer than 15, the announcement must be  opened more broadly to candidates in SEC beyond that particular office  or division.

In 2013, we  found that SEC had made efforts to improve communication and  collaboration but had not fully addressed barriers to an environment of  open communication. We recommended that the SEC Chief Operating  Officer identify and implement incentives for all staff to support an  environment of open communication and collaboration. We determined  that this recommendation had been fully implemented in November 2017.  Among other steps, in 2016 SEC revised its performance expectations for  supervisors to encourage communication and collaboration and  proactively share relevant information.", "Best practices for communication and collaboration. In 2013, we  recommended that SEC explore communication and collaboration best  practices and implement those that could benefit SEC. SEC has taken  action to fully implement this recommendation. Specifically, SEC\u2019s Office  of the Chief Operating Officer engaged a third-party management  consultant team to complete a study of best practices for communication  and collaboration, which was completed in 2018. For the study, the  consultants developed a framework of best practices recognized in the  public and private sectors and assessed SEC\u2019s practices against the  framework. The consultants found that each of the best practices in its  framework was met by at least one of SEC\u2019s activities, tools,  technologies, or initiatives. The report included eight recommendations to  help address barriers to cross-division communication and collaboration,  among other goals. In response to these recommendations, as of May  2019, SEC had taken action on six recommendations and developed  planned actions for the remaining two. For example, to facilitate staff-to- staff communication and collaboration, SEC officials updated the intranet  sites of each mission-critical office and division with main contact  telephone numbers and staff directories. In addition, SEC plans to pilot an  electronic communication tool for project execution among teams  collaborating across divisions and offices that will provide more  functionality than SEC\u2019s current application.", "Cross-divisional committees and working groups. In 2016, we noted  that the lack of a central position or office with authority over the daily  operations of all divisions and offices made it difficult to address  challenges related to communication and collaboration. We  recommended that SEC enhance or expand the responsibilities and  authority of the Chief Operating Officer or another official or office to help ensure that improvements to communication and collaboration across  SEC were made. While SEC disagreed with this recommendation, it has  taken actions that meet the intent of our recommendation.", "First, SEC created cross-divisional committees and working groups that  help to enhance intra-agency communication and collaboration. For  example, in 2018, SEC created an Operations Steering Committee, which  consists of senior operational leaders throughout the agency who meet  on a regular basis to discuss and collaborate on cross-agency operational  issues, including those related to human capital. SEC also created other  formal intra-agency committees and working groups, including an  Information Technology Capital Planning Committee, an Emerging Risk  Group, and a Data Management Board.", "Second, between 2009 and 2018, SEC established Managing Executive  positions in the Office of the Chairman and in eight of its nine mission- critical offices and divisions. Managing Executives are responsible for  working closely with one another, including serving together on intra- agency working groups, to facilitate effective internal collaboration on  operations issues, including personnel management. The Managing  Executive in the Office of the Chairman, established in 2017, acts as a  liaison between the Chairman\u2019s office and the various committees and  working groups.

Without  such validation, SEC may lack information that could help it identify  changes needed to address employee dissatisfaction and ensure its  system achieves its goals. We therefore reiterate our 2013  recommendation that SEC conduct periodic validations, with staff input, of  the performance management system and make changes as appropriate  based on these validations. Consistent with our recommendation, SEC  officials stated they plan to work with OPM to validate the new  performance management system. However, until SEC completes its  validation of the new system, which it plans to do at the conclusion of the  2020 appraisal period, this recommendation remains unaddressed.", "Finally, a key feature of SEC\u2019s new performance management system will  be a performance incentive bonus program through which SEC  supervisors will be able to nominate individual employees for a bonus of  up to $10,000 once per fiscal year. Our prior work on performance  management has highlighted the importance of safeguards that can help  ensure that agencies\u2019 performance management systems\u2014and  particularly the systems affecting pay\u2014are fair and transparent. At the  time of our review, SEC was in the process of designing the performance  incentive bonus program and did not provide us with detailed policies or  procedures.

To obtain employees\u2019 views on SEC\u2019s personnel management  and organizational culture, we implemented two web-based surveys from  March 2019 to May 2019. We administered the first survey to a stratified  random sample of 877 nonexecutive employees in mission-critical  occupations in mission-critical offices and divisions. We administered the  second survey to all 80 senior officers in mission-critical offices and  divisions.", "To determine our sample of nonexecutive employees, we stratified the  population of mission-critical SEC employees into sampling strata by  office and division to help mitigate the risk that a particular part of SEC  could be over- or underrepresented by the respondents to our survey. We  stratified the Division of Enforcement and the Office of Compliance  Inspections and Examinations into two further categories (\u201cheadquarters\u201d  and \u201cregional office\u201d) because this division and office have a majority of  their staff located in one of SEC\u2019s 11 regional offices. Table 3 shows the  total number of employees and the number of employees selected in our  sample for each of the strata. Due to their small employee counts, we  combined the Offices of the Chief Accountant and Credit Ratings into one  stratum for the purpose of selecting the sample. Prior to selecting the  sample, we sorted the sample frame by supervisory status within each  stratum. We then selected the sample via systematic random sampling  within each stratum. Our initial sample size allocation was designed to  achieve a stratum-level margin of error no greater than plus or minus 8  percentage points at the 95 percent level of confidence. Based upon our  prior surveys on SEC\u2019s personnel management, we assumed a response  rate of 70 percent to determine the sample size for the mission-critical  employees. Because some employees left SEC between the time we  obtained a list of SEC employees and the launch of the survey, the final  sample size decreased from 884 to 877.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we  might have drawn. Since each sample could have provided different  estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular  sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval  that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the  samples we could have drawn. We provide confidence intervals along  with each sample estimate in the report. All survey results presented in  the body of this report are generalizable to the estimated population of  2,907 in-scope mission-critical employees at SEC as of September 30,  2018.", "For our survey of nonexecutive employees in the mission-critical offices  and divisions, 563 nonsupervisors and supervisors responded to our  survey, for a response rate of 64 percent. For our survey of all mission- critical senior officers, 50 responded to our survey, for a response rate of  63 percent. For the nonexecutive survey, we carried out a statistical  nonresponse bias analysis using available administrative data and  determined that the results are generalizable to SEC\u2019s mission-critical  employees.

The separate survey of all mission-critical SEC senior officers (those at  the SO-1, SO-2, and SO-3 pay grades) covered the same topic areas but  omitted questions not relevant to senior officers and included additional  questions specifically relevant to senior officers. Our surveys included  both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. We analyzed the results  of our 2019 survey of supervisory and nonsupervisory staff and senior  officers, and we compared the results to results of similar surveys we  conducted in 2013 and 2016. In addition, we reviewed the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint  Survey results to obtain additional perspectives from SEC staff on issues  related to the agency\u2019s personnel management and to compare SEC\u2019s  results to government-wide responses.", "To minimize certain types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors, and enhance data quality, we employed recognized survey design  practices in the development of the questionnaires and the collection,  processing, and analysis of the survey data. To develop our survey  questions, we drew on prior GAO SEC personnel management surveys.  For both of our 2019 surveys, we took steps to ensure that survey  questions from 2016 were still relevant and to determine if new issues  warranted new questions. To do this, we reviewed information from  individual interviews with current and former employees, met with five  mission-critical employees to pretest the nonexecutive survey, and met  with two senior officers to obtain their feedback on the senior officer  survey. As a result of these meetings, for example, we added three  questions related to the impact of SEC\u2019s hiring freeze on personnel  management.", "In addition, a GAO survey expert reviewed and provided feedback on our  survey instrument. To reduce nonresponse, another source of  nonsampling error, we sent multiple emails encouraging SEC employees  to complete the surveys, and we made telephone calls to nonrespondents  to encourage participation and troubleshoot any logistical issues in  accessing the questionnaire. We also had respondents complete  questionnaires online to eliminate errors associated with manual data  entry. On the basis of our application of these practices and follow-up  procedures, we determined that the survey data were of sufficient quality  for the purpose of obtaining employees\u2019 views on SEC\u2019s personnel  management and organizational culture.", "Content analysis. To analyze the information we obtained from the  open-ended survey responses, we conducted a content analysis on the  633 responses to the six open-ended survey questions from the survey of  the mission-critical offices and divisions. Five staff members developed  coding categories based on our researchable objectives, information  collected during our individual interviews, and the findings from our  December 2016 report. Coding categories were as follows: (1) workforce  management, (2) communication, (3) management, (4) promotions, (5)  performance management, and (6) risk aversion.
