To satisfy our  objectives, we used the normal cost rates determined by actuarial  valuations of the system for each of the 3 plan years and determined the  judges\u2019 normal cost share of the plan\u2019s total normal cost rate. The normal  cost rate is the level percentage of future salaries projected to be  sufficient, along with investment earnings and the plan\u2019s assets, to pay  the plan\u2019s benefits.

Generally, it was established to  provide benefits to surviving eligible spouses and unmarried dependent  children of judges who participate in the plan. Judges may elect coverage  within 6 months of taking office; 6 months after getting married, if they  were not married when they took office; 6 months after being elevated to  a higher court; or during an open season authorized by statute. Upon a  judge\u2019s death, the surviving spouse is to receive an annual annuity that  equals 1.5 percent of the judge\u2019s average annual salary, including  retirement salary, during the 3 highest consecutive paid years (commonly  known as the high-3) times the judge\u2019s years of creditable service. The  annuity may not exceed 50 percent of the high-3 and is guaranteed to be  no less than 25 percent. JSAS also provides survivor annuity benefits to  unmarried dependent children under age 18 or age 22 if they are full-time  students. JSAS annuitants receive an annual adjustment in their annuities  at the same time, and by the same percentage, as any cost-of-living  adjustment (COLA) received by CSRS annuitants. Spouses and children  are also eligible for Social Security survivor benefits, provided the judge  was an insured worker under the Social Security system.", "Since its inception, JSAS has been amended several times. Because of  concern that too few judges were participating in the plan, Congress  made broad reforms effective in 1986 with the Judicial Improvements Act  of 1985. The 1985 act (1) increased the annuity formula for surviving  spouses from 1.25 percent to the current 1.5 percent of the high-3 for  each year of creditable service and (2) changed the provisions for  surviving child benefits to relate benefit amounts to judges\u2019 high-3 rather  than the specific dollar amounts provided in 1976 by the Judicial  Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act. In recognition of the significant benefit  improvements that were made, the 1985 act increased the amounts that  judges were required to contribute from 4.5 percent to 5 percent of their  salaries, including retirement salaries. The 1985 act also changed the  requirements for government contributions to the plan. Under the 1976  Judicial Survivors\u2019 Annuities Reform Act, the government matched the  judges\u2019 contributions of 4.5 percent of salaries and retirement salaries.  The 1985 act modified this by specifying that the government would  contribute the amounts necessary to fund any remaining cost over the  future lifetime of current participants. That amount is limited to 9 percent  of total covered salary each year.", "In response to concerns that required contributions of 5 percent may have  created a disincentive to participate, Congress enacted the Federal  Courts Administration Act of 1992. Under this act, participants\u2019  contribution requirements were reduced from 5 percent to 2.2 percent of  salaries for active and senior judges and 3.5 percent of retirement  salaries for retired judges. The 1992 act also significantly increased  benefits for survivors of retired judges. This increase was accomplished  by including years spent in retirement in the calculation of creditable  service and the high-3 salary averages. Additionally, the 1992 act  allowed judges to stop contributing to the plan if they ceased to be  married and granted benefits to survivors of any judge who died in the  interim between leaving office and the commencement of a deferred  retirement salary. Prior to 2008, surviving spouses forfeited their JSAS  annuity rights if they remarried before reaching age 55. In 2008, JSAS  was amended to restore the judicial survivor\u2019s spousal annuity upon the  termination or dissolution of a subsequent remarriage by annulment,  death, or divorce.", "Furthermore, after AOUSC conducted a study of JSAS to determine  whether it was equitable in its coverage and cost when compared to other  survivor benefit programs, Congress passed the Judicial Survivors  Protection Act of 2009. The 2009 act authorized an open season, which  covered the period from September 11, 2009, through March 10, 2010,  for judges who previously opted not to enroll in JSAS. However, these  judges were required to pay 2.75 percent of future pay instead of the 2.2  percent referred to in the 1992 act. The 2009 act also allowed judges to  purchase, in 3-month increments, up to an additional year of service  credit for each year of federal judicial service completed. According to  AOUSC, during this open season, 279 judges enrolled in JSAS,  increasing the participation rate from 60 percent to 71 percent.", "According to the JSAS actuarial valuation report for plan year 2010  issued on November 16, 2012, as of October 1, 2010, there were 1,542  active and senior judges, 268 retired judges, and 356 survivor annuitants  covered under JSAS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Calculation of Federal Share", "paragraphs": ["JSAS is financed by judges\u2019 contributions and direct appropriations of  federal funds.

Normal cost calculations are  estimates and require that many actuarial assumptions be made about  the future, including, but not limited to, mortality rates, turnover rates,  returns on investment, salary increases, and COLA increases over the life  spans of current participants and beneficiaries. There are many  acceptable actuarial methods for calculating normal cost. Regardless of  which cost method is chosen, the expected total long-term cost of the  plan should be the same; however, the allocation of these total long-term  costs to particular years\u2019 costs may differ, depending on the cost method  used.

Beginning in plan year 2009, to reflect lower mortality  rates, the plan\u2019s actuary used a mortality table that projected mortality  rates forward to build in 5 years of mortality improvement and applied a 4- year age setback. In addition, in plan year 2010, the assumed rates of  investment return and inflation were changed to be consistent with  changes in the assumptions used by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) for CSRS. These changes included a decrease in  the assumed rate of investment return from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent.", "One factor that may further increase the federal government\u2019s  contribution rate over the next 3-year cycle is continued low interest rates.

AOUSC is  responsible for providing the actuary the economic assumptions to be  used in the actuarial valuation reports, which include rates for return on  investment, inflation, and salary increases. For the economic  assumptions, AOUSC has historically made a determination to use  assumptions that are consistent with those used by OPM in its  determination of funding requirements for the federal CSRS, specifically  those that relate to return on investment and inflation. Prior to fiscal year  2010, OPM used the same set of economic assumptions for funding and  financial reporting purposes.

The monitoring group includes staff  members from JCRSO, AFSD, and the Office of the General Counsel.  AOUSC\u2019s revised procedures also require the actuary to prepare  valuation reports that include economic assumptions for both funding and  financial reporting purposes. The economic assumptions used by the  actuary are to be approved and documented by the monitoring group  after consulting with OPM. Further, AOUSC\u2019s revised procedures require  that JCRSO review actuarial valuation reports before issuance to help  ensure the accuracy of participant data and completeness of all relevant  information affecting JSAS. We determined that the revised procedures  developed by AOUSC, if properly implemented, are sufficient to address  the issues we identified in this report.

The  difference between these amounts, $358,934,134, must be financed  through future contributions to be paid by the participating judges and the  federal government. Using the same assumptions as used to estimate the  present value of future benefits, the actuary estimated the present value  of participating judges\u2019 future salaries to be $4,727,919,865 so that the  amount to be financed represented 7.59 percent ($358,934,134 divided  by $4,727,919,865) of the participating judges\u2019 future salaries. This  percentage is JSAS\u2019s normal cost rate. If all the actuarial assumptions  proved exactly correct, then a total contribution of 7.59 percent of the  participating judges\u2019 salaries annually would make up the difference  between JSAS\u2019s future payments and its assets (the $358,934,134  mentioned above). The JSAS\u2019s actuary also estimated the present value  of participating judges\u2019 future contributions to be $127,723,509. Thus, the  federal government\u2019s share of the present value of future contributions is  the difference between $358,934,134 and $127,723,509, or  $231,210,625.", "Under this method, for plan year 2010, the federal government\u2019s  actuarially recommended contribution rate is equal to the federal  government\u2019s share of future financing ($231,210,625) divided by the  present value of the participating judges\u2019 future salaries ($4,727,919,865).  For plan year 2010, the rate was 4.89 percent ($231,210,625 divided by  $4,727,919,865). Thus, the actuarially recommended federal government  contribution for a particular year is the product of the federal  government\u2019s actuarially recommended contribution rate and the  participating judges\u2019 salaries for that year. The actual federal government  contribution is approved through annual appropriations, which could vary  above and below the actuarially recommended amount. According to  AOUSC, the amount appropriated is usually equal to the actuarially  recommended amount. However, there is a time lag between the AOUSC  budget preparation and the issuance of the actuarial valuation reports.  For example, the appropriations received for fiscal year 2010 were based  on the recommended contributions from the actuarial valuation report for  fiscal year 2008 (that is, the valuation as of October 1, 2007) as it was the  most current report available when the fiscal year 2010 budget was  prepared."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Julie Phillips (Assistant  Director), Jehan Chase, and Nina M.
