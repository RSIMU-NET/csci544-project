Some of these differences are due to varying requirements in applicable laws and regulations. For example, the law requires manufacturers, exporters, and brokers to register with State for items controlled by State but not for items controlled by Commerce. Additionally, while Commerce and State both screen parties to licenses against relevant watch lists, Commerce officials said they do not have direct access to State's internal watch list, which contains derogatory information from past screening of licenses for firearms, artillery, and ammunition exports. State and Commerce officials stated that, while they have held some discussions, they have not established a process for sharing watch list information. Without access to State's watch list, Commerce may lack critical information to effectively screen parties to exports of firearms and related items. State and Commerce also both have end-use monitoring programs to confirm the legitimacy of end-users but some differences exist. For example, State relies on embassy staff to conduct end-use monitoring whereas Commerce relies primarily on several officers positioned overseas specifically for this purpose. In addition, a statutory requirement to notify Congress of proposed firearms exports over $1 million would no longer apply to firearms that transfer from State to Commerce, according to Commerce officials.", "According to the proposed rules and agency officials, the proposed transfer, if finalized, would result in a decline in licenses and revenues for State and an increase in licenses for Commerce, but the precise extent of these changes is unknown. State estimates that the transfer would result in a decline in revenue from registration fees but officials stated it is difficult to predict the extent of this decline.

State\u2019s definition of technical data includes information,  such as blueprints, drawings, or instructions. Commerce\u2019s export control  regulations generally do not apply to services. For example, training in  the basic operation of a firearm controlled by Commerce would not be  subject to export controls, according to State officials. In addition,  Commerce\u2019s regulations do not control technology or software, if it is  \u201cavailable to the public without restrictions.\u201d For example, Commerce officials told us that Commerce would not require an export license for the  posting of instructions for 3D printing of firearms on the internet, if they  were publicly available without restrictions.", "Minimum level of U.S.-origin content. Items subject to State\u2019s controls  require a license when they are incorporated into a foreign-made product  regardless of the percentage of controlled U.S. content in that product.  Commerce does not require a license for items when they are  incorporated into foreign-made items unless the controlled U.S.-origin  content of a foreign-made product exceeds the applicable minimum  percentage which, according to Commerce officials, may be 10 or 25  percent, depending on the destination. This minimum level of U.S.-origin  content is referred to as \u201cde minimis treatment.\u201d Commerce\u2019s proposed  rule states that de minimis treatment in Commerce\u2019s regulations would  apply for all foreign-made items proposed for transfer to the CCL, unless  they are being exported to a country that is subject to a United States  arms embargo, in which case there would be no minimum threshold for  U.S.-origin content.", "License exceptions. State regulations contain some country-based  license exceptions, including for exports to Canada and, more narrowly,  to Australia and the United Kingdom whereas Commerce has several  different license exceptions under its regulations. For example,  Commerce regulations have the \u201cStrategic Trade Authorization\u201d (STA) exception that permits exports of certain items to countries determined to  be low risk, which includes NATO partners and other close allies, of which  37 are eligible for a broader STA authorization and seven are eligible for  a much narrower STA authorization. Commerce\u2019s proposed rule  specifies that it would revise Commerce\u2019s regulations to make firearms  and most parts, components, accessories, and attachments ineligible for  the STA license exception. However, Commerce estimates that 450 to  650 license applications per year involving certain eligible items would still  be authorized under STA exceptions if the proposed rules are finalized.", "Commerce also has a \u201cLimited Value Shipment\u201d exception, which is  available for proposed exports of certain less sensitive firearms parts and  components with a value of $500 or less per shipment based on the  actual selling price or fair market value. Commerce\u2019s proposed rule  specifies that this exception would only be available for certain parts,  components, and accessories and attachments for firearms; complete  firearms would be ineligible for this exception. State offers a similar  exemption but only for licenses with a value of $100 or less, based on the  wholesale price."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and Commerce Both Conduct End-Use Monitoring of Selected Controlled Exports but Differences Exist", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State and Commerce Both Implement End-Use Monitoring Programs", "paragraphs": ["State and Commerce both conduct end-use monitoring to verify the  reliability of foreign end-users and legitimacy of proposed transactions  and to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with the terms of the  license and proper use of the licensed items. State recommends that end-use checks involve a site visit whenever possible, while Commerce policy  requires that the end-use check include a physical verification on-site with  a party to the transaction, according to Commerce officials. State and  Commerce also apply their own means of risk-based targeting to select  the licenses or exports that will undergo end-use monitoring, however,  similarities exist involving selection criteria. For example, State and  Commerce may target transactions that involve unfamiliar foreign parties,  unusual shipping routes, or derogatory information from watch lists,  according to the departments. The number of end-use checks conducted  by State averaged about 1.3 percent of its license applications, and those  conducted by Commerce averaged about 3.3 percent of its applications  from fiscal years 2013-2017.", "State and Commerce end-use checks may result in either \u201cfavorable\u201d or  \u201cunfavorable\u201d findings.

For either State or Commerce, an  unfavorable end-use check can lead to denying applications, revoking  licenses, removing parties from licenses, updating the watch list, or  making referrals to U.S. law enforcement agencies for investigation,  according to a State report and Commerce officials. State closed 166 of  766, or 22 percent, of end-use monitoring cases as \u201cunfavorable\u201d in fiscal  years 2013-2017 for firearms, artillery, and ammunition licenses. State\u2019s  three most common reasons for an unfavorable finding for end-use  checks for firearms, artillery, and ammunition were derogatory information  on a foreign party, inability to confirm order or receipt of goods, and  involvement of an unlicensed party.", "State relies on U.S. embassy or consulate staff in the country or countries  involved in the transaction to conduct its end-use checks. Commerce  relies primarily on Export Control Officers (ECOs) positioned overseas to  conduct end-use checks. ECOs conducted an average of about 60  percent of Commerce\u2019s end-use checks per year from fiscal years 2013  to 2017. According to Commerce officials, Commerce had a total of nine ECO positions in Beijing, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, New  Delhi, and Singapore, as of October 2018 (see fig. 5). Six of these nine  positions were filled as of this date. The ECOs have areas of  responsibility covering multiple countries within their geographic region.  For the remaining 40 percent of end-use checks, Commerce relied  primarily on its \u201cSentinel Program\u201d in which BIS special agents based in  domestic field offices, along with other responsibilities, travel to  destination countries not covered by ECOs to conduct end-use checks.  In addition, a small percentage of Commerce\u2019s end-use checks are  conducted by Foreign Commercial Service officers or other personnel  stationed at U.S. embassies, according to Commerce officials.", "State conducted 766 end-use checks for firearms, artillery, and  ammunition in fiscal years 2013-2017 with the largest share, over 40  percent, in the Western Hemisphere (see fig. 6).

According to Commerce officials, the  number and locations of end-use checks for firearms, artillery, and  ammunition, if these items are transferred to the CCL, will depend on how  exports of these items factor into the department\u2019s existing targeting  criteria. To the extent that Commerce needs to conduct end-use checks  for these items in the Western Hemisphere, Commerce officials told us  that they plan to cover these checks via the Sentinel Program and, where  necessary, through checks by Foreign Commercial Service Officers. The  officials noted that they plan to reassess their end-use monitoring efforts  after items are transferred to the CCL if the proposed rules are finalized.", "End-use checks include pre-license checks in support of the license  application review or post-shipment verifications after the license has  been approved and items have shipped. As shown in figure 7, more  than 50 percent of State\u2019s end-use checks specifically for firearms,  artillery, and ammunition licenses from fiscal years 2013 to 2017 were  pre-license checks. Conversely, about 90 percent of Commerce\u2019s end- use checks for all items subject to the EAR for this period were post- shipment verifications.
