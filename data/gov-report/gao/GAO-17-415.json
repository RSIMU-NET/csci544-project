DOD developed plans that will support construction efforts in Guam and Japan, and developed some initial infrastructure plans for Hawaii and Australia. However, GAO found the Marines Corps' integrated master schedule for Guam did not fully meet the comprehensive, well-constructed, and credible characteristics for a reliable schedule. For example, the schedule does not include resources needed for nonconstruction activities, such as information technology and design activities. Additionally, the Marine Corps has not completed its risk-management plan for infrastructure construction in Guam. Specifically, the Marine Corps has not identified its strategy to address construction risks including labor shortages and endangered-species protection. If DOD does not have a reliable schedule or has not completed risk planning for Guam, it may not have complete information to identify and address risks that may result in cost overruns and schedule delays.", "DOD has made progress in developing cost estimates for Guam, but its estimates partially met GAO best practices for reliable cost estimates for the relocations to Guam and Hawaii and the establishment of a rotational presence in Australia. For cost estimates related to Guam military construction activities, DOD included ground rules and assumptions, but did not include some elements of a reliable cost estimate, such as a risk analysis. Additionally, DOD developed cost estimates for nonmilitary construction activities that provide a high-level planning overview of the requirements, but they did not incorporate several other best practices, including a unifying Work Breakdown Structure that defines in detail the work necessary to accomplish a program's objectives. For Hawaii and Australia, the cost estimates are not considered reliable because they did not include all life-cycle costs or a Work Breakdown Structure. If DOD does not revise the cost estimates for these locations, decision makers in DOD and Congress will not have reliable cost information to inform funding decisions and to help them determine the viability of relocation of Marines to Hawaii and the establishment of a rotational presence in Australia."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD resolve capability deficiencies in the four selected identified areas, update its schedule for Guam infrastructure, complete a risk-management plan for Guam infrastructure, and revise its three cost estimates.

Japan serves as the United States\u2019 most significant  forward-operating location in the Asia-Pacific region, accommodating  approximately 55,000 U.S. military personnel, 42,000 dependents, and  9,400 DOD civilian employees, as of the second quarter of fiscal year  2016. The majority of this presence resides in Okinawa, an island  prefecture south of the Japanese mainland that represents less than 1  percent of Japan\u2019s entire land mass. Although it is small compared to the  entirety of Japan\u2019s land mass, Okinawa\u2019s U.S. bases house  approximately 29,000 military personnel (including about 18,000 Marine  Corps personnel) on any given day. To balance the importance of this  forward presence to both the United States and Japan with the stated  need to reduce the impact on the Okinawa community, in April 2012 the  U.S. and Japanese governments adjusted the realignment plans.  Specifically, in an effort to reach this balance and realign its presence in  the Asia-Pacific region, the Marine Corps plans to consolidate bases in  southern Okinawa and relocate 4,100 Marines to Guam, 2,700 to Hawaii,  800 to the continental United States, and 1,300 (on a rotational basis) to  Australia.", "This report is one of a series of reports on DOD\u2019s Asia-Pacific  realignment. In May 2011, we reported on U.S. defense posture in Asia,  highlighting the need for additional cost information and methods for  evaluating posture in that region. We recommended, among other  things, that DOD develop annual cost estimates for posture in the U.S.  Pacific Command\u2019s area of responsibility. In part in response to our  report, since early 2012 DOD has reported its cost estimates for new or  ongoing posture initiatives in the annual U.S. Global Defense Posture  Report to Congress. In June 2013, we reported that DOD did not include  detailed information on requirements for several key cost components  needed for its cost estimate for Guam, had not developed an integrated  master plan for the relocation, and had not identified sustainment needs  and costs for U.S. forces on Okinawa and Guam. We recommended,  among other things, that DOD update its cost estimate to include seven  cost components, develop an integrated master plan for the relocation of  Marines, and identify sustainment requirements for affected facilities until  relocation initiatives are complete. DOD generally agreed with our  recommendations, and as of August 2016 had implemented two of the six  recommendations.

However, as we had reported, realignment  efforts did not make much progress until the end of 2002, when the  United States and Japan launched a series of realignment initiatives  called the Defense Policy Review Initiative  (DPRI). Under DPRI, both  countries were seeking to reduce the U.S. footprint in Okinawa, enhance  interoperability  and communication, and better position U.S. forces to  respond to a changing security environment. The major realignment  initiatives under DPRI were outlined in the U.S.\u2013Japan Roadmap for  Realignment Implementation (2006 Roadmap) and subsequently  adjusted, most recently through a joint statement issued in April 2012.  There are four initiatives under DPRI that are specific to the realignment  of Marine Corps forces in the Pacific:  1. Constructing and moving forces to the Futenma Replacement Facility,  2.

For  example, III  Marine Expeditionary Force officials stated they would like  the Guam relocation to occur within an 18-month time frame to help  ensure that forces move together based on capabilities. According to  officials from III  Marine Expeditionary Force, it makes more sense to  move a maintenance battalion at the same time it moves the units the  battalion supports rather than move that battalion based on facility  completion dates; otherwise, the supported units would remain in  Okinawa for some time without maintenance capability. Marine Corps and  Pacific Command officials stated that, based on the capability concerns  regarding the relocation expressed by III  Marine Expeditionary Force, in  the summers of 2015 and 2016 Marine Corps Forces Pacific conducted  simulated wartime scenarios to assess these capability concerns.

According to officials from U.S. Forces\u2013 Japan, there are no training locations near Iwakuni that are sufficient  for relocated Marine Corps units\u2019 training needs, resulting in the units  returning to Okinawa for training and spending additional money for  fuel and equipment maintenance. Kanoya Air Base is currently the  only location that is being considered for training, but it is not sufficient  for the relocated units\u2019 needs because there are training requirements  that cannot be satisfied at Kanoya Air Base, according to U.S.  Forces\u2013Japan and Marine Corps officials. DOD has formed a working  group to consider training in mainland Japan for Iwakuni units, but  planning has stalled because DOD has not identified other training  areas. Although, according to officials from U.S. Forces\u2013Japan, the  government of Japan is ultimately generally responsible for building  training locations, DOD\u2019s identification of other training areas could be  presented to the government of Japan to help resolve this issue, in  particular given that DOD may ultimately be responsible for sustaining  whatever training facility the government of Japan builds. DOD could  also continue to raise the concern about the training deficiency in  normal bilateral channels such as the Security Consultative  Committee.

The addition of the Marines will likely cause additional strain on already stressed training ranges in Hawaii. As of April 2016, Marine Corps officials have not identified a timeline for when they plan to develop training plans, stating that planning for Hawaii is not yet a priority. However, citing a March 2014 Hawaiian islands training study, Marine Corps officials noted that installations in Hawaii lack sufficient range capabilities to fully support training of units already stationed there. Because the sites are not sufficient, the officials stated that about 90 percent of the Marine Corps training occurs on Army training ranges in Hawaii. However, there are capacity issues with those sites because the Marine Corps has to share the space with the Army. According to the March 2014 study, the limited ranges in Hawaii have historically been used at a close-to- capacity level. Furthermore, infrastructure planning takes years to complete in advance of allocating resources for particular needs in a budget. Without infrastructure planning to support mission requirements, as identified in the Unified Facilities Criteria 2-100-01, the Marine Corps risks not having the necessary infrastructure to fulfill its needed capabilities. It is important to resolve this capability deficiency now because these training issues will become exacerbated as additional Marines begin to relocate to Hawaii. CNMI\u2014DOD has not fully resolved the training requirements in the region of CNMI,  and may have to spend more time and resources to identify other, potentially more costly, locations for training. According to DOD\u2019s study on training requirements in CNMI, there are 42 unfilled training requirements throughout Pacific Command\u2019s area of responsibility. DOD officials stated that training ranges in CNMI would solve all of the unfulfilled live-fire and unit-level training deficiencies in the Asia-Pacific region. Pacific Command officials described the potential training capabilities in CNMI  as a crucial initiative. However, as of the time of our review, the environmental impact statement recommending training ranges in CNMI has not been finalized, and instead it is being revised. The draft  environmental impact statement received 27,000 comments  expressing concerns about the plans regarding training facilities in  CNMI.  Many of these comments expressed concerns about potential  impacts on water, wastewater, and public health. In order to address  the multitude of comments, the Department of the Navy stated it is  conducting a revised study. While some DOD officials offered  hypothetical alternatives for training in CNMI,  such as training in  foreign countries, they have not yet conducted any specific planning  and stated that there are no Pacific-based alternatives to consider on  U.S. territories. Rather, DOD officials stated that fulfillment of any of  the 42 unfilled training requirements through the training ranges in  CNMI  would be an improvement, and they could plan for alternatives  once they determine if any requirements will remain unfulfilled.

Marine Corps Air  Station Futenma also supports the use of a runway if needed for a United  Nations contingency, such as disaster response, for which U.S. Forces\u2013 Japan is a key partner. The proposed runway at Camp Schwab will not  adequately support these same mission requirements, according to  Marine Corps officials. Instead, there will be two 5,900-foot V-shaped  runways that, according to Marine Corps officials, will be too short for  certain aircraft. As we reported in March 1998 and is still the case based  on our discussions with Marine Corps officials, the loss of Marine Corps  Air Station Futenma\u2019s runway equates to the loss of an emergency  landing strip for fixed-wing aircraft in the area and the loss of the United  Nations use of a runway. According to an official from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, the office has not yet developed a  plan for other alternate runways in Okinawa because it is not a priority.

Without a risk-management plan that identifies the Marine Corps\u2019 strategy  for addressing risks to the infrastructure buildup in Guam, DOD will not  have the information necessary to address risks for its infrastructure  design and construction that will likely result in cost overruns and  schedule delays related to the relocation. Moreover, DOD has taken  steps to implement our June 2013 recommendation to update Okinawa  installation master plans, but it has not identified short- or long-term  sustainment needs for facilities in Okinawa. By fully implementing our  June 2013 recommendation to include short- or long-term sustainment  needs, DOD would be better positioned to mitigate infrastructure  sustainment risks in Okinawa and could better ensure that facilities are  adequate to carry out its mission until related realignment activities are  completed. DOD would also limit its risk of experiencing cost overruns  resulting from having to sustain facilities longer than expected because of  delays or uncertainties related to other Asia-Pacific relocation activities  that officials project will need to occur before consolidating infrastructure.", "DOD has made overall progress in developing its cost estimates for  Guam since June 2013, but its estimates partially met best practices for  reliable cost estimates for infrastructure in Guam, Hawaii, and Australia.  Specifically, the cost estimates for Guam do not include a unifying Work  Breakdown Structure, risk and sensitivity analyses, and an independent  cost estimate. The cost estimates for Hawaii and Australia do not include  a life-cycle cost estimate or a Work Breakdown Structure. Without a  revision of current cost estimates for Guam, Hawaii, and Australia to fully  address all of the best practices established by GAO\u2019s cost estimating  guide, decision makers in DOD and Congress will not have reliable cost  information to inform their funding decisions and to help them determine  the viability  of these options for the relocation and the establishment of a  rotational presence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following nine  actions.", "To improve the Department of Defense\u2019s ability to maintain its capability  in the Asia-Pacific region, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense  direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected identified capability  deficiencies associated with the relocation in four areas:  the movement of Marine Corps units by, for example, reconsidering  when units should move to Guam to minimize leaving facilities vacant;  training needs in Iwakuni, Hawaii, and CNMI  by, for example,  identifying other suitable training areas;  reduction in runway length at the Futenma Replacement Facility by,  for example, selecting other runways that would support mission  requirements; and challenges in Australia regarding seasonal changes and biosecurity  requirements that affect equipment downtime by, for example,  deciding on a location for the wet season and identifying a solution for  biosecurity requirements.", "To provide DOD with reliable information on potential sources of delays  for the design and construction of infrastructure in Guam, we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct the appropriate entities to update the  Marine Corps\u2019 integrated master schedule for Guam so that it meets the  comprehensive, well-constructed, and credible characteristics for a  reliable schedule.

In written comments, DOD concurred with two  recommendations, partially concurred with six recommendations, and  nonconcurred with one recommendation. After receiving a draft of the  sensitive report in December 2016, DOD provided additional information  and documentation in January and February 2017 based on new  developments in the bilateral negotiations between the governments of  the United States and Australia, actions taken by DOD during our review  in response to our draft report, and roles and responsibilities in the Asia- Pacific region. As a result of our review of the documentation provided  and discussions with officials, we revised some of our findings to reflect  this additional information, and we revised the wording of some of our  recommendations. Specifically, in discussions in January 2017, DOD  officials raised concerns about the stakeholders to whom we directed our  recommendations, noting that multiple stakeholders have roles in the  relocation. We agree there are multiple stakeholders and modified some  recommendations to allow the Secretary of Defense to direct the  appropriate entities to implement the recommendations, rather than  identify the specific stakeholders. Additionally,  we removed one finding  and its related recommendation regarding challenges reaching an  agreement between the United States and Australia relating to the  mission of the Marine Corps units in Australia, given new documentation  provided by DOD and updates in the bilateral negotiations. DOD\u2019s  comments on this report are summarized below and reprinted in their  entirety in appendix VI. In e-mail, the audit liaison from the Department of  State indicated that the department did not have formal comments. DOD  and the Department of State also both provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD partially concurred with our first four recommendations that the  Secretary of Defense direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected  identified capability deficiencies associated with the movement of Marine  Corps units; training needs in Iwakuni, Hawaii, and CNMI; reduction in  runway length at the Futenma Replacement Facility; and challenges in  Australia regarding seasonal changes and biosecurity requirements. In its  letter, DOD stated that the Marine Corps has already addressed, where  applicable, the selected identified capability deficiencies. We disagree  that the Marine Corps has addressed these capability deficiencies, given  the ongoing concerns as noted in our report. Moreover, in January 2017,  both the Marine Corps and Pacific Command provided additional  documents to us stating that the four selected identified capability  deficiencies were not yet resolved, and we address the specific points in  the following paragraphs related to each recommendation.", "With regard to our first recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected identified capability  deficiencies associated with the movement of Marine Corps units, DOD  stated that the Marine Corps\u2019 plans for movement of units from Okinawa  to Guam has considered many factors, including, among others, the  capabilities required to support Pacific Command and the logistical  requirements associated with the movement of forces. In its response,  DOD stated it disagrees with our assessment that adequate planning with  regard to minimizing operational downtime of III  Marine Expeditionary  Force during the movement to Guam has not been done. Rather, DOD  stated that both the Marine Corps and Pacific Command have done  extensive planning and analysis to determine how best to posture, move,  and support forces from III  Marine Expeditionary Force. In its response,  DOD further noted Pacific Command\u2019s explanation that the existing plan  cannot be considered fixed and final because of the requirement to adapt  to changing conditions. DOD also noted that those conditions do not  materially impact the infrastructure required. DOD added that the pace at  which this movement is executed will continue to take into account the  rate at which the required infrastructure is developed. Moreover, DOD\u2019s  response stated that the Marine Corps is already working to ensure that  its plan is continually refined to balance fiscal and construction realities  with operational risk, capability requirements, and readiness.", "Although DOD has taken initial steps to consider how to move Marine  Corps units from Okinawa to Guam, we continue to believe it has not yet  fully resolved this capability deficiency. We agree that DOD has taken  some steps to analyze capability deficiencies regarding the movement of  Marine Corps units, and we stated in our report that Marine Corps Forces  Pacific conducted simulated wartime scenarios to assess the capability  concerns that had been expressed by III  Marine Corps Forces. However,  as we also stated in our report, DOD has not completed its analysis or  reached any decisions on how to move the forces. Further, as we stated,  DOD anticipates that it will soon be rapidly increasing the number of  construction projects in Guam, increasing from 4 projects as of July 2016  to 15 projects in fiscal year 2018. Those projects, which are already in the  planning and development stage, will be affected if DOD has not made  decisions on the movement of forces. Further, any changes could result  in costly adjustments to the construction if decisions are made too late or  could result in vacant facilities if the movement of units needs to be  adjusted. DOD has not provided us evidence that, if plans are adapted to  changing conditions, the effect on infrastructure will be minimal; in  contrast, we have historically found that infrastructure changes can be  costly to the department. Moreover, in January 2017, Marine Corps and  Pacific Command officials continued to express concerns that decisions  with regard to force structure and positioning of forces will ultimately  affect facility planning adjustments. As a result, until DOD resolves how to  move units from Okinawa to Guam, it risks hindering its mission  requirements during the relocation.", "With regard to our second recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected identified capability  deficiencies associated with training needs in Iwakuni, Hawaii, and CNMI,  DOD stated that it has already conducted an extensive analysis of  training needs. Specifically concerning training requirements for CNMI,  DOD stated that Pacific Command identified 42 combatant command\u2013 level training deficiencies to be fulfilled through the development of  training ranges in Pacific Command\u2019s area of responsibility. DOD added  that, due to the complexity and scale of these training deficiencies, CNMI  emerged as the only viable location on U.S. territory to address these  deficiencies. DOD further stated it disagrees that a study to reexamine  these and other potential training locations in the event that DOD is not  able to meet all of its identified training requirements in CNMI is  warranted or worthwhile years prior to the development of new training  ranges in the CNMI.", "With respect to the department\u2019s assertion that DOD has already  conducted an extensive analysis of training needs for the Marine Corps  and the joint force in Iwakuni, Hawaii, and CNMI,  we disagree. The  assertion is contrary to evidence provided to us in documents and  discussions we held with DOD officials. In particular, in February 2017,  officials from U.S. Forces\u2013Japan said that bilateral agreement was  reached to establish a working group to study other possible locations  beyond Kanoya Air Base for training, thus indicating that identification of  other training locations near Iwakuni has not yet been resolved. With  respect to Hawaii, in April 2016, Marine Corps officials told us they had  not identified a timeline for when they plan to develop training plans, and  in January 2017 Marine Corps officials added that there is significant work  to be done to fully determine training requirements and conduct planning  to meet those requirements. With respect to CNMI, in January 2017 both  Pacific Command and the Marine Corps stated that DOD has not fully  resolved the challenges associated with training areas. As noted in our  report, the department received more than 27,000 comments in response  to the draft environmental impact statement, and to address the multitude  of comments the Department of the Navy stated it is developing a revised  draft environmental impact statement. However, the Marine Corps  synchronization matrix, as of June 2016, still showed construction  scheduled to begin in Tinian as soon as 2017. We continue to believe that  DOD should take actions to resolve capability deficiencies associated  with training needs in Iwakuni, Hawaii, and CNMI; otherwise, it may take  additional time, effort, and resources to resolve these deficiencies and it  is uncertain whether the Marine Corps units will be able to complete  necessary training in these locations.", "With regard to our third recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected identified capability  deficiencies associated with the reduction in runway length at the  Futenma Replacement Facility, DOD stated that it disagreed that the  length of the runway planned at the Futenma Replacement Facility is a  capability deficiency for the Marine Corps. DOD stated that, at the time of  its agreement with Japan, it understood that the Futenma Replacement  Facility would not possess a long runway and that the Marine Corps  drove the final requirements to support the capabilities required for their  missions at the Futenma Replacement Facility.", "While we agree that the shorter runway is not a deficiency for the Marine  Corps, it is a deficiency that is ultimately connected with infrastructure  plans for the Marine Corps in the context of relocation\u2014specifically,  infrastructure plans associated with Marine Corps relocation from Marine  Corps Air Station Futenma. As such, we directed our recommendation to  the Secretary of Defense to direct the appropriate entities for whom the  shorter runway is a deficiency. As we wrote in our report, the shorter  runway equates to the loss of an emergency landing strip for fixed-wing  aircraft in the area and the loss of the United Nations use of a runway.  These capability deficiencies affect the Air Force and U.S. Forces\u2013Japan  and have not yet been resolved. Additionally,  as we stated in our report,  senior officials from U.S. Forces\u2013Japan said that, given the large  Japanese investment into the Futenma Replacement Facility, it may be  likely that the United States becomes pressured by the government of  Japan to return Marine Corps Air Station Futenma even if the  replacement runway deficiency is not resolved. If this return were to occur  without a replacement runway identified, DOD mission capabilities could  be hindered. Until this deficiency is resolved, DOD may be unable to  maintain all mission capabilities or face higher costs to do so.", "With regard to our fourth recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the appropriate entities to resolve selected identified capability  deficiencies associated with challenges in Australia regarding seasonal  changes and biosecurity requirements that affect equipment downtime,  DOD stated that these factors are not capability deficiencies but rather  real-world constraints around which DOD and Australia are working to  develop the most bilaterally beneficial annual program possible. DOD  also stated that the Marine Corps continues to coordinate closely with the  Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry to develop  best practices to train Marines as assistant inspectors to minimize the  cost, in time and money, to conduct biosecurity inspections.", "We agree that the department likely understood these issues when it first  began planning for the rotational presence to Australia, but knowing about  these issues does not negate the fact that DOD has not yet determined  how it plans to resolve them. These issues remain relevant to the Marine  Corps, as it will need to determine where to place up 2,500 Marines when  some units can no longer return to Okinawa and how to reduce readiness  risks when its equipment is unusable due to biosecurity screening  requirements. As we noted in our report, DOD officials are considering  multiple options for the wet season, but no decisions have been made,  and Marine Corps officials have identified constraints for each option  being considered. Moreover, as stated in our report, in January 2017  Pacific Command and Marine Corps officials stated that challenges  remain to fund and source a dedicated equipment set. Initial force flow  has already begun, and the cost-sharing arrangement between the  governments of the United States and Australia was signed in January  2017, which will likely allow for construction decisions to be made in the  near term. DOD has the opportunity now\u2014before force flow increases  and DOD spends additional effort and resources\u2014to make prudent  decisions to avoid needing to make costly corrections later. As a result,  we continue to believe that DOD should take actions to resolve these  challenges in Australia in order to help ensure that its plans are fully  developed and resources are identified so that DOD and Congress can  make prudent and informed funding decisions to resolve these  challenges.", "DOD concurred with our fifth recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the appropriate entities to update the Marine Corps\u2019  integrated master schedule for Guam so that it meets the comprehensive,  well-constructed, and credible characteristics for a reliable schedule. In its  response, DOD stated that, in September 2016, it began updating its  integrated master schedule based on our review to conform to the GAO  Schedule Assessment Guide and plans to adopt the best practices of  assigning resources and establishing activity durations to ensure the  schedule is comprehensive. Also, DOD plans to continue to work to verify  that the schedule can be traced horizontally and vertically and conduct a  schedule risk analysis. If fully implemented, we believe that DOD\u2019s  proposed actions will better provide DOD with reliable information on  potential sources of delays for the design and construction of  infrastructure in Guam.", "DOD concurred with our sixth recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the appropriate entities to complete a risk-management  plan for Guam, and include, at a minimum, plans to address: (1)  construction labor shortages, (2) explosive-ordnance detection, (3)  cultural-artifact discovery and preservation, and (4) protection of  endangered species. In its response, DOD cited actions it has previously  taken and plans to mitigate risks for infrastructure construction and  sustainment, such as coordinating with the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services to address foreign-worker visas, approving an  explosive-safety exemption for construction projects in Guam and CNMI,  and developing a monitoring and mitigation tracking plan to ensure Navy  compliance and execution of environmental requirements. These past  and planned actions, as well as DOD\u2019s concurrence with our  recommendation, should better address risks to the design and  construction of its infrastructure and, in turn, reduce the potential for cost  overruns and schedule delays.", "DOD nonconcurred with our seventh recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense direct the appropriate entities to revise the cost estimates for  Guam to address all best practices established by GAO\u2019s cost estimating  guide. In its response, DOD stated that the department does not accept  the assertion that GAO\u2019s best practices are universally applicable to a  wide range of activities that includes military construction, acquisition, or  basing. DOD stated that the Guam program was developed and  communicated to Congress consistently with statute and the department\u2019s  long-standing supporting policies. Specifically, DOD noted that DOD  Financial Management Regulation, Volume 2B, Chapter 6, requires  inclusion of a form for each project submitted with the budget request,  containing certain information. According to DOD, per this guidance, a  contractor develops a detailed Work Breakdown Structure when the  construction contract is awarded, which is much later in the project  execution timeline than our expectations. DOD further stated that it is  unrealistic for DOD to develop detailed Work Breakdown Structures for  over 100 independent construction projects prior to any construction  project getting under way. Moreover, DOD states that it provides sufficient  information to support military construction decisions, and in cases where  Congress desires additional information on a particular project, it routinely  requests and receives that information.", "We continue to believe that our cost estimating guide provides a  consistent methodology that is based on best practices and that can be  used across the federal government\u2014including DOD\u2014for developing,  managing, and evaluating capital program cost estimates. Moreover, as  noted in our report, there is no Work Breakdown Structure to tie the cost  estimates and schedule together. A Work Breakdown Structure is the  cornerstone of every program because it defines in detail the work  necessary to accomplish a program\u2019s objectives, and it provides a  consistent framework for planning and assigning responsibility for the  work. Further, we do not state that DOD should develop detailed Work  Breakdown Structures for over 100 independent construction projects.  Rather, we state that DOD should have a unifying Work Breakdown  Structure to align the Guam Rainbow Chart\u2014DOD\u2019s program- management tool that summarizes detailed program inputs\u2014to the  schedule or the cost estimate. Per GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide, a Work  Breakdown Structure should be initially set up when the program is  established and becomes successively detailed over time as more  information becomes known about the program. In its response, DOD did  not dispute our findings and related recommendation that the revisions to  the Guam cost estimates should include risk and sensitivity analyses and  an independent cost estimate; we believe these revisions remain relevant  as well. We continue to believe that, without a revision of cost estimates  for Guam to include the best practices established by GAO\u2019s cost  estimating guide, decision makers in DOD and Congress will not have  reliable cost information to inform their funding decisions regarding  infrastructure for the Marine Corps relocation to Guam.", "Finally, DOD partially concurred with our eighth and ninth  recommendations that the Secretary of Defense direct the appropriate  entities to revise the DOD cost estimates for Hawaii and Australia to  address all best practices for the comprehensive characteristic  established by the GAO cost estimating guide, specifically to capture  entire life-cycle costs and develop a Work Breakdown Structure. In its  response, the department agreed that good cost estimating practices are  prudent for good decision making but did not agree that it should expend  effort to update its cost estimates for the Hawaii and Australia programs  due to reasons of timing, in the case of Hawaii, and international  agreements, in the case of Australia. Specifically, DOD stated that, for  Hawaii, high-level cost estimates are sufficient at this early planning stage  and a detailed Work Breakdown Structure is not needed. Moreover, in its  response, DOD stated that it disagrees with what constitutes the program  life cycle. DOD stated it believes that the program is complete when  forces move and occupy the new facilities. Regarding Australia cost  estimates, DOD stated in its response that the costs borne by DOD under  this program will be subject to international agreement rather than the  GAO cost estimating guide.", "Per GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, we are not  recommending a Work Breakdown Structure for specific construction  projects, but rather a Work Breakdown Structure that combines all of the  different projects involved in the overall program. We continue to believe  that DOD should develop a Work Breakdown Structure that lays out the  costs at a high level so that DOD can easily see and track  accomplishments. Then, as the program continues, DOD can add detail  to those areas of the Work Breakdown Structure when they are further  defined. Additionally,  life-cycle costing enhances decision making,  especially in early planning and concept formulation of acquisition. While  DOD notes that it incorporates best practices for minimizing facility  maintenance and sustainment costs into its construction costs, a full life- cycle cost estimate is important in budgetary decisions, key decision  points, milestone reviews, and investment decisions. Without considering  operations and support throughout the entire life cycle, DOD is not  considering all possible costs of what the facilities will cost over time. With  regard to Australia\u2019s cost estimate, costs could still be identified in a Work  Breakdown Structure and then later assigned to either the United States  or Australia. We continue to believe that revising cost estimates for  Hawaii and Australia to include all of the best practices established by  GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide for the comprehensive characteristic will  better enable decision makers in DOD and Congress to make informed  funding decisions and determine the viability of the relocation of Marines  to Hawaii and the establishment of a rotational presence in Australia.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and the Department  of State.

Also, the methodology used for both  reports is the same.", "For all objectives, we scoped our review to actions taken since GAO last  reviewed Marine Corps realignment initiatives in the Asia-Pacific region in  June 2013. We reviewed relevant policies and procedures, and collected  information by interviewing and communicating with officials from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Policy), the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), the Air Force, the Army, the Navy,  the Marine Corps, and the State Department. We also conducted site  visits in the following areas: Hawaii, where we met with Pacific Command  and its service components; Japan, where we met with U.S. Forces\u2013 Japan and the services, Marine Corps Installation Command Pacific, III  Marine Expeditionary Force, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, and the U.S.  Consulate on Okinawa, and observed infrastructure conditions in  Okinawa and Iwakuni; and Guam, where we met with DOD and  government of Guam officials, and observed infrastructure conditions and the buildup of Marine Corps Base Guam. Additionally,  we interviewed  DOD officials and officials from the U.S. Embassy in Australia. We also  met with DOD\u2019s construction agents, specifically the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers and the Naval Facilities Engineering Command.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has coordinated efforts and  resolved selected identified capability deficiencies related to the  relocation of Marines from Okinawa, we reviewed DOD documentation  and interviewed knowledgeable officials. Specifically, we reviewed  documentation such as the Marine Corps\u2019 Asia-Pacific Realignment  Synchronization Matrix;  capability documents such as bilateral  agreements between the United States and Japan or Australia as well as  training requirement documentation; and other documentation including  program management plans for the various locations supporting the  relocation. We reviewed capability deficiencies that were identified by  DOD through interviews. We compared DOD\u2019s decision-making process  for plans to resolve the identified capabilities to DOD Unified Facilities  Criteria regarding identifying  mission needs to determine land and facility  support requirements.", "To determine the extent that DOD has developed plans and schedules for  its relocation efforts and completed risk planning for its infrastructure, we  reviewed DOD guidance related to the development of installation plans,  integrated master schedules, and risk planning. We identified current  infrastructure plans and integrated master schedules. Specifically, we  assessed the Guam integrated master schedule to determine whether  this schedule reflects best practices needed to implement a program as  well as the extent to which projects and activities were properly  sequenced. GAO schedule specialists reviewed the Guam schedule and  compared it with best practices in GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide to  determine the extent to which it reflects 10 key schedule estimating  practices that are fundamental to having a reliable schedule. These  practices address whether the schedule (1) captured all activities, (2)  sequenced all activities, (3) assigned resources to all activities, (4)  established the duration of all activities, (5) can be traced horizontally and  vertically, (6) established a valid critical path, (7) identified reasonable  total float between activities, (8) identified a level of confidence using a  schedule risk analysis, (9) was updated using progress and logic to  determine dates, and (10) maintained a baseline schedule. To do so, we  independently assessed the program\u2019s integrated master schedule  compared to these 10 best practices and determined an assessment  rating for each best practice. Then we determined an overall assessment  rating for the 4 characteristics of a reliable schedule based on averages  of the 10 best practices. When the program office made updates to the  integrated master schedule, we conducted our review again to reflect  those updates. We also received two detailed construction project  schedules and assessed them for resource assignments. In addition, we  interviewed cognizant program officials to discuss their use of best  practices in creating the program\u2019s current schedule to better understand  how the schedule was constructed and maintained. Moreover, we  reviewed documentation and conducted interviews with DOD officials to  determine any identified risks to the schedule and actions DOD has taken  to address those risks. We compared DOD\u2019s risk-planning efforts outlined  in that documentation to DOD guidance on addressing risk, such as  guidance that identifies the characteristics needed in a risk-management  plan and guidance on how DOD plans for infrastructure sustainment in  base master plans.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has developed reliable cost  estimates for infrastructure for the relocation to Guam and Hawaii and for  the rotational presence in Australia, we reviewed DOD\u2019s cost estimates  and analyses and interviewed DOD and Department of State officials  about costs and funding sources related to infrastructure in locations  considered for relocation. GAO cost estimation specialists compared  those estimates and analyses to the best practices included in GAO\u2019s  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. We also reviewed the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Capital Programming Guide, and DOD\u2019s  guidance on Economic Analysis for Decision-making, which support our  best practices for developing reliable cost estimates. Specifically, GAO\u2019s  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies best practices that  represent work across the federal government and are the basis for a  high-quality, reliable cost estimate. A cost estimate created using best  practices exhibits four broad characteristics: accurate, well-documented,  credible, and comprehensive. In assessing program cost estimates for  Guam, GAO cost estimation specialists evaluated the Marine Corps  program office estimating methodologies, assumptions, and results to  determine whether the official cost estimates were comprehensive,  accurate, well-documented, and credible. As the basis of our assessment,  we used our GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide on estimating  program schedules and costs, which was developed based on extensive  research of cost estimating best practices. Our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide considers an estimate to be accurate if it is not overly  conservative, is based on an assessment of the most likely costs, and is  adjusted properly for inflation; comprehensive if its level of detail ensures  that all pertinent costs are included and no costs are double-counted or  omitted; well-documented if the estimate can be easily repeated or  updated and can be traced to original sources through auditing; and  credible if the estimate has been cross-checked with an independent cost  estimate and a level of uncertainty associated with the estimate has been  identified and quantified. We also interviewed the Marine Corps program  office\u2019s cost estimating team to obtain a detailed understanding of the  cost models provided, and met with Marine Corps headquarters, Marine  Corps Forces Pacific Command, and Naval Facilities Engineering  Command Pacific to understand their methodology, data, and approach in  developing their independent cost estimate (if applicable). In doing so, we  interviewed cognizant program officials, including the Program Manager  and cost analysis team, regarding their respective roles, responsibilities,  and actual efforts in developing and reviewing the cost estimate.", "In assessing program cost estimates for Hawaii and Australia, GAO cost  estimation specialists conducted a limited assessment focused on the  comprehensive characteristic because the estimates developed and  provided by DOD are early in the program life cycle (e.g., they are Rough  Order of Magnitude  estimates), and as such the information is immature  and inadequate to support a full analysis. Therefore, we chose to review  only the comprehensive characteristic because, according to GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, if the cost estimate is not  comprehensive then it cannot fully meet the well-documented, accurate,  or credible best practice characteristics. For instance, if the cost estimate  is missing some cost elements, then the documentation will be  incomplete, the estimate will be inaccurate, and the result will not be  credible due to the potential underestimating of costs and the lack of a full  risk and uncertainty analysis.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We determined an assessment rating for each of the 10 best practices,  and then determined an overall assessment rating for each characteristic  based on the ratings for the best practices within each characteristic in  table 5.
