As you know, disproportionately large  numbers of military veterans have appeared among the homeless  population in recent years, raising concerns about the incomes and  housing conditions of veterans who rent, rather than own, their homes.  According to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), on any given night  at least 194,000 veterans were homeless in fiscal year 2005\u2014about one- third of the adult homeless population\u2014and many veteran renters could  be on the verge of homelessness if they have low incomes or precarious  living conditions in overcrowded or substandard housing. The return of  more veterans from service in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014some with significant  physical and psychological challenges\u2014could increase demand for  affordable housing with supportive services such as mental health and  substance abuse treatment.", "The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is the primary  federal provider of rental housing assistance through its housing choice  voucher, public housing, and project-based programs. Vouchers assist  households in paying rent for units of their choice in the private market,  while public housing and project-based programs assist households by  subsidizing the rents of specifically designated units. These programs  generally serve low-income households\u2014those with incomes that are 80  percent or less of their local area median incomes. However, because the  rental assistance programs are not entitlement programs\u2014the extent of  assistance is limited by the amount of appropriated funds\u2014not all renter  households that are eligible receive assistance.

Using income categories established by HUD for calendar  year 2005, we estimated the number of veteran households in the ACS with  incomes that were low (80 percent or less of the area median income),  very low (50 percent or less of the area median income), and extremely  low (30 percent or less of the area median income). We also used  information on veteran households in ACS to describe certain  demographic characteristics, and the cost and quality of their housing. To  determine how HUD\u2019s rental assistance programs treat a household\u2019s  veteran status (that is, whether the household includes a veteran or not) in  determining eligibility and subsidy amounts, we reviewed HUD\u2019s eligibility  policies and regulations on rental assistance programs and interviewed  officials from HUD and VA. To determine whether public housing agencies  and property owners participating in HUD\u2019s programs have established a  veterans\u2019 preference for households, we interviewed officials from the 41  largest agencies that administer the public housing program and/or the  voucher program, and from the 13 largest performance-based contract  administrators that oversee property management under project-based  rental assistance programs. Information on preferences, however, is not  statistically generalizable to the other public housing agencies and  property owners. Finally, to determine the extent to which HUD\u2019s rental  assistance programs served veteran households in fiscal year 2005, we  matched data from HUD on program participants with data from VA on  living veterans and used these matched data to estimate the percentage of  low-income veteran renter households that received HUD assistance. For  all of our research objectives, we consulted with officials from various  housing and veteran groups.

The number of low-income veteran  renter households varied considerably by state, from a high of 236,000 in  California (representing 10 percent of all low-income veteran renters  nationwide) to less than 6,000 in Wyoming. While the percentages of renter  households that were low-income varied by state, in no state did the  proportion fall below 41 percent. In terms of demographic characteristics,  we found the following:    More than one-third of low-income veteran renter households included  a veteran who was elderly or had a disability.", "An estimated 1.3 million, or about 56 percent of low-income veteran  renter households, had housing affordability problems\u2014that is, their  rental costs exceeded 30 percent of their household incomes.

When determining  income eligibility and subsidy amounts, HUD generally does not  distinguish between income sources that are specific to veterans, such as  VA-provided benefits, and other sources of income; rather, HUD takes into  account the type of income, such as whether it is recurring or not. Finally,  although HUD rental assistance programs generally do not target veterans,  HUD allocated about 1,800 vouchers in the early 1990s for placing formerly  homeless veterans with severe psychiatric or substance abuse disorders  into affordable rental housing, but usage of these vouchers has been  declining\u2014as of the end of fiscal year 2006, about 1,000 vouchers  remained in use.", "The majority of the 41 largest public housing agencies we contacted have  no veterans\u2019 preference for admission to their public housing or voucher  programs, and all of the 13 largest performance-based contract  administrators we contacted told us that owners of project-based  properties that they oversee generally do not have a veterans\u2019 preference.

The two exclusions are identified in federal  statutes that are separate from those authorizing the three major rental  assistance programs.", "HUD does provide rental assistance vouchers specifically to veterans  under a small program called the Housing and Urban Development- Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program (HUD-VASH). Established in  1992, HUD-VASH is jointly funded by HUD and VA and offers homeless  veterans an opportunity to obtain permanent housing, as well as ongoing  case management and supportive services. HUD allocated these special  vouchers to selected public housing agencies that had applied for funding,  and VA was responsible for identifying participants based on specific  eligibility criteria, including the veteran\u2019s need for treatment of a mental  illness or substance abuse disorder. Under the HUD-VASH initiative, HUD  allocated 1,753 vouchers from fiscal years 1992 through 1994. HUD funded  these vouchers for 5 years and, if a veteran left the program during this  period, the housing agency had to reissue the voucher to another eligible  veteran. According to VA officials, after the 5-year period ended, housing  agencies had the option of continuing to use their allocation of vouchers  for HUD-VASH, or could discontinue participation whenever a veteran left  the program (that is, the housing agency would not provide the voucher to  another eligible veteran upon turnover). VA stated that after the 5-year  period ended, many housing agencies decided not to continue in HUD- VASH after assisted veterans left the program; instead, housing agencies  exercised the option of providing these vouchers to other households  under the housing choice voucher program. As a result, the number of  veterans that receive HUD-VASH vouchers has declined. Based on  information from VA, about 1,000 veterans were in the program as of the  end of fiscal year 2006, and absent any policy changes, this number is  likely to decline to 400 because housing agencies responsible for more  than 600 vouchers have decided not to continue providing these vouchers  to other veterans as existing participants leave the program.", "Congress statutorily authorized HUD-VASH as part of the Homeless  Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act of 2001.

Preferences  affect only the order of applicants on a waiting list for assistance; they do  not determine eligibility for housing assistance. Before 1998, federal law  required housing agencies and property owners to offer a preference to  eligible applicants to their subsidized housing programs who (1) had been  involuntarily displaced, (2) were living in substandard housing, or (3) were  paying more than half their income for rent. Public housing agencies were  required by law to allocate at least 50 percent of their public housing units  and 90 percent of their housing choice vouchers to applicants who met  these criteria. Similarly, project-based owners had to allocate 70 percent  of their units to newly admitted households that met these criteria. The  Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) gave more  flexibility to housing agencies and project-based property owners to  administer their programs, in part by eliminating the mandated housing  preferences.

HUD policy requires housing agencies to specify their preferences in their  administrative plans, and HUD reviews these preferences to ensure that  they conform to nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity  requirements. Similarly, HUD policy allows owners of project-based  properties to establish preferences as long as the preferences are specified  in their written tenant selection plans.

Similarly, of the 40 housing agencies  that administered the housing choice voucher program, 34 used admission  preferences, and 13 employed a preference for veterans.

Public housing  agencies that we contacted that did not offer a veterans\u2019 preference gave  various reasons for their decisions. Some officials told us that the housing  agency did not need a veterans\u2019 preference because veteran applicants  generally qualified under other preference categories, such as elderly or  disabled.

However, all the  contract administrators we contacted either said that property owners did  not use preferences or agreed that the use of preferences, including a  veterans\u2019 preference, among owners of properties with project-based  assistance was limited.
