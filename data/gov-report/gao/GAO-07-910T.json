Executive approvals of key acquisition documents are about 9 months late--due in part to the complexity of navigating three agencies' approval processes. Delays in finalizing these documents could hinder plans to complete contract negotiations by July 2007 and could keep the program from moving forward in fiscal year 2008 with a new program baseline. The program office has also made progress in establishing an effective management structure by adopting a new organizational framework with increased oversight from program executives and by instituting more frequent and rigorous program reviews; however, plans to reassign the recently appointed Program Executive Officer will likely increase the program's risks. Additionally, the program lacks a process and plan for identifying and filling staffing shortages, which has led to delays in key activities such as cost estimating and contract revisions. As of June 2007, key positions remain to be filled. Development and testing of major NPOESS segments--including key sensors and ground systems--are under way, but significant risks remain. For example, while work continues on key sensors, two of them--the visible/infrared imager radiometer suite and the cross-track infrared sounder--experienced significant problems and are considered high risk. Continued sensor problems could cause further cost increases and schedule delays. Additionally, while progress has been made in reducing delays in the data processing system, work remains in refining the algorithms needed to translate sensor observations into usable weather products.

These satellite  data are also the predominant input to numerical weather prediction  models, which are a primary tool for forecasting weather 3 or more  days in advance\u2014including forecasting the path and intensity of  hurricanes. The weather products and models are used to predict  the potential impact of severe weather so that communities and  emergency managers can help prevent and mitigate their effects.

NOAA and DOD share the costs of  funding NPOESS, while NASA funds specific technology projects  and studies. The NPOESS program office is overseen by an  Executive Committee, which is made up of the Administrators of  NOAA and NASA and the Under Secretary of the Air Force.", "NPOESS is a major system acquisition that was originally estimated  to cost about $6.5 billion over the 24-year life of the program from  its inception in 1995 through 2018. The program is to provide  satellite development, satellite launch and operation, and ground- based satellite data processing. These deliverables are grouped into  four main categories: (1) the space segment, which includes the  satellites and sensors; (2) the integrated data processing segment,  which is the system for transforming raw data into environmental  data records (EDR) and is to be located at four data processing  centers; (3) the command, control, and communications segment,  which includes the equipment and services needed to support  satellite operations; and (4) the launch segment, which includes  launch vehicle services.", "When the NPOESS engineering, manufacturing, and development  contract was awarded in August 2002, the cost estimate was  adjusted to $7 billion. Acquisition plans called for the procurement  and launch of six satellites over the life of the program, as well as  the integration of 13 instruments\u2014consisting of 10 environmental  sensors and 3 subsystems. Together, the sensors were to receive  and transmit data on atmospheric, cloud cover, environmental,  climatic, oceanographic, and solar-geophysical observations. The  subsystems were to support nonenvironmental search and rescue  efforts, sensor survivability, and environmental data collection  activities. The program office considered 4 of the sensors to be  critical because they provide data for key weather products; these  sensors are in bold in table 1, which describes each of the expected  NPOESS instruments.", "In addition, a demonstration satellite (called the NPOESS  Preparatory Project or NPP) was planned to be launched several  years before the first NPOESS satellite in order to reduce the risk  associated with launching new sensor technologies and to ensure  continuity of climate data with NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System  satellites. NPP is to host three of the four critical NPOESS sensors  (VIIRS, CrIS, and ATMS), as well as one other noncritical sensor  (OMPS). NPP is to provide the program office and the processing  centers an early opportunity to work with the sensors, ground  control, and data processing systems.", "When the NPOESS development contract was awarded, the  schedule for launching the satellites was driven by a requirement  that the satellites be available to back up the final POES and DMSP  satellites should anything go wrong during the planned launches of  these satellites.

In 2003, we  reported that changes in the NPOESS funding stream led the  program to develop a new program cost and schedule baseline.  After this new baseline was completed in 2004, we reported that the  program office increased the NPOESS cost estimate from about $7  billion to $8.1 billion; delayed key milestones, including the planned  launch of the first NPOESS satellite\u2014which was delayed by 7  months; and extended the life of the program from 2018 to 2020. At  that time, we also noted that other factors could further affect the  revised cost and schedule estimates. Specifically, the contractor was  not meeting expected cost and schedule targets on the new baseline  because of technical issues in the development of key sensors,  including the critical VIIRS sensor. Based on its performance  through May 2004, we estimated that the contractor would most  likely overrun its contract at completion in September 2011 by $500  million\u2014thereby increasing the projected life cycle cost to $8.6  billion. The program office\u2019s baseline cost estimate was  subsequently adjusted to $8.4 billion.", "In mid-November 2005, we reported that NPOESS continued to  experience problems in the development of a key sensor, resulting  in schedule delays and anticipated cost increases. At that time, we  projected that the program\u2019s cost estimate had grown to about $10  billion based on contractor cost and schedule data. We reported that  the program\u2019s issues were due, in part, to problems at multiple  levels of management\u2014including subcontractor, contractor,  program office, and executive leadership. Recognizing that the  budget for the program was no longer executable, the NPOESS  Executive Committee planned to make a decision in December 2005  on the future direction of the program\u2014what would be delivered, at  what cost, and by when. This involved deciding among options  involving increased costs, delayed schedules, and reduced  functionality. We noted that continued oversight, strong leadership,  and timely decision making were more critical than ever, and we  urged the committee to make a decision quickly so that the program  could proceed.", "However, we subsequently reported that, in late November 2005,  NPOESS cost growth exceeded a legislatively mandated threshold  that requires DOD to certify the program to Congress. This placed  any decision about the future direction of the program on hold until  the certification took place in June 2006.

In late November 2005, NPOESS exceeded the 25  percent threshold, and DOD was required to certify the program.  Certifying a program entailed providing a determination that (1) the  program is essential to national security, (2) there are no  alternatives to the program that will provide equal or greater  military capability at less cost, (3) the new estimates of the  program\u2019s cost are reasonable, and (4) the management structure  for the program is adequate to manage and control costs.

It also entailed using  NPOESS satellites in the early morning and afternoon orbits and  relying on European satellites for midmorning orbit data. Table 2  summarizes the major program changes made under the Nunn- McCurdy certification decision.", "The Nunn-McCurdy certification decision established new  milestones for the delivery of key program elements, including  launching NPP by January 2010, launching the first NPOESS  satellite (called C1) by January 2013, and launching the second  NPOESS satellite (called C2) by January 2016. These revised  milestones deviated from prior plans to have the first NPOESS  satellite available to back up the final POES satellite should  anything go wrong during that launch.", "Delaying the launch of the first NPOESS satellite means that if the  final POES satellite fails on launch, satellite data users would need  to rely on the existing constellation of environmental satellites until  NPP data become available\u2014almost 2 years later. Although NPP  was not intended to be an operational asset, NASA agreed to move  NPP to a different orbit so that its data would be available in the  event of a premature failure of the final POES satellite. However,  NPP will not provide all of the operational capability planned for the  NPOESS spacecraft. If the health of the existing constellation of  satellites diminishes\u2014or if NPP data are not available, timely, and  reliable\u2014then there could be a gap in environmental satellite data.  Table 3 summarizes changes in key program milestones over time.", "In order to reduce program complexity, the Nunn-McCurdy  certification decision decreased the number of NPOESS sensors  from 13 to 9 and reduced the functionality of 4 sensors. Specifically,  of the 13 original sensors, 5 sensors remain unchanged, 3 were  replaced with less capable sensors, 1 was modified to provide less  functionality, and 4 were cancelled.

As a result, the revised NPOESS system has  significantly less capability for providing global climate measures  than was originally planned. Specifically, the number of EDRs was  decreased from 55 to 39, of which 6 are of a reduced quality. The 39  EDRs that remain include cloud base height, land surface  temperature, precipitation type and rate, and sea surface winds. The  16 EDRs that were removed include cloud particle size and  distribution, sea surface height, net solar radiation at the top of the  atmosphere, and products to depict the electric fields in the space  environment.

Additionally, continued sensor  problems could lead to higher final program costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ground Segment\u2014Progress Has Been Made, but Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["Development of the ground segment\u2014which includes the interface  data processing system, the ground stations that are to receive  satellite data, and the ground-based command, control, and  communications system\u2014is under way and on track. However,  important work pertaining to developing the algorithms that  translate satellite data into weather products within the integrated  data processing segment remains to be completed. Table 6 describes  each of the components of the ground segment and identifies the  status of each.", "The NPOESS program office plans to continue to address risks  facing IDPS development. Specifically, the IDPS team is working to  reduce data processing delays by seeking to limit the number of data  calls, improve the efficiency of the data management system,  increase the efficiency of the algorithms, and increase the number of  processors. The program office also developed a resource center  consisting of a logical technical library, a data archive, and a set of  analytical tools to coordinate, communicate, and facilitate the work  of algorithm subject matter experts on algorithm development and  calibration/validation preparations. Managing the risks associated  with the development of the IDPS system is of particular importance  because this system will be needed to process NPP data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of GAO Recommendations Should Reduce Program Risks", "paragraphs": ["Because of the importance of effectively managing the NPOESS  program to ensure that there are no gaps in the continuity of critical  weather and environmental observations, in our accompanying  report we made recommendations to the Secretaries of Defense  and Commerce and to the Administrator of NASA to ensure that the  responsible executives within their respective organizations  approve key acquisition documents, including the memorandum of  agreement among the three agencies, the system engineering plan,  the test and evaluation master plan, and the acquisition strategy, as  quickly as possible but no later than April 30, 2007. We also  recommended that the Secretary of Defense direct the Air Force to  delay reassigning the recently appointed Program Executive Officer  until all sensors have been delivered to the NPOESS Preparatory  Program; these deliveries are currently scheduled to occur by July  2008. We also made two additional recommendations to the  Secretary of Commerce to (1) develop and implement a written  process for identifying and addressing human capital needs and for  streamlining how the program handles the three different agencies\u2019  administrative procedures and (2) establish a plan for immediately  filling needed positions.", "In written comments, all three agencies agreed that it was important  to finalize key acquisition documents in a timely manner, and DOD  proposed extending the due dates for the documents to July 2, 2007.  Because the NPOESS program office intends to complete contract  negotiations by July 4, 2007, we remain concerned that any further  delays in approving the documents could delay contract  negotiations and thus increase the risk to the program.", "In addition, the Department of Commerce agreed with our  recommendation to develop and implement a written process for  identifying and addressing human capital needs and to streamline  how the program handles the three different agencies\u2019  administrative procedures. The department also agreed with our  recommendation to plan to immediately fill open positions at the  NPOESS program office. Commerce noted that NOAA identified the  skill sets needed for the program and has implemented an  accelerated hiring model and schedule to fill all NOAA positions in  the NPOESS program. Commerce also noted that NOAA has made  NPOESS hiring a high priority and has documented a strategy\u2014 including milestones\u2014to ensure that all NOAA positions are filled  by June 2007.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation to delay reassigning  the Program Executive Officer, noting that the NPOESS System  Program Director responsible for executing the acquisition program  would remain in place for 4 years. The Department of Commerce  also noted that the Program Executive Officer position is planned to  rotate between the Air Force and NOAA. Commerce also stated that  a selection would be made before the departure of the current  Program Executive Officer to provide an overlap period to allow for  knowledge transfer and ensure continuity. However, over the last  few years, we and others (including an independent review team  and the Commerce Inspector General) have reported that ineffective  executive-level oversight helped foster the NPOESS program\u2019s cost  and schedule overruns. We remain concerned that reassigning the  Program Executive at a time when NPOESS is still facing critical  cost, schedule, and technical challenges will place the program at  further risk.", "In addition, while it is important that the System Program Director  remain in place to ensure continuity in executing the acquisition,  this position does not ensure continuity in the functions of the  Program Executive Officer. The current Program Executive Officer  is experienced in providing oversight of the progress, issues, and  challenges facing NPOESS and coordinating with Executive  Committee members as well as the Defense acquisition authorities.  Additionally, while the Program Executive Officer position is  planned to rotate between agencies, the memorandum of agreement  documenting this arrangement is still in draft and should be flexible  enough to allow the current Program Executive Officer to remain  until critical risks have been addressed.", "Further, while Commerce plans to allow a period of overlap  between the selection of a new Program Executive Officer and the  departure of the current one, time is running out. The current  Program Executive Officer is expected to depart in early July 2007,  and as of early June 2007, a successor has not yet been named.  NPOESS is an extremely complex acquisition, involving three  agencies, multiple contractors, and advanced technologies. There is  not sufficient time to transfer knowledge and develop the sound  professional working relationships that the new Program Executive  Officer will need to succeed in that role. Thus, we remain convinced  that given NPOESS current challenges, reassigning the current  Program Executive Officer at this time would not be appropriate.", "In summary, NPOESS restructuring is well under way, and the  program has made progress in establishing an effective management  structure. However, key steps remain in restructuring the  acquisition, including completing important acquisition documents  such as the system engineering plan, the acquisition program  baseline, and the memorandum of agreement documenting the three  agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities. Until these key documents are  finalized, the program is unable to finalize plans for restructuring  the program. Additionally, the program office continues to have  difficulty filling key positions and lacks a programwide staffing  process. Until the program establishes an effective and repeatable  staffing process, it will have difficulties in identifying and filling its  staffing needs in a timely manner. Having insufficient staff in key  positions impedes the program office\u2019s ability to conduct important  management and oversight activities, including revising cost and  schedule estimates, monitoring progress, and managing technical  risks. The program faces even further challenges if DOD proceeds  with plans to reassign the Program Executive Officer this summer.  Such a move would add unnecessary risk to an already risky  program.", "In addition, the likelihood exists that there will be further cost  increases and schedule delays because of technical problems on key  sensors and pending contract negotiations. Major program  segments\u2014including the space and ground segments\u2014are making  progress in their development and testing. However, two critical  sensors have experienced problems and are considered high risk,  and risks remain in developing and implementing the ground-based  data processing system. Given the tight time frames for completing  key sensors, integrating them, and getting the ground-based data  processing systems developed, tested, and deployed, continued  close oversight of milestones and risks is essential to minimize  potential cost increases and schedule delays.", "Mr. Chairmen, this concludes my statement.
