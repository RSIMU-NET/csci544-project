The 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed stated that they generally supported one of the following scenarios for restructuring the immigration court system, all of which would require a statutory change to implement:", "a court system outside of the executive branch to replace EOIR's immigration court system, including both trial and appellate tribunals;", "a new, independent administrative agency within the executive branch to carry out EOIR's quasi-judicial functions with both trial-level immigration judges and an appellate level review board; or", "a hybrid approach, placing trial-level immigration judges in an independent administrative agency within the executive branch, and an appellate-level tribunal outside of the executive branch.", "Six of the 10 experts and stakeholders GAO interviewed supported restructuring the immigration court system into a court independent of the executive branch. Experts and stakeholders offered several reasons for each of the proposed scenarios, such as potentially improving workforce professionalism and credibility. They also provided reasons against restructuring options, including that restructuring may not resolve existing management challenges, such as difficulties related to hiring immigration judges.", "GAO also reported in June 2017 that EOIR could take several actions to address management challenges. EOIR has since taken some steps to address these challenges, but additional actions are needed. For example, GAO found that EOIR did not have efficient practices for hiring immigration judges, which contributed to judges being staffed below authorized levels. EOIR hiring data showed that on average from February 2014 through August 2016, EOIR took more than 21 months to hire an immigration judge. GAO recommended that EOIR assess the immigration judge hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency. As of January 2018, EOIR had increased the number of its judges but remained below its authorized level for fiscal year 2017. Hiring additional judges is a positive step; however, to fully address GAO's recommendation, EOIR needs to assess its hiring process to identify opportunities for efficiency.", "In June 2017, GAO also reported on ways EOIR could enhance its video teleconferencing (VTC) program, through which judges conduct hearings by VTC. GAO found that EOIR had not, in accordance with best practices, established a mechanism to solicit feedback and comments about VTC from those who use it regularly to assess whether it meets user needs. GAO recommended EOIR develop and implement such a mechanism. EOIR concurred and implemented this recommendation in December 2017 by establishing a mechanism on its public website to solicit feedback from respondents regarding their satisfaction with VTC hearings. This effort should help EOIR ensure VTC hearings it conducts meet all user needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its June 2017 report GAO made 11 recommendations to improve EOIR's hiring process and performance assessment, among other things. EOIR generally concurred with the recommendations, has implemented 1, and reported actions planned or underway to address the remaining 10."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on expert and  stakeholder proposals for restructuring the immigration court system and  management challenges facing the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ)  Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). As you know, EOIR is  responsible for conducting immigration court proceedings, appellate  reviews, and administrative hearings to fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly  administer and interpret U.S. immigration laws and regulations. Each  year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiates hundreds of  thousands of cases with the U.S. immigration court system to decide  whether respondents\u2014foreign nationals charged on statutory grounds of  inadmissibility or deportability\u2014are removable as charged; and, if so,  should be ordered removed from the United States or granted any  requested relief or protection from removal and permitted to lawfully  remain in the country.", "A significant and growing case backlog\u2014the number of cases pending at  the start of each fiscal year\u2014before the immigration courts has been the  subject of attention by Congress, immigration court experts and  stakeholders, and others. In June 2017, we reported that the immigration  courts\u2019 case backlog more than doubled from fiscal years 2006 through  2015, reaching a backlog of about 437,000 cases pending in 2015.  Further, our analysis showed that initial case completion time increased  more than fivefold over this 10-year period. For example, the median  number of days to complete a removal case, which comprised 97 percent  of EOIR\u2019s caseload for this time period, increased by 700 percent from 42  days in fiscal year 2006 to 336 days in fiscal year 2015. Since we  completed our work, DOJ has indicated that the case backlog remains a  challenge. For example, a December 2017 memorandum from the  Attorney General indicated that there were well above a half million cases  pending before the immigration courts.", "To address the case backlog and other challenges, various organizations,  such as the American Bar Association, have recommended, among other  things, management improvements; incremental reform of the  immigration courts within the existing EOIR structure; and major structural  changes, such as creating an immigration court system independent of  any executive branch department or agency. Experts and stakeholders,  such as individuals affiliated with professional legal organizations and  former EOIR immigration judges, have also proposed changing the  immigration court system\u2019s structure, organizational location among the  three branches of government, and aspects of its operations.", "EOIR\u2019s quasi-judicial functions are carried out by the immigration court  system, which includes 58 immigration courts located nationwide that are  overseen by the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge, whose  immigration judges preside over removal proceedings to determine  respondents\u2019 removability and eligibility for any relief being sought, and  the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), whose members hear and issue  decisions regarding appeals of immigration judges\u2019 decisions and certain  DHS decisions. Additionally, the Office of the Chief Administrative  Hearing Officer adjudicates immigration-related employment and  document fraud cases.", "In June 2017, we reported on, among other things, (1) scenarios that  experts and stakeholders have proposed for restructuring EOIR\u2019s  immigration court system and the reasons they offered for or against  these proposals; and (2) how EOIR manages and oversees immigration  court operations, including workforce planning, hiring, performance  assessment, and technology utilization. This statement summarizes information on immigration court restructuring and EOIR\u2019s management  of the immigration courts from that report as well as actions EOIR has  taken, as of April 2018, to address resulting recommendations for  addressing management challenges.", "For the June 2017 report, we identified scenarios that experts and  stakeholders have proposed for restructuring the immigration court  system and their reasons for or against these proposals. To identify these  scenarios, we reviewed publications and interviewed individuals affiliated  with eight entities and two former immigration judges, all selected based  on their expertise in immigration court issues. In selecting these 10  experts and stakeholders, we considered, among other things, their depth  of experience with the immigration court system and the relevance of their  published work to immigration court restructuring. We also considered  input from our identified experts and stakeholders, as well as EOIR, on  any additional experts or stakeholders we should interview. To ensure a  diversity of perspectives regarding proposed scenarios for restructuring  the immigration court system, we selected experts and stakeholders from  a variety of organizations, including federal agencies, immigration lawyer  and respondent advocacy groups and individuals, and the immigration  judges\u2019 union.", "To assess EOIR\u2019s workforce planning, hiring, performance assessment,  and technology utilization, we analyzed relevant documentation, such as  contracts for workforce planning services; EOIR data on, among other  things, immigration judge hiring; and interviewed EOIR and DHS officials  from headquarters and six immigration courts. More detailed information  on our objectives, scope, and methodology is contained in our June 2017  report. Additionally, after the issuance of our report through April 2018 we  obtained and analyzed information and documentation on actions EOIR  has taken to address our recommendations. The work upon which this  statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

Two of the experts and stakeholders we contacted  supported a new independent administrative agency within the executive  branch. One of the experts and stakeholders supported the hybrid  scenario, placing trial-level immigration judges in an independent,  administrative agency within the executive branch, and an appellate-level  tribunal outside of the executive branch.", "As we reported in June 2017, experts and stakeholders offered several  reasons for each of the proposed scenarios, such as potentially  increasing judicial autonomy over courtrooms and dockets; as well as  provided reasons against restructuring options, such as that restructuring  may not resolve existing management challenges. These reasons for and  against each of the scenarios are summarized in table 1 and discussed  further below. We are not taking a position on any of these restructuring  proposals, or on any of the reasons offered for or against them. We  present the information we obtained from the experts and stakeholders to  inform policymakers about proposals that have been put forth regarding  restructuring the immigration court system.", "We found in our June 2017 report that experts and stakeholders we  interviewed cited several reasons for the proposed restructuring  scenarios, as described in table 1 and below.", "Independence: Six of the 10 experts and stakeholders we  interviewed stated that establishing a court system independent (i.e.,  outside) of the executive branch could increase the perceived  independence of the system. For example, 1 of the 10 experts and  stakeholders we interviewed explained that the public\u2019s perception of  the immigration court system\u2019s independence might improve with a  restructuring that removes the quasi-judicial functions of the  immigration courts and the BIA from DOJ, because DOJ is also  responsible for representing the government in appeals to the U.S.  Circuit Courts of Appeals by individuals seeking review of final orders  of removal. Another 1 of the 10 experts and stakeholders we  interviewed explained that under the existing immigration court  system, respondents may perceive, due to the number of immigration  judges who are former DHS attorneys and the co-location of some  immigration courts with DHS U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement\u2019s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor offices, that  immigration judges and DHS attorneys are working together. Two of  the 10 experts and stakeholders we interviewed also proposed that an  immigration court system independent of the executive branch would  be less susceptible to political pressures within the executive branch.  Experts and stakeholders cited similar independence-related reasons  for supporting the administrative agency and hybrid scenarios.", "Judicial autonomy: Four of the 10 experts and stakeholders we  interviewed stated that a court system independent of the executive  branch might give immigration judges and BIA members more judicial  autonomy over their courtrooms and dockets. For example, 1 of the  10 experts and stakeholders we interviewed stated that immigration  judges in an independent court system would be able to file  complaints against private bar attorneys directly with the state bar  authority instead of filing the complaint with DOJ first, as required for  immigration judges acting in their official capacity. EOIR officials  explained that while immigration judges cannot directly file a  complaint with the state bar authority, EOIR\u2019s Disciplinary Counsel,  which is charged with investigating these complaints, can file a  complaint with the state bar on behalf of the immigration judge.", "Workforce professionalism or credibility: Experts and stakeholders  also stated reasons why a court system independent of the executive  branch might also improve the professionalism or credibility of the  immigration court system\u2019s workforce. For example, 1 of the 10  experts and stakeholders we interviewed explained that if the judge  career path was improved under a restructuring such that immigration  judges were able to advance to more prestigious judgeships, this  could assist in attracting candidates to the immigration bench.  Regarding the hybrid scenario, 1 of the 10 experts and stakeholders  we interviewed noted that this proposal may attract a more diverse  and balanced pool of candidates for immigration judge positions.", "Organizational capacity or accountability: Experts and  stakeholders who supported a court system independent of the  executive branch also cited enhanced organizational capacity or  accountability as a reason for adopting this scenario. One of the 10  experts and stakeholders we interviewed explained that this type of  restructuring may allow the immigration court system to improve its  organizational capacity by changing the way it staffs its managerial  and supervisory positions. For example, this individual explained that  instead of placing immigration judges in managerial positions, EOIR  could, as an independent court system, more easily attract and fill  managerial positions with individuals who have experience in court  management and public administration instead of placing immigration  judges in these positions. Similarly, this same individual also noted  that if the restructured immigration court system was placed within the  purview of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which provides  a wide range of support services to the federal judiciary (including  administrative, technological and legal services), it could use its  expertise in court management to assist with managing the system.", "In terms of enhancing organizational accountability, 1 of the 10 experts  and stakeholders we interviewed explained that an independent court  system could also increase the transparency of the performance  evaluation system for immigration judges by incorporating feedback from  court stakeholders, such as DHS and private bar attorneys, on the judges\u2019  performance as well as increasing the transparency of the process for  making complaints against immigration judges. According to this  individual, the complaint process for other federal judges is more  transparent and the judges are given an opportunity to address the  complaint and appeal any decisions that resulted from the complaint.", "We also found in our June 2017 report that the experts and stakeholders  we interviewed cited several reasons against the proposed restructuring  scenarios, as described in table 1 and below.", "Appointment of immigration judges: Two of the 10 experts and  stakeholders we interviewed noted that requiring the presidential  nomination and Senate confirmation of immigration judges under an  independent court system could further complicate and delay the  hiring of new judges by making the appointment of additional judges  more dependent on external parties.", "Administrative challenges: Two of the 10 experts and stakeholders  we interviewed stated that it may be difficult to establish and  administer a court system independent of the executive branch.  Specifically, these experts and stakeholders expressed concern that  the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts may be reluctant to  assume the vast responsibility of administering a newly created court  system. Regarding administrative challenges associated with the  establishment of an independent administrative agency, 1 of the 10  experts and stakeholders we interviewed explained that this scenario  might be overly complicated to implement since EOIR would need to  develop its own administrative functions outside of DOJ. According to  another 1 of the 10 experts and stakeholders we interviewed, creating  a hybrid court system may further complicate the administration of the  immigration court system and potentially result in difficulties for  respondents.", "Procurement of resources: Five of the 10 experts and stakeholders  we interviewed expressed the concern that a restructured immigration  court system, regardless of the scenario, would not be able to procure  sufficient resources outside of DOJ. For example, 1 of the 10 experts  and stakeholders noted that a restructured independent court or  administrative agency might have less leverage outside of DOJ to  compete for resources.", "Trial level disconnection from the appellate level: One of the 10  experts and stakeholders we interviewed stated that if the hybrid  scenario were to be adopted, the trial level may become more  disconnected from the appellate level, due to the placement of the  immigration courts within the executive branch and the appellate body  outside of the executive branch.", "Resolution of existing management challenges or case backlog:  Two of the 10 experts and stakeholders we contacted stated that a  court system independent of the executive branch may not address  the immigration courts\u2019 management challenges, such as the case  backlog. For example, 1 of the 10 experts and stakeholders stated  that the immigration court system would likely have a large caseload  regardless of how it is structured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EOIR Has Initiated Actions to Improve Its Management of the Immigration Courts, but Additional Steps Are Needed to Address Long- Standing Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We also reported in June 2017 that EOIR could take several actions to  address long-standing management and operational challenges and  reduce the case backlog. In particular, we identified challenges related to,  and made 11 recommendations to improve, EOIR\u2019s workforce planning,  hiring, performance assessment, and technology utilization. EOIR  generally concurred with our recommendations, and, has initiated actions  to address them. Overall, EOIR has fully implemented 1 recommendation  but needs to take additional steps to fully implement the remaining 10  recommendations to help strengthen the agency\u2019s management and help  reduce the case backlog.", "Workforce Planning. In June 2017, we reported that EOIR could help  address its case backlog and staffing challenges, such as by hiring more  immigration judges to meet its authorized number of judges and through  better workforce planning and hiring practices. During the course of our  review we found that EOIR estimated staffing needs using an informal  approach that did not account for long-term staffing needs, reflect EOIR\u2019s  performance goals, or account for differences in the complexity of court  cases. For example, in developing its staffing estimate, EOIR did not  calculate staffing needs beyond the next fiscal year or take into account  resources needed to achieve the agency\u2019s case completion goals.", "Furthermore, we found that, according to EOIR data, approximately 39  percent of all immigration judges were eligible to retire as of June 2017,  but EOIR had not systematically accounted for these impending  retirements in its staffing estimate.", "At the time of our review, EOIR had begun to take steps to account for  long-term staffing needs, such as by initiating a workforce planning report  and a study on the time it takes court staff to complete key activities.  However, we found that these efforts did not align with key principles of  strategic workforce planning that would help EOIR better address current  and future staffing needs. EOIR officials also stated that the agency had  begun to develop a strategic plan for fiscal years 2018 through 2023 that  could address its human capital needs. We recommended that EOIR  develop and implement a strategic workforce plan that addresses key  principles of strategic workforce planning.", "EOIR agreed with our recommendation. In February 2018, EOIR officials  told us that they had established a committee and working group to  examine the agency\u2019s workforce needs and would include workforce  planning as a key component in EOIR\u2019s forthcoming strategic plan.  Specifically, EOIR officials stated that the agency had established the  Immigration Court Staffing Committee in April 2017 to examine how to  best leverage its existing judicial and court staff workload model to  address its short- and long-term staffing needs, assess the critical skills  and competencies needed to achieve future programmatic results, and  develop strategies to address human capital gaps, among other things. In  February 2018, EOIR officials stated that the agency replaced this  committee, which had completed its work, with a smaller working group of  human resource employees charged with addressing the agency\u2019s  strategic workforce planning. Additionally, EOIR officials stated that the  agency was developing a strategic plan that includes human capital  planning as a critical component, which will be used to guide workforce  planning for the agency. These are positive steps, but to fully address our  recommendation, EOIR needs to continue to develop, and then  implement a strategic workforce plan that: (1) addresses the agency\u2019s  short- and long-term staffing needs; (2) identifies the critical skills and  competencies needed to achieve future programmatic results; and (3)  includes strategies to address human capital gaps. Once this strategic  workforce plan is completed, EOIR needs to monitor and evaluate the  agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital goals.", "Hiring. Additionally, in our June 2017 report, we found that EOIR did not  have efficient practices for hiring new immigration judges, which has  contributed to immigration judges being staffed below authorized levels  and to staffing shortfalls. For example, in fiscal year 2016, EOIR was  allocated 374 immigration judge positions and had 289 judges on board  at the end of the fiscal year. EOIR officials attributed these gaps to  delays in the hiring process. Our analysis of EOIR hiring data supported  their conclusion. Specifically, we found that from February 2014 through  August 2016, EOIR took an average of 647 days to hire an immigration  judge\u2014more than 21 months. As a result, we recommended that EOIR  (1) assess the immigration judge hiring process to identify opportunities  for efficiency; (2) use the assessment results to develop a hiring strategy  that targets short- and long-term human capital needs; and (3) implement  any corrective actions related to the hiring process resulting from this  assessment.", "In response to our report, EOIR stated that it concurred with our  recommendation and was implementing a new hiring plan as announced  by the Attorney General in April 2017 intended to streamline hiring.  Among other things, EOIR stated that the new hiring plan sets clear  deadlines for assessing applicants moving through different stages of the  process and for making decisions on advancing applicants to the next  stage, and allows for temporary appointments for selected judges  pending full background investigations. In February 2018, EOIR indicated  to us that it had begun to use the process outlined in its hiring plan to fill  judge vacancies. The Attorney General also announced in April 2017 that  the agency would commit to hire an additional 50 judges in 2018 and 75  additional judges in 2019. In January 2018, EOIR officials told us that the  agency had a total of 330 immigration judges, an increase of 41 judges  since September 2016. Hiring these additional judges is a positive step;  however, EOIR remains below its fiscal year 2017 authorized level of 384  immigration judges based on funding provided in fiscal years 2016 and  2017. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided  funding for EOIR to hire at least 100 additional immigration judge teams,  including judges and supporting staff, with a goal of fielding 484  immigration judge teams nationwide by 2019. To fully address our  recommendation, EOIR will need to continue to improve its hiring process  by (1) assessing the prior hiring process to identify opportunities for  efficiency; (2) developing a hiring strategy targeting short- and long-term  human capital needs; and (3) implementing corrective actions in response  to the results of its assessment of the hiring process.", "Performance Assessment. Regarding EOIR\u2019s performance assessment,  we reported in June 2017 that EOIR had previously established  performance monitoring activities and measures to assess aspects of the  immigration courts, but it had eliminated several of these performance  assessment mechanisms. EOIR also had goals for some cases it  adjudicated, such as respondents in detention, but no longer had goals  for most cases, including some cases it had prioritized for adjudication.  For example, we found that EOIR did not have performance measures or  goals for completing cases in which the respondent is not detained (non- detained cases), which comprised 83 percent of immigration courts\u2019 total  caseload from fiscal year 2010 through fiscal year 2015. To help EOIR  more effectively monitor its performance and fully evaluate whether the  immigration courts are achieving EOIR\u2019s mission, we recommended that  EOIR establish and monitor comprehensive case completion goals,  including a goal for completing non-detained cases not captured by  performance measures, and goals for cases it considers a priority.", "EOIR agreed with this recommendation and has taken steps to address it.  For example, EOIR issued guidance in January 2018 to all immigration  court staff that established the agency\u2019s goals for each immigration court  in adjudicating cases. In particular, EOIR identified in this guidance a  case completion goal for non-detained cases: courts must complete 85  percent of all non-detained removal cases that do not qualify as a \u201cstatus  case\u201d within 1 year of filing of the Notice to Appear (NTA) in court,  reopening or recalendaring of the case, remand from the Board of  Immigration Appeals, or notification of release from custody. According  to this guidance, EOIR has also retained case completion goals for other  categories it considers a priority, such as cases in which the respondent  is detained and credible fear reviews. In its January 2018 guidance,  EOIR stated that it will track these measures and the courts\u2019 performance  in meeting them as well as regularly auditing these measures. To fully  address this recommendation, EOIR needs to monitor courts\u2019  performance in meeting these goals.", "In June 2017, we also reported that EOIR collected information on the  extent and reasons why immigration judges issue continuances\u2014 temporary adjournments of case proceedings until a different day or  time\u2014but did not systematically assess these data to identify and  address potential operational challenges affecting the immigration courts  or areas where immigration judges could benefit from additional guidance  or training. An immigration judge may continue a case for good cause  shown, such as to allow respondents to obtain legal representation or  DHS to complete required background investigations and security checks. Our analysis of continuance records from fiscal year 2006  through fiscal year 2015 showed that the use of continuances had grown  over time. Specifically, all types of continuances increased by 23 percent  from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2015 and operational  continuances, such as those caused by a lack of foreign language  interpretation or a video-teleconference (VTC) malfunction, increased by  33 percent over this same time period. We recommended that EOIR  systematically analyze immigration court continuance data to identify and  address any operational challenges faced by courts or areas for  additional guidance or training.", "EOIR agreed with this recommendation and, in July 2017, issued updated  guidance for immigration judges on fair and efficient docket management  relating to the use of continuances. For instance, according to this  guidance, judges must annotate the case worksheet on disposition of the  case with a continuance code describing the reason for the continuance  and court staff must ensure that each continuance code is accurately  entered into the agency\u2019s case management system for all cases. EOIR  also issued guidance in October 2017 updating case continuance codes  and their definitions to assist immigration judges in recording this  information on the case worksheet. These are positive steps, and  analyzing the use of continuances on a systematic basis would give EOIR  greater insight into more widespread operational issues that the courts  may be facing. To fully address our recommendation, EOIR will need to  systematically analyze immigration court continuance data to identify and  address any operational challenges faced by courts or areas for  additional guidance or training.", "We also reported in June 2017 that EOIR could improve the reliability of  its case management data and reports on case completion times by  ensuring that court staff accurately record NTAs in a timely manner. We  found that EOIR did not have guidance or data integrity efforts to ensure  the timely and accurate recording of NTAs in its case management  system, and that at least 16 percent of NTA dates were unreliable. EOIR  uses NTA dates to calculate case completion times, which are used to  assess court performance. The agency reports this information publicly in  DOJ\u2019s Annual Performance Report. We concluded that improving the  reliability of NTA data would allow EOIR to provide more accurate  information on case completion times to Congress and the public. We  recommended that EOIR update its policies and procedures to promote  the timely and accurate recording of NTAs. In response to our report,  EOIR stated that it partially concurred with our recommendation and  stated that it would continue to monitor the timeliness and accuracy of  NTA recording, and implement corrective actions as needed. In January  2018, as part of its policy on case completion goals, EOIR also created a  goal that 100 percent of all electronic and paper records be accurate and  complete. This goal is a positive step, and updating policies and  procedures to remind staff about the importance of timely and accurate  recording of all NTAs would provide EOIR greater assurance that this  goal could be consistently met. To fully address our recommendation,  EOIR will need to update its policies and procedures to ensure the timely  and accurate recording of NTAs.", "Technology Utilization. We also made several recommendations to  EOIR in our June 2017 report to improve its technology utilization,  including the agency\u2019s oversight of the ongoing development of a  comprehensive electronic-filing (e-filing) capability\u2014a means of  transmitting documents and other information to immigration courts  through an electronic medium, rather than on paper. EOIR identified the  implementation of an e-filing system as a goal in 2001, but has not, as of  April 2018, fully implemented this system. In 2001, EOIR issued an  executive staff briefing for an e-filing system that stated that only through  a fully electronic case management and filing system would the agency  be able to accomplish its goals. This briefing also cited several benefits  of an e-filing system, including, among other things, reducing the data- entry, filing, and other administrative tasks associated with processing  paper case files; and improving communication with external court  stakeholders, such as respondents and attorneys, providing the ability to  file court documents from private home and office computers. As we  reported in June 2017, EOIR initiated a comprehensive e-filing effort in  2016\u2014the EOIR Court and Appeals System (ECAS)\u2014for which EOIR  had documented policies and procedures governing how its primary  ECAS oversight body\u2014the ECAS Executive Committee\u2014would oversee  ECAS through the development of a proposed ECAS solution. However,  we found that EOIR had not yet designated an entity to oversee ECAS  after selection of a proposed solution during critical stages of its  development and implementation.", "In our June 2017 report, we recommended that in order to help ensure  EOIR meets its cost and schedule expectations for ECAS, the agency  identify and establish the appropriate entity to oversee ECAS through full  implementation. EOIR concurred and stated that it had selected and  convened the EOIR Investment Review Board to serve as the ECAS  oversight body with the Office of Information Technology directly  responsible for the management of the ECAS program. EOIR officials told  us in February 2018 that the board convened in October 2017 and  January 2018 to discuss, among other things, the ECAS program.  However, as we reported in June 2017, EOIR officials previously told us  that the EOIR Investment Review Board was never intended to oversee  ECAS implementation due to the detailed nature of this system\u2019s  implementation. EOIR has recently provided us with documentation  related to its oversight of ECAS, which we are reviewing to help  determine the extent to which EOIR has met the intent of our  recommendation. Additionally, we recommended in June 2017 EOIR  develop and implement a plan that is consistent with best practices for  overseeing ECAS to better position the agency to identify and address  any risks and implement ECAS in accordance with its cost, schedule, and  operational expectations. As of April 2018, EOIR has not indicated that it  has developed such a plan.", "In June 2017 we also reported on ways EOIR could enhance its VTC  program. EOIR is authorized by statute to hold immigration removal  proceedings through VTC. According to EOIR officials, EOIR largely  uses VTC for hearings for detained individuals, including both master  calendar and individual merits hearings. We reported in June 2017 that  officials from all six of the immigration courts we visited identified  challenges related to VTC hearings, including difficulties maintaining  connectivity, hearing respondents, exchanging paper documents,  conducting accurate foreign language interpretation, and assessing the  demeanor and credibility of respondents and witnesses. We further found  that EOIR had not, in accordance with best practices, (1) evaluated its  VTC program to ensure that it is outcome-neutral, or (2) established a  mechanism to solicit feedback and comments about VTC from those who  use it regularly to assess whether it meets user needs.", "Therefore, we recommended that EOIR take three actions to provide  further assurances that its use of VTC in immigration hearings is  outcome-neutral, including that it collect more complete and reliable data  related to its VTC use (e.g., the number of hearings it conducts by VTC)  and use the data to assess any effects of VTC on immigration hearings.  EOIR partially concurred with these actions and has since taken some  steps to implement these recommendations, such as piloting a project to  collect data on respondent appeals related to the use of VTC in their  cases. Additionally, EOIR officials told us in August 2017 that the agency  is studying how to collect more complete and reliable data on the number  and type of hearings it conducts through VTC and use these and other  data to assess any effects of VTC on immigration hearings.", "We also recommended that EOIR develop and implement a mechanism  to solicit and monitor feedback from respondents regarding their  satisfaction and experiences with VTC hearings. EOIR concurred and  implemented this recommendation in December 2017 by establishing a  mechanism on its public website to solicit open-ended feedback from  respondents regarding their satisfaction with VTC hearings, including the  audio and visual quality of the hearing. According to EOIR officials, a  group of individuals within EOIR\u2019s Office of the Chief Immigration Judge is  responsible for monitoring and addressing feedback received through this  portal. These efforts should help EOIR ensure VTC hearings it conducts  meet all user needs and identify and address technical issues with VTC  hearings.", "Chairman Cornyn and Ranking Member Durbin, this completes my  prepared statement.
