Recently, DOD's leadership role in fostering innovation has been supplanted by the commercial sector. This has changed DOD's approach to technology development by relying more on commercial innovation.", "Conference Report 112-329 included a provision for GAO to review DOD's S&T enterprise. This report assesses (1) the practices leading companies employ to manage technology development and (2) the extent to which DOD can incorporate these practices into its own. GAO interviewed eight large, profitable, leading technology companies (Amazon, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, General Motors, IBM, Qualcomm, Siemens AG, and Valvoline) to identify practices they used to manage, prioritize, and assess their technology portfolios. GAO also met with DOD organizations that manage and execute S&T funds to identify their practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The eight leading companies whose practices GAO assessed take a disciplined approach to organizing and executing their technology development activities by grouping them into two portfolios: incremental and disruptive, as shown in the figure. Incremental development improves product lines whereas disruptive development is for riskier innovative and potentially market-shifting technologies.", "By separating these two portfolios, companies reported that they could promote existing product lines in the short term while exploring opportunities to remain competitive in the long term, and mitigate the financial risk associated with disruptive technology development. Moreover, GAO found that leading companies also ensure technologies will be relevant in the marketplace by engaging a wide range of internal stakeholders. These companies also reported that they gain leadership buy-in by prototyping technologies before committing to further development and product integration.", "While some Department of Defense (DOD) practices closely mirror those of the companies GAO reviewed, DOD's ability to adopt leading commercial practices in its approach to managing science and technology (S&T) investments is limited by its funding policies and culture. Unlike the companies GAO reviewed, DOD leadership does not provide guidance on or assess the mix of incremental and disruptive innovation. As a result, officials reported that DOD labs struggle to find the right balance between these investment areas. Under DOD's budget policy, projects are planned up to 2 years in advance, which can slow innovation and limit lab directors' autonomy as compared to companies. Congress has provided a means for lab directors to initiate work outside of this lengthy process, but it has not been fully utilized. Additionally, responsibilities for technology versus product development also contribute to a culture that discourages collaboration and limits labs' ability to prototype. Yet these issues are not insurmountable, as pockets of each military department have demonstrated, such as through recent efforts to expand advanced prototyping in the labs. Further, Congress has required that by February 2018 DOD create a new Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (USD(R&E)), which will be charged with developing policies to improve innovation. This position creates an opportunity to develop policies that further promote adoption of leading commercial practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD annually define and assess the mix of innovation investments and define, in policy or guidance, an S&T management framework that comprehensively employs leading commercial practices.

To counter  these challenges, DOD\u2019s science and technology (S&T) community is  charged with identifying and maturing new technologies and making them  available to DOD\u2019s acquisition community for integration into weapon  systems. In the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget submission, DOD  requested approximately $12.5 billion for S&T activities aimed at  developing technologies that meet both the short-term and long-term  needs of current and future warfighters. In recent years, DOD has  reported that its leadership role in fostering innovation has been  supplanted by the commercial sector, which has changed the paradigm  for DOD S&T. DOD now relies increasingly on the innovations  commercial industry produces to guide its own S&T investments.", "The conference report 112-329 accompanying the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 included a provision for us to  review DOD\u2019s S&T enterprise, including its interactions with industry,  investment strategies, technology development methods, and transition  activities\u2014the process of migrating new technologies from the research  environment to military users. We previously issued a report in March  2013 to address the technology transition component of this provision. In  this report, we analyze DOD\u2019s approach to managing technology  development as compared to best practices that leading companies use.  Specifically, we identified (1) practices that selected leading companies  use to manage their S&T portfolios and programs, and (2) the extent to  which DOD can employ these practices within its S&T enterprise,  including any barriers to adopting such practices.", "To identify the practices that leading companies use to manage their S&T  portfolios and programs, we selected eight companies to include as case  studies in our review.

All of the  companies we selected were profitable, large Fortune 500-listed  companies, or were owned by those companies. For each of the  companies, we interviewed senior management officials and other  representatives knowledgeable about research and development (R&D),  which are technology development activities equivalent to S&T  development activities at DOD. We collected documentation, when  available, and conducted semi-structured interviews to gather consistent  information about processes and practices these selected companies  used to manage technology development. In particular, we obtained  information on their (1) organizational structures and management  cultures, (2) R&D portfolio management and investment strategies, (3)  R&D project management practices, and (4) their technology transition  processes, including when transitions occur, what organizations are  involved, and how technologies are further funded. We synthesized each  company\u2019s processes and created summary documents, which the  companies then reviewed for accuracy and completeness to validate our  assessment of their specific practices. Using this validated information,  we identified the practices that were consistent among the selected  companies and which company representatives considered key to  promoting innovation. We also presented our analysis of these leading  practices to senior DOD S&T executives within the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, the military services, and other defense research  organizations to obtain their views on the practices.", "To identify the extent to which DOD can employ practices that leading  companies use to manage S&T investments, we met with officials from  across the DOD S&T enterprise, including the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)), the  three military departments\u2019 laboratories, and other defense research  organizations that execute S&T funds. We conducted semi-structured  interviews to gather consistent information about processes and practices  these organization used to manage S&T development. In particular, we  discussed their (1) organizational structure and management culture, (2)  S&T portfolio management and investment strategy, (3) S&T project  management practices, and (4) their technology transition process. From  these, we identified the existing practices in S&T management being  used throughout DOD. We compared and contrasted those practices with  those identified through our meetings with selected leading companies to  determine the extent to which DOD is employing commercial practices.  We reviewed relevant policies and regulations used by DOD S&T  organizations to manage the S&T enterprise. To further our  understanding of the S&T management practices being used at the  military department labs, we reviewed at least two recent S&T projects by  each of these labs. These projects were identified by lab officials and  included projects deemed successful as well as ones identified as  unsuccessful. Finally, we hosted a forum in December 2016 that included  12 DOD S&T executives, including those associated with the  organizations we met with during our review, to identify what opportunities  exist within DOD to adopt selected leading companies\u2019 practices, as well  as any obstacles that may preclude DOD from fully adopting these  practices.

DOD has long  reported the existence of a chasm between its S&T community and the  acquisition community, which often precludes effective transitioning of  technologies out of the S&T environment into weapon systems. In a  series of reports, we found that technologies may not leave the lab  because their potential has not been adequately demonstrated or  recognized, acquisition programs may be unwilling to fund final stages of  development, or private industry chooses to develop the technologies  itself. Further, we found that the acquisition community frequently  integrates technologies too early and takes on the task of maturing  technologies\u2014an activity that is the primary responsibility of the S&T  community\u2014at the start of an acquisition program.

Effective management of  these portfolios requires balancing investments between two types of  R&D efforts: incremental R&D, which is tied to near-term products; and  disruptive R&D, which is intended to deliver innovative technologies that  can provide longer-term growth. According to company representatives,  this balance is driven by the business imperative of sustaining current  markets while also developing future ones. Leading companies align their  goals for incremental technology development with product development,  while also providing independent paths for developing disruptive  technologies not tied to product development. In addition, these  companies identify stakeholders outside the scientific realm and  collaborate extensively with them to ensure that technologies are relevant  and can be efficiently integrated into marketable products. Among the key  R&D stakeholders are representatives from the business units who are  responsible for identifying customer needs and getting products to  market. They also scale the rigor in project oversight based on the  amounts of time and money invested.

Incremental R&D: lower-risk projects to be integrated quickly into  near-term products.  2.  Disruptive R&D: projects that carry a higher risk of failure, but offer  significant rewards for the company in the long-term.

IBM representatives  found that development models with longer sequential steps and a single  deliverable are less useful than faster paced and smaller deliverables  under shorter timeframes.", "Companies may also use external demonstrations of maturing  technologies to prove they work in realistic environments. For example,  Valvoline produces and tests small volumes of new motor oil formulas in  its own laboratory or at a few select customers\u2019 facilities.

Similarly, both DOD  and the companies we reviewed assess projects based on their cost,  schedule, and technical performance requirements.

Instead,  DOD S&T investments are organized and funded based on budget  activities (BA) that reflect stages of technology maturity. DOD uses this  approach, in part, because the Financial Management Regulation dictates  how R&D activities are identified for the purposes of budgeting. We found  that one limitation of funding under BAs is a lack of visibility into whether  individual projects that labs and research centers invest in are geared  toward disruptive or incremental innovation.

While the Director of DARPA approves  every project the agency undertakes and is not beholden to address  defined requirements, the military departments\u2019 labs and centers do not  control all of the S&T-related R&D work they perform annually. These  labs and centers regularly undertake work on behalf of acquisition  community customers, such as a major defense acquisition program, who  provide funding in support of the project. This work comes in addition to  \u201cdirect funded\u201d projects approved and funded to the lab or center through  PPBE that are intended to address S&T requirements outlined in strategy.  As a result, both the direct funded and customer-funded projects compete  for lab resources, such as staff, and must be balanced.

The other 81  percent was customer-funded work from Navy, other DOD, or other  governmental sources. Despite having direct funding, the POM review  and approval process may constrain which projects are ultimately funded.  For example, we found that the projects a lab or center proposes in its  POM submission may be reviewed by as many as four different  organizations before it is submitted to OSD.

Each of the services has unique strategies for  executing section 219 authorities but DOD reported that the full 3 percent  of funds available to the labs has not been used. DOD officials told us  that the full 3 percent available to each defense laboratory has not been  used for a number of reasons, including due to competing S&T funding  priorities. Additionally, DOD officials indicated that labs had concerns  about charging customers a fee to fund such S&T activities, which was a  factor in different amounts of funds available for section 219 purposes, as  shown in figure 16.", "During our review, Congress amended the Section 219 authority in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 to permit lab  directors to use an amount of funds not less than 2 percent but not more  than 4 percent of all funding available to the lab.

Although we found that S&T projects funded by the acquisition community  obtain collaborative input from those same eventual customers, this was  not the case for direct-funded projects\u2014those initiated by the lab. Lab  officials explained that for direct-funded projects, they may consult with  potential customers in the acquisition community to gauge interest before  starting a project or to present results after it is complete, but those  customers are not part of the development team. This approach is, in  part, attributable to these organizations being separate\u2014both in mission  and in the type of funding they receive. For example, unlike the  companies we reviewed, S&T officials explained that they do not  transition scientists and engineers along with the technologies they  developed to the acquisition programs.

For example, applied research  project proposals at the Naval Research Lab and the Army\u2019s Engineer  Research and Development Center both identify and consider potential  transition partners as part of the selection criteria, regardless of whether it  was for incremental or disruptive technologies.

Leading companies have  shown they do this by organizing and funding R&D to avoid the pressures  to focus on incremental innovation at the expense of maintaining their  technological edge in the future. With its focus on meeting warfighter  needs, DOD does not operate under similar business imperatives; it has  not, at a department-wide level, emphasized the need to invest in  disruptive technologies.

It did not,  however, identify if any such strategy would be revised to promote earlier  prototyping so the S&T community can prove technologies work and  generate demand from future acquisition programs. We continue to  believe that establishing an S&T framework that emphasizes prototyping  outside of acquisition programs is needed.", "Additionally, in response to our recommendations that the Secretary of  Defense direct the USD(R&E) to define the three elements above in an  S&T management framework, DOD also noted that Reliance 21 is  expected to continue serving as the overarching framework for the S&T  joint planning and coordination process.
