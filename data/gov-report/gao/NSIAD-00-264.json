We recently testifiedbefore the House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology on the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to address its long-standing pervasive weaknesses in financial management systems, operations, and controls. Material financial management deficiencies identified at DOD, taken together, continue to represent the single largest obstacle that must be effectively addressed to achieve an unqualified opinion on the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements. DOD\u2019s vast operations\u2014with an estimated $1 trillion in assets, nearly $1 trillion in reported liabilities and a reported net cost of operations of $378 billion in fiscal year 1999\u2014have a tremendous impact on the government\u2019s consolidated reporting.", "To date, no major part of DOD has yet been able to pass the test of an independent audit; auditors consistently have issued disclaimers of opinion because of pervasive weaknesses in DOD\u2019s financial management systems, operations, and controls. Such problems led us in 1995 to put DOD financial management on our list of high-risk areas vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, a designation that continued in last year\u2019s update.Lacking such key controls and information not only hampers the department\u2019s ability to produce timely and accurate financial information, but also significantly impairs efforts to improve the economy and efficiency of its operations. Unreliable cost and budget information affects DOD\u2019s ability to effectively measure performance, reduce costs, and maintain adequate funds control, while ineffective asset accountability and control adversely affect DOD\u2019s visibility over weapons systems and inventory.", "DOD has made genuine progress in many areas throughout the department, both larger steps forward and smaller incremental improvements. We have seen a strong commitment by the DOD Comptroller and his counterparts in the military services to address the department\u2019s serious financial management problems. At the same time, DOD has a long way to go. Major problems remain\u2014problems that are pervasive, long-standing, deeply rooted, and complex in nature. Our previous testimony outlined DOD\u2019s most difficult financial management challenges and described the many initiatives that are under way or planned to address them.", "Today, I will highlight certain of those ongoing challenges, with a focus on those that affect the reliability of budget execution data as well as other areas where accurate and complete financial management information could provide a useful perspective to decisionmakers related to budget requests, performance measures, costs, and other key decision points.", "Finally, I will discuss DOD\u2019s plans and actions to develop an integrated financial management system that complies with federal system standards. To achieve what the Comptroller General has referred to as the \u201cend game\u201d\u2013systems and processes that routinely generate good financial information for day-to-day management purposes\u2014will require a major systems and reengineering effort. Integrated financial management systems, along with marshaling the human capital needed to achieve results, have long been cited as major components to the final resolution of DOD\u2019s financial management problems. The successful Year 2000 effort demonstrated that DOD can resolve complex, entitywide problems through top management leadership working across functional lines. Applying the Year 2000 lessons learned to the department\u2019s financial management system integration effort will require similar leadership and commitment to a disciplined systems development approach."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reliability of Budget Execution Data Impaired", "paragraphs": ["As an integral part of an effective budget execution system, an agency is responsible for determining and maintaining its available fund balance. Treasury also has information about activity in the agency\u2019s accounts, and Treasury\u2019s and the agency\u2019s records must be periodically reconciled to determine the actual amount of funds available. This is analogous to reconciling one\u2019s personal checking account with the monthly bank statement. DOD weaknesses in accounting for its funds include (1) the inability to reconcile its balances to Treasury\u2019s, (2) frequent adjustments of recorded payments from one appropriation to another appropriation account, including to canceled appropriations, (3) problem disbursements\u2014disbursements that are not properly matched to specific obligations recorded in the department\u2019s records, and (4) obligated balances that are incorrect or unsupported.", "As a result of these weaknesses, auditors have been unable to verify DOD\u2019s Fund Balance With Treasury and its major components\u2014obligated and unobligated balances. This means that DOD does not know with certainty the amount of funding that is available. This information is essential for DOD and the Congress to be able to determine the status of funds and if unobligated balances are available that could be used to reduce current funding requirements or that could be reprogrammed to meet other critical program needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Significant Differences Between DOD\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s Records", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD has made some improvements in its accountability over its fund balance with Treasury, the amount of funds available at DOD remains questionable because (1) significant differences between DOD\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s records remain, (2) the reduction in differences between Treasury\u2019s and DOD\u2019s recorded fund balances may be, in part, a result of a change in policy rather than an actual reduction, and (3) items in suspense accounts, which cannot be identified with a specific appropriation account, may not be DOD transactions.", "DOD made the reduction of differences a high priority in its short-term improvement plans last year. There was a drop in the amount of the unresolved differences from $9.6 billion at September 30, 1998, to $7.3 billion at September 30, 1999. Although some of the differences may be due to the timing of transaction processing at Treasury versus DOD, an aging of the difference suggests that significant reconciliation issues remain. For example, of the $7.3 billion difference, $2.5 billion is 60 days or older. Differences over 60 days old are generally not attributable to timing.", "At least some of the decrease in the total differences as of September 30, 1999, can be attributed to the practice of some Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) center staff to routinely adjust their records each month to match those at Treasury without first identifying whether the adjustment is proper. This practice results in fewer differences on the reports but does not necessarily mean that the reconciliation process has actually improved or that the causes of the differences, such as Treasury or DOD errors in recording transactions, have been addressed and resolved. For example, one Army disbursing station recorded $608 million in differences to a suspense account.At year-end, DOD charged the differences to Army\u2019s Operations and Maintenance appropriation, without documentation to support that these transactions should be recorded to this account. This resulted in financial reports to the Congress and OMB that show a reduction in the obligated balance in that account available for disbursement. However, DOD has little assurance that the charge should not have been properly assessed against, for example, some other Army appropriation or even to another entity\u2019s appropriation. Further, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, DOD reversed the Operations and Maintenance charges and returned the amounts to suspense accounts.", "Finally, DOD records show that an estimated $1.6 billion of transactions held in suspense accounts at the end of fiscal year 1999 have not been properly reported to Treasury and may also affect the fund balance with Treasury amount. Until suspense account transactions are posted to the proper appropriation account, the department will have little assurance that appropriation balances are accurate, and that it has a right to any collections, that adjustments are valid, and that the disbursements do not exceed appropriated amounts. Moreover, the reported amounts in suspense accounts represent the offsetting (netting) of collections and adjustments against disbursements, thus understating the magnitude of the unrecorded amounts in suspense accounts. To illustrate the magnitude of this issue, we previously testifiedthat audit work for fiscal year 1997 found that while the Navy had a net balance of $464 million in suspense accounts recorded in its records, the individual transactions\u2014collections as well as disbursements\u2014totaled about $5.9 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frequent Adjustments Affect Reliability", "paragraphs": ["DOD frequently adjusts recorded payments to transfer the payment to another appropriation account, including to canceled appropriations. These adjustments raise questions about the reliability of amounts reported as obligated and available for disbursement in specific appropriations. In March 2000, we reportedthat about one of every two dollars in fiscal year 1997 contract payment transactions processed was for adjustments to previously recorded disbursement transactions. Although DOD reported that the number of adjustments has declined, it remains significant. During fiscal year 1999, DFAS data showed that almost one of every three dollars in contract payment transactions was for adjustments to previously recorded payments\u2014$51 billion in adjustments out of $157 billion in transactions. Adjustments were often made to original entries that were recorded years earlier. A number of the adjustments selected during our review were made to canceled accounts.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, the Congress changed the government\u2019s account closing procedures. The intent of the changes was to impose the discipline of the Antideficiency Actand the bona fide needs ruleto expired appropriations and to ensure that expired appropriations do not remain open on the government\u2019s books indefinitely.", "Subsequent to the amendment of the account closing law, DOD requested that Treasury reopen hundreds of closed accounts to permit the posting of adjustments. Treasury asked us whether it had authority to correct reporting or accounting errors in closed accounts. In 1993, we determined that Treasury had authority to correct these errors.The decision concluded that Treasury may adjust the records of canceled appropriations to record disbursements that were in fact made before the cancellation. However, Treasury can make these adjustments only if DOD can establish that a disbursement was a liquidation of a valid obligation, recorded or unrecorded, that was properly chargeable against the account before it closed.", "Adjusting disbursements previously recorded to current accounts by moving those transactions to canceled accounts can increase balances available for obligation in the current accounts. Since the 1991 account closing law was enacted, DOD has requested that Treasury reopen 333 closed accounts, totaling $26 billion. These accounts remained open as of September 30, 1999. By comparison, all other federal agencies combined have requested that Treasury reopen 21 closed accounts, totaling $5 million. According to Treasury\u2019s records, DOD made $576 million in net adjustments to canceled accounts in fiscal year 1999. DOD has indicated that it has controls in place to ensure that adjustments to canceled accounts are proper. Chairman Kasich and Chairman Horn recently asked us to review DOD\u2019s practice of making adjustments to canceled accounts, and our work has just begun."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disbursements Not Properly Recorded", "paragraphs": ["Problem disbursements\u2014disbursements that are not properly matched to specific obligations recorded in the department\u2019s records\u2014continue to impede the department\u2019s efforts to improve its budgetary data. This situation can misstate DOD\u2019s reported obligated balances, undermining this important budgetary control. For example, when disbursements are not matched to specific obligations, an understatement of obligations and an overdisbursement of an account can occur. This situation occurs if the disbursement is for an item for which an obligation has not been recorded or if the amount of the recorded obligation is less than the recorded disbursement. Obligations are also understated in the case of in-transits, in which a disbursement has been made but documentation is insufficient to determine how the transaction should be recorded in the accounting records. The elimination of problem disbursements is one of the department\u2019s highest financial management priorities. DOD has reported progress in resolving problem disbursements. As of September 30, 1999, DOD reported$10.5 billion in problem disbursements, including in- transits, as compared with about $17.3 billion in problem disbursements reported at the end of fiscal year 1998.", "Of the $10.5 billion, DOD reported that about $1.5 billion were problem unmatched disbursements and negative unliquidated obligations (NULOs)over 180 days old. DOD\u2019s problem disbursement policy requires that obligations be recorded for amounts paid that are unmatched to a recorded obligation or exceed recorded obligated balances after 180 days. However, the policy makes an exception if sufficient funds are not available for obligation. In that case, DOD\u2019s policy permits the department to delay recording an obligation or adjustment until the funds cancel\u2014up to 5 years after expiration of the account. DOD believes that by delaying the recording of the obligation, funds will become available\u2014for example, through de-obligation\u2013thus permitting the obligation to be recorded without raising an Antideficiency Act concern and ensuing investigation. If DOD had recorded this $1.5 billion after the transactions remained unmatched for 180 days, the related account balances would have reflected potential Antideficiency Act violations and required an investigation and report to the Congress if the appropriation is ultimately determined to be overobligated or overspent.", "An agency may not avoid the requirements of the Antideficiency Act, including its reporting requirements, by failing to record obligations or to investigate potential violations. To ensure sound funds control and compliance with the Antideficiency Act, an agency\u2019s fund control system must record transactions as they occur. We and the DOD IG have previously reportedon this issue and recommended that DOD revise its problem disbursement policies and procedures to ensure that accurate and reliable balances are maintained.", "Finally, the process and control problems that result in the problem disbursement issues previously discussed also contribute to improper payments by the department. For example, our work continues to identify problems with overpayments and erroneous payments to contractors. For fiscal years 1994 through 1999, according to DFAS records, defense contractors returned over $5.3 billion to the DFAS Columbus Center, including about $670 million during fiscal year 1999, due to contract administration actions and payment processing errors. However, these amounts do not reflect the true magnitude of this problem because many overpayments are returned through billing offsets. We are currently working to estimate the scope of the overpayment problem, including these offsets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obligated Balances Were Incorrect and Unsupported", "paragraphs": ["In their testing of obligated balances, DOD auditors found evidence of unsupported obligations and poor internal controls over obligations, as illustrated by the following examples.", "The Army Audit Agency foundthat internal controls over the recording of obligations were not adequate to ensure that reported obligated balances were accurate. In a sample of 60 1999 transactions, the auditors found that 21 could not be supported.", "For fiscal year 1999, audit resultsshow that the Air Force Working Capital Fund had $211 million of obligations out of approximately $1 billion tested, that is 700 out of 2,526 transactions that were incorrect, inadequately supported, or not supported. In addition, Air Force\u2019s general fund audit continued to identify inaccurate or unsupported obligated balances as of September 30, 1999. Specifically, Air Force auditors identified an estimated $1.3 billion in inaccurate or unsupported obligated balances, a significant improvement over the prior year when an estimated $4 billion in obligated balances were inaccurate or unsupported.", "In addition to auditors\u2019 reports, the Department of the Navy identified its unliquidated and invalid obligations as a material management control weakness in its fiscal year 1999 annual assurance statement issued pursuant to the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act. For example, the Navy reported that within the Operation and Maintenance-Navy appropriation, some activities were not verifying that only valid obligations were entered into the accounting system. As a result, funding may have been available but not used. In addition, the Navy had more than $1 billion in expired budget authority that was allowed to cancel at the end of fiscal year 1999, including more than $750 million that had been obligated but not disbursed. According to Treasury data, at the end of fiscal year 1999, the department had $3.8 billion in expired budget authority that canceled.", "Accurate and reliable information would permit the Congress to review DOD year-end unobligated and unexpended balances and identify opportunities for possible funding reductions. For example, as a result of our analysis of unobligated balances in the military personnel appropriation, the House Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction of $96 million in the fiscal year 2001 request for this account. Since the military services\u2019 account data have shown a pattern of not spending all of their appropriated funds, the Committee concluded that the fiscal year 2001 military personnel budget request is overstated and can be reduced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improved Data on Environmental/ Disposal Liability Would Be an Important Oversight Tool", "paragraphs": ["Under federal, state, and international law, DOD faces a major funding requirement associated with environmental cleanup and disposal. These environmental costs result from the production of weapons systems and prior and current operations. Even when current operations are carried out in full compliance with existing environmental regulations, future cleanup costs for certain operations will still result due to the nature of these DOD activities. DOD has taken important steps to implement the federal accounting standardsrequiring recognition and reporting of these liabilities and has made noteworthy progress. For example, DOD\u2019s reported estimated liabilities increased from $34 billion in its fiscal year 1998 financial statements to $80 billion in fiscal year 1999. However, the full magnitude and timing of these costs are not yet known because (1) all potential liabilities were not considered in the reported estimates, (2) estimates were not based on the consistent application of assumptions and methodologies across the services, and (3) support for the basis of reported estimates continues to be inadequate.", "A reliable estimate of DOD\u2019s environmental liability would be an important factor in determining the cost of its operations and specific programs and for resource planning. To effectively, efficiently, and economically manage DOD\u2019s programs, its managers and oversight officials need reliable cost information for the following key decision points.", "Evaluatingprograms\u2014Long-term liabilities that affect program costs must be accurately measured and considered in evaluating the status of programs. For example, the liability for disposal activity is part of the overall life-cycle cost of weapon systems and can contribute to the ongoing dialogue on funding comparable weapons. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 required that the Secretary of Defense analyze the environmental costs of major defense acquisitions as part of the life-cycle costs of the programs. However, recent IG audits of several major weapons systems programs, including the Black Hawk helicopter and F-15 aircraft, have found that life-cycle cost estimates did not include costs for demilitarization, disposal, and associated cleanup.", "In addition, the Senate Committee on Appropriations has required that DOD develop disposal cost estimates for munitions.", "Makingcurrenteconomicchoices\u2014DOD\u2019s decisions on whether to outsource specific functions require accurate and complete supporting cost data. Yet DOD, as well as other government agencies, has historically been unable to provide actual data on the costs associated with functions to be considered for outsourcing. For example, environmental and disposal costs must be considered in the department\u2019s plans to analyze its more than 2,000 utility systems for privatization. If these costs prove significant to DOD, they should be considered in any cost-benefit analyses developed by the department in deciding to retain or privatize these functions.", "Resourceplanning\u2014Reliable information on the full extent of the environmental liability that DOD faces under current law and the likely timing of funding requests would enable DOD and the Congress to make informed judgments about DOD\u2019s ability to carry out those requirements. As the Comptroller General recently testifiedbefore the Senate Budget Committee, although we are currently enjoying a period of budget surplus, it does not signal the end of fiscal challenges. Long-term cost pressures from programs such as Social Security and Medicare will consume an ever-larger share of the economy and squeeze the resources available for other commitments and contingencies, such as federal insurance programs and cleanup costs from federal operations known to result in hazardous waste, including defense facilities and weapons systems. Accurate and complete information on the magnitude and timing of DOD\u2019s environmental liability would permit DOD and the Congress to strategically plan for this long-term liability and set realistic priorities among the competing challenges that we will face in the future. Further, quantifying this enormous liability and providing a breakdown of the costs by the approximate time periods the disposal costs are expected to be incurred would add an important context for congressional and other decisionmakers on the timing of resource needs, including those that are more near-term. For example, we estimatedthat approximately $1.6 billion of the $5.6 billion estimate for the disposal of nuclear powered submarines was for submarines that are already decommissioned and awaiting disposal.", "In summary, the most significant issues faced by the department in determining and verifying its environmental/disposal liability include incomplete estimates, inconsistent methodologies, and inadequate documentation.", "Incompleteestimates\u2014To date, DOD has focused on what it expects will be its most significant liabilities, those associated with nuclear weapons and training ranges. It has not yet considered the magnitude of costs associated with other weapon systems, conventional munitions, or its ongoing operations, although these costs may also be billions of dollars. For example, the department\u2019s costs to dispose of conventionally powered ships would be at least $2.4 billion, based on applying the Navy\u2019s estimated average cost of $500 per ton of displacement used to estimate disposal costs for its inactive fleet. In addition, we previously estimated that the conventional munitions disposal liability for Army alone could exceed $1 billion.", "Also, the costs of cleaning up and disposing of assets used in ongoing operations may be significant. Significant environmental and disposal costs are required to be recognized over the life of the related assets to capture the full cost of operations. We are working with DOD to assess whether operations, such as landfills and utilities (including wastewater treatment and power generation facilities), will ultimately have significant environmental costs associated with closure. For example, Edwards Air Force Base officials provided us with a landfill closure cost estimate of approximately $8 million. This estimate excluded post-closure maintenance costs (such as monitoring) which are estimated to exceed $200,000 annually over 30 years. To provide some perspective on the potential scope of these operations, the Army alone reported 65 landfills that, based on the Air Force estimated cost data, could cost nearly $1 billion to close and monitor.", "Cost estimates should also be refined for changes in cleanup/disposal schedules. For example, DOD reported a liability of approximately $8.9 billion in its fiscal year 1999 financial statements for chemical weapons disposal. Initial estimates to comply with the United Nations- sponsored Chemical Weapons Convention were based on a 2007 completion date. However, we recently reportedthat while 90 percent of the stockpile could be destroyed by the 2007 deadline, schedule slippages associated with the remaining 10 percent are likely to occur because of additional time required to validate, certify, and obtain approval of technologies to dispose of the remaining stockpile of chemical weapons. These schedule slippages will likely result in additional program costs. Historically, schedule delays have been found to increase costs such as labor, emergency preparedness, and program management.", "Inconsistentmethodologiesandinadequatedocumentation\u2014Each military service independently estimated its liabilities with, in some cases, significantly different results, and the lack of documentation hampered auditors\u2019 ability to verify the estimates. For example, although the Air Force reported twice as many aircraft as the Navy, it has not yet reported environmental and disposal liabilities for its aircraft. The Navy\u2019s financial statements included an initial estimate of $331 million in fiscal year 1999 for its disposal of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. In addition, our limited analysis of DOD\u2019s first-time effort to develop complete cleanup cost estimates for training ranges, which we view as an important step forward, showed that the reported amount of $34 billion was comprised primarily of cost estimates for active, inactive, and closed Navy/Marine Corps ranges of approximately $31 billion. The Navy reported this to be a minimum estimate based on assumptions of \u201clow\u201d contamination and cleanup/remediation to \u201climited public access\u201d levels, for uses such as livestock grazing or wildlife preservation but not for human habitation. Based on these assumptions, the Navy used a cost factor of $10,000 per acre. Although the Army also has significant exposure for training range cleanup liabilities, it reported only $2.4 billion for ranges on formerly used defense sites and closed ranges on active installations. The Army assumed one closed training range per base for the active installations. However, because the Army has not developed a complete range inventory nor recorded any liability for active or inactive ranges, this approach may have significantly understated its liability. To illustrate the potential magnitude of Army training range cleanup, applying the cost factor used by the Navy to estimated range acreage of the Army\u2019s National Training Center at Ft. Irwin, California, would result in a cleanup cost estimate of approximately $4 billion for that installation alone.", "Further, DOD has had ongoing problems in adequately documenting its reported liability\u2014an important control in ensuring its reliability. Last year, the DOD IG reported that the basis of estimates for significant recorded liabilities\u2014primarily those related to restoration (cleanup) of sites contaminated from prior operations\u2014was not adequately supported, and those problems persist. Military service auditors continue to find that significant portions of the reported restoration liabilities lack adequate support for the basis of cost estimates. For example, the Army Audit Agency found that the Army lacked support for its estimates and attributed it to the fact that recent guidance on documentation requirements was not properly disseminated to project managers and others preparing project cost estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Estimates of Retiree Health Care Benefits Could Assist DOD and the Congress", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the Congress are looking at numerous options to provide more\u2014 and more cost-effective\u2014health care to military personnel upon their retirement. Currently, there are several pilot programs underway to test the feasibility of providing additional health care benefits to retirees over 65 years, including the Medicare Subvention demonstration and the TRICARE Senior Supplement project.Congress is now considering expanding these pilot programs to cover greater numbers of retirees or extending the length of the trial periods. The Congress is also considering expanding coverage of certain benefits, such as for pharmaceuticals, to Medicare eligible retirees. Reliable financial and patient care data would enhance the ability of DOD and the Congress to consider medical care options.", "DOD estimates that, based on its current benefit programs, the cost of providing future health care benefits for military retirees and their dependents will be $196 billion;however, we have previously testifiedthat this estimate is unreliable because DOD does not have accurate or complete cost and patient care information. DOD developed its estimate using an actuarial model that relies on historical information about the retiree population and the numbers, types, and costs of medical services provided to them. The model also uses economic, actuarial, and other assumptions, such as future interest rates and projected rate increases for medical costs. Improvements to the underlying data or assumptions can significantly change the liability estimate. DOD has made meaningful progress in improving the processes and underlying data on which its liability is based. For example, when better and more complete data about DOD\u2019s population, medical care costs, and outpatient clinic usage were used in the model in fiscal year 1999, the revised estimate was lower by $37.5 billion, or nearly 17 percent, than the fiscal year 1998 estimate.", "DOD has used its health care model to determine the long-term impacts of some benefit changes; for example, DOD recently calculated the long-term change in the liability of a proposal to provide eligibility for purchased care to retirees over 65. With better underlying data and some refinements to its methodology, DOD\u2019s model could be a valuable tool to both the department and the Congress for estimating the short-term, as well as long-term, budgetary impacts of complex changes to the retiree health benefits program. DOD has been using a similar model to calculate its long-term liability for military retiree pensions for many years, and both DOD and the Congressional Budget Office rely on the model to analyze the impact of changes to the retirement program.", "As we testified in May 2000, DOD needs to improve the underlying data used by the model. First, DOD needs actual cost data for its military treatment facilities. DOD has been using budget obligation information as a surrogate; however, obligations do not reflect the full cost of providing health care because they do not, for example, include civilian employee retirement benefits that are paid directly out of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund rather than by DOD. Nor do obligations include depreciation costs for medical facilities and equipment. In addition, DOD needs to improve the accessibility and reliability of its patient workload information. The DOD IG has reportedthat medical services could not be validated either because the medical records were not available or outpatient visits were not adequately documented. The DOD IG also reported that outpatient visits are often double counted and that many telephone consultations have been incorrectly counted as visits.", "An accurate count of patient visits by clinic and type is necessary for DOD to make the proper allocations of medical personnel, supplies, and funding. DOD has been working with the audit community on health care cost and workload data deficiencies and currently has several improvement efforts underway. DOD has been using examples of blatant data errors, such as negative costs for some surgery clinics and obstetric services provided to male patients, to stress to its own staff and to health care contractors the importance of its improvement efforts.", "We are currently working with a contractor to assess DOD\u2019s retiree health benefits estimation methodology, and preliminary results indicate several areas where the model could be refined. DOD is currently assessing the feasibility and impact of making the following types of refinements.", "Pharmacy costs for retirees are currently not segregated from those of non-retirees, even though preliminary evidence suggests that retirees use more outpatient pharmacy resources. Also, the future trend rate used by DOD for pharmacy costs is the same as that for general medical costs, even though we previously estimated that DOD pharmacy costs increased 13 percent from 1995 through 1997 while its overall health care costs increased only 2 percent for the same period.", "In the past, DOD has assumed that numbers and types of clinic visits are adequate measures of outpatient health care usage for purposes of allocating health care costs to retiree and active duty populations; however, additional work may show that diagnosis related information is a better indicator of health resources usage because retirees may have more complicated diseases and therefore require longer and more resource intensive procedures.", "DOD\u2019s model currently does not calculate separate liabilities for retirees under and over 65 years old.

In addition, the military services have historically been unable to maintain information on additions and deletions for most of their national defense assets. While some progress has been made toward improving this data, auditors found that much of it was still unreliable for fiscal year 1999. Reliable information on additions and deletions is an important internal control to ensure accountability over assets. Without integrated accounting, acquisition, and logistics systems to provide accounting controls over asset balances, this control is even more important. For example, property managers should be able to review information on additions to ensure that all assets acquired are reported in logistics systems. If such a control is not in place, DOD cannot have assurance that all items purchased are received and properly recorded.", "Because of the recognized problems with national defense asset information, the audit community in the past year focused on supporting and reviewing improvement efforts, rather than conducting any significant tests of data and systems. Under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, the DOD Inspector General is required to review national defense asset data submitted to the Congress for fiscal year 1999. Such a review should help determine the success of DOD\u2019s improvement efforts so far, as well as identify those areas requiring further improvement.", "In addition, DOD has acknowledged that the lack of a cost accounting system is the single largest impediment to controlling and managing weapon systems costs, including costs of acquiring, managing, and disposing of weapons systems. Accurate information on the life-cycle costs of weapon systems would allow DOD officials and the Congress to make more fully informed decisions about which weapons, or how many, to buy.", "Properly accounting for the revenue associated with the sale of these assets has also been a significant financial management challenge. Since October 1998, we have issued four reports identifying internal control weaknesses in DOD\u2019s foreign military sales program that includes sales of national defense assets and services to eligible foreign countries. Most recently, on May 3, 2000, we reportedthat the Air Force did not have adequate controls over its foreign military sales to ensure that foreign customers were properly charged. Specifically, our analysis of data contained in the Defense Finance and Accounting Service\u2019s Defense Integrated Financial System as of July 1999, indicated that the Air Force might not have charged FMS customer trust fund accounts for $540 million of delivered goods and services.", "In performing a detailed review of $96.5 million of these transactions, we found that the Air Force was able to reconcile about $20.9 million. However, of the remaining $75.6 million, the Air Force had either failed to charge customer accounts ($5.1 million, 22 transactions); made errors, such as incorrectly estimating delivery prices ($44 million, 11 could not explain differences between the recorded value of delivered goods and services and corresponding value of charges to customer accounts. ($26.5 million or 19 transactions).", "Inventory\u2013 DOD\u2019s inability to account for and control its huge investment in inventories effectively has been an area of major concern for many years. In its fiscal year 1999 financial statements, DOD reported $128 billion in inventory and related property. The sheer volume of DOD\u2019s on-hand inventories impedes the department\u2019s efforts to accumulate and report accurate inventory data. We reportedin our January 1999 high-risk report on defense inventory management that the department needs to avoid burdening its supply system with large inventories not needed to support current operations or war reserves. For example, our analysis of approximately $63 billion of DOD\u2019s reported secondary inventory at September 30, 1999, showed that 58 percent of the reviewed items, or an estimated $36.9 billion, exceeded these requirements. Further, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999, only 2 of the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) 20 distribution depots reported accuracy rates above 90 percent, and overall accuracy was reported at 83 percent, with error rates ranging from 6 percent to 28 percent. DLA\u2019s goal is 95 percent accuracy. The lack of complete visibility over inventories increases the risk that responsible inventory item managers may request funds to obtain additional, unnecessary items that may be on-hand but not reported.", "Control weaknesses over inventory can lead to inaccurate reported balances, which could affect supply responsiveness and purchase decisions, and result in a loss of accountability. For example, during a December 1999 visit to one Army ammunition depot, we found weak internal controls over self-contained, ready-to-fire, handheld rockets, a sensitive item requiring strict controls and serial number accountability. As detailed in our recently issued report,we and depot personnel identified 835 quantity and location discrepancies associated with 3,272 rocket and launcher units contained in two storage igloos. The depot had more items on hand than shown in its records because of control weaknesses over receipt of items, and, in some cases, the records had location errors. Depot management responded immediately to our findings, and the depot subsequently accounted for and corrected the inventory records of all the rocket and launcher units. Regarding this problem, we identified potentially systemic weaknesses in controls and lack of compliance with federal accounting standards and inventory system requirements and made recommendations to the Army to establish and verify operating procedures to help ensure that systemic weaknesses are corrected.", "DOD has long-standing problems accumulating and reporting the full costs associated with working capital fund operations that provide goods and services in support of the military services, its primary customers. The foundation for achieving the goals of these business-type funds is accurate cost data, which are critical for management to operate efficiently, measure performance, and maintain national defense readiness.", "With regard to inventory cost information, federal accounting standards require inventories to be valued based on historical costs or a method that approximates historical costs. However, DOD systems do not capture the information needed to report historical cost. Instead, inventory records and accounting transactions are maintained at a latest acquisition cost or a standard selling price. Inventory levels are also reported to the Congress at latest acquisition cost. Although latest acquisition cost data may be important for budget projection and purchase decisions, this information may not be appropriate for performance measurement. Latest acquisition cost can substantially differ from the cost paid for the item. To illustrate how this occurs, assume a military service had 10 items that cost $10 each, so each item would be valued at $10, or at $100 in total. However, if the service then purchased 1 new item at $25, all 11 items would be valued based upon the latest purchase price of $25, or $275 in total. The former Commander of Air Force Materiel Command testified in October 1999 that such valuation practices distort DOD\u2019s progress toward reducing inventory levels and impact Congressional funding decisions.The Commander stated the following. \u201cPart of the problem was accounting policy. \u2026Each year, inventories of old spare parts were increased in value to reflect their latest acquisition price (the normal commercial practice is to deflate, not inflate, the value of long term assets). Many supply managers who faithfully disposed of unneeded inventory were surprised at the end of the year to see their total inventory value increase. As a result, they were subject to great pressure to further reduce inventory levels. . . .The new spares were needed but funding restrictions prevented purchase of these parts for several years.\u201d", "Overall, the effect of increasing prices can be demonstrated by noting that the Air Force\u2019s $32.6 billion of inventory at latest acquisition cost is revalued to $18.3 billion to reflect estimated historical costs.", "Realandpersonalproperty\u2013Audit tests of real property transactions, additions, deletions, and modifications that occurred during fiscal year 1999 indicated that DOD continues to lack the necessary systems and processes to ensure that its real property assets are promptly and properly recorded in its accountability databases. For example, Army auditors reviewed about $408 million in real property transactions recorded during fiscal year 1999 and determined that $113 million of those transactions should have been posted in prior fiscal years. Army auditors also identified $43 million in unrecorded real property transactions.In addition, recent audits by the military service auditors have continued to find that while DOD regulations require periodic physical inventories and inspections\u2014a critical control in safeguarding assets\u2014they are not always performed as required. Air Force auditors reported that real property personnel did not perform required inventories at 34 of 99 installations audited in fiscal year 1999. To illustrate the benefit of physical inventories, while implementing the Navy\u2019s new accountability system, the number of assets recorded in the accountability database at one Marine Corps location alone increased by over 35 percent as result of wall-to-wall inventories.", "In addition, because DOD does not have the systems and processes in place to reliably accumulate costs, it is unable to account for several significant costs of its operations, including its facilities and equipment. Comprehensive and reliable asset financial information is necessary for determining the full cost of operations and can be useful for anticipating the need for additional budgetary resources.", "An analysis of reported asset balances and related depreciationcan provide additional information to review specific budget requests. For example, the Navy reported that 85 percent, or approximately $1.2 billion of its $1.4 billion of depreciated equipment reported on its fiscal year 1998 financial statements, was fully depreciated. If Navy\u2019s financial information accurately reflected asset accountability and utilization periods, this information could be used as a factor in analyzing Navy\u2019s funding requests. Specifically, if the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1998 information were accurate, it would indicate that most of the Navy\u2019s equipment is at or beyond its anticipated utilization period. This type of information could help support a funding request or, absent such a request, could be used to question whether operations would be impaired by the lack of needed capital equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Net Cost Information Is Unreliable", "paragraphs": ["Our audit of the U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 1999 found that the government was unable to support significant portions of the $1.8 trillion reported as the total net cost of government operations.

In general, the data DOD reported in its financial statements represented disbursement data for those budgetary accounts, adjusted for estimated asset purchases and accruals.

DOD\u2019s 1999 update to its FinancialManagementImprovementPlanset out an integrated financial management system as the long-term solution for establishing effective financial management.
