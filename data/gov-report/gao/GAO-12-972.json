However, limited progress has been made to consolidate the management of their assets. According to department officials, when Congress established the Treasury Forfeiture Fund in 1992, it recognized the differences in the programs' missions, which warranted creating separate programs, and this encouraged independent operational decisions that eventually created differences between the programs. There are some differences between the programs, but both departments seize similar assets such as vehicles. Nevertheless, the departments have not assessed the feasibility of consolidation, including whether such efforts would be cost-effective, and continue to duplicate efforts by separately managing and disposing of their seized and forfeited property. Specifically, Justice and Treasury maintain four separate information technology (IT) asset tracking systems, which perform similar functions to support their respective asset forfeiture program activities. In addition, both departments procure separate national contracts for the management of real property and they separately store assets seized under each program that are in some cases located within the same geographic area. For example, both the United States Marshals Service (Marshals)--the primary custodian of Justice's seized assets--and Treasury maintain vehicle storage facilities, 40 percent of which are within 20 miles of each other. GAO recognizes the separate legal authorities of the asset forfeiture funds, but those authorities do not preclude consolidating certain management activities within the programs. Conducting a study to evaluate the feasibility of consolidation that considers associated costs and benefits, among other things, could help Justice and Treasury effectively identify the extent to which consolidation would help increase efficiency, effectiveness, and cost savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Justice and Treasury conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility, costs, and benefits of consolidating their asset management activities.

At  the federal level, both the Department of Justice (Justice) and  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) operate asset forfeiture programs  that are designed to prevent and reduce crime through the seizure and  forfeiture of assets that represent the proceeds of, or were used to  facilitate, federal crimes. Annually, participating agencies within Justice  and Treasury seize millions of dollars in assets as a result of their law  enforcement activities. Seized assets include cash and financial  instruments, as well as noncash items such as real estate, vehicles,  businesses, jewelry, art, antiques, collectibles, vessels, and aircraft. In  fiscal year 2011, the combined value of assets in these two programs was  about $9.4 billion, of which about $6.9 billion and $2.5 billion were assets  under Justice\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s management, respectively. Participating  agencies of both programs also seize and hold illegal drugs, firearms, and  counterfeit items that have no resale value to the government and are  typically held by the agencies until they are approved for destruction. In  addition to separate asset forfeiture programs, each department  maintains a separate fund that is the receipt account for the deposit of  forfeitures. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 established  the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF). Monies  deposited in the AFF pay for the costs of operating the Justice Forfeiture  Program. Likewise, the Treasury Forfeiture Fund Act of 1992 established  the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) as a successor to what was then the  Customs Forfeiture Fund. Monies deposited in the TFF pay for the costs  of operating the Treasury Forfeiture Program.", "The asset forfeiture process is made up of sequential activities that  include (1) preseizure activities such as investigations whereby assets  are identified for potential seizure; (2) postseizure activities such as  notification, wherein a law enforcement agency provides legal and official  notice to the property owner and the public that the government intends to  forfeit the seized property, and asset forfeiture property management  activities such as appraising the value of a seized asset, storing and  maintaining the asset, and disposing of the asset once it has been  officially forfeited; and (3) management of the fund that receives forfeited  cash and proceeds from the sale of forfeited assets. In addition to the two  statutes establishing the Justice and Treasury Funds, a series of laws  have been enacted over the years expanding forfeiture from drug  offenses to money laundering, financial crimes, and terrorism-related  offenses. These statutes authorize seizure and fund management  activities, but they do not prohibit coordination or consolidation of asset  forfeiture property management activities.", "In January 1990 we identified both the Justice and Treasury forfeiture  programs as high-risk areas\u2014in part because of the potential for cost  reduction through administrative improvements and consolidation of the  programs\u2019 management and disposition of all noncash seized property,  including property seized for drug-related offenses.that the two agencies had made no significant progress toward  developing a joint plan for consolidating the postseizure administration of  properties seized for drug-related violations, as directed by the Anti-Drug   In 1991, we reported  Abuse Act of 1988. In February 1995 and March 1996, we  recommended that Justice and Treasury aggressively pursue  consolidation of their asset management and disposition functions. In  2003 we removed both programs from the high-risk list because Justice  and Treasury had (1) made improvements in the management of and  accountability for seized and forfeited property, and (2) demonstrated the  commitment to communicate and coordinate where joint efforts could help  reduce costs and eliminate potentially duplicative activities. For example,  Justice and Treasury were moving toward better coordination of asset  forfeiture property management activities such as sharing website  locations for Internet sales, sharing selected vehicle storage and  warehouse facilities, and exploring opportunities to jointly contract for  specific services in high-volume areas.", "The current fiscal crisis offers a window of opportunity for the federal  government to examine how consolidating its operations can contribute to  cost savings or effectiveness gains. With our nation facing serious, long- term fiscal challenges, a reevaluation of federal agencies\u2019 operations has  never been more important than it is today, and over the past 2 years, we  have reported on many areas that may be or are duplicative, overlapping,  and fragmented. You asked us to report on what Justice and Treasury  have done to coordinate asset forfeiture property management activities  between their respective asset forfeiture programs since 2003, the time  when both programs were taken off GAO\u2019s high-risk list, and to determine  the potential for duplication in asset management activities related to the  programs. Specifically, this report addresses the following question: To what extent have Justice and Treasury assessed and acted on  opportunities to coordinate or consolidate asset forfeiture property  management activities to reduce any duplication and achieve cost  savings since 2003?", "To conduct this work, we reviewed our prior reports for a historical  perspective on findings and recommendations related to potentially  duplicative activities for managing and disposing of seized and forfeited  assets, relevant law and congressional action related to the programs,  and a study contracted by Justice and Treasury in 2000 to identify  opportunities for increased cooperation and sharing of agency and  contractor resources. We also interviewed agency officials in both  departments to determine actions under way and completed to  consolidate any duplicative property management activities between their  respective programs since 2003.", "To determine the extent to which there may be areas of duplication  between the programs, we reviewed the asset forfeiture process to  determine the different activities undertaken within the programs. We  focused on the postseizure activities of managing assets\u2014in particular,  the use of asset tracking systems, and the management of personal and  real property\u2014since this is where past legislation, congressional  committee report language, and our prior work recommended  consolidation. With regard to information technology (IT) asset tracking  systems, we reviewed and analyzed technical information such as user  requirements documentation, operations manuals, and information  technology business cases. We also observed a demonstration of each  system and interviewed agency officials responsible for operating each  system.", "With regard to the management of personal property, we analyzed data,  as of June 2012, on contract vendors utilized by both Justice and  Treasury to manage three categories of seized and forfeited personal  property assets\u2014vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. To assess the reliability  of these data, we (1) performed electronic data testing and looked for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, and (2) interviewed agency  officials knowledgeable about asset management to determine the  processes in place to ensure the integrity of the data. We determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. There is  some variation in the types and volumes of assets seized under each  program; however, we selected vehicles, vessels, and aircraft asset  categories because they encompass the types of assets that both  agencies seize and generally manage similarly. Specifically, we analyzed  the addresses of the Justice and Treasury vendors to determine the  geographic proximity of the two agencies\u2019 facilities for storing similar  assets encompassed within each category. The objective of this analysis  was to determine whether the two agencies were storing similar assets in  close geographic proximity while maintaining separate contracts for this  purpose and if so, the frequency of these occurrences. For purposes of  this analysis, we regarded 20 miles or less as close geographic proximity.  Finally, we visited 4 out of about 140 vehicle storage facilities to observe  how assets are managed under the Justice and Treasury programs. We  selected these facilities based on geographic location for states that have  a high volume of forfeitures or that have large numbers of facilities, and  on their proximity to GAO staff conducting the review. While the results of  these observations cannot be generalized to all storage facilities, they  provided us with an understanding of how assets can be managed.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2011 through  September 2012 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Noncash personal  property, such as vehicles, airplanes, jewelry, and collectibles, that has  been seized must be stored and maintained until it is either returned to  the owner or has been forfeited to the government and then disposed of.  Seized and forfeited real property, while not stored, must also be  maintained. Once property is forfeited to the government, it is  subsequently sold, put into official use, destroyed, or transferred to  another agency. In fiscal year 2011, Justice was responsible for  overseeing 452 pieces of real property at a value of about $97 million,  and over 3,000 pieces of personal property at a value of about $74  million. Treasury was responsible for 251 pieces of real property at a  value of about $41 million, and over 15,000 pieces of personal property at  a value of about $20 million. Cash and monetary instruments that have  been forfeited and property that has been forfeited and sold are  subsequently deposited in the forfeiture fund, in the case of Justice\u2014the  AFF\u2014and for Treasury\u2014the TFF. Money collected in the funds is used  to pay for expenses related to the asset forfeiture program and for other  law enforcement initiatives.

The program has  three primary goals: (1) to punish and deter criminal activity by depriving  criminals of property used or acquired through illegal activities; (2) to  enhance cooperation among foreign, federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies through the equitable sharing of assets recovered  through the program; and as a by-product, (3) to produce revenues in  support of future law enforcement investigations and related forfeiture  activities. The Justice Asset Forfeiture Program includes activity by the  Department of Justice components as shown in table 1, as well as  several components outside of the department.", "Likewise, the mission of the Treasury Forfeiture Program is to  affirmatively influence the consistent and strategic use of asset forfeiture  by Treasury law enforcement bureaus to disrupt and dismantle criminal  enterprises. The program has four primary goals: (1) to deprive criminals  of property used in or acquired through illegal activities; (2) to encourage  joint operations among federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies, as well as foreign countries; (3) to strengthen law enforcement;  and (4) to protect the rights of the individual.", "The Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture administers the TFF,  which is the receipt account for the deposit of non-tax forfeitures made by  member agencies.

The study contained recommendations for  improving the effectiveness and efficiency of property management  functions. For example, the study recommended sharing fixed-cost  vehicle storage facilities and jointly disposing of vehicles, vessels, and  aircraft. The study also recommended that Treasury consolidate its IT  asset tracking systems into one. However, Justice rejected the findings of  the study because it asserted that the contractor did not satisfy the terms  of the contract. For example, the contractor was supposed to develop  performance metrics for property management and disposition but,  according to Justice, did not do so.

According to Justice and Treasury officials, when Congress passed a law  establishing the TFF in 1992, it recognized the differences in the  programs\u2019 missions, which warranted creating separate programs, and  this encouraged independent operational decisions that eventually  created differences between the two programs. Treasury officials further  noted that with the enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and  the creation of DHS in 2003, Congress did not choose to mandate any  consolidation of the programs, and therefore Congress\u2019 intent was that  the programs remain separate. We recognize the separate legal  authorities of the asset forfeiture funds, but those legal authorities do not  preclude coordinating more or consolidating certain asset management  activities within the programs that we have found to be duplicative over  the years across the federal government. Further, after the statutory  creation of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund in 1992, a 1995 House  Appropriations Committee report directed Justice to review the feasibility  of consolidating Justice and Treasury contracts with vendors that provide  asset management and disposal services for both agencies, in order to  address duplication and provide cost savings. Additionally, over the past  2 years, pursuant to a statutory mandate, we have reported on many  areas that appear to be duplicative, overlapping, or fragmented.

Specifically, the departments continue to maintain separate IT  asset tracking systems, storage facilities, and contracts.", "Justice and Treasury maintain four separate IT asset tracking systems\u2014 one for Justice and three for Treasury\u2014to support their respective asset  forfeiture program activities, and these four tracking systems have similar  functionality. In February 1995, we reported that Justice and Treasury  were pursuing consolidation of IT asset tracking systems and that both  departments had agreed to develop, implement, manage, operate,  enhance, and support a consolidated IT asset tracking system.  According to Justice officials, Treasury had intended to use Justice\u2019s  system and participated for 2 years in its design, development, and  implementation, but subsequently withdrew to use its own tracking  system. Treasury officials stated that they developed their own IT asset  tracking system that would link to the program\u2019s financial system of record  in order to satisfy the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 and the federal  financial requirements mandated by the Federal Accounting Standards  Advisory Board. Our prior work shows that information technology  solutions can be identified in areas in which agencies have made  individual investments for systems that are common and duplicative. For  example, the federal payroll consolidation initiative consolidated 26  payroll systems to four shared-service centers, standardized payroll  policies and procedures, and resulted in achieving cost effectiveness  through economies of scale and the elimination of duplicative systems.  Further, in 1996, we reported that Treasury recognized that the Justice IT  asset tracking system could be modified to meet the Treasury financial  reporting requirements but believed that developing a new system to  meet the requirements was preferable.officials stated that they had not compared the different systems to  determine similarities or differences between them or whether  consolidation was feasible or desirable.

All four systems have the ability to record seizures,  details on the asset, movement of the asset through various stages, and  disposition of the asset. Further, all systems could generate detailed and  various reports related to the management of assets.", "Officials at CBP, the agency responsible for managing SEACATS\u2014the  Treasury system of record\u2014stated that a committee had been  established in 2011 to begin an IT evaluation of an analysis of  alternatives that would explore combining the three IT asset tracking  systems under the Treasury program. However, just as the effort began,  funding for the evaluation was eliminated because of overall federal  government program budget cuts. While CBP attempted an evaluation,  officials responsible for the overall Treasury program stated that given the  unique requirements of Treasury participating agencies, it would not be  beneficial to develop a consolidated asset tracking system. Likewise,  according to Justice officials, Justice has done little outreach to the  Treasury participating agencies about coordinating or consolidating IT  asset tracking systems. However, Justice officials believed that there was  room to consolidate asset tracking systems, and said a \u201cbest of breed\u201d  approach could be used, wherein the best features from each system  would be combined. Further, in our analysis of the systems, we found that  the technology in the Treasury system of record, SEACATS, was based  on 1990s mainframe technology with no existing formal documentation;  officials from the Office of Information Technology would like to move the  application from the mainframe to a more modern technology  environment. According to Justice and Treasury data, the cost of  developing, maintaining, and overseeing their four asset tracking systems  in fiscal year 2011 totaled $16.2 million for CATS and $10.4 million  combined for the three Treasury asset tracking systems.", "As we reported in May 2012, consolidating management functions, such  as information technology services, can increase the efficiency and  effectiveness of programs or contribute to cost savings, but information is  needed to help effectively evaluate consolidation proposals and  activities. As shown in table 4, fundamental questions should be  answered while considering consolidation because, while consolidation is  beneficial in some situations, it is not in others. Consolidation initiatives  can be immensely complex, politically charged, and costly and are not  quick, easy, or automatic ways of producing desired change. As a result,  a case-by-case analysis is necessary\u2014evaluating the goals of the  consolidation against the realistic possibility of the extent to which those  goals would be achieved\u2014to ensure effective stewardship of government  resources in a constrained budget environment. By conducting a study  that takes into account the expected costs, benefits, and other key  questions to consider when evaluating consolidation proposals, Justice  and Treasury would have the information needed to determine if  consolidation would result in improvements such as increases in  efficiency, effectiveness, or cost savings.", "Justice and Treasury have made limited progress in sharing storage  facilities or contracts and continue to separately store assets seized  under each program. In some cases, storage facilities are located in the  same geographic area.

In  fiscal year 2011, the Marshals Service had multiple contracts for the  management, storage, and disposal of assets at a cost of about $19  million. Treasury, using a centralized approach, has two nationwide  contracts that provide custodial services either directly or through  subcontracts with other vendors at a cost of about $49 million for fiscal  year 2011. Treasury reported overseeing 5 government warehouse  facilities, 61 vehicle locations, and 82 outside specialty vendor locations  such as cold storage or storage of hazardous materials. Justice and  Treasury stated that the volume and types of properties seized by the  participating agencies of each department vary. For example, according  to Treasury officials, CBP seizes and holds a much higher volume of  items that have no resale value to the government, such as narcotics and  contraband, than Justice. While there are some variations in the types of  properties seized, both departments also seize similar assets such as  vehicles and real property.", "Our analysis of contracted asset storage facilities showed that about 23 to  40 percent of Marshals and Treasury\u2019s contracted facilities in each  category are in close proximity to one another\u2014or within 20 miles or less  of one another. Because there is some variation in the types and volumes  of assets seized under each program, we analyzed storage locations for  assets that both departments seize and that generally are managed  similarly. In our analysis, we examined a total of 212 contract-owned  asset storage facilities utilized by Marshals and Treasury as of June 2012  for the storage of three categories of assets\u2014vehicles (143), vessels  (54), and aircraft (15).

Treasury uses a similar  model for managing real property and also uses one national contract for  the management of real property, which includes maintaining and  eventually disposing of the property. Marshals and Treasury use different  national contractors, and have not evaluated the feasibility of  consolidating the contracting for real property management.
