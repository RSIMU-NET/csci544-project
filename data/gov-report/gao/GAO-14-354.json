To do this, GAO reviewed the extent to which (1) federal agencies are effectively responding to cyber incidents and (2) DHS is providing cybersecurity incident assistance to agencies. To do this, GAO used a statistical sample of cyber incidents reported in fiscal year 2012 to project whether 24 major federal agencies demonstrated effective response activities.

For example, agencies identified the scope of an incident in the majority of cases, but frequently did not demonstrate that they had determined the impact of an incident. In addition, agencies did not consistently demonstrate how they had handled other key activities, such as whether preventive actions to prevent the reoccurrence of an incident were taken. Although all 6 selected agencies that GAO reviewed in depth had developed parts of policies, plans, and procedures to guide their incident response activities, their efforts were not comprehensive or fully consistent with federal requirements. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conduct CyberStat reviews, which are intended to help federal agencies improve their information security posture, but the reviews have not addressed agencies' cyber incident response practices.

Officials from the 24 agencies GAO surveyed said that they were generally satisfied with the assistance provided, and made suggestions to make the services more useful, such as improving reporting requirements. Although US-CERT receives feedback from agencies to improve its services, it has not yet developed performance measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the assistance it provides to agencies.

In addition, VA developed procedures for  prioritizing incidents where a matrix would be used to map the type of  incident to a predefined priority, such as critical, high, medium, and  low, for handling the incident. Procedures for HUD and DOE partially  addressed this activity since their procedures did not specify whether  risk or impact would determine incident handling priorities.

We then used a two-stage  cluster sample to identify a generalizable sample of incidents to review for  compliance with key steps. First, we selected 6 agencies from the  population of 24 major agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers  Act, using probability proportionate to the number of cyber incidents  those agencies had reported to US-CERT in fiscal year 2012, divided by  32,442\u2014the total number of cyber incidents reported to US-CERT in  fiscal year 2012\u2014sampling without replacement.
