While the program serves students from families with a wide range of household incomes, about half the students receiving a DCTAG award in academic years 2007\u20132016 came from the three D.C. wards with the lowest household incomes, as the figure below illustrates. DCTAG coordinates with public and private partners in the community to help students prepare for college, complete financial aid applications, and stay on track to graduate college.", "Although the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), which manages DCTAG on behalf of the Mayor of the District of Columbia, issues various annual reports, these reports do not relate program performance to the program's four goals. One of these goals is to help D.C. students make smarter college choices. OSSE officials stated that they regularly communicate information about DCTAG data and activities internally and externally. However, these efforts do not provide the context necessary for program managers, Congress, or the public to understand the program's goals, nor determine whether DCTAG is making progress toward meeting them. Standards for internal control state that program managers should communicate information that internal and external stakeholders need to help the program achieve its objectives.

The grants can help  defray some costs associated with recipients\u2019 postsecondary education.  For example, D.C. residents who attend public colleges and universities  in other states may pay higher \u201cout-of-state\u201d tuition.  States generally  provide financial support to their state university systems and can require  public institutions to offer residents lower, \u201cin-state\u201d tuition. In contrast to  these state university systems, which can include dozens of institutions  serving hundreds of thousands of students, D.C. has a single public  university.

To assess the reliability of program data, we interviewed  OSSE officials about the processes used to produce these data and  reviewed the programming codes used to extract them from OSSE\u2019s data  system. We did not independently verify recipients\u2019 eligibility for DCTAG.  We also used American Community Survey (ACS) data to produce  estimates of D.C. household income and enrollment in D.C. high schools  for calendar years 2007\u22122016. To assess the reliability of these  estimates, we reviewed technical documentation for ACS. Because ACS  is based on samples and therefore subject to sampling error, we present  these estimates with their associated 95 percent confidence intervals.  Lastly, to provide context for trends in DCTAG, we reviewed data on  average tuition and required fees at 4-year public institutions for  academic years 2007\u20132016 and average 6-year graduation rates for  certain nationwide groups of students in academic years 2012\u20132016 from  the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). To  assess their reliability, we reviewed technical documentation on IPEDS.  We determined that data from these three sources were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To identify steps taken to support recipients, we reviewed documents  from OSSE describing support services offered to students either directly  by DCTAG or by other entities within OSSE. For example, we reviewed  documents describing services provided by OSSE\u2019s Office of College and  Career Readiness, which promotes college access and graduation for  D.C. students. Additionally, we interviewed officials from OSSE and the  stakeholders they partner with, including public and private school  officials and representatives of college access providers, which generally  are organizations that seek to expand access to higher education. These  organizations included the D.C. College Access Program, a privately  funded scholarship program, and the federally funded D.C.

ACS data for calendar  years 2007\u22122016 indicate that the population of high school students  with incomes within DCTAG\u2019s eligibility requirements has remained  relatively stable. Over this time frame, about 25,000 students in D.C.  were enrolled in high school each year, and about 90 percent of D.C.  households had annual incomes less than $200,000. Additional  households with annual incomes of $200,000 and above were also  likely eligible for DCTAG based on income.", "Enrollment in DCTAG. DCTAG program data indicate that the  number of DCTAG recipients remained relatively stable over the last  decade. DCTAG provided awards to an average of about 4,750  recipients annually over academic years 2007\u22122016 (see fig. 1).  While enrollment in DCTAG peaked in academic year 2012, the  number of DCTAG recipients in academic year 2016, the last year in  our period of review, was similar to the number of recipients in  academic year 2007, the first year in our period of review.", "Enrollment in DCTAG by type of high school attended. DCTAG  program data indicate the majority of recipients over academic years  2007\u20132016 graduated from D.C.\u2019s public high school system\u2014both  traditional public schools and public charter schools. D.C.\u2019s traditional  public schools include six selective schools, or magnet schools, that  limit admission to students that meet certain criteria or eligibility  requirements. For example, in academic year 2016, more than 70  percent of DCTAG recipients graduated from D.C.\u2019s public high school  system (see fig. 2). Many DCTAG recipients have also graduated  from private schools or schools outside D.C., were home schooled, or  attained their General Equivalency Diploma. For academic years  2007\u22122016, between about 30 and 40 percent of DCTAG recipients  came from high schools or programs outside the D.C. public school  system.", "Enrollment in DCTAG by taxable household income. Although in  2007 federal law limited eligibility for DCTAG to students from families  with annual taxable incomes less than $1,000,000, DCTAG  enrollment data show the program made awards to students from  families with a wide range of household taxable incomes in academic  years 2009\u22122016. At the same time, enrollment data indicate the  program\u2019s particular support for students from middle and lower  income families. Nearly 60 percent of recipients over this time frame  came from families with annual household taxable incomes of  $50,000 or less (see fig. 3).", "Enrollment in DCTAG by Ward. DCTAG program data indicate that  for academic years 2007\u22122016, about 50 percent of recipients came  from the three D.C. wards with the lowest median household incomes,  according to American Community Survey estimates (see fig. 4).", "Enrollment in DCTAG by attendance at 4-year and 2-year  institutions. DCTAG program data show that for academic years  2007\u22122016, about 90 percent of DCTAG recipients attended 4-year  institutions (see fig. 5). To counter the downward trend in enrollment  at 2-year institutions that began in academic year 2013, OSSE  officials told us they made programmatic changes to DCTAG for  academic year 2018. Specifically, OSSE officials told us they  determined out-of-state-tuition at 2-year public institutions attended by  DCTAG recipients exceeded in-state tuition by an average of $4,500  per year. However, the maximum annual award for recipients  attending these institutions was only $2,500. For academic year 2018,  OSSE officials said they increased the maximum annual award to  attend 2-year public institutions to $10,000 to close this gap.", "Enrollment in DCTAG by amount awarded. For academic years  2007\u22122016, the percentage of recipients receiving DCTAG\u2019s  maximum annual awards increased from 40 percent to 62 percent  (see fig. 6). OSSE officials linked an increase in the percentage of  recipients receiving maximum awards to rising tuition at colleges and  universities over this period. We analyzed data from IPEDS on  average tuition and required fees at 4-year public institutions and our  analysis confirmed that the average gap between out-of-state and in- state tuition exceeded DCTAG\u2019s $10,000 maximum annual award  starting in academic year 2015.", "DCTAG graduation rates. College graduation rates are an important  measure of performance for DCTAG. OSSE officials told us they  maintain a program goal of helping recipients choose schools from  which they are likely to graduate. For academic years 2012\u22122015, 6- year college graduation rates for DCTAG recipients were lower than  those for students nationwide. However, OSSE officials reported  that rates for recipients compare favorably to rates for national and  regional groups of students with characteristics similar to those of  DCTAG recipients. Our analysis confirmed that in academic year  2015, about 72 percent of DCTAG recipients were African-American  and the DCTAG graduation rate was about 10 percentage points  higher than for African-Americans nationwide. Similarly, in academic  year 2015, nearly 40 percent of DCTAG recipients attended  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and the DCTAG  graduation rate was about 15 percentage points higher than for the  nationwide population of students at these schools (see fig. 7).  Additionally, OSSE officials estimated that more than 65 percent of  DCTAG recipients were eligible for Pell Grants in academic year  2016. The National Center for Education Statistics recently started  reporting graduation rates for Pell Grant recipients, beginning with the  cohort of recipients that should have graduated by academic year  2016. Although not directly aligned, the academic year 2016  graduation rate for Pell Grant recipients nationwide was 48 percent\u2014 similar to the academic year 2015 graduation rate for DCTAG  recipients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DCTAG and Its Partners Help Recipients Prepare for College, Complete Applications for Financial Aid, and Stay on Track to Graduate", "paragraphs": ["DCTAG partners with other entities to offer support services intended to  help D.C. students prepare for college, apply for financial aid, and stay on  track to graduate college.

DCTAG  provides some support services directly to students, such as individual  counseling on how to complete a DCTAG application (see fig. 8). An  OSSE official told us that DCTAG counselors instruct applicants and  renewing recipients on tasks such as how to obtain required supporting  documents to verify their residency in D.C. Additionally, to keep recipients  on track to graduate, DCTAG emails recipients a quarterly newsletter with  reminders to reapply for DCTAG and federal student aid so that they do  not disrupt their studies by losing financial assistance. OSSE officials also  said that DCTAG expands the reach of its support services by partnering  with other entities within OSSE and in the community. For example,  DCTAG works with OSSE\u2019s Office of College and Career Readiness,  whose mission is to increase D.C. public school students\u2019 access to  college. Through this collaboration, DCTAG helps eligible students  prepare for higher education, such as through assistance to public  schools to offer college entrance exams at no cost to students.

For example,  OSSE\u2019s 2017 annual report to Congress on DCTAG did not include  DCTAG\u2019s four program goals, nor did OSSE relate information about the  performance of the program to those goals.

We have previously  reported that annual reports are essential for managers of federal  programs to communicate to decision makers the progress an agency  has made toward achieving its goals during a given year and, in cases  where goals are not met, identify opportunities for improvement or  whether goals need to be adjusted. In addition, our prior work found that  managers of these programs can increase the value of their reports to  congressional decision makers and the public by relating annual  performance information to the agency\u2019s strategic goals and mission.  Furthermore, we reported that performance measurement does not  require establishing a causal link between program activities and program  outcomes, but rather emphasizes that the nature of performance  measurement is the ongoing monitoring and reporting of program  accomplishments, particularly toward pre-established goals.", "OSSE officials agreed on the importance of developing an annual report  relating performance to program goals for the DCTAG program and  concurred with our finding that they had not communicated DCTAG\u2019s  performance information, such as progress toward program goals, in a  single annual report. They explained that developing performance  measures is challenging. For example, they said DCTAG recipients have  access to multiple support programs, which creates difficulties in  establishing causal links between a program and the desired outcome.  OSSE officials also stated that many DCTAG initiatives are new and, as a  result, complete data on those initiatives are not yet available. Although  we recognize that developing an annual report could be challenging, our  prior work has found performance measurement guidelines would not  require program managers to establish causal links as part of ongoing  performance monitoring and reporting of progress toward program goals.  Unless DCTAG\u2019s stakeholders have access to an annual report that  relates performance information to the program\u2019s goals, they may be  limited in their ability to judge the significance of what is being reported,  determine whether the agency is making progress toward achieving its  goals, or make informed program management and funding decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Design of Selected Scholarship Programs Reflects Unique State and Local Needs", "paragraphs": ["Each of the three other selected scholarship programs we reviewed was  created to meet unique state or local needs.", "Boston Tuition-Free Community College Plan.
