GAO was asked to review the state of distance education at Minority Serving Institutions, which are schools that serve high percentages of minority students, including Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians. Under Titles III and V of the Higher Education Act, these schools are eligible for grants that can be used for expanding their technology, including distance education. GAO's review focused on (1) the use of distance education at Minority Serving Institutions, (2) key factors influencing these schools' decisions about whether or not to offer distance education, and (3) steps the Department of Education could take, if any, to improve monitoring efforts of technological progress under Titles III and V programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There are some variations in the use of distance education at Minority Serving Institutions compared to other schools. For example, while Minority Serving Institutions tend to offer at least one distance education course at the same rate as other schools, they differ in how many courses are offered and which students take the courses. Also, like other schools, larger Minority Serving Institutions tend to offer more distance education than smaller schools, and public schools tend to offer more distance education than private schools. However, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges generally offer fewer courses than other schools, and a smaller percentage of minority students take such courses. Minority Serving Institutions consider two main factors in deciding whether to offer distance education. The first is distance education's compatibility with the school's preferred teaching method. Many schools that offered no distance education had a strong preference for a classroom-based approach. The second is resources--schools offering little or no distance education had limited technology and support personnel. Also, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions viewed distance education as a lower priority compared to expanding technology usage in the classroom. By contrast, Tribal Colleges gave distance education higher priority, reflecting the greater geographic dispersion of their students. Education could strengthen its monitoring efforts of the Title III and V programs by expanding its existing system. Currently, the monitoring efforts for tracking the progress of technological improvements are more complete for Hispanic Serving Institutions than for the other Minority Serving Institutions. Education also lacks good baseline information on technology capacity at Minority Serving Institutions. Expanding current efforts to include such data would provide a basis for measuring the progress being made by Minority Serving Institutions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For over 100 years, the Congress has recognized that some postsecondary  institutions have roles to play in providing minority students with help in  attaining their educational goals and developing skills necessary to move  into all facets of the American economy. In the 2000-01 school year,  465 schools, or about 7 percent of postsecondary institutions in the  United States, served about 35 percent of all Black, American Indian, and Hispanic students. These schools have special designation under federal  law as Minority Serving Institutions.", "Like other postsecondary institutions, over the last decade, Minority  Serving Institutions have faced the challenge of trying to keep pace with  rapidly changing technology usage in education. Part of keeping pace with  technology involves using it in traditional classroom education, but one  growing area\u2014distance education\u2014has commanded particular attention. As defined in federal law, distance education is, \u201can educational process  that is characterized by the separation, in time or place, between  instructor and student.\u201d Some examples of course delivery methods  include the Internet, videoconferencing, and videocassettes. Distance  education offers opportunities for students to take classes without  considering where they live or when classes may be available. In the  1999-2000 school year, about one in every 13 postsecondary students  enrolled in at least 1 distance education course, and the Department of  Education (Education) estimates that the number of students involved in  distance education has tripled in just 4 years. For the most part, students  taking distance education courses can qualify for student financial aid in  the same way as students taking traditional courses. As the largest  provider of student financial aid to postsecondary students (an estimated  $60 billion in fiscal year 2003), the federal government has a substantial  interest in distance education. Under Title IV of the Higher Education Act  of 1965, as amended, the federal government provides grants, loans, and  work-study wages for millions of students each year.", "The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, provides specific federal  support for Minority Serving Institutions through Titles III and V. In  2002, grants funded under these two titles provided over $300 million for  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions,  and Tribal Colleges to improve their academic quality, institutional  management, and fiscal stability. Technology is one of the many purposes  to which these grants can be applied. As the Congress prepares to  reauthorize the act, you asked us to examine several issues related to  Minority Serving Institutions and technology\u2014and particularly to distance  education. We focused our work on determining (1) whether the use of  distance education varies between Minority Serving Institutions and non- Minority Serving Institutions; (2) what factors Minority Serving  Institutions consider when deciding whether to offer distance education;  and (3) what steps Education could take, if any, to improve its monitoring  of technological progress, including distance education, at Minority  Serving Institutions under Titles III and V. In September 2002, we testified  on some of these issues before the Senate Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions. Additionally, you asked us to look at the  quality of distance education and examine any statutory and regulatory  issues related to distance education. We plan to issue a report on those  topics later this year.", "Our findings are based on questionnaires that were developed and sent to  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions,  and Tribal Colleges. Seventy-eight percent, 75 percent, and 82 percent of  the schools responded, respectively. We compared the results of our  survey with Education\u2019s July 2003 report entitled Distance Education at  Degree-Granting Postsecondary Education Institutions: 2000-2001. This  survey was sent to over 1,600 2-year and 4-year degree granting institutions  that were eligible for federal student aid programs and provided  information on distance education offerings by these schools. However,  the data from our survey and the survey conducted by Education are not  completely comparable because they cover two different time periods. We  also analyzed two databases produced by Education\u2019s National Center for  Education Statistics. We analyzed data from the National Postsecondary  Student Aid Study (NPSAS) to examine the characteristics of  postsecondary students, including those who attended Historically Black  Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, involved in  distance education programs. We analyzed data from the Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) to examine the  characteristics of postsecondary institutions. Additionally, we conducted  site visits to selected schools drawn from these three types of Minority  Serving Institutions. We interviewed Education officials involved in  programs aimed at improving the quality of education at Minority Serving  Institutions. Finally, we interviewed numerous experts on distance  education. A more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is  included in appendix I. We performed our work between October 2002 and  September 2003 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In general, Minority Serving Institutions vary in size and scope and serve a  high percentage of minority students, many of whom are financially  disadvantaged. In size, for example, they range from Texas College, a  Historically Black College with about 100 students, to Miami-Dade  Community College, a Hispanic Serving Institution with more than  46,000 students. In scope, they range from schools with certificate or  2-year degree programs to universities with an extensive array of graduate  and professional degree programs. Table 1 briefly compares the three  types of Minority Serving Institutions in terms of their number, type, and  size. Appendixes II to IV provide additional information about the three  types of institutions.", "Historically Black Colleges and Universities are the oldest of the Minority  Serving Institutions. While the first Historically Black University, Cheyney  University of Pennsylvania, was founded in 1837, most of the colleges and  universities were founded between 1865 and 1890. In the 2000-01 school  year, there were 102 Historically Black Colleges and Universities that were  eligible for federal student aid programs, including Xavier University in  New Orleans, Louisiana; Howard University in Washington, D.C.; and  Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. Our analysis of the 2000-01 IPEDS,  shows that while Historically Black Colleges and Universities represented  2 percent of all public and nonprofit postsecondary institutions, they  enrolled about 14 percent (223,359) of Black non-Hispanic students in the  United States. In all, the schools were in 20 states, the District of  Columbia, and the Virgin Islands (see fig. 1). About 85 percent of the  students enrolled at these institutions were black Americans. Their  students and parents have lower incomes, on average, than students and  parents at non-Minority Serving Institutions.", "Hispanic Serving Institutions were recognized as such under the  1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act and some of the schools  first received funding through the Higher Education Act in 1995. Under the  definition established by the Congress, a Hispanic Serving Institution must  have a student body that is at least 25 percent Hispanic, and at least half of  the Hispanic students must be low-income. In the 2000-01 school year,  there were 334 Hispanic Serving Institutions, including Long Beach City  College in California; the University of Miami in Florida; and the University  of New Mexico. Our analysis of the 2000-01 IPEDS shows that while  Hispanic Serving Institutions represented only 5 percent of all  postsecondary institutions, they enrolled 48 percent (798,489) of all  Hispanic students. These schools were located in 14 states and Puerto  Rico (see fig. 2). About 51 percent of the students enrolled at these  institutions are Hispanic. Compared to the two other major categories of  Minority Serving Institutions, Hispanic Serving Institutions are generally  larger and have more racial diversity in their student body. They are also  the only type to include private for-profit schools, such as ITT Technical  Colleges. Their students and parents have lower incomes, on average, than  students and parents at non-Minority Serving Institutions.", "Most Tribal Colleges were founded in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1998, the  Higher Education Act was amended to create a grant program for Tribal  Colleges to improve educational quality offered to their students, and  some of the schools first received funds in 1998. In the 2000-01 school  year, there were 29 Tribal Colleges located in 12 states (see fig. 3). They  included Din\u00e9 College in Tsaile, Arizona; Salish Kootenai College in Pablo,  Montana; and Oglala Lakota College in Kyle, South Dakota. Our analysis of  the 2000-01 IPEDS shows that while Tribal Colleges were less than 1  percent of all public and private nonprofit postsecondary institutions, they  enrolled 8 percent (11,262) of all American Indian/Alaska Native students  in the United States. Tribal Colleges are the smallest of the three major  types of Minority Serving Institutions, averaging less than 500 students,  and nearly all are 2-year schools. About 85 percent of the students  attending Tribal Colleges in the fall of 2000 were American Indian/Alaska  Native. The percentage of students at Tribal Colleges who receive Pell  Grants\u2014a type of financial aid made available to the neediest students\u2014  was more than double that of students at non-Minority Serving Institutions  (60 percent v. 24 percent).", "Through certain provisions in the Higher Education Act, the Congress has  recognized the role that Minority Serving Institutions play in serving the  needs of students, many of whom are from disadvantaged backgrounds.  These provisions authorize grants for augmenting the limited resources  that many Minority Serving Institutions have for funding their academic  programs. Historically Black Colleges and Universities are eligible for  grants funded through Title III, part B; Hispanic Serving Institutions  through Title V, part A; and Tribal Colleges through Title III, part A of the  Higher Education Act. These grants seek to improve the academic quality,  institutional management, and fiscal stability of eligible institutions. More  specifically, according to Title III, part B, Historically Black Colleges and  Universities receive grants, in part, to remedy discriminatory action of the  states and the federal government against Black colleges and universities.  Hispanic Serving Institutions receive funds to expand educational  opportunities for and improve the academic attainment of Hispanic  students. Finally, the grants for Tribal Colleges seek to improve and  expand the colleges\u2019 capacity to serve American Indian students. The  Congress has identified as many as 14 areas in which institutions may use  funds for improving their academic programs. Authorized uses include  purchase or rental of telecommunications equipment or services, support  of faculty development, and purchase of library books, periodicals, and  other educational materials. Table 2 provides more information on each  type of grant.", "One area to which such funds can be directed is technology, both inside  the classroom and, in the form of distance education, outside the  classroom. Both inside and outside the classroom, technology is changing  how institutions educate their students, and Minority Serving Institutions,  like other schools, are grappling with how best to adapt. Through such  methods as E-mail, chat rooms, and direct instructional delivery via the  Internet, technology can enhance students\u2019 ability to learn any time, any  place, rather than be bound by time in the classroom or in the library. For  Minority Serving Institutions, the importance of technology takes on an  additional dimension in that available research indicates their students  may arrive with less prior access to technology, such as computers and the  Internet, than their counterparts in other schools. These students may  need considerable exposure to technology to be fully equipped with job- related skills."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Distance Education", "paragraphs": ["Distance education is one major application of this new technology.  Although distance education is not a new concept, it has assumed  markedly newer forms and greater prominence over the past decade.  Distance education can trace its history to the 1870s when correspondence  courses\u2014a home study course generally completed by mail\u2014were first  offered. Now, distance education is increasingly delivered in electronic  forms, such as videoconferencing and the Internet. Through these  approaches, distance education provides postsecondary education access  to students who may live in remote locations or whose schedules require  greater flexibility. For example, schools such as the University of Phoenix  Online and the University of Maryland University College target entire  distance learning degree programs to working adults who take their  classes largely at home. Distance education\u2019s effect on helping students  complete their courses of study is still largely unknown. Although there is  some anecdotal evidence that distance education can help students  complete their programs or graduate from college, school officials that we  spoke to did not identify any studies that evaluated the extent to which  distance education has improved completion or graduation rates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "There Are Some Variations in the Use of Distance Education at Minority Serving Institutions Compared to Other Schools", "paragraphs": ["It is difficult to generalize across the Minority Serving Institutions, but  available data indicate that while Minority Serving Institutions tend to  offer at least one distance education course at about the same rate as  other schools, they differ in how many courses are offered and which  students take the distance education courses.

However, there are also differences  between Minority Serving Institutions and other schools, and between the  three categories of Minority Serving Institutions we reviewed. We found  that Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges  offered fewer distance education courses than other schools, which may  be a reflection of their generally smaller size. The limited data available  about student participation in distance education indicates that minority  students may be somewhat less involved in distance education than other  students. In the 1999-2000 school year, for example, 6 percent of students  at Historically Black Colleges and Universities were involved with distance  education, compared with 8.4 percent at non-Minority Serving  institutions\u2014perhaps reflecting the fewer number of distance education  courses that Historically Black Colleges and Universities offer.

The following  examples illustrate these conditions.", "Northwest Indian College, a Tribal College in Bellingham, Washington, has  over 10 percent of its 600 students involved in distance education. It offers  distance education by videoconference equipment or correspondence. The  College offers over 20 distance education courses, such as mathematics  and English to students at seven remote locations in Washington and  Idaho. According to College officials, distance education technology is  essential because it provides access to educational opportunities to  students who live away from campus. For example, some students taking  distance education courses live hundreds of miles from the College in  locations such as the Nez Perce Reservation in Idaho and the Makah  Reservation in Neah Bay, Washington. According to school officials,  students involved in distance education tend to be older with dependents,  and therefore, find it difficult to take courses outside of their community.  Also, one official noted that staying within the tribal community is valued  and distance education allows members of tribes to stay close to their  community and still obtain skills or a degree.", "The University of the Incarnate Word is a private nonprofit Hispanic  Serving Institution with an enrollment of about 6,900 students. The school,  located in San Antonio, Texas, offers on-line degree and certificate  programs, including degrees in business, nursing, and information  technology. About 2,400 students are enrolled in the school\u2019s distance  education program.

Our site  visits to these schools raised several possible explanations. Potential  students of many Tribal Colleges live in communities dispersed over large  geographic areas\u2014in some cases, potential students might live over a  hundred miles from the nearest Tribal College or satellite campus\u2014  making it difficult or impossible for some students to commute to these  schools. In these cases, distance education is an appealing way to deliver  courses to remote locations. Also, officials at one Tribal College told us  that some residents of reservations may be place-bound due to tribal and  familial responsibilities, making distance education one of the few realistic  postsecondary education options. Also important, according to some  officials, is that tribal residents have expressed an interest in enrolling in  distance education courses.", "With regard to type of school, Minority Serving Institutions mirrored the  national trend in that the percentage of Minority Serving Institutions  offering distance education was higher among public than private  institutions (see fig. 6).

For example, the Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, serves about 670 students and it uses distance  education to provide courses for an associates degree in early childhood  development to about 100 students. The school uses two-way satellite  communication and transmits the courses to 11 remote locations.  According to a technology specialist at the school, this form of distance  education is expensive compared to other methods. As an alternative, the  Institute would like to establish two-way teleconferencing capability and  Internet access at the off-site locations as a means of expanding  educational opportunities. School officials noted, however, that many of  the locations have no telephone or Internet service because they are in  such remote areas of the state.", "About half of the schools also noted that they might experience difficulty  in meeting their goals because they did not have enough staff to operate  and maintain information technology and to help faculty apply technology.  For example, officials at Din\u00e9 College, a Tribal College on the Navajo  Reservation, told us they have not been able to fill a systems analyst  position for the last 3 years. School officials cited their remote location  and the fact that they are offering relatively low pay as problems in  attracting employees that have skills in operating and maintaining  technology equipment.", "Having a systematic approach to expanding technology on campuses is an  important step toward modernizing and evaluating technology at  postsecondary schools. About 75 percent of Historically Black Colleges  and Universities, 70 percent of Hispanic Serving Institutions, and only  48 percent of Tribal Colleges had completed a strategic plan for expanding  their technology infrastructure. Fewer schools had completed a financial  plan for funding technology improvements. About half of Historically  Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, and  19 percent of Tribal Colleges have a financial plan for expanding their  information technology (see fig. 9).", "Studies by other organizations describe challenges faced by Minority  Serving Institutions in expanding their technology infrastructure. For  example, an October 2000 study by Booz, Allen, and Hamilton determined  that historically or predominantly Black colleges identified challenges in  funding, strategic planning, and keeping equipment up to date. An October  2000 report by the Department of Commerce found that most Historically  Black Colleges and Universities have access to computing resources, such  as high-speed Internet capabilities but individual student access to campus  networks is seriously deficient due to, among other things, lack of student  ownership of computers or lack of access from campus dormitories.

Among the activities that Education and  grantees discussed were how grants are being used to improve  information technology on campuses and how best to collect information  on how such efforts improve the education of students. For example,  program staff held a series of four meetings with about 200 schools and  conducted telephone conferences with another 90 institutions to obtain  feedback on the format and effectiveness of the draft annual performance  report.

More specifically, we found that the way Education tracks the  usage of grant funds for technology improvements among Minority Serving  Institutions may not completely reflect how Historically Black Colleges  and Universities and Tribal Colleges use their grants. The tracking of  technology-related information appears to be adequate for Hispanic  Serving Institutions. (See table 3.) For example, Education\u2019s tracking  effort for Hispanic Serving Institutions includes the extent to which  program funds (1) improve student and faculty access to the Internet,  (2) increase the number of computers available to students outside of  classrooms, and (3) expand the number of new distance education courses  and students. Similar information is not collected for Historically Black  Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges even though a substantial  number of these schools use grant funds to expand distance education  offerings or to improve technology on campus. Eight of the 11 Tribal  Colleges that received new Title III grants in 2001 stated that funds would  be used to develop or expand technology usage, including distance  education. Similarly, between 1999-2001, about 23 percent of Historically  Black Colleges and Universities that responded to our survey indicated  that they used Title III funds on distance education.", "According to managers of the Titles III and V programs, the differences in  the types of information on activities and outcomes that are captured for  each report stems from differences in the titles themselves. Title V, part A,  under which funds are provided to Hispanic Serving Institutions, explicitly  allows program funds to be used for \u201ccreating or improving facilities for  Internet or other distance learning academic instruction capabilities,  including purchase or rental of telecommunications technology equipment  or services.\u201d The program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (Title III, part B) and Tribal Colleges (Title III, part A) does not specifically  address the use of funds in this manner, however, using grant funds for  expanding distance education offerings or technology usage are  authorized activities, according to Education staff.

However, according to other Education  officials, two issues need to be addressed before such a change can be  made. First, there are different views on how to accurately measure  technology infrastructure at postsecondary institutions. For example, in  determining how many computers are available to students at a school,  there is no agreement on whether personal computers, computers in the  library, and computers for faculty should be included in total or in part.  Second, before Education expands any of its data collection efforts, Office  of Management and Budget regulations that implement the Paperwork  Reduction Act require agencies to evaluate, among other things, the need  for collecting data and the costs to respondents of generating, maintaining,  or providing the data.

We compared the results of the survey with a July  2003 report from Education\u2019s National Center for Education Statistics  entitled Distance Education at Degree-Granting Postsecondary  Education Institutions: 2000-2001. This survey was sent to over  1,600 2-year and 4-year degree granting institutions that were eligible for  the federal student aid programs and provided information on distance  education offerings by these schools. We also analyzed the National  Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) to determine the extent that  students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic  Serving Institutions enrolled in distance education courses. NPSAS  contains information on characteristics of students who attended  postsecondary institutions, including Historically Black Colleges and  Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions in the 1999-2000 school year.

States that did not want to create integrated institutions could use the  grants to create racially segregated schools, provided that the funding was  divided equitably between the institutions. Land-grant colleges and  universities were required to teach practical industrial subjects, such as  agriculture and mechanical arts.

However, beginning about 1968, the federal government moved toward a  policy of tribal self-determination that included a greater set of tools and  resources so that tribes could better control their own educational  activities. For example, the Indian Self Determination and Education  Assistance Act was passed in 1975, and in part, called for \u201cassuring  maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational as well as  other federal services to Indian communities.\u201d", "Concurrent to the self-determination movement, as the result of the GI  Bill of 1944 and the Higher Education Act of 1965, a college education  became more accessible to all Americans, including American Indians.
