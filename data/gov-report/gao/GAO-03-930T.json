DOE has about 94 million  gallons of highly radioactive nuclear waste from the nation\u2019s nuclear  weapons program. This waste is currently in temporary storage at DOE  sites in Washington, South Carolina, and Idaho. After investing more than  20 years and about $18 billion, DOE acknowledged in February 2002 that  the program to clean up its high-level waste was far behind schedule, far  over budget, and in need of major change. In 2002, DOE began an initiative  to reduce the program\u2019s nearly $105-billion estimated cost and 70-year  time frame to finish permanent disposal of this waste. Our testimony,  based on work included in the report being released by the Subcommittee  today, discusses (1) the components of DOE\u2019s high-level waste and the  process involved in preparing the waste for disposal, (2) the status of  DOE\u2019s accelerated cleanup initiative for high-level waste, (3) legal and  technical challenges DOE faces in implementing the initiative, and (4)  further opportunities to reduce costs beyond those identified in DOE\u2019s  current cost-savings proposal or to improve program management.", "In summary, we found the following:    DOE\u2019s high-level waste has many components, ranging from  radioactive isotopes and corrosive chemicals to the water in which  much of this material was initially discharged. The radioactive  components vary greatly; a small portion will remain dangerously  radioactive for millions of years, while the vast majority will lose much  of their radioactivity more quickly, so that more than 90 percent of the  current radioactivity will be gone within 100 years. To prepare the  waste for permanent disposal, DOE plans to separate the waste into  two waste streams: one with high levels of radioactivity and the other  with lower concentrations of radioactivity. DOE expects that this  process will concentrate at least 90 percent of the radioactivity into a  volume that is significantly smaller than the current total volume of  waste. DOE plans to immobilize and bury the highly radioactive portion  in a permanent underground repository. The remaining waste will be  immobilized and disposed of at the location where it is currently stored  or at some other location.", "DOE\u2019s initiative to accelerate the cleanup is evolving, and while its  savings estimates are changing accordingly, we have ongoing concerns  about the reliability of those estimates. As of April 2003, DOE  estimated it could shorten the waste cleanup schedule by 20-35 years  and save up to $29 billion. To help achieve these schedule and cost  reductions, DOE has identified alternative treatment and disposal  strategies, such as developing ways to permanently dispose of more of  the radioactive waste at current sites rather than moving it to the  planned underground repository. However, our assessment of DOE\u2019s  savings estimate indicates that it may not be reliable. For example, the  savings analysis does not take into account all costs associated with  alternative treatment strategies. Also, the estimate of savings does not  compare costs on the basis of \u201cpresent value,\u201d where dollars to be  saved in future years are discounted to a common year to reflect the  time value of money. At DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site in South Carolina,  such an adjustment would lower the savings estimate for accelerated  waste processing by $2.6 billion\u2014from $5.4 billion to $2.8 billion (in  2003 dollars).", "DOE faces significant legal and technical challenges to realize the  estimated savings. A key legal challenge involves DOE\u2019s authority to  apply a designation other than high-level waste to some waste with  relatively low concentrations of radioactivity, so that this portion can  be treated less expensively than highly radioactive waste. A recent  court ruling invalidated this redesignation process, thus precluding  DOE from proceeding with this element of its accelerated initiative. If  DOE cannot meet its accelerated schedules, then potential savings are  in jeopardy. A key technical challenge is that DOE\u2019s approach relies  primarily on laboratory testing to confirm that separating waste into  high-level and low-activity portions will be successful. At the Hanford  Site in Washington State, DOE is planning to construct full-scale  facilities before fully testing the technologies on an integrated basis\u2014 an approach that has failed on another project in the past, resulting in  significant cost increases and schedule delays.", "DOE is exploring additional cost savings beyond those identified in its  current cost-saving proposals. The proposals that offer significant  potential are being developed by the Hanford and Savannah River sites.  These proposals call for increasing the amount of waste that can be  concentrated into the canisters destined for the permanent  underground repository. DOE\u2019s data indicates that these proposals, if  successful, could save several billion dollars. Considerable evaluation  of these proposals remains to be done and cost-saving estimates have  not yet been fully developed, according to DOE officials. DOE also has  opportunities to improve its management of the cleanup program by  addressing management weaknesses that we and others have identified  in the past. Although DOE has taken steps to improve program  management, we have continuing concerns about management  weaknesses in several areas. These include making key decisions  without rigorous supporting analysis, incorporating technology into  projects before it is sufficiently tested, and pursuing a \u201cfast-track\u201d  approach of launching into facility construction before completing  sufficient design work. It does not appear that DOE\u2019s current  management efforts will fully address these weaknesses.", "Our report makes several recommendations to DOE that, if implemented,  will help to manage or reduce legal and technical risks to the program,  avoid costly delays, and strengthen overall program management. DOE  agreed to consider our recommendation to seek clarification from the  Congress regarding its authority to determine that some waste can be  treated and disposed of as other than high-level waste. However, regarding  our recommendations that the department conduct integrated pilot testing  of its waste separation processes at Hanford, and take steps to improve  the management of high-level waste projects, such as by conducting more  rigorous analyses to support key project decisions, DOE believes that its  current approach is adequate.

For example, many of Hanford\u2019s and Savannah River\u2019s tanks were built in  the 1940s to 1960s and were designed to last 10-40 years. Leaks from some  of these tanks were first detected at Hanford in 1956 and at Savannah  River in 1959.

For example, the Idaho National  Laboratory\u2019s estimated savings of up to $7 billion is based, in large part, on  eliminating the need to build a vitrification facility to treat its waste.  However, the waste may have to undergo an alternative treatment method  before it can be accepted at a geological repository, and the Idaho  National Laboratory is considering four different technologies for doing  so. Nevertheless, DOE\u2019s current savings estimate reflects the potential  cost of only one of those technologies.

Instead, DOE\u2019s  savings estimates generally measure savings by comparing dollars in  different years.

Adjusting the savings  estimate to present value in 2003 results in a savings of $2.8 billion in  2003 dollars.", "Regarding uncertainties, in contrast to OMB guidance, the DOE savings  estimates generally do not consider uncertainties. For example, the  savings projected in the Idaho National Laboratory\u2019s accelerated plan  reflect the proposal to no longer build the vitrification facility and an  associated reduction in operations costs. However, the savings do not  account for uncertainties such as whether alternatives to vitrification  will succeed and at what cost. Rather than reflecting uncertainties by  providing a range of savings, DOE\u2019s savings estimate is a single point  estimate of $7 billion.", "Regarding nonbudgetary impacts, DOE\u2019s savings estimates generally  do not fully assess the value of potential nonbudgetary impacts, such  as a change in the level of risk to workers or potential effects on the  environment. OMB guidelines recommend identification and, where  possible, quantification of other expected benefits and costs to society  when evaluating alternative plans. For example, the Idaho National  Laboratory\u2019s accelerated plan does not assess potential increases in  environmental risk, if any, from disposing of the waste without  stabilizing it into a vitrified form.

The portion of DOE\u2019s  order setting out criteria for making such determinations has been  invalidated in a recent court ruling. On the technical side, DOE\u2019s proposals  rest heavily on the successful application of waste separation methods  that are still under development and will not be fully tested before being  put in place. DOE\u2019s track record in this regard has not been strong; it has  had to abandon past projects that were also based on promising\u2014but not  fully tested\u2014technologies. Either or both of these challenges could limit  the potential savings from DOE\u2019s accelerated cleanup initiative."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE\u2019s Accelerated Initiative Relies on a Process for Reclassifying Waste That the Court Has Ruled Invalid", "paragraphs": ["DOE has traditionally managed all of the wastes in its tanks as high-level  waste because the waste resulted primarily from the reprocessing of spent  nuclear fuel and contains significant amounts of radioactivity. However,  by separating the waste into high-level and low-activity portions and  managing the low-activity portion as something other than high-level  waste, DOE could use less costly and less complicated treatment  approaches. DOE has developed guidelines for deciding when waste in the  tanks should not be considered high-level waste. In 1999, under Order  435.1, DOE formalized its process for determining which waste is  incidental to reprocessing (\u201cincidental waste\u201d), not high level waste,  and therefore will not be sent to a geological repository for high-level  waste disposal. This process provides a basis for DOE to treat and  dispose of some portion of its wastes less expensively as low-level or  transuranic wastes.", "DOE\u2019s ability to define some waste as incidental to reprocessing, and to  then follow a different set of treatment and disposal requirements for that  waste, is central to its overall strategy for addressing its tank waste. For  example, DOE planned to use its incidental waste process to manage  about 90 percent of its 54 million gallons of tank waste at the Hanford Site  as low-level waste, rather than process it through a high-level waste  vitrification facility. Using that approach, most of the waste would be  eligible for treatment and disposal on site. Such an approach would save  billions compared to treating all of the waste as high-level waste and  sending it for disposal in a high-level waste geologic repository.", "A recent court ruling precludes DOE from reclassifying some of its waste  as other than high-level waste. In March 2002, the Natural Resources  Defense Council and others filed a lawsuit challenging DOE\u2019s authority to  manage its wastes through its incidental waste process. The plaintiffs  alleged that DOE arbitrarily established the incidental waste determination  process without proper regard for the law or properly establishing a  justification for this process. A primary concern of the plaintiffs was that  DOE would use its incidental waste process to permanently leave  intensely radioactive waste sediments in the tanks with only minimal  treatment. The lawsuit alleged that DOE\u2019s incidental waste process  improperly allows DOE to reclassify high-level waste as incidental waste  that does not need to be treated in the same way as high-level waste.  According to the plaintiffs, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act defines all waste  originating from a given source\u2014that is, from reprocessing of spent  nuclear fuel\u2014as high-level waste and requires that such waste be managed  as high-level waste, yet DOE has chosen to differentiate its wastes  according to the level of radioactivity and manage them accordingly. In a  July 3, 2003 ruling on the lawsuit, the court agreed with the plaintiffs,  stating that the portion of DOE\u2019s Order 435.1 setting out its incidental  waste determination process violates the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and  thus is invalid.", "The court\u2019s ruling could seriously hinder DOE\u2019s efforts to implement its  accelerated treatment and disposal strategies. Under the ruling, DOE\u2019s  incidental waste determinations cannot be implemented. Since the start of  the lawsuit, DOE had not implemented any of its approved incidental  waste determinations and had not yet decided whether to defer or proceed  with its pending incidental waste determinations\u2014such as those for  closing tanks at the Savannah River Site and Idaho National Laboratory.", "If DOE appeals the court ruling, a lengthy legal process could follow. A  lengthy legal process will also likely delay treatment plans for this waste  and delay closing tanks on an accelerated schedule. For example, the  Idaho National Laboratory planned to begin closing tanks in the spring of  2003, pending approval of an incidental waste determination that would  allow DOE to close the tanks by managing tank waste residuals as low- level waste. A DOE official at the Idaho National Laboratory told us that  while a delay of several months would not immediately threaten schedule  dates, a delay beyond 24 months would seriously affect the site\u2019s ability to  meet its accelerated 2012 date to close all of the tanks.", "If the court\u2019s ruling invalidating DOE\u2019s incidental waste determination  process is upheld, DOE may need to find an alternative that would allow it  to treat waste with lower concentrations of radioactivity less expensively.  Searching for such an alternative could delay progress at all three of  DOE\u2019s high-level waste sites that rely on incidental waste determinations.  If DOE cannot meet its accelerated schedules, then potential savings are  in jeopardy. At this point, the department does not appear to have a  strategy to avoid the potential effects of challenges to its incidental waste  determination authority, either from the current court ruling or future  challenges. At the time of our report, DOE officials told us that they  believed the department would prevail in the legal challenge. DOE  believed it would be premature to explore alternative strategies to  overcome potentially significant delays to the program that could result  from a protracted legal conflict or from an adverse decision. Such  strategies could range from exploring alternative approaches for  establishing an incidental waste regulation to asking that the Congress  provide legislative authority for DOE to implement an incidental  waste policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accelerated Initiative Also Relies on Waste Separation Approaches That Will Not Be Fully Tested", "paragraphs": ["Like the ability to determine that some waste is incidental to reprocessing,  the ability to separate the waste components is important to meet waste  cleanup schedule and cost goals.

Doing so would require a much  larger repository than currently planned, and drive up disposal costs  by billions of dollars. Successful separation will substantially reduce the  volume of waste needing disposal at the planned repository, as well as the  time and cost required to prepare it for disposal, and allow less expensive  methods to be used in treating and disposing of the remaining low- activity waste. The waste separation process is complicated, difficult, and  unique in scope at each site. The waste differs among sites not only in  volume but also in the way it has been generated, managed, and stored  over the years.", "The challenge to successfully separate the waste is significant at the  Hanford Site, where DOE intends to build a facility for separating the  waste before fully testing the separation processes that will be used. The  planned laboratory testing includes a combination of pilot-scale testing of  major individual processes and use of operational data for certain of those  processes for which DOE officials said they had extensive experience.  However, integrated testing will not be performed until full-scale facilities  are constructed.

For projects with significant technical  uncertainties that could affect cost and schedule, corrective action plans  to address these uncertainties are required before the projects can  proceed. In addition, DOE\u2019s supplementary project management guidance  suggests that technologies be developed to a reasonable level of maturity  before a project progresses to full implementation to reduce risks and  avoid cost increases and schedule delays. The guidance suggests that DOE  avoid the risk of designing facilities concurrently with  technology development.", "The laboratories working to develop Hanford\u2019s waste separation process  have identified several technical uncertainties, which they are working to  address. These uncertainties or critical technology risks include problems  with separating waste solids through an elaborate filtration system,  problems associated with mixing the waste during separation processes,  and various problems associated with the low-activity waste evaporator.", "Given these and other uncertainties, Hanford\u2019s construction  contractor and outside experts have seen Hanford\u2019s approach as  having high technical risk and have proposed integrated testing during  project development. However, DOE and the construction contractor  eventually decided not to construct an integrated pilot facility and instead  to accept a higher-risk approach. DOE officials said they wanted to avoid  increasing project costs and schedule delays, which they believe will result  from building a testing facility. Instead, Hanford officials said that they will  continue to conduct pilot-scale tests of major separation processes. DOE  officials said they believe this testing will provide assurance that the  separation processes will function in an integrated manner. After the full- scale treatment facilities are constructed, DOE plans to fully test and  demonstrate the separation process during facility startup operations.", "The consequences of not adhering to sound technology development  guidelines can be severe. At the Savannah River Site, for example,  DOE invested nearly $500 million over nearly 15 years to develop a waste  separation process, called in-tank precipitation, to treat Savannah River\u2019s  high-level waste. While laboratory tests of this process were viewed as  successful, DOE did not adequately test the components until it started  full-scale operations. DOE followed this approach, in part, because the  technology was commercially available and considered \u201cmature.\u201d  However, when DOE started full-scale operations, major problems  occurred. Benzene, a dangerously flammable byproduct, was produced in  large quantities. Operations were stopped after DOE spent about  $500 million because experts could not explain how or why benzene was  being produced and could not determine how to economically reconfigure  the facility to minimize it. Consequences of this technology failure  included significant cost increases, schedule delays, a full-scale waste  separation process that did not work, and a less-than-optimum waste  treatment operation. Savannah River is now developing and implementing  a new separation technology at an additional cost of about $1.8 billion and  a delay of about 7 years.", "Subsequent assessments of the problems that developed at Savannah  River found that DOE (1) relied on laboratory-scale tests to demonstrate  separation processes, (2) believed that technical problems could be  resolved later during facility construction and startup, and (3) decided to  scale up the technology from lab tests to full-scale without the benefit of  using additional testing facilities to confirm that processes would work at  a larger scale. Officials at Hanford are following a similar approach.  Several experts with whom we talked cautioned that if separation  processes at Hanford do not work as planned, facilities will have to be  retrofitted, and potential cost increases and schedule delays would be  much greater than any associated with integrated process testing in a  pilot facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Explore Additional Cost Savings and to Strengthen Program Management", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the potential cost savings identified in the accelerated  site cleanup plans, DOE continues to develop and evaluate other proposals  to reduce costs but is still assessing them.

At  the Savannah River and Hanford sites, for example, DOE is identifying  ways to increase the amount of waste that can be placed in its high-level  waste canisters to reduce treatment and disposal costs. DOE also has a  number of initiatives under way to improve overall program management.  However, we are concerned that the initiatives may not be adequate. In  our examinations of problems that have plagued DOE\u2019s project  management over the years, three contributing factors often emerged\u2014 making key project decisions without rigorous analysis, incorporating new  technology before it has received sufficient testing, and using a \u201cfast-track\u201d  approach (concurrent design and construction) on complex projects.", "Ensuring that these weaknesses are addressed as part of its program  management initiatives would further improve the management of the  program and increase the chances for success."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOE Is Considering Additional Potential Opportunities to Reduce Costs", "paragraphs": ["DOE is continuing to identify other proposals for reducing costs under  its accelerated cleanup initiative. Among the proposals that DOE is  considering, the ones that appear to offer significant cost savings  opportunities would increase the amount of waste placed in each disposal  canister. The amount of waste that can be placed into a canister depends  on a complex set of factors, including the specific mix of radioactive  material combined with other chemicals in the waste, such as chromium  and sulfate, that affect the processing and quality of the immobilized  product. These factors affect the percentage of waste than can be placed  in each canister because they indicate the likelihood that radioactive  constituents could move out of the immobilizing glass medium and into  the environment. The greater the potential for the waste to become  mobile, the lower the allowable percentage of waste and the higher  the percentage of glass material that must be used.", "Savannah River officials believe they can increase the amount of waste  loaded in each canister from 28 percent to about 35 percent, and for at  least one waste batch, to nearly 50 percent. In June 2003, Savannah River  began to implement this new process to increase the amount of waste in  each canister. If successful, Savannah River\u2019s improved approach could  reduce the number of canisters needed by about 1,000 canisters and save  about $2.7 billion, based on preliminary estimates. Other efforts to  increase waste loading of the canisters are also under way that, if  successful, may permit further cost savings of about $1.7 billion. The  Hanford Site is also exploring ways to decrease the numbers of waste  canisters that will be needed by using waste forms other than the standard  borosilicate glass. This effort is in a very early stage of development and  cost-savings estimates have not been fully developed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Opportunities to Improve Management of the Program by Addressing Previously Identified Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["In addition to site-specific proposals for saving time and money, DOE is  also undertaking management improvements using teams to study  individual issues. Nine teams are currently in place, while other teams to  address issues such as improving the environmental review process to  better support decision making have not yet been formed. Each team has a  disciplined management process to follow, and even after the teams\u2019  work is completed, any implementation will take time. These efforts are in  the early stages, and therefore it is unclear if they will correct the  performance problems DOE and others have identified.", "We are concerned that these management reforms may not go far enough  in addressing performance problems with the high-level waste program.  Our concerns stem from our review of initiatives under way in the  management teams, our discussions with DOE officials, and our past and  current work, as well as work by others inside and outside DOE. We have  identified three recurring weaknesses in DOE\u2019s management of cleanup  projects that we believe need to be addressed as part of DOE\u2019s overall  review. These weaknesses cut across the various issues that the teams are  working on and are often at the center of problems that have been  identified. Two of these weaknesses have been raised earlier in this  testimony\u2014lack of rigor in the analysis supporting key decisions, and  incorporating technology into projects before it is sufficiently mature. The  final area of weakness involves using \u201cfast-track\u201d methods to begin  construction of complex facilities before sufficient planning and design  have taken place."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Decisions Not Always Supported by Rigorous Current Analysis", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s project management guidance emphasizes the importance of  rigorous and current analysis to support decision making during the  development of DOE projects. Similarly, OMB guidance states that  agencies should validate earlier planning decisions with updated  information before finalizing decisions to construct facilities. This  validation is particularly important where early cost comparisons are  susceptible to uncertainties and change.", "DOE does not always follow this guidance, yet no DOE management team  appears to be addressing this weakness. Proceeding without rigorous  review has been a recurring cause of many of the problems we have  identified in past DOE projects. For example, the decision at Hanford to  construct a vitrification plant to treat Hanford\u2019s low-activity waste has not  been validated with updated information. Hanford\u2019s primary analysis  justifying the cost of this approach was prepared in 1999 and was based on  technical performance data, disposal assumptions, and cost data  developed in the early to mid-1990s\u2014conditions that are no longer  applicable. Subsequent analyses have continued to rely on this data.  However, since that time conditions have changed, including the  performance capabilities of alternative technologies such as grout, the  relative cost of different technologies, and the amount of waste DOE  intends to process through a vitrification facility.", "DOE officials disagree with our assessment of their analysis, stating that a  comprehensive analysis was conducted in the spring of 2003. However,  DOE\u2019s high-level waste project team agreed that the DOE officials at  Hanford had not performed a current, rigorous analysis of low-activity  waste treatment options including the use of grout as an alternative to  vitrification, and the team encouraged the Hanford site to update its  analysis based on current waste treatment and disposal assumptions. DOE  officials at Hanford told us they do not plan to reassess the decision to  construct a low-activity vitrification facility because their compliance  agreement with the state of Washington calls for vitrification of this waste.  They also stated that vitrification is a technology needed for destroying  hazardous constituents in a portion of the waste."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Technology Is Incorporated before It Is Sufficiently Mature", "paragraphs": ["Our work on Department of Defense acquisitions has documented a set of  \u201cbest practices\u201d used by industry for integrating new technology into  major projects. We reported in July 1999 that the maturity of a technology  at the start of a project is an important determinant of success. As  technology develops from preconceptual design through preliminary  design and testing, the maturity of the technology increases and the risks  associated with incorporating that technology into a project decrease.  Waiting until technology is well-developed and tested before integrating it  into a project will greatly increase the chances of meeting cost, schedule,  and technical baselines. On the other hand, integrating technology that is  not fully mature into a project greatly increases the risk of cost increases  and schedule delays. According to industry experts, correcting problems  after a project has begun can cost 10 times as much as resolving  technology problems beforehand.", "DOE\u2019s project management guidance issued in October 2000 is consistent  with these best practices. The guidance discusses technology development  and sets out suggested steps to ensure that new technology is brought to a  sufficient level of maturity at each decision point in a project. For  example, during the conceptual design phase of a project, \u201cproof of  concept\u201d testing should be performed before approval to proceed to the  preliminary design phase. Furthermore, the guidance states that  attempting to concurrently develop the technology and design the facility  for a project poses ill-defined risks to the project.", "Nevertheless, as we discussed earlier, DOE sites continue to integrate  immature technologies into their projects. For example, as discussed  earlier, DOE is constructing a facility at the Hanford Site to separate  high-level waste components, although integrated testing of the many  steps in the separations process has not occurred and will not occur until  after the facility is completed. DOE, trying to keep the project on schedule  and within budget, has decided the risks associated with this approach are  acceptable. However, there are many projects for which this approach  created schedule delays and unexpected costs. The continued reliance on  this approach in the face of so many past problems is a signal of an area  that needs careful attention as DOE proceeds with its management reform  efforts. At present, no DOE management team is addressing this issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facility Construction Starts before Design Is Sufficiently Developed", "paragraphs": ["Finally, we have concerns about DOE\u2019s practice of launching into  construction of complex, one-of-a-kind facilities well before their final  design is sufficiently developed, again in an effort to save time and money.  Both DOE guidance and external reviews stress the importance of  adequate upfront planning before beginning project construction. DOE\u2019s  project management guidance identifies a series of well-defined steps  before construction begins and suggests that complex projects with  treatment processes that have never before been combined into a facility  do not lend themselves to being expedited. However, DOE guidance does  not explicitly prohibit a fast-track\u2014or concurrent design and  construction\u2014approach to complex, one-of-a-kind projects, and DOE  often follows this approach. For example, at the Hanford Site, DOE is  concurrently designing and constructing facilities for the largest, most  complex environmental cleanup job in the United States. Problems are  already surfacing. Only 24 months after the contract was awarded, the  project was 10 months behind schedule dates, construction activities have  outpaced design work causing inefficient work sequencing, and DOE has  withheld performance fee from the design/construction contractor  because of these problems.", "DOE experienced similar problems in concurrent design and construction  activities on other waste treatment facilities. Both the spent nuclear fuel  project at Hanford and the waste separations facility at the Savannah River  Site encountered schedule delays and cost increases in part because the  concurrent approach led to mistakes and rework, and required extra time  and money to address the problems. In its 2001 follow-up report on DOE  project management, the National Research Council noted that inadequate  pre-construction planning and definition of project scope led to cost and  schedule overruns on DOE\u2019s cleanup projects. The Council reported that  research studies suggest that inadequate project definition accounts for  50 percent of the cost increases for environmental remediation projects.  Again, no DOE team is specifically examining the \u201cfast-track\u201d approach,  yet it frequently contributed to past problems and DOE continues to use  this approach."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s efforts to improve its high-level waste cleanup program and to rein  in the uncontrolled growth in project costs and schedules are important  and necessary. The accelerated cleanup initiative represents at least the  hope of treating and disposing of the waste in a more economical and  timely way, although the actual savings are unknown at this time.  Furthermore, specific components of this initiative face key legal and  technical challenges. Much of the potential for success rested on DOE\u2019s  ability to dispose of large quantities of waste with relatively low  concentrations of radioactivity on site by applying its incidental waste  process. Recently, a court ruled that the portion of DOE\u2019s order setting out  its incidental waste determination process violates the Nuclear Waste  Policy Act and is invalid. Thus, DOE is precluded from implementing this  element of its accelerated initiative. Success in accelerating cleanup also  rests on DOE\u2019s ability to obtain successful technical performance from its  as-yet unproven waste separation processes. Any technical problems with  these processes will likely result in costly delays. At DOE\u2019s Hanford Site,  we believe the potential for such problems warrants reconsidering the  need for more thorough testing of the processes, before completing  construction of the full-scale waste separation facility.", "DOE\u2019s accelerated cleanup initiative should mark the beginning, not  the end, of DOE\u2019s efforts to identify other opportunities to improve the  program by accomplishing the work more quickly, more effectively, or at  less cost. As DOE continues to pursue other management improvements,  it should reassess certain aspects of its current management approach,  including the quality of the analysis underlying key decisions, the  adequacy of its approach to incorporating new technologies into projects,  and the merits of a fast-track approach to designing and building complex  nuclear facilities. Although the challenges are great, the opportunities for  program improvements are even greater. Therefore, DOE must continue  its efforts to clean up its high-level waste while demonstrating tangible,  measurable program improvements.", "In the report being released today, we made several recommendations to  help DOE manage or reduce the legal and technical risks faced by the  program as well as to strengthen DOE\u2019s overall program management.  DOE agreed to consider seeking clarification from Congress regarding its  authority to define some waste as incidental to reprocessing, if the legal  challenge to its authority significantly affected DOE\u2019s ability to achieve  savings under the accelerated initiative. Regarding our recommendations  to conduct integrated pilot-scale testing of the separations facility at  Hanford before construction is completed, and to make other management  improvements to address the weaknesses I just discussed, DOE\u2019s position  is that it has already taken appropriate steps to manage the technology  risks and strengthen its management practices. We disagree and believe  that implementing all of our recommendations would help reduce the risk  of costly delays and improve overall management of DOE\u2019s entire high- level waste program.  -     -     -     -     -  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee.
