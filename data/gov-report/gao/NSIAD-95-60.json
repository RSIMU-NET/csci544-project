In fiscal year 1994, AGMC\u2019s depot maintenance workload consisted of about 900,000 hours; almost 10,500 items were produced to support repair requirements for 66 Air Force, Navy, and Army systems and components. This work was accomplished by about 500 maintenance and engineering personnel and 325 management and support personnel.", "AGMC is different from the Air Force air logistics centers (ALC) in that it does not have weapon system and item management responsibility collocated at the same base. For Air Force systems repaired at AGMC, weapon system and item management functions are performed primarily at the Ogden or Oklahoma City ALCs. However, some of the engineering support normally provided by the system program management offices at ALCs is performed at AGMC for systems it repairs.", "In its second Air Force mission, metrology and calibration, AGMC performs overall technical direction and management of the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program and operates the Air Force Measurement Standards Laboratory. About 200 personnel are involved in the metrology and calibration mission\u2014109 in generating technical orders, certification of calibration equipment, and management operations and 89 in the standards laboratory. As the single manager for the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program, AGMC provides all metrology engineering services for the Air Force. The standards laboratory complex, consisting of  47 laboratories, serves as the primary laboratory for calibrating and certifying measurement standards used worldwide in all Air Force precision measurement equipment laboratories. In fiscal year 1994, the standards laboratory produced about 11,500 calibrated items.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) considered AGMC\u2019s work conducive to conversion to the private sector and recommended closing Newark AFB/AGMC through privatization and/or transferring the workload to other depots. DOD justified the closure by (1) identifying at least 8.7 million hours of excess Air Force depot maintenance capacity, with the closure of AGMC expected to reduce this excess by 1.7 million hours, and (2) applying the eight base closure criteria to Air Force bases having depots and ranking Newark AFB low relative to the others (see app. II for base closure criteria). DOD assigned a low military value to Newark AFB primarily because it was a single mission base with no airfield.", "DOD estimated that implementing its recommendation on Newark AFB/AGMC would cost $31.3 million, result in an annual savings of $3.8 million, and have an 8-year payback period for closure and relocation expenses. In our report on the base closure and realignment recommendations and selection process, we estimated that the Newark AFB/AGMC closure costs would be $38.29 million, with a 13-year payback period. BRAC determined that the AGMC workload could either be contracted out or privatized-in-place at the same location, although the BRAC noted that industry interest in privatization-in-place was limited. The BRAC recommended closing Newark AFB/AGMC\u2014noting that some workload will move to other depot maintenance activities, including the private sector. The President agreed with the overall BRAC recommendations dealing with maintenance depots, including the closure of AGMC. The Congress did not challenge the overall BRAC recommendations.

In general, the Air Force has developed a three-pronged approach to implementing BRAC\u2019s decision. First, four systems, representing about 3 percent of AGMC\u2019s existing depot maintenance workload, will be transferred to other Air Force depots. Second, ownership of the Newark AFB/AGMC property and facilities will be transferred to a local reuse commission. The commission is to lease space to one prime guidance system repair contractor that will provide depot maintenance work, one prime metrology contractor that will perform calibrations and author calibration manuals, and the remaining organic metrology program management contingent. While privatization-in-place is the goal, based on a strategy option announced in the Commerce Business Daily, contractors may elect to move workload to other facilities. Hypothetically, this option could result in all workload moving to other contractor locations\u2014should the winning contractor(s) demonstrate that moving workload to other locations would provide the best value to the government. Third, the metrology and calibration mission will be continued at AGMC, with some functions privatized and another continued as an Air Force activity reporting to AFMC Headquarters or one of the ALCs.", "The Air Force originally planned to privatize all activities related to the metrology and calibration mission, but it later determined that the Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program\u2019s materiel group manager function could not be privatized because it is a function considered to be \u201cinherently governmental.\u201d In performing this function, AGMC civilian and military employees provide policy and direction for all precision measurement equipment laboratories Air Force wide, inspect these laboratories for compliance with required policies and procedures, and procure calibration standards used in calibration laboratories.", "Current plans for the metrology and calibration program provide for (1) retaining about 130 government employees to provide the metrology and calibration management function\u2014with the Air Force leasing space at AGMC from the local reuse commission and (2) contracting out the primary standards laboratory and technical order preparation, which will also remain at AGMC, with the contractor leasing space from the reuse commission.", "The Air Force plans to retain ownership of mission-related maintenance and metrology and calibration equipment, which will be provided to the winning contractor(s) as government-furnished equipment. AGMC accountable records indicate the value of the depot maintenance equipment is $297.5 million and the value of the metrology and calibration equipment $28.5 million. Details such as the cost of the lease arrangement, allocation of utility and support costs between the Air Force and contractor(s), and the determination of whether the government or the contractor will be responsible for maintaining the equipment are not yet known.", "To manage the AGMC privatization, the Air Force established a program management office at Hill AFB. This office is responsible for developing the statement of work, request for proposal, acquisition plan, source selection plan, and related documents. The award is scheduled for September 29, 1995. Several key milestones leading up to contract award have slipped, compressing the schedule for the remaining tasks in the pre-contract-award period. Air Force officials describe this schedule as optimistic. After contract award, the Air Force plans to initiate a phased process for transitioning individual maintenance workloads to the contractor. Air Force officials stated that this 12-month transition period reduces the risk of interrupting ongoing operations and allows the contractor(s) an opportunity to build up an infrastructure and trained workforce. However, according to the program management office, a \u201cturn-key\u201d transition where the contractor becomes fully responsible for the AGMC workload at one point in time is the preferred strategy of the ALC system managers and may be adopted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Cost and Savings Raises Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Our work has identified several concerns regarding the cost, savings, and payback period for the Air Force\u2019s implementation of the AGMC BRAC decision. These include concerns that (1) the projected cost of closing AGMC has doubled and may increase further; (2) the $3.8 million annual savings projected to result from AGMC\u2019s closure is not likely to be realized because of potentially higher costs for contract administration, contractor profit, possible recurring proprietary data costs, and other factors that have not been considered in the cost computation; and (3) the payback period could be extended to over 100 years or never, depending upon the Air Force\u2019s ability to contain one-time closure costs and recurring costs of performing the AGMC mission after privatization.", "Recognizing that projected closure costs have increased, in August 1994, the Air Force base closure group validated a Newark AFB/AGMC closure budget of $62.2 million. This amount is $30.9 million more than the original projection of $31.3 million. Almost all of the increase is attributable to the estimated $30.5 million transition cost to convert from Air Force to contractor operation. According to Air Force officials, the original cost estimate only included costs associated with transferring and separating personnel under the base closure process and for transferring a limited amount of workload to other Air Force depots. They noted that DOD has no prior experience with privatizing a large, complex depot maintenance facility. Additionally, since the development of the closure and privatization option for AGMC was done quickly, the time available to identify all the factors and costs associated with this option at the time of the 1993 BRAC was limited.", "We recomputed the payback period using DOD\u2019s 1993 Cost of Base Realignment Actions (COBRA) model. We used the estimated nonrecurring costs validated by the Air Force in August 1994 (adjusted for inflation) and assumed that post-closure operations would result in $3.8 million annual savings as DOD originally projected in 1993. The model indicated that, with these costs and assumptions, the payback period would be over 100 years rather than 8 years as originally projected by DOD. However, DOD approved discount rate used in the COBRA model has been reduced from 7 percent in the 1993 BRAC process to 2.75 percent in 1995. Consequently, we adjusted the COBRA model to the revised discount factor\u2014holding all other variables constant\u2014and found the revised payback period to be 17 years. Achieving a 17-year payback is dependent on no further increase in one-time closure costs and achieving the $3.8 million annual post-closure operational cost savings originally projected by DOD. Our work has determined that neither of these assumptions is likely because of significant cost uncertainties.", "While the Air Force has recognized that an estimated $62.2 million will be required as BRAC funded costs of closure, it also recognizes there will be additional one-time closure costs not funded by BRAC. For example, an estimated $4.86 million will be needed to cover costs such as interim health benefits for personnel separating from government employment. Also, there will be environmental cleanup costs of some undetermined amount. Thus far, $3.62 million has been identified for environmental cleanup.", "As already indicated, we have also identified other potential closure costs that the Air Force has not included. One is the cost to acquire the right to provide data some equipment manufacturers consider proprietary to contractors expecting to bid on the AGMC maintenance workload. Proprietary rights involve the claim of ownership by equipment manufacturers of some unique information, such as technical data, drawings, and repair processes, to protect the manufacturer\u2019s market position by prohibiting disclosure outside the government. An Air Force official said cost estimates were submitted by four equipment manufacturers claiming proprietary rights, and these estimates were \u201cabsurdly high.\u201d While we cannot identify what these additional one-time costs will be, any unidentified costs push the payback period even further.", "At the time AGMC was identified for closure and privatization, DOD estimated $68.09 million annual cost for contractor operations and $71.84 million in net annual savings in personnel and overhead costs\u2014resulting in an estimated annual savings of $3.8 million. Recurring costs after AGMC closure and privatization probably cannot be determined with any degree of assurance until after contract negotiation and award. However, some Air Force officials have estimated that rather than achieving savings, annual recurring costs could actually exceed current costs of operations. For example, an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) memorandum noted that prevailing labor rates and private sector charges for similar items suggest that it will be difficult to keep the annual contract value the same as the current annual civilian salary\u2014a key assumption in achieving the originally projected $3.8 million annual savings.", "An AFMC analysis determined that, assuming these costs are comparable, additional costs for profit and contract administration could result in post-closure operation costs exceeding the current operation costs by at least $1.8 million. Additional costs for proprietary data and taxes could increase the post-closure operation costs by $3.8 million annually.", "A November 1994 AFMC memorandum informed system managers of increased funding requirements for AGMC workloads to cover anticipated increases in costs of operation under privatization-in-place. A December 1994 meeting of the Acquisition Strategy Panel confirmed the projected increases. For example, the projected fiscal year 1997 costs after privatization-in-place were about 107 percent higher than projected costs under government operation. Additionally, the projected costs of contractor operations for the 5-year period between fiscal years 1996 and 2000 were estimated to be over $456 million more than previously estimated costs of government operations over that period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Closure and Privatization Issues", "paragraphs": ["Other privatization issues relate to (1) proprietary data claims, (2) the effect of the closure on excess depot maintenance capacity, (3) the impact of privatizing core workload, (4) the segmentation of the metrology and calibration mission, and (5) the transfer of AGMC property and facilities to the local reuse commission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Proprietary Data Claims", "paragraphs": ["The proprietary rights to technical data is unresolved for some workloads to be contracted out and could greatly increase the costs of privatization. In this case, when contractors have a legitimate claim of ownership, the government cannot make this information available to other private sector firms that compete for the AGMC maintenance workload. The amount of depot maintenance workload at AGMC that involves proprietary data, the extent to which owners of proprietary rights are willing to sell these rights to the government, or the potential cost of this acquisition have not been determined. Air Force officials noted they are investigating possible methods for the prospective bidders to gain the necessary data rights as part of their proposal.

Since many of the systems and components currently repaired at AGMC are not repaired elsewhere, the AGMC depot maintenance capability does not generally duplicate repair capability found elsewhere. Where duplicate capability exists, consolidating like repair workloads and eliminating redundancies would be expected to generate economies and efficiencies. Currently, it is planned that almost all the AGMC capability will be retained in place for use by private contractors. The Air Force will retain ownership of depot plant equipment and the standards laboratory equipment, which AGMC accountable records indicate are valued at about $326 million.

According to Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance, core exists to minimize operational risks and to guarantee required readiness for critical weapon systems. The Air Force determined that 100 percent of the AGMC depot maintenance workload is core. AGMC is the only Air Force depot activity having all its repair workload defined as core\u2014with other depots\u2019 core capability ranging from 59 percent at Sacramento ALC to 84 percent at Warner Robins ALC. An AFMC memorandum noted some inconsistency in planning to contract out workload defined as 100 percent core, while continuing to support the need for retaining core capability in DOD facilities. However, the memorandum noted that the inherent risk of contracting out can be minimized if the workload is retained at AGMC as a result of privatization-in-place.

We discussed this issue with personnel from both the Army and the Navy who maintain similar organic capabilities to support service metrology and calibration management functions. They noted that from their perspective, contracting part of this work while maintaining most of it as a government activity would not be desirable. Navy officials noted that 100 percent of their metrology and calibration program management personnel were formerly employed in the primary standards laboratory. Army and Navy officials stated that the experience and training gained from their prior work in laboratories was essential to performance of program management responsibilities.", "We questioned the viability of having the Air Force interservice its metrology and calibration activities to the Army and/or the Navy, which have similar activities. Army and Navy officials said they believe it would be possible to combine the Air Force metrology and calibration function with that of one or both of the other services. Air Force officials said they considered interservicing but determined that neither the Army nor the Navy facilities meet the tolerances required for calibrating some Air Force equipment or have the capacity to assume the Air Force workload. Army and Navy officials stated that an existing memorandum of agreement among the three military departments provides that if one of the primary standards laboratories loses its capability, the remaining laboratories would assist in meeting calibration requirements.

Whether this transfer will take place is unclear since (1) the fair market value has not been determined and (2) agreements as to the cost of the property or means of payment and as to whether the reuse commission is willing to assume responsibility for operating the property and facilities have not been reached. To effect property transfer at below estimated fair market value, the Secretary of the Air Force must explain the cost and approve the transfer.
