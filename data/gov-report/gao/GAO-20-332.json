Although the Air  Force has been working to improve its risk management and internal  control practices, including remediation of deficiencies in its internal  control over financial reporting related to mission-critical assets, it still  faces significant challenges.

Without an effective ERM governance structure, there is an increased risk  that the Air Force will not properly identify, assess, and respond to  significant entity-level risks.
