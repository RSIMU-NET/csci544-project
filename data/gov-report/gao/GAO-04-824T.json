States, counties, cities, tribal governments, and  the private sector also use geospatial information to support critical  functions.

One of the committee\u2019s  responsibilities is to establish a National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse to  provide Web-based access to descriptions of available geospatial data,  allowing governments at all levels, academia, and the private sector to  make their data widely available. In addition to the clearinghouse, more  recently, in 2002, OMB established the Geospatial One-Stop initiative to  develop an Internet portal to provide easier, faster, and less expensive  access to geospatial information for all levels of government and the  public. Both the clearinghouse and Geospatial One-Stop, along with many  other coordination activities, contribute to the development of the  National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).", "My testimony today follows up on testimony provided to the  Subcommittee in June 2003.

As long as  standard processes and formats have been used to facilitate integration,  each of these themes could be based on data originally collected and  maintained by a separate organization.

According to the USGS Associate  Director for Geography, USGS is currently working to develop  relationships with FEMA and DOD, along with other federal agencies, to  determine where these agencies\u2019 data-collection activities overlap.", "In another example, officials at the Department of Agriculture and the  National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) both said they have  purchased data sets containing street-centerline data from commercial  sources, even though the Census Bureau maintains such data in its TIGER  database. According to these officials, they purchased the data  commercially because they had concerns about the accuracy of the TIGER  data. The Census Bureau is currently working to enhance its TIGER data  in preparation for the 2010 census, and a major objective of the project is  to improve the accuracy of its street location data. However, despite  Agriculture and NGA\u2019s use of street location data, Census did not include  either agency in the TIGER enhancement project plan\u2019s list of agencies  that will be affected by the initiative. Without better coordination,  agencies such as Agriculture and NGA are likely to continue to need to  purchase redundant commercial data sets in the future.", "In summary, although various cross-government committees and  initiatives, individual federal agencies, and OMB have each taken actions  to coordinate the government\u2019s geospatial investments across agencies  and with state and local governments, agencies continue to purchase and  maintain uncoordinated and duplicative geospatial investments. Without  better coordination, such duplication is likely to continue. In order to  improve the coordination of federal geospatial investments, our report  recommends that the Director of OMB and the Secretary of the Interior  direct the development of a national geospatial data strategy with  outcome-related goals and objectives; a plan for how the goals and  objectives are to be achieved; identification of key risk factors; and  performance measures. Our report also recommends that the Director of  OMB develop criteria for assessing the extent of interagency coordination  on proposals for potential geospatial investments. Based on these criteria,  funding for potential geospatial investments should be delayed or denied  when coordination is not adequately addressed in agencies\u2019 proposals.  Finally, our report provides specific recommendations to the Director of  OMB in order to strengthen the agency\u2019s oversight actions to more  effectively coordinate federal geospatial data and systems acquisitions and  thereby reduce potentially redundant investments.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my testimony.
