Without such matching, there is a substantial risk that (1) fraudulent or erroneous payments may be made without being detected and (2) cumulative amounts of disbursements may exceed appropriated amounts and other legal limits.", "Long-standing problems have plagued DOD\u2019s efforts to properly match disbursements with obligations. Since 1980, we have issued 12 reportspertaining to DOD\u2019s disbursement problems, including negative unliquidated obligations (ULOs) recorded in DOD\u2019s accounting records and overpayments made to contractors.

For example, the Directive states that these systems are to ensure that funds are used only for congressionally authorized purposes and that payments are not to exceed amounts available.", "In order to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, DOD organizations\u2019 accounting and fund control systems must be able to record disbursements as expenditures of appropriations and as reductions of previously recorded obligations. Proper matching of disbursements with related obligations is necessary to ensure that the agency has reliable information on the amount of funds available for obligation and expenditure.", "DOD\u2019s administrative control procedures are intended to prevent unauthorized disbursements and purchases and to ensure that DOD organizations do not obligate or spend more funds than the Congress has appropriated. These control procedures require DOD organizations to (1) commit or administratively reserve funds based on firm procurement directives, orders, requisitions, or requests, (2) record obligations in appropriation account(s) when they place an order, award a contract, or receive a service, and (3) match disbursements with the related obligations in the accounting records as payments are made.", "Certain DOD organizations commit and obligate funds, and other DOD offices generally disburse the funds. For example, during fiscal year 1993, the Columbus Center of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), one of DOD\u2019s major contract paying activities, administered over 370,000 contracts valued at $482 billion and paid over 1 million invoices totaling $64 billion. Disbursing offices, such as DFAS-Columbus, are required to ensure that (1) payments are made only for goods and services authorized by purchase orders, contracts, or other authorizing documents, (2) the government received and accepted the goods and services, and (3) payment amounts are accurately computed. They are also responsible for ensuring that accounting data on payment supporting documents are complete and accurate.", "In order to match disbursements with the corresponding obligations and record the transactions into the accounting records, the disbursement data must flow from the activity making the disbursements (paying activity) to the activity responsible for matching the payment to its corresponding obligation and recording the transaction in the accounting records (accountable activity). The flow of data from the paying activity to the accountable activity varies by military service. For example, Air Force transactions generally flow from the paying activities through the DFAS-Denver Center to the Air Force accountable activities. Navy disbursements flow essentially the same way, except the data flows through the DFAS-Cleveland Center to the accountable activities. The Army uses a more simplified flow: its disbursements generally flow from the paying activity directly to the Army accountable activity if the paying activity is an Army activity or the DFAS-Columbus Center. Disbursements made for the Army by the Air Force, Navy, and non-DOD organizations flow through the DFAS-Indianapolis Center to the Army accountable activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To measure DOD\u2019s progress in resolving problem disbursements and evaluate DOD\u2019s criteria for identifying and reporting on disbursements that could not be properly matched to obligations, we met with the DFAS officials responsible for identifying the universe of transactions to discuss and assess how they determined if all disbursements not properly matched with obligations were included and correctly reported. We also analyzed the criteria DOD used to establish the $19.1 billion as its benchmark for reporting progress in correcting disbursements not properly matched to obligations.", "We obtained the dollar values of disbursements discussed in this report from agency reports or compiled them from agency records.

To assess the DOD team\u2019s progress in addressing these weaknesses, we spoke with team officials at DFAS centers and headquarters and reviewed various progress reports and other internal documents on disbursement problems and corrective actions taken or planned.", "We performed our work at the offices of the DOD Comptroller, Washington, D.C.; the Air Force Materiel Command, Dayton, Ohio; the Army Materiel Command, Alexandria, Virginia; Headquarters, DFAS, Arlington, Virginia; and the following DFAS Centers: Denver, Colorado; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kansas City, Missouri; Columbus, Ohio; and Cleveland, Ohio. Our work was performed between November 1993 and September 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "As agreed with your offices, we did not obtain written DOD comments on a draft of this report.

These officials generally agreed with our findings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Made Some Progress in Reducing Problem Disbursement Transactions", "paragraphs": ["DOD reported that it had reduced its problem disbursements from the benchmark figure of $19.1 billion to $9.7 billion\u2014a $9.4 billion reduction\u2014as of June 30, 1994. Although we agree that DOD has made some progress, DOD\u2019s reduction was actually $5.8 billion. We found that $3.6 billion of the reported reduction was for problem disbursements that the Navy reclassified as negative ULOs\u2014which still must be resolved.", "According to the DOD team leader, prior to December 1993, one of the Navy\u2019s accounting systems would not accept a payment transaction if it would result in a negative ULO. Instead, the Navy\u2019s system would reject such transactions to a suspense file that included disbursements that had not been matched to obligations. When DOD established the June 1993 benchmark for Navy transactions, it included the amounts in the suspense file and\u2014therefore, the Navy negative ULOs\u2014in the $19.1 billion benchmark.", "In December 1993, the Navy changed its system procedures and began processing the rejected transactions as negative ULOs. At that time, DOD reclassified these transactions as negative ULOs and took them off the \u201cproblem\u201d list. We informed DOD on several occasions that while these transactions were properly reclassified as negative ULOs, they should not have been removed from the \u201cproblem\u201d list simply because they were reclassified from one category of problem transaction to another. Although the officials agreed that the negative ULOs were problem disbursements that still needed to be resolved, they continued to report them as resolved in measuring and reporting on DOD\u2019s progress to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee on Government Operations, Legislation and National Security Subcommittee. For example, on April 12, 1994, the DOD Comptroller testified before the Senate Committee that as of February 1, 1994, DOD had reduced the $19.1 billion benchmark figure by $7.1 billion.

As a result, DOD significantly understated the magnitude of problem disbursements by billions of dollars. After we brought this to DOD officials\u2019 attention, DOD began, in March 1994, to collect data on the problem disbursement transactions that were not originally included under the criteria DOD used to establish its benchmark. Using the revised criteria, our analysis showed that DOD\u2019s records contained at least $24.8 billion in problem disbursement transactions as of June 30, 1994. DOD Comptroller officials stated that they plan to update the original benchmark figure to show DOD\u2019s total disbursement problem but could not tell us when it would be reported.", "The original criteria DOD used to define problem disbursements and the revised criteria DOD began using in March 1994 differed in several ways. According to DOD Comptroller officials, this was DOD\u2019s first effort to quantify its overall disbursement problem. In order to establish a benchmark amount in a reasonable period of time, DOD officials stated, they initially focused on known problems to establish their criteria for defining problem transactions.", "As a result, DOD did not identify certain categories of problem disbursements which should have been included to more fully disclose the extent of the disbursement problem. Specifically, as discussed in the following sections, DOD (1) used net rather than gross disbursement balances, which significantly lowered the amount reported, (2) did not include disbursement problems for certain activities in its figures, and (3) did not consider certain disbursement transactions if initial matching efforts had not been attempted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Netting Positive and Negative Balances Lowered Reported Totals", "paragraphs": ["We found that some DOD activities had been offsetting positive and negative balances, thus reporting lower amounts.

At our request, DFAS-Denver developed a computer program to identify and summarize its negative ULO transactions without netting them with the positive amounts. Using this program, DFAS-Denver reran the March 1994 data and found that its negative ULO balances totaled about $7 billion, which was more than 11 times the $630 million of net balances reported to DFAS headquarters. Since DFAS-Denver did not previously maintain gross data on negative ULO balances, it could not provide us with any trend data prior to March 1994. However, DFAS-Denver officials acknowledged that they previously had always used net values in their reports to DFAS headquarters. After we brought this to the DFAS officials\u2019 attention, DFAS-Denver included the gross negative ULO amounts in its June 1994 and subsequent progress reports.", "In April 1994, DFAS-Denver began to assign staff to review and correct the $7 billion of negative ULO balances.

Specifically, DOD (which had most of the \u201cM\u201d and merged surplus authority accounts) had been expending funds from these accounts without sufficient assurance that authority for such expenditures existed or in ways that the Congress did not intend. The Congress was particularly concerned about (1) the large balances available to DOD in the \u201cM\u201d and merged surplus accounts, which totaled a reported $50 billion at the time of the new law, (2) DOD\u2019s access to and routine use of hundreds of millions of dollars from the \u201cM\u201d accounts and merged surplus authority to cover contract cost increases, and (3) lack of congressional oversight over these accounts.", "The Congress passed Public Law 101-510 to strengthen its oversight and control over expired appropriations. The law, enacted on November 5, 1990, canceled the budget authority associated with obligations recorded in \u201cM\u201d accounts in stages, with the final cancellation occurring on September 30, 1993. The new law also required agencies to maintain records for each expired appropriation account reflecting obligated and unobligated balances by year for 5 years and cancellation of obligated and unobligated balances for other appropriation accounts 5 years after the budget authority expires regardless of whether or not goods or services contracted for have yet been provided or paid for. Accordingly, an additional year of appropriation accounts was canceled on September 30, 1994, and other appropriation accounts will be canceled each fiscal year thereafter as each rolling 5-year period ends.", "In order to ensure that obligations and expenditures do not exceed the amounts appropriated, agencies will have to maintain adequate records by fiscal year of obligated, unobligated, and expended balances of current, expired, and canceled budget authority.", "The Congress, aware of particular problems with DOD\u2019s handling of its \u201cM\u201d accounts, also included in Public Law 101-510 a requirement that DOD audit all its \u201cM\u201d accounts by December 31, 1991. One purpose of the audit was to establish the total balances of \u201cM\u201d accounts. Therefore, to achieve this purpose, DOD would need to properly match disbursements with obligations associated with those accounts.", "In April 1993, we reported that as of September 30, 1992\u2014or 9 months after the audit of its \u201cM\u201d accounts was to be completed and nearly 2 years after the passage of Public Law 101-510\u2014DOD had still not finished its review of \u201cM\u201d account balances. At that time, DOD stated that it would complete its review by September 30, 1993\u2014the date that the final \u201cM\u201d account balances were to be canceled. As that date approached, the Department of the Treasury sought our opinion on whether it was authorized to continue accepting agency adjustments to canceled DOD \u201cM\u201d account balances after the September 30, 1993, cutoff in order to properly record disbursements associated with those accounts. We stated that the Department of the Treasury could make these adjustments to reflect the completion of accounting transactions that occurred before the accounts were closed. In response to our opinion, the Department of the Treasury granted agencies until May 31, 1994, to post disbursements that had not been previously matched to obligations.", "In February 1994, we advised the Secretary of Defense that DOD still had billions of dollars of disbursements that had not been properly matched to obligations, many of which were in the \u201cM\u201d accounts, and asked how DOD planned to deal with the situation.", "In May 1994, the DOD Deputy Comptroller for Financial Systems responded that it was unlikely that DOD could identify and correct all disbursement problems by the May 31, 1994, deadline established by the Department of the Treasury. He also asserted that there was no avenue for correcting errors attributable to closed accounts after the deadline.", "We disagree with DOD\u2019s assertion that it no longer has an avenue to resolve problem disbursements associated with its canceled \u201cM\u201d accounts. As a result of accounts being canceled under Public Law 101-510, agencies must find a source of funds to pay otherwise valid obligations that did not become payable until after the originally chargeable account was canceled. The law provides that with certain limitations, agencies may pay such obligations out of currently available appropriations.", "One limitation on this authority is that agencies must be able to demonstrate that there would have been enough unexpended funds in the canceled account to make the payment. Agencies could do this by showing that there is a sufficient unexpended balance in the Department of the Treasury account for the appropriation to make the payment. However, an account maintained by the Department of the Treasury ceases to exist once it is canceled under Public Law 101-510. Therefore, agencies will have to use their own accounting records as a basis for demonstrating that the payment could have been made from the canceled account.", "To do this, DOD must maintain current and accurate records of disbursements attributable to both the canceled \u201cM\u201d accounts and any subsequent canceled accounts in order to justify using current appropriations to make payments attributable to these previously closed accounts. Therefore, DOD must reconcile the about $5 billion of problem disbursements related to canceled \u201cM\u201d accounts that had not been properly matched to obligations as of June 30, 1994. This procedure is necessary to ensure that payments do not exceed the originally appropriated amounts and result in Antideficiency Act violations.

These weaknesses are cited in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s fiscal year 1993 Annual Statement of Assurance under the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act. In March 1994, the DOD Comptroller issued guidance aimed at reducing disbursements made in excess of recorded obligations.

However, this will not be an easy task given DOD\u2019s years of sloppy bookkeeping, the failure to observe and enforce rudimentary control features over its disbursement process, and serious deficiencies in DOD\u2019s contract pay and accounting systems. For example, we found that DOD continues to experience serious internal control weaknesses over one of its computer-based disbursement systems, the Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), which is used to administer contracts and pay invoices at DFAS-Columbus. MOCAS records showed that as of June 30, 1994, 2,551 contracts were overdisbursed by a total of $1 billion. This was a $612 million increase in overdisbursed contracts at that location since July 1993.", "DFAS-Columbus officials told us that they did not have any reports to show how long the contracts had been in a negative status. They also stated that most of the overdisbursements were probably caused by errors in recording the disbursements or obligations. They noted that until detailed reviews of the 2,551 contracts were completed, they would not know how much, if any, of the $1 billion of recorded overdisbursements resulted from overpayments or whether they were caused by accounting errors.", "We agree that each of the 2,551 contracts will have to be reviewed to determine if contractors were overpaid. We also believe that there is a good possibility that some overpayments may have occurred. For example, we recently reported that during a 6-month period, hundreds of contractors returned about 4,000 checks totaling $751 million to DFAS-Columbus.

However, this will be a difficult task since DOD\u2019s disbursing process is very complex and decentralized. For example, in the DOD Comptroller\u2019s April 12, 1994, testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, he noted that the purchase of an F-18 aircraft can take as many as 105 paper transactions and involve different functional areas, such as budgeting, contracting, and accounting. According to the Comptroller, the purchasing process involves separate chain-of-command organizations that must work together to accomplish the tasks, and an honest mistake in any one of the 105 paper transactions can produce inconsistencies that require extensive manual research to resolve.", "In light of the problems DOD has encountered in developing and improving its systems over the years, accomplishing CIM\u2019s objectives will be a long-term effort. Therefore, DOD will have to continue to rely on existing systems to provide information on the amount of funds appropriated, obligated, and disbursed and to report this information to the appropriate congressional committees. Thus, DOD needs to pursue short-term efforts to improve the quality of the information in its systems. This can be as simple as complying with existing guidance and procedural requirements for (1) recording obligations prior to making contract payments, (2) detecting and correcting errors in the disbursement process, and (3) posting accurate and complete accounting information in systems that support the disbursement process.
