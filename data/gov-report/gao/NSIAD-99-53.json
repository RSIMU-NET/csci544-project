In deciding whether to grant a moral waiver, the services employ the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept: They consider the circumstances surrounding the criminal violations, the age of the person committing them, and personal interviews.", "As figure 1 shows, the services differ in both the way they categorize criminal offenses and the criteria they use for requiring moral waivers. In general, however, the services require moral waivers for convictions or adverse adjudications for criminal offenses as follows: (1) \u201cfelonies\u201d\u2014such as murder and grand larceny; (2) \u201cnon-minor (serious) misdemeanors\u201d\u2014assault and petty larceny; (3) \u201cminor misdemeanors\u201d\u2014discharging a firearm within city limits and removing property from public grounds; (4) \u201cminor non-traffic\u201d\u2014disorderly conduct and vandalism; (5) \u201cserious traffic\u201d\u2014driving with revoked license and failure to comply with officer\u2019s directions; and (6) \u201cminor traffic\u201d\u2014speeding and driving without a license. The services, except for the Army, also grant moral waivers for preservice drug and alcohol abuse. None of the services grant waivers for certain offenses, such as the trafficking, sale, or distribution of illegal drugs.", "Appendix I provides detailed information about how often and for what reasons the services granted moral waivers to enlistees during the fiscal years 1990 through 1997 period. Overall, DOD\u2019s Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) data for this 8-fiscal year period shows the following: moral waivers accounted for 62 percent of all waivers granted and represented 13 percent of all individuals enlisted; although annual DOD-wide enlistments fluctuated between about 162,000 and 223,000 during this period, the rate of granting moral waivers consistently declined from 17.5 percent to 7.8 percent of all enlistees\u2014a total decrease of over 60 percent; of the moral waivers granted, non-minor (serious) misdemeanors and preservice drug and alcohol abuse categories accounted for over 75 percent, minor non-traffic and traffic offenses for about 20 percent, and felonies committed either as an adult or juvenile about 3 percent; and the number of moral waivers granted in all categories decreased, but felony and non-minor misdemeanor waivers increased as a percentage of total moral waivers granted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Screening Policies and Procedures Are Extensive, but Record Checks Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["The services\u2019 policies and procedures for screening for criminal histories and granting moral waivers are extensive and are intended to encourage applicants to reveal their criminal history information.

First, the majority of the national agency checks are conducted without using an applicant\u2019s fingerprints to verify or search for records. Also, service policies and federal, state, and local laws and policies sometimes limit or preclude access to criminal history information, and the criminal history databases relied on by the services for record checks are incomplete. Of further concern is the services\u2019 practice of sending enlistees to training before the results of criminal record checks are received, which incurs unnecessary costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extensive Policies and Procedures Exist for Gathering Criminal History Information", "paragraphs": ["Each service screens for criminal background information in a similar manner. Figure 2 shows how the following screening tools fit in the recruiting process: (1) face-to-face interviews, briefings, and completion of forms; (2) law enforcement agency record checks at the state and local levels; and (3) national agency record checks conducted by the Defense Security Service.", "According to recruiting officials, screening to identify criminal histories begins when recruiters contact potential applicants informally\u2014over the telephone, at shopping malls, or in schools. Through interviews and briefings listed in figure 3, the services provide applicants with as many as 14 different opportunities to disclose any prior criminal offenses and convictions to as many as 7 different recruiting, military entrance processing station, and training officials. The recruiting officials also stated that security interviews are conducted for applicants enlisting in jobs requiring secret or top secret clearances.", "Applicants are required to complete the following forms used in obtaining criminal history information: (1) Record of Military Processing\u2014Armed Forces of the United States (DD Form 1966), (2) Personnel Security Questionnaire (SF-86), (3) the Police Record Check (DD Form 369), and (4) the Armed Forces Fingerprint Card (DD Form 2280). These forms elicit information on police record histories, drug and alcohol use and abuse, financial records and delinquencies, and any juvenile arrest or criminal activity. At this point, recruiters may request state and local background checks.", "After formal interviews with recruiters, applicants go to 1 of 65 military entrance processing stations to take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test; undergo a physical exam; submit fingerprints; participate in more interviews and briefings; and take their first oath of enlistment, which formally enlists them as unpaid members of the Individual Ready Reserve forces and places them into the Delayed Entry Program.", "Entry into the Delayed Entry Program signals the beginning of the national agency check. Most of these record checks are conducted using descriptive data\u2014an applicant\u2019s name, social security number, sex, date of birth, and race\u2014without using fingerprints. When the checks involve fingerprints, the services request a fingerprint verification\u2014a comparison of an enlistee\u2019s fingerprints against FBI criminal records to ensure that they are from the same individual whose name was associated with a possible arrest record identified through the descriptive data search.", "Also, during the Delayed Entry Program, recruiters are in contact with the enlistees and continue to inquire about their criminal background and any current contact with law enforcement agencies. If recruiters discover that enlistees have a criminal history or that they committed offenses while in the Delayed Entry Program, the enlistees may be discharged. After the Delayed Entry Program period, enlistees report again to a military entrance processing station where they undergo a second physical examination and more interviews and briefings and, if qualifications are met, take a second enlistment oath (which places them on active military duty). Subsequently, enlistees are asked again to disclose disqualifying information when they report to basic training, which lasts from 6 to 12 weeks depending on the service. By the 6-month point in their first terms, most enlistees have completed follow-on training in technical skills, though the length of such training can vary widely (from a few weeks to a year or more).", "Moral waivers can be initiated at any stage of the recruiting process\u2014during contacts with recruiters, visits to the military entrance processing stations, or the Delayed Entry Program. The level at which the moral waivers are approved depends on the seriousness of the offense. Waivers for the most serious offenses must be approved by the commanders of the recruiting commands in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force and by the two regional recruiting commanders in the Marine Corps. Applicants or enlistees that intentionally conceal any disqualifying information may be refused enlistment at any point during the recruiting process or, after enlisting, discharged for fraudulent enlistment.", "Quality control procedures have been incorporated into the recruiting process to ensure that recruiters do not conceal negative information about applicants. Each service (1) has established performance and moral character standards that recruiters must meet; (2) requires successful completion of a recruiter training course; (3) assigns some of its most senior recruiter personnel to military entrance processing stations; (4) conducts periodic inspections of recruiting activities; and (5) investigates all allegations relating to recruiter improprieties, which include an irregularity, misconduct, or malpractice. Malpractice, in particular, is considered by DOD to include willfully concealing disqualifying factors, misleading or misinforming applicants, or violating recruiting policies and procedures resulting in processing an ineligible applicant. Examples of recruiter malpractice include telling the applicant to not claim all dependents or to conceal bankruptcies or previous criminal history. DOD data for the 7-fiscal year period ending September 30, 1997, show that the percentage of recruiter impropriety investigations opened was less than 1 percent of the total DOD enlistments; the percentage of investigations substantiated was less than 0.1 percent of these enlistments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations Exist for Record Checks", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s checks of criminal history records are limited because (1) the majority of national agency checks are conducted without using fingerprints, (2) the services have limited access to criminal history information, and (3) criminal history data sources are incomplete."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Majority of National Agency Checks Are Conducted Without Using Fingerprints", "paragraphs": ["The services do not always require fingerprint verification because they do not believe the risk is great that enlistees will enter the service with undisclosed serious criminal histories, and they are concerned about the time and cost associated with fingerprint verification. However, it is the services\u2019 policy to conduct national agency checks with fingerprint verifications when (1) the descriptive data check reveals a possible arrest record; (2) applicants are aliens in the United States, prior service persons, or individuals who have criminal record activity; or (3) any information is revealed that may require more investigation for a security clearance. As a result, 73 percent of the enlistees in fiscal years 1992 through 1997 were checked for criminal history information at the national level using only descriptive data\u2014name, social security number, race, sex, and date of birth. Fingerprint verification checks were made on the remaining 27 percent, accounting for 32 percent of the cases in the Army, 25 percent in the Navy, 22 percent in the Marine Corps, and 20 percent in the Air Force.", "According to FBI officials, this fingerprint verification currently used by the services provides less certainty than a full fingerprint search, which compares an enlistee\u2019s fingerprints against all criminal records in the FBI files. For example, fingerprint verification does not assure the services that the search results are accurate if an applicant has used an alias not recorded in the criminal records. A full fingerprint search is required to positively identify the person and detect when they have used undisclosed aliases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Have Limited Access to Criminal History Information", "paragraphs": ["The services do not obtain or substantiate all available criminal history information because federal, state, and local laws and policies limit or prohibit access.", "DOD policy states that the military services shall obtain and review criminal history record information from the criminal justice system and Defense Security Service to determine whether applicants are acceptable for enlistment and for assignment to special programs. However, under the Security Clearance Information Act (5 U.S.C. 9101), criminal justice agencies are required to provide this information to DOD only when an individual is being investigated for eligibility for access to classified information or sensitive national security duties. These agencies, which include federal, state, and local agencies, are not required to provide this information for determining basic eligibility or suitability for enlistment (i.e., employment). DOD gains access to this information through the national agency checks, which are used for granting security clearances to enlistees. These national agency checks are initiated by military entrance processing station personnel for all enlistees soon after they enter the Delayed Entry Program and are employed as unpaid members of the reserves. Recruiters attempting to gain assess to this information for screening applicants prior to sending them to the military entrance processing stations, however, cannot obtain it when state and local laws and policies restrict access. The sooner applicants\u2019 criminal records are known to military managers, the sooner they can make informed decisions about whether to grant moral waivers.", "Section 520a of title 10 of the U.S. Code authorizes DOD and the services to request from state and local government criminal history record information regarding enlistees. However, state and local policies sometimes prohibit the release of information, or require fees or fingerprints to obtain it. A telephone survey of the states by the Navy Recruiting Command in 1996, showed that 43 states released information on crimes committed by adults. The survey also showed that 33 states charged fees ranging from $5 to $59 and that 18 states and the District of Columbia required fingerprints before releasing information. The Army has a policy to request local and state record checks for all applicants, but will not pay these fees, and therefore, does not obtain information from states that charge fees. The other services request these record checks only if an applicant admits to a criminal history. Navy and Marine Corps policy allows recruiters to pay for the checks; Air Force policy requires applicants to obtain the checks and pay any fees associated with the checks. Further, because the services do not take fingerprints until after local and state record checks have been requested, the services do not obtain information from 18 states and the District of Columbia.", "Finally, recruiters frequently cannot obtain information on applicants\u2019 juvenile criminal records. Generally, most state laws restrict access to juvenile records. The 1996 Navy survey showed that only three states release these records. In addition, under 18 U.S.C. 5038, federal juvenile delinquency proceedings\u2019 records are safeguarded from disclosure to unauthorized persons. Specifically, federal juvenile records may not be disclosed for any purposes other than judicial inquiries, law enforcement needs, juvenile treatment requirements, employment in a position raising national security concerns, and disposition questions from victims or victims\u2019 families. These juvenile crime records are likely to be a major source of criminal history information for the population targeted by military recruiters\u2014men and women generally 17 to 21 years old. However, according to Department of Justice officials, when juveniles are charged with serious crimes such as murder and rape, most states try them as adults in criminal court. Their records, if reported by states, are available in the FBI\u2019s national criminal records system. Criminal history checks, therefore, should identify many of the more serious juvenile criminal offenders who are tried as adults.", "In 1992, the Department of Justice revised its regulations (28 C.F.R. 20.32) to allow the FBI to collect, maintain, and provide authorized access to juvenile records for juveniles tried or otherwise adjudicated in juvenile proceedings. Before 1992, the FBI was prohibited from collecting juvenile records with the exception of those cases when a juvenile had been processed as an adult. However, according to Department of Justice officials, each state determines whether its own laws permit submitting these juvenile records to, or authorizing access through the FBI. Also, states may elect not to record the offense, and local law enforcement may decide to label the offense a status violation (truancy, for example) rather than a criminal violation. As of February 1998, about 213,700 (less than 1 percent) of the 37,857,111 criminal subjects in the FBI\u2019s identification records system were under the age of 18."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Criminal History Data Sources Are Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Department of Justice studies have shown for decades that criminal history databases are incomplete and, as discussed in the next section, they have funded initiatives for improvements. The FBI considers a record to be complete when all significant events, such as the arrest and disposition, are available. A complete record also includes the individual\u2019s name, social security number, age, sex, fingerprints, and other physical descriptive type information. According to FBI officials, completeness of the FBI database is dependent upon states\u2019 submissions of arrest information and court disposition actions, and the states depend on local agencies to submit information to the state repository. Reporting of this information by all levels of law enforcement agencies to the next higher level is voluntary and does not always occur.", "The Department of Justice periodically requests information from the states regarding the completeness of their criminal history databases. As of December 31, 1997, among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of arrest records that have final dispositions recorded varied greatly, ranging from 5 to 98 percent. Also, for arrests within the last 5 years, three states reported that less than 30 percent of their records were complete. Conversely, nine states reported that 90 percent or more of their records were complete for the same period. At the federal level, as of June 1998, the FBI database had a total of 76,427,487 active arrests, but dispositions were on file for only 46 percent of the arrests.", "According to a Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General, state criminal records systems tend to be more comprehensive than the federal system. This is particularly true in the case of non-felony arrests and convictions. Many nonserious offenses are either not reported to the FBI or, once reported, are not retained because they fail to satisfy retention criteria specified in regulation (28 C.F.R. 20.32). For example, the FBI is prohibited from maintaining nonserious offenses such as drunkenness, traffic violations, and vagrancy. The FBI database, however, includes reports of vehicular violations, which resulted in personal injury or property damage and driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Services Risk Incurring Unnecessary Costs When Enlistees Are Sent to Training Before Results of Record Checks Are Known", "paragraphs": ["The military services\u2019 policies allow enlistees to begin basic and follow-on training and, in some cases, enter their first-duty stations before investigative results of record checks are available. If the national record search does not reveal that an enlistee has a criminal history, results from the national agency check are usually received during the Delayed Entry Program. If the national record search reveals that an enlistee has a criminal history, the national agency check usually takes longer in order to positively identify the individual, obtain records, and in some cases, conduct an investigation. The results of this check may not be available until after the beginning of basic training. In some cases, an enlistee may be in a follow-on technical school or even at a first-duty station before the results of investigative reports are received.", "The frequency with which enlistees enter basic and follow-on training with undisclosed serious criminal histories and are subsequently discharged because of unfavorable record checks is unknown. The Navy, however, had limited data regarding the actions taken as a result of this unfavorable information. During the first 11-1/2 months of 1997, the Navy reviewed 2,368 enlistee cases that contained unfavorable criminal history information; 389 (16.4 percent) were subsequently discharged because of unfavorable information.", "When enlistees are discharged from service after beginning basic training, the services incur training costs that could have been avoided. On the basis of the Navy\u2019s 389 discharges, we estimate that the Navy incurred over $2 million in unnecessary costs. The other services could not provide data that would allow us to make comparable estimates. The services risk having to absorb these costs because they are trying to avoid the cost of not filling allotted training slots.", "Only the Army conducts an in-depth interview with enlistees whose record checks have not been received to determine the possibility of a concealed record and assigns them control numbers before sending them to basic training.

The Defense Security Service will be responsible for conducting a (1) national agency check using fingerprints; (2) local agency check, which requests local jurisdictions to provide criminal record information; and (3) credit check that provides information on financial responsibility. (Prior to January 1, 1999, the minimum requirement for background investigations for enlistees requiring secret and confidential clearances included the national agency check using only descriptive data, not fingerprints.) This new requirement will increase the quality of criminal history record checks for those enlistees filling jobs requiring a security clearance.", "Second, the Defense Security Service requested that, by January 1, 1999, all DOD activities exclusively use the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire, which replaces the paper version of the SF-86. The automated form allows personnel security data to be more efficiently recorded, checked for completeness, and transmitted in electronic form. Also, the Defense Security Service will be able to expedite its performance of background investigations and efficiently store information for future retrieval.", "Third, in July 1999, the FBI plans to implement the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System. The FBI developed this system to capture, submit, process, match, and store fingerprints in a paperless environment, which will permit electronic\u2014rather than manual\u2014fingerprint searches. With it, the FBI expects that (1) electronically scanned fingerprints will be more readable\u2014thereby eliminating the delays caused by rejecting smudged fingerprints, which must be resubmitted; (2) fingerprint matches will be more accurate because more fingerprint detail will be taken into account; (3) the turnaround time for fingerprint searches for DOD national agency checks will be reduced\u201424 hours instead of the current average of 16 days; and (4) the workload of full fingerprint searches for DOD could be processed in a timely manner without a significant change to current fees.", "Finally, during the last several years, the need to improve the quality of criminal history records has been one of the major challenges facing federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies. The FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division\u2019s Strategic Plan has a goal of having at least 80 percent of its criminal history records complete (containing both arrest and disposition information) by fiscal year 2003. Also, the Department of Justice has supported three major programs since 1988 that provide funding incentives to the states to improve the accuracy and completeness of criminal record information.

It noted, however, that implementation will depend upon availability of automated fingerprint scanners at the military entrance processing stations.", "Regarding the services\u2019 practices of sending enlistees to training and first-duty stations without having all available criminal history information, DOD stated that before directing such a change, a system needs to be developed to ensure a prompt turnaround time and allow the flexibility to process applicants without completed criminal history checks as exceptions to policy when criminal history information is delayed. DOD emphasized that enlistment screening will be improved with a system that ensures prompt availability of all applicant criminal history information, including that from state and local law enforcement agencies, including juvenile records.", "DOD noted that our report does not fully address its need for timely access to state and local criminal information at a reasonable cost. It noted that many records of youth crime do not reach national databases. DOD commented that the absence of complete data makes it difficult to evaluate enlistment waiver rates because the services cannot waive offenses they cannot identify. The Department of Justice also stated that DOD needs to obtain juvenile records presently protected under existing state laws. We agree that juvenile criminal records may contain information that would provide DOD with a more complete assessment of the criminal histories of applicants and our report generally describes limitations on access beginning on page 12. However, evaluating the pros and cons of access to juvenile records was beyond the scope of our review, and we clarified the Scope and Methodology section accordingly.", "The Department of Justice also emphasized that fingerprint verification currently used by the military services is not to be confused with, nor is it a substitute for, positive identification by a full fingerprint search. It believes that only through a full fingerprint search can the military be assured that enlistees have not fraudulently listed their identities.

Our objectives were to (1) determine how often and for what reasons the services granted moral waivers to enlistees and (2) compare the reasons for separation for those enlistees who entered the services with and without moral waivers. For sound analyses, we needed high-quality data that were accurate, reliable, and comparable. DMDC data, however, are of limited quality because enlistees may have entered military service without their past criminal history records being discovered and, therefore, entered without a moral waiver that should have been granted. Also, the services and the Military Entrance Processing Command apply moral waiver codes inconsistently, and the services differ in the way they use separation codes. Nonetheless, until the Department of Defense (DOD) completes its database improvements to standardize definitions and coding structures for enlistment and separation data, the DMDC data are the best available for describing DOD\u2019s experiences with granting moral waivers.", "Given these data limitations, however, the following analyses generally indicate that the number and percentage of new active duty enlisteesgranted moral waivers has consistently decreased during the 8-year period ending fiscal year 1997.
