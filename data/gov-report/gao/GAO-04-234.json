Family Court Act (P.L. 107-114) mandated that GAO examine the performance of the D.C. Family Court. GAO addressed the following objectives: (1) What procedures were used to make judicial appointments to the Family Court and what effect did qualification requirements have on appointment timeframes? (2) How timely was the Family Court in meeting established timeframes for transferring and resolving abuse and neglect cases, and what impact did magistrate judges have on the workload of judges and other personnel? (3) What progress has the D.C. Courts made in procuring permanent space? And (4) What progress have the Superior Court and District agencies made in sharing data from their computer systems? To address these objectives, GAO analyzed court data on its timeliness in resolving cases, reviewed the Family Court Act, applicable District laws, and reports required by the act; reviewed documents regarding the Family Court's progress in acquiring permanent space and those related to sharing data from the computer systems of the Superior Court and the District; and interviewed relevant District, Superior Court, and Family Court officials. In commenting on this report, the Superior Court agreed with our conclusions and cited additional progress. The Deputy Mayor for Children, Youth, Families, and Elders clarified the roles and responsibilities of various District offices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Superior Court and the District of Columbia used established procedures to appoint magistrate and associate judges to the Family Court, but an issue related to qualification requirements and other factors delayed appointments. One nominee expressed some reluctance to meeting Family Court training requirements. A second nominee was found to have had delinquent tax filing issues a few years prior to his nomination. The Senate Committee charged with approving the nominees determined that these issues were adequately resolved, but chose to defer their confirmation until other Superior Court nominees were approved. The Family Court met its statutory deadlines for transferring cases into the court from other Superior Court divisions and closed 620, or 19 percent, of these cases. The court has also decreased the timeframes for resolving abuse and neglect matters and magistrate judges have played a key role in handling cases. Several factors, however, such as shortages of substance abuse treatment services, posed barriers to achieving Family Court goals. To accommodate the operations of the Family Court, D.C. Courts--comprised of all components of the District's judiciary branch--has made progress in procuring permanent space for the Family Court. This new space, expected to be complete in late 2009, will consolidate 76 percent of the Family Court functions and associated personnel. The Superior Court and the District of Columbia have made progress in exchanging data from their respective information systems. In August 2003, the Superior Court implemented the Integrated Justice Information System, which is used to manage its cases and exchange data with other agencies. Although the District has developed a model to enable the exchange of data between various District agencies and the court, it has not fully resolved several critical issues we reported in August 2002. The District plans to address these issues as it incorporates solutions into the plans it is developing to modernize District agency computer systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Child abuse, juvenile delinquency, domestic violence, and child support  are some of the issues that fall under the jurisdiction of the D.C. Family  Court (Family Court). The Family Court, established by the D.C. Family  Court Act of 2001, was created in part to transition the former Family  Division of the D.C. Superior Court into a court solely dedicated to matters  concerning children and families. To assist the court in the handling of  such matters, the Family Court Act authorized the Family Court to hire  associate judges and magistrate judges (formerly hearing commissioners)  with expertise in family law; required the court to develop a transition plan  to transfer all family-related cases from other divisions of the Superior  Court into the Family Court and implement various case management  practices to expedite their resolution in accordance with timeframes  established by the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of 1997;  required a plan for space, equipment, and other needs; and required the  Superior Court to integrate its computer system with those of relevant  District of Columbia agencies to share information regarding children and  families.", "To monitor the progress of the Family Court, the Congress established  three mandates requiring that we assess various aspects of the court\u2019s  progress at different intervals. In response to the first mandate, requiring  that we assess the Superior Court\u2019s plan to transition the Family Division  to a Family Court, we reported that the Family Court had made progress,  but faced challenges in acquiring space to house all of its personnel and  developing an automated information system to support its operations, as  well as other challenges. In response to the second mandate, requiring  that we evaluate the Mayor of the District of Columbia\u2019s plan to integrate  the computer systems of relevant District agencies with the Superior  Court\u2019s, we reported that successful implementation of the plan was  contingent on resolving several critical issues, such as ensuring  confidentiality of electronic records and the quality of data exchanged  with the court. This report responds to the third mandate and agreements  reached with cognizant congressional offices to address the following four  objectives:  1.  What procedures were used to make initial judicial appointments to  the Family Court and what effect did qualification requirements have  on the length of time to make appointments of magistrate judges and  associate judges?  2.  How timely was the Family Court in meeting established timeframes  for transferring and resolving abuse and neglect cases, and what  impact did magistrate judges have on the workload of judges and other  court personnel?  3.  What progress has the D.C. Courts made in procuring permanent  physical space?  4.  What progress have the Superior Court and relevant District of  Columbia agencies made in sharing data from their computer  systems?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed data provided by the Family Court  on the status of transferred cases and its timeliness in resolving these and  other abuse and neglect cases. We also reviewed the Family Court Act,  applicable District laws, and the Family Court Transition Plan and  subsequent reports required by the act to identify qualification  requirements for judges and prescribed procedures for appointing  associate judges; reviewed documents regarding the Family Court\u2019s  progress in acquiring permanent physical space and those related to  integrating the computer systems of the Superior Court and the District;  and interviewed relevant District, Superior Court, and Family Court  officials. In addition, we interviewed child welfare and court experts, as  well as court officials in other jurisdictions, to obtain information on  potential best practices and a perspective on court operations in other  jurisdictions. We focused our review on abuse and neglect cases because  of congressional interest and the former Family Division\u2019s past problems  in handling such cases. We conducted our work between April and  December 2003 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Appendix I provides a more detailed discussion of our  scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The D.C. Family Court Act fundamentally changed the way the Superior  Court\u2019s Family Division handled its family cases. To transition the Family  Division into a Family Court, the Family Court Act required that the  Superior Court prepare a transition plan describing such things as the  function of the presiding judge and the number of magistrate judges, the  flow and management of cases, and staffing needs. One of the central  organizing principles for establishing the Family Court was the one  family/one judge case management concept, whereby the same judge  handles all matters related to one family. Judges in other court  jurisdictions, such as Hamilton County Juvenile Court in Cincinnati, Ohio,  report that implementing a one family/one judge approach in their courts  facilitated more efficient and effective court operations and improved  compliance with required timeframes of ASFA. The act re-established the  Family Division as a Family Court, which has jurisdiction over alleged  child abuse and neglect, juvenile delinquency, domestic violence, child  support, and other family matters. The act also established specific  qualifications for judges and extended their term requirements and  established various case management practices to improve the Family  Court\u2019s administration of cases and proceedings. Additionally, in creating  the new position of magistrate judge (formerly hearing commissioners),  the act specified that the magistrate judges would assist associate judges  in deciding how to dispose of cases and identifying cases that were to be  transferred from judges outside of the Family Court. To assist the Family  Court in meeting its responsibilities, the Chief Judge of the Superior Court  determined that the Family Court needed 15 associate judges and 17  magistrate judges. Twelve associate judges and 8 magistrate judges  initially joined the Family Court, creating the need to hire 3 additional  associate judges and 9 magistrate judges. The act specified that before  assigning individuals to serve as judges in the Family Court, the  individuals would certify to the Chief Judge of the Superior Court that they  intend to serve the full term of service and would participate in ongoing  training programs designated by the Family Court on various family- related topics.  The act also requires judges to have prior training or  expertise in family law.  New associate judges appointed to the Family  Court are required to serve a 5-year term, except for judges who  previously served in the Superior Court, who must serve 3-year terms.  Magistrate judges are required to serve a 4-year term. To support  implementation of the Family Court, a total of about $30 million in federal  funds was budgeted to fund the Family Court\u2019s transition from fiscal years  2002 through 2004.", "In addition to the D.C. Family Court Act, which required that all pending  abuse and neglect cases assigned to judges outside of the Family Court be  transferred to the Family Court by October 2003, other federal and District  laws establish required timeframes for handling abuse and neglect case  proceedings. ASFA requires each child to have a permanency hearing  within 12 months of the child\u2019s entry into foster care, defined as the earlier  of the following two dates: (1) the date of the first judicial finding that the  child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect or (2) the date that is 60  days after the date on which the child is removed from the home. The  permanency hearing is to decide the goal for where the child will  permanently reside and set a timetable for achieving the goal. Permanency  may be accomplished through reunification with a parent, adoption,  guardianship, or some other permanent placement arrangement. In  addition to ASFA\u2019s requirements, District of Columbia law establishes  deadlines for conducting trials to determine the veracity of neglect or  abuse allegations and dispositions to determine the remedy for confirmed  abuse and neglect cases. The deadlines differ depending upon whether  children remain in their homes or are removed from their homes. In  general, if children are not removed from their homes, both the trial and  the disposition must begin within 45 days of the filing of the petition  requesting that the court review an alleged abuse and neglect case. If  children are removed from their homes and placed in foster care, the  statute requires that the trial and disposition begin within 105 days of  removal from their home. To ensure that abuse and neglect cases are  properly managed, the Council for Court Excellence, at the request of  Congress, evaluates Family Court data on these cases.", "It is important that District social service agencies and the Family Court  receive and share information they need on the children and families they  serve. For example, Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA)  caseworkers need to know from the court the status of a child\u2019s case,  when a hearing is scheduled, and a judge\u2019s ruling. The Family Court needs  case history information from caseworkers, such as whether services have  been provided and if there is evidence of abuse or neglect. Recognizing the  need to share such information, the Family Court Act required that the  Family Court and the District government integrate their computer  systems to share essential information. According to District officials,  current plans to exchange information between the Superior Court and  District agencies and among District agencies are estimated to cost about  $66 million, of which about $22 million would support initiatives outlined  in the Mayor\u2019s plan issued in July 2002. According to District officials,  about $36 million of the $66 million would come from capital funds that  are currently available; however, they would need to seek additional  funding for the remaining $30 million. Currently, budget submissions are  being made to the District\u2019s Office of Budget and Planning for the fiscal  year 2005 budget. In addition to the $66 million needed to fund District  data exchange efforts, the total cost of the IJIS project to the Superior  Court is expected to be between $20 and $25 million, depending on the  availability of funds for project-related infrastructure improvements and  other project initiatives. Funding for this project is being made available  through the D.C. Courts\u2019 capital budget.", "The Deputy Mayor for Children, Youth, Families, and Elders and the eight  District agencies identified in the District of Columbia Family Court Act or  by the Mayor are responsible for defining the program and operational  requirements for data sharing and integration.

Public Schools, to lead the effort to define the  business and program requirements derived from the Family Court Act  and the Mayor\u2019s July 2002 plan to integrate District social services and  related information systems with the information systems of the Family  Court. The planned Safe Passages Information Suite (SPIS) is expected to  link disparate health and human services databases across the District to  provide individual case managers with critical information regarding  cross-agency servicing of children, families, and individuals within the  District\u2019s health and human services system.

JNC considered 37 applicants for the 3 vacancies,  29 of whom had previously applied for associate judge positions and 8 new  applicants.

While  the act generally required the transfer of abuse and neglect cases by  October 2003, it also permitted judges outside the Family Court to retain  certain abuse and neglect cases provided that their retention of cases met  criteria specified in the Family Court Act. Specifically, these cases were to  remain at all times in full compliance with ASFA, and the Chief Judge of  the Superior Court must determine that the retention of each case would  lead to a child\u2019s placement in a permanent home more quickly than if the  case were to be transferred to a judge in the Family Court.", "In its October 2003 progress report on the implementation of the Family  Court, the Superior Court reported that it had transferred all abuse and  neglect cases back to the Family Court, with the exception of 34 cases that  remained outside the Family Court, as shown in table 1. The Chief Judge  of the Superior Court said that, as of August 2003, a justification for  retaining an abuse and neglect case outside the Family Court had been  provided in all such cases. According to the Superior Court, the principal  reason for retaining abuse and neglect cases outside the Family Court was  a determination made by non-Family Court judges that the cases would  close before December 31, 2002, either because the child would turn 21,  and thus no longer be under court jurisdiction, or because the case would  close with a final adoption, custody, or guardianship decree. In the court\u2019s  October 2003 progress report, it stated that the cases remaining outside  the Family Court involve children with emotional or educational  disabilities.", "While the Superior Court reported that 4 of the 34 abuse and neglect cases  remaining outside the Family Court had closed subsequent to its October  2003 progress report, children in the remaining 30 cases had not yet been  placed in permanent living arrangements. On average, children in these   30 cases are 14 years of age and have been in foster care for 8 years, nearly  three times the average number of years in care for a child in the District  of Columbia. Table 2 provides additional information on the  characteristics of the 30 cases that remain outside the Family Court.", "The Superior Court also reported that the Family Court had closed 620 of  the 3,255 transferred cases, or 19 percent, as shown in table 3. Among the  transferred cases closed by the Family Court, 77 percent of the 620 cases  closed following reunification of the child with a parent or adoption,  guardianship, or custody of the child by a designated family member or  other individual. In most of the remaining transferred cases that had  closed, the child had reached the age of majority, or 21 years of age in the  District of Columbia.", "In addition to transferring cases to the Family Court, the Family Court is  responsible for the routine handling of all newly filed cases. For alleged  cases of abuse and neglect, complainants file a petition with the Family  Court requesting a review of the allegation. After the filing of the petition,  the Family Court holds an initial hearing in which it hears and rules on the  allegation. Following the initial hearing, the court may resolve the case  through mediation or through a pretrial hearing. Depending on the course  of action that is taken and its outcome, several different court proceedings  may follow to achieve permanency for children, thereby terminating the  court\u2019s jurisdiction. Family Court abuse and neglect proceedings include  several key activities, such as adjudication, disposition, and permanency  hearings. ASFA requires that a permanency hearing be held within 12  months of a child\u2019s placement in foster care. The objective of a  permanency hearing is to establish a permanency goal for the child, such  as adoption or reunification with a parent, and to establish a time for  achieving the specified permanency goal. Figure 1 depicts the flow of  abuse and neglect cases through the various case activities handled by the  D.C. Family Court.", "Data provided by the court show that in the last 2 years there has been a  decrease in the amount of time to begin an adjudication hearing for  children in abuse and neglect cases. Figure 2 shows median times to begin  hearings for children removed from their homes and for children not  removed from their home. As required by District law, the court must  begin the hearing within 105 days for children removed from their home  and placed in foster care and within 45 days for children not removed from  their home. Between 2001 and 2003, the median time to begin adjudication  hearings in cases when a child was removed from home declined by 140  days to 28 days, or about 83 percent. Similarly, the decline in timeframes  to begin the hearings was about as large in cases when children remained  in their home. In these cases, median timeframes declined by about 90  percent during this same period to 12 days. In both cases, the Superior  Court is beginning the hearings within D.C. law requirements. While the  reduction in timeframes for these hearings began prior to the  establishment of the Family Court, median days to begin hearings for  children removed from their home increased immediately following the  court\u2019s establishment before declining again in more recent months.  According to two magistrate judges, the increase in timeframes  immediately following establishment of the Family Court for children  removed from their homes was attributable to the complexity of cases  initially transferred to it.", "Similarly, timeframes to begin disposition hearings, a proceeding that  occurs after the adjudication hearing and prior to permanency hearings,  declined between 2001 and 2003, as shown in figure 3. As required by  District law, the court must begin disposition hearings within 105 days for  children removed from their home and within 45 days for children not  removed from their home. The median days to begin disposition hearings  for children removed from their home declined by 202 days to 39 days, or  about 84 percent, between 2001 and 2003. The median days to begin  disposition hearings for children not removed from their home declined by  159 days to 42 days, or about 79 percent. Therefore, the Superior Court is  also within the timeframes required by D.C. law for these hearings. While  the decline in the timeframes for disposition hearings began prior to the  Family Court, according to two magistrate judges we interviewed the time  required to begin these hearings increased in the 7-month period following  the establishment of the Family Court because of the complexity of these  cases.", "Despite declines in timeframes to begin adjudication and disposition  hearings, the Family Court has not yet achieved full compliance with  ASFA\u2019s requirement to hold permanency hearings within 12 months of a  child\u2019s placement in foster care. The percentage of cases with timely  permanency hearings increased from 25 percent in March 2001 to 55  percent in September 2002, as shown in figure 4.    result from the use of uniform court orders. However, other factors  continue to impede the Family Court\u2019s full achievement of ASFA  compliance. Some D.C. Family Court judges have questioned the adequacy  of ASFA\u2019s timelines for permanency, citing barriers external to the court,  which increase the time required to achieve permanency.", "These barriers include lengthy waits for housing, which might take up to a  year, and the need for parents to receive mental health services or  substance abuse treatment before they can reunite with the child. For  example, from January through May 2003, Family Court judges reported  that parental disabilities, including emotional impairments and treatment  needs, most often impeded children\u2019s reunification with their parents. In  nearly half of these reported instances, the parent needed substance abuse  treatment. Procedural impediments to achieving reunification included the  lack of sufficient housing to fully accommodate the needs of the reunified  family. Regarding adoption and guardianship, procedural impediments  included the need to complete administrative requirements associated  with placing children with adoptive families in locations other than the  District of Columbia. Financial impediments to permanency included  insufficient adoption or guardianship subsidies. Table 4 provides  additional details on impediments to achieving permanency goals.", "Associate judges we interviewed cited additional factors that impeded the  achievement of the appropriate foster care placements and timely  permanency goals. For example, one judge said that the District\u2019s Youth  Services Administration inappropriately placed a 16-year old boy in the  juvenile justice facility because CFSA had not previously petitioned a  neglect case before the Family Court. As a result, the child experienced a  less appropriate and more injurious placement in a juvenile justice facility  than what the child would have experienced had he been appropriately  placed in foster care. In other cases, an associate judge has had to mediate  disputes among District agencies that did not agree with court orders to  pay for services for abused and neglected children, further complicating  and delaying the process for providing needed services and achieving  established permanency goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Magistrate Judges Increased the Court\u2019s Ability to Process Cases, but Several Factors Limited the Gains Achieved", "paragraphs": ["To assist the Family Court in its management of abuse and neglect cases,  the Family Court transition plan required magistrate judges to preside over  abuse and neglect cases transferred from judges in other divisions of the  Superior Court, and these judges absorbed a large number of those cases.  In addition, magistrate judges, teamed with associate judges under the one  family/one judge concept, had responsibility for assisting the Family Court  in resolving all new abuse and neglect cases. Both associate and  magistrate judges cited factors that have limited the court\u2019s ability to fully  implement the one family/one judge concept and achieve the potential  efficiency and effectiveness that could have resulted. For example, the  court\u2019s identification of all cases involving the same child depends on  access to complete, timely, and accurate data in IJIS. In addition, Family  Court judges said that improvements in the timeliness of the court\u2019s  proceedings depends, in part, on the continuous assignment of the same  caseworker from CFSA to a case and sufficient support of an assigned  assistant corporation counsel from the District\u2019s Office of Corporation  Counsel. Family Court judges said the lack of consistent support from a  designated CFSA caseworker and lack of assistant corporation counsels,  has in certain cases prolonged the time required to conduct court  proceedings. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Superior Court  indicated that the one family/one judge concept does not apply to all  proceedings, and as a result multiple judges may preside over cases  involving the same child and family.  After consultations with Family  Court stakeholders, the court chose to apply the concept to juvenile cases  only after adjudication of the case.  Therefore, in all instances, a different  associate or magistrate judge handles the adjudication phase of a juvenile  case from the one responsible for all other cases related to the same child  and family.", "In addition, several judges and court officials told us that they do not have  sufficient support personnel to allow the Family Court to manage its  caseload more efficiently. For example, additional courtroom clerks and  court aids could improve case flow and management in the Family Court.  These personnel are needed to update automated data, prepare cases for  the court, and process court documentation. Under contract with the  Superior Court, Booz, Allen, and Hamilton analyzed the Superior Court\u2019s  staffing resources and needs; this evaluation found that the former  Family Division, now designated as the Family Court, had the highest need  for additional full-time positions to conduct its work. Specifically, the  analysis found that the Family Court had 154 of the 175 full-time positions  needed, or a shortfall of about 12 percent. Two branches\u2014juvenile and  neglect and domestic relations\u2014had most of the identified shortfall in full- time positions. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Superior Court  stated that the Family Court, subsequent to enactment of the D.C. Family  Court Act, hired additional judges and support personnel in excess of the  number identified as needed in the Booz, Allen, and Hamilton study to  meet the needs of the newly established Family Court.

As  the District resolves these issues, and agreements are reached, OCTO will  incorporate the solutions into its plans and activities.  In commenting on a  draft of this report, the Deputy Mayor for Children, Youth, Families, and  Elders said that the Children and Youth Program Coordinating Council has  established a subcommittee to evaluate the data-sharing issues, including  the relevant policies and laws governing that sharing. This subcommittee,  comprising agency program personnel, policy directors, legal support  teams\u2014including Office of Corporation Counsel and outside counsel\u2014and  OCTO staff, will make recommendations to the full Council for legislative  changes that may be necessary to support or allow some aspects of data  sharing.", "Data accuracy, completeness, and timeliness problems that have  hampered program management and operations\u2014Data quality concerns  are a high priority for the Mayor, and in turn, OCTO and its staff. Prior  studies have documented too many data errors resulting from human  error, inadequate business processes, inadequate controls and reviews,  and insufficient computer-assisted mechanisms that can identify errors or  inconsistencies. To correct these problems, OCTO is putting in place  infrastructure and software to support individual agency efforts to  improve data quality and reliability and strengthen their practices to  maintain higher levels of data quality and reliability. Once the  infrastructure is in place, OCTO will coordinate agency-specific efforts  within the overall Human Services Modernization Program initiative.  OCTO is putting together a comprehensive plan to perform a major data  cleanup with the key health and social services agencies and will provide  tools to help the agencies identify inconsistent data and potential data  errors. OCTO will work with agencies to identify data stewards who will  have ongoing responsibility for monitoring data accuracy.

For example, some information  systems do not reflect agencies\u2019 business process or support integration;  some are outdated, difficult and costly to maintain, and difficult to  integrate fully within a citywide integration infrastructure; some systems  can support agencies\u2019 business processes to some extent, but have severe  security limitations and cannot support interagency business processes.  OCTO plans to address these issues as part of its current efforts, and  incorporate the solutions into OCTO\u2019s modernization plans and activities.", "Human capital acquisition and management\u2014OCTO does not anticipate  any issues with the acquisition or management of human capital. OCTO  has the option of contracting for specific tasks, functions, deliverables, or  system components; contracting for fulfillment of specific project tasks; or  contracting for various combinations of functions. Alternately, the District  can determine the roles or skills it requires for time-limited technical  support and hire temporary employees to satisfy these needs.

We interviewed officials in the  Superior Court\u2019s Information Technology Division, the Office of the  Deputy Mayor for Children, Youth, Families and Elders, and officials in the  District of Columbia\u2019s Office of the Chief Technology Officer, responsible  for leading the District\u2019s efforts to integrate the computer systems of  relevant district agencies with the Superior Court\u2019s system. In addition, we  interviewed officials in all eight of the District agencies required by the  D.C. Family Court Act or by the Mayor of the District of Columbia to  exchange data with the Family Court. We interviewed these officials to  obtain their perspectives on their data exchange efforts. The eight  agencies included: the Child and Family Services Agency, D.C. Public  Schools, D.C. Housing Authority, Office of the Corporation Counsel, the  Metropolitan Police Department, D.C. Department of Mental Health, D.C.  Department of Health, and the D.C. Department of Human Services.", "In addition, to gain an overall perspective on court practices in other  jurisdictions, we interviewed judges in family courts in Honolulu, Hawaii;  Louisville, Kentucky; and Cincinnati, Ohio, by telephone. We chose these  court jurisdictions because they served populations similar to the D.C.  Family Court\u2019s and because of their experience in managing family court  operations. In addition, we interviewed court experts with the National  Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, National Center for State  Courts, Council for Court Excellence, and the American Bar Association,  to gain a perspective on court best practice standards. We conducted our  work from April through November 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: D.C.
