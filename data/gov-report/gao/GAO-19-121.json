We compared the number  of unserved veterans by using estimated veteran population data from  NCA as well as data from the U.S. Census Bureau. We estimated the  percentage of veterans served by multiplying the percentage of the area  of each census tract in the United States that falls within the service area  of an open veterans\u2019 cemetery by the estimated number of veterans in  the tract, which we derived from the American Community Survey 5-year  estimates for 2013-2017. We totaled these estimates at the county,  state, and national levels to calculate the estimated percentage of  veterans served in the United States. We determined the numbers of  unserved veterans in the actual and planned service areas of the  initiatives by using both NCA\u2019s county-level population data and census  tract data from 2013-2017 to compare the data from the two sources and  to assess whether access to burial options have been or will be expanded  or increased from the urban initiatives and increased from the rural  initiatives. The estimates of veterans within the service area of an open  cemetery that we derived from American Community Survey 5-year data  are statistical estimates that have sampling error associated with them.  We followed the Census Bureau technical guidance for estimating the standard error of census tract population totals from American  Community Survey 5-year data. We express our confidence in the  precision of our estimate as 90 percent confidence intervals. These are  the intervals that would contain the actual population value for 90 percent  of the American Community Survey samples that the Census Bureau  could have drawn.

NCA established this revised policy  threshold in recognition that many highly populated areas still lacked  reasonable access to a burial option, and based on data and analysis  provided by an independent review of VA\u2019s burial benefits program in  2008. This revised minimum veteran population threshold was chosen  based on data showing that state veterans\u2019 cemeteries funded through  VA\u2019s Grants Program were located in areas that typically served a  maximum of 80,000 veterans within a 75-mile service area.

This analysis also allows NCA to  project where additional state and tribal government veterans\u2019 cemeteries  may be most needed. Specifically, NCA has ranked what it identified as  the 40 largest currently unserved veteran population areas. NCA  performs this ranking at the county level, not the more precise census  tract level, although as we have previously reported it has the technical  ability to use census tract data.", "In September 2014, we reported that NCA was using population data at  the county level to identify veterans not served by burial options, and that  using population data at the census tract level would enhance NCA\u2019s  management of the national cemetery program. Specifically, we  recommended that NCA use its existing capabilities to estimate the  served and unserved veteran populations using census tract data. This  would have allowed them to make better-informed decisions concerning  where to locate new national cemeteries, as well as identify which state  and tribal government cemetery grant applications would provide  reasonable burial access to the greatest number of veterans. However,  VA did not concur with that recommendation. In its comments on our draft  report, VA agreed that census tract data may yield more precise  information than county-level population data, but it disagreed with our  conclusion that the use of census tract data would have helped VA to  make better-informed decisions regarding the location of burial options.", "For this review, we performed an analysis using census tract data to  examine the 40 prospective sites that NCA has identified as the currently  largest unserved areas, using current veteran population data. Our  analysis yielded estimates for veterans in the service areas for these  prospective sites that differed substantially in some instances from the  numbers used by NCA (see figure 5). For example, NCA ranked Erie,  Pennsylvania, as 4th on its list of prospective sites, based on its estimate  that an additional 45,154 veterans could be served by a cemetery at this  location. However, using census tract data we estimate that only about  10,000 veterans could be served there, resulting in a lower priority for  Erie, Pennsylvania, on this list of prospective sites. Similarly, the county- based methodology used by NCA ranked Decatur, Alabama, as 25th on  the list of prospective sites, while our methodology based upon nearby  census tracts placed it 2nd on the list by estimated number of veterans in  the service area. Thus, even though it could serve many additional  veterans, Decatur, Alabama, would not be ranked highly on the list for  funding using NCA\u2019s methodology.", "By using the more precise census tract data to help inform its grant- making decisions, NCA could enhance its ability to implement its plan to  provide burial options to unserved veterans. Comparing estimates of  unserved veterans based on current census tract data with such  estimates based on current county-level data can be a useful supplement  to NCA\u2019s current reliance on long-term projected county-level population  data. Comparing census tract data with county-level data could also  identify areas where the county-level projections might be overridden or  require additional scrutiny. This could position NCA to better identify  those areas of the country that will have the most significant unserved  veteran populations. Additionally, this could help NCA refine its current  plans or develop new ones, as it deems appropriate. We therefore  continue to maintain the validity of our 2014 recommendation for VA to  use census tract data to estimate the served and unserved veteran  populations to help inform its plans for providing reasonable access to  burial options."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By NCA\u2019s estimates, more than 2.1 million veterans\u2014about 10 percent of  the veterans in the United States\u2014did not have reasonable access to  burial options at the end of fiscal year 2013.
