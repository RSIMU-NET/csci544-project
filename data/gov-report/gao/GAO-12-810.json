DHS has been pursuing a third generation of the technology that will perform automated testing, potentially generating a result in under 6 hours and reducing labor costs.", "GAO was asked to examine issues related to the Gen-3 acquisition. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS used its acquisition life cycle framework to justify the need and consider alternatives; (2) DHS developed reliable performance, schedule, and cost expectations; and (3) steps remaining before Gen-3 can be deployed. GAO reviewed acquisition documentation and test results and interviewed agency officials from the BioWatch program and other DHS components with development, policy, and acquisition responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) approved the Generation-3 (Gen-3) acquisition in October 2009, but it did not fully engage in the early phases of its acquisition framework to ensure that the acquisition was grounded in a justified mission need and that it pursued an optimal solution. Critical processes in the early phases of DHS's framework are designed to (1) justify a mission need that warrants investment of resources and (2) select an optimal solution by evaluating viable alternatives based on risk, costs, and benefits. BioWatch program officials said that these early acquisition efforts were less comprehensive and systematic than the DHS framework calls for because there was already departmental consensus around the solution. Without a systematic effort to justify the need for the acquisition in the context of its costs, benefits, and risks, DHS has pursued goals and requirements for Gen-3 with limited assurance that they represent an optimal solution. Reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives could provide better assurance of an optimal solution.", "The performance, schedule, and cost expectations presented in required documents when DHS approved the acquisition were not developed in accordance with DHS guidance and good acquisition practices--like accounting for risk in schedule and cost estimates. BioWatch program officials said that DHS leadership directed them to prepare information quickly for the 2009 decision, which was accelerated by more than 1 year. Since DHS approved the acquisition in October 2009, the estimated date for full deployment has been delayed from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2022, and the original life cycle cost estimate for the 2009 decision--a point estimate unadjusted for risk--was $2.1 billion. In June 2011, DHS provided a risk-adjusted estimate at the 80 percent confidence level of $5.8 billion. Comprehensive and systematic information developed using good practices for cost and schedule estimating, could help ensure more reliable performance, schedule, and cost information for decision makers.", "Several steps remain before DHS can deploy and operate Gen-3. First, DHS must conduct additional performance and operational testing. This testing--estimated to take 3 years and cost $89 million--is intended to demonstrate full system performance, including the information technology network. To do so, the BioWatch program must address testing challenges including limitations on the use of live pathogens, among others. Following operational testing, DHS intends to decide whether to authorize the production and deployment of Gen-3. If Gen-3 is approved, the BioWatch program plans to prepare for deployment by working with BioWatch jurisdictions to develop location-specific plans to guide Gen-3 operations. DHS estimates show that about $5.7 billion of the $5.8 billion life-cycle cost remains to be spent to test, produce, deploy, and operate Gen-3 through fiscal year 2028."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that before continuing the acquisition, DHS reevaluate the mission need and alternatives and develop performance, schedule, and cost information in accordance with guidance and good acquisition practices.

However, GAO believes the recommendations should be enacted before DHS proceeds with the acquisition as discussed in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Soon after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, letters laced with  anthrax began appearing in the U.S. mail. During the incident\u2014known as  Amerithrax\u20145 Americans were killed and 17 were sickened in what  became one of the worst biological attacks in U.S. history. The intentional  use of a biological agent in this manner brought new awareness of the  threat posed by and the potentially devastating consequences of a  biological weapon. This awareness led to increased focus on developing  the ability to provide early detection of and situational awareness during a  disease outbreak. As we have reported in June 2010 and again in  October 2011, federal efforts to combat the risk of a biological attack have  included enhancing traditional public health surveillance and developing  new approaches to prevention, early detection, and treatment. However,  as we also noted, these efforts have not been guided by an overarching  strategy and leadership to help ensure that they complement each other  to efficiently and effectively mitigate as much risk as possible. In 2011,  the National Academies\u2019 Institute of Medicine and National Research  Council cautioned that new approaches to biosurveillance need to be  integrated into the overall prevention and response system, and their  cost-effectiveness needs to be evaluated in comparison with other  investments that could be made to attain the same goals.", "According to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10):  Biodefense for the 21st Century, a national bioawareness capability  providing early warning, detection, or recognition of a biological weapon  attack is an essential component of biodefense. To contribute to this national capability, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operates  the BioWatch program, which uses routine laboratory testing designed to  detect an aerosolized biological attack for five specific biological agents  considered high risk for use as biological weapons. The BioWatch  program is a federally-managed, locally operated system with collectors  deployed primarily in outdoor locations in more than 30 major  metropolitan areas. The technology currently deployed relies on capturing  air samples, which are then manually collected and transported to a  laboratory for testing\u2014a process that can take 12-36 hours and entails  labor costs for manual collection and analysis. DHS has been pursuing a  new technology\u2014which is to be the third generation of deployed  BioWatch technology, called BioWatch Generation-3 (Gen-3). The goal  of Gen-3 is to improve upon existing technology by enabling autonomous  collection and analysis of air samples using the same laboratory science  that is carried out in manual processes to operate the current system. In  essence, the new technology is to operate as a self-contained  \u201claboratory-in-a-box\u201d that, compared with the current system, would  reduce the time between potential exposure and confirmation of the  presence of biological pathogens and eliminate manual collection and  analysis costs.", "BioWatch Gen-3 has a history of technical and management challenges.  With a current estimated life-cycle cost of $5.8 billion (risk adjusted at the  80 percent confidence level) to procure and operate, it is one of DHS\u2019s  largest ongoing acquisitions. DHS will soon be confronted with deciding  whether or not to implement the next stage of the acquisition, which  includes initial production, testing, full production, and deployment. We  have previously reported on acquisition challenges at DHS, and though  DHS has taken steps to improve its acquisition management, it remains  on our High-Risk List as part of the department\u2019s efforts to strengthen and  integrate its management functions.", "DHS acquisition efforts are guided by a four-phased template for planning  and executing acquisitions. Among other purposes, this template serves  to help DHS ensure that acquisitions respond to a justified mission need;  to select the optimal alternative while balancing cost, schedule, and risk  realities; and to ensure that reliable performance, schedule, and cost  estimates are available to help guide decision making in every phase.  Expressing questions about whether DHS had undertaken rigorous efforts  to help guide such decision making, you asked us to examine several  issues related to the development, acquisition, and deployment of Gen-3.  This report addresses the following questions:  1.  In making its initial decision to acquire Gen-3, to what extent did DHS  use its Acquisition Life-cycle Framework processes to justify the need  and consider alternatives for Gen-3? 2.  To what extent did DHS ground the Gen-3 acquisition in reliable  performance, schedule, and cost expectations? 3.

Concerned with the threat of  bioterrorism, in 2004, the White House released HSPD-10, which outlines  four pillars of the biodefense enterprise and discusses various federal  efforts and responsibilities that help to support it. The biodefense  enterprise is the whole combination of systems at every level of  government and the private sector that can contribute to protecting the  nation and its citizens from potentially catastrophic effects of a biological  event.

The goal of BioWatch is to provide early warning,  detection, or recognition of a biological attack. When DHS was  established in 2002, a perceived urgency to deploy useful\u2014even if  imperfect\u2014technologies in the face of potentially catastrophic  consequences catalyzed the rapid deployment of many technologies,  including the earlier generations of BioWatch collectors.

In 2005, DHS expanded BioWatch to an additional  10 jurisdictions, for a total of 30. This expanded deployment\u2014referred to  as Generation 2 (Gen-2)\u2014also included the addition of indoor monitoring  capabilities in three high-threat jurisdictions and provided additional  capacity for events of national significance, such as major sporting events  and political conventions.", "Currently, the BioWatch program collaborates with 30 BioWatch  jurisdictions throughout the nation to operate approximately 600 Gen-2  collectors. These detectors rely on a vacuum-based collection system  that draws air samples through a filter. These filters must be manually  collected and transported to state and local public health laboratories for  analysis using a process called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).", "During this process, the sample is evaluated for the presence of genetic  material from five different biological agents. If genetic material is  detected, a BioWatch Actionable Result (BAR) is declared. Using this  manual process, the determination of a BAR can occur from 12 to 36  hours after an agent is initially captured by the air filter.

In the event of a BAR, the BioWatch Advisory Committee is  also responsible for determining whether that BAR poses a public health  risk and deciding how to respond. The declaration of a BAR does not  necessarily signal that a biological attack has occurred, as the Gen-2  detection process is highly sensitive and can detect minute amounts of  pathogens that naturally occur in the environment. For example, at least  two of the agents the program monitors occur naturally and have been  detected in numerous areas of the United States. Since 2003, more than  100 BARs have been declared according to BioWatch program officials,  but none were determined to be a potential risk to public health. Figure 2  shows the process that local BioWatch jurisdictions are to follow when  deciding how to respond to a BAR.", "To reduce the time required to detect biological pathogens, DHS has  been pursuing an autonomous detection capability for the BioWatch  program. Envisioned as a laboratory-in-a-box, the autonomous detection  system that DHS seeks would automatically collect air samples, produce  and read PCR results every 4 to 6 hours, and communicate the results to  public health officials without manual intervention. By automating the  analysis, DHS anticipates that detection time could be reduced to 6 hours  or less, making the technology more appropriate for monitoring indoor  high-throughput facilities such as transportation nodes. DHS also  anticipates that operational costs will be reduced through the elimination  of the daily manual collection and laboratory analysis process.", "Developing autonomous detection has proved challenging according to  BioWatch program officials, in part because some of the technology  required was novel, but also because even the existing technologies\u2014for  example, the air collection system and the apparatus that reads the PCR  results\u2014had not been combined for this specific application in an  operational environment before. As shown in figure 3, DHS began to  develop autonomous detection technology in 2003. Initially, development  of technologies to support autonomous detection was led by DHS\u2019s  Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), which partnered with  industry.

The  purpose of DHS\u2019s IPG is to communicate the Secretary\u2019s policy and  planning goals to component-level decision makers to inform their  programming, budgeting, and execution activities. As such, this specific  set of goals for BioWatch Gen-3 demonstrates that DHS leadership had  established a course for the acquisition by March 2008, in advance of any  efforts to define the mission need through the Mission Needs Statement  process, which was finalized more than a year and a half later.", "BioWatch program officials said they were directed by DHS to prepare the  Mission Needs Statement\u2014along with other required documentation for  the ADE-1 and ADE-2A decision gates\u2014on an accelerated time frame of  about 6 weeks to prepare for the ADE-2A decision, efforts that they said  would typically require at least 8 months. According to these officials, they  were aware that the Mission Needs Statement prepared for ADE-2A did  not reflect a systematic effort to justify a capability need. Although such  an effort would provide a platform to help make trade-off decisions in  terms of costs, risks, and benefits throughout the remainder of the  acquisition process, officials said the time they were given would not have  allowed for such an effort. They said that the department directed them to  proceed because there was already departmental consensus around the  solution.", "Moreover, in its fiscal year 2009 budget request, submitted in February  2008, DHS requested funding to procure BioWatch automated detection  sensors and initiate deployment activities of the automated sensor  system.

We  interviewed multiple officials in various DHS offices who had knowledge  of Gen-3 in this early decision making period and the process that DHS  used to justify the need to acquire Gen-3. However, none of these  officials could describe what processes, if any, the department followed to  determine that Gen-3 was a justified need. On the other hand, these  officials all described a climate, in the wake of the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks and the subsequent Amerithrax attacks, in which the  highest levels of the administration expressed interest in quickly  deploying the early generation BioWatch detectors and subsequently  improving the functionality of these detectors\u2014as quickly as possible\u2014to  allow for faster detection and an indoor capability. On the basis of this  interest, officials from the multiple DHS offices said it was their  understanding that the administration and departmental leadership had  already determined that the existing BioWatch technology would need to  be expanded and entirely replaced with an autonomous solution well  before the acquisition was approved at ADE-2A.", "DHS guidance states that the Mission Needs Statement should consider  the IPG, but it also directs the program to focus on the capability need  without specifying a specific technical solution. The Mission Needs  Statement is designed to serve as the foundational document upon which  subsequent Acquisition Life-cycle Framework efforts are based. As such,  a Mission Needs Statement that focuses on the capability need can help  articulate and build consensus around the goals and objectives for a  program in a way that provides a touchstone throughout the rest of the  acquisition processes as the program endeavors to identify optimal  solutions and contends with technology, budget, schedule, and risk  realities. The Gen-3 Mission Needs Statement prepared for ADE-2A, in  response to the very specific solution set prescribed by DHS leadership in  the IPG, asserted a specific technological solution\u2014total replacement of  the existing vacuum-based, manual technology with autonomous  detectors\u2014as the only viable solution. Because the Mission Needs  Statement was completed after DHS had prescribed specific goals for  Gen-3 in the IPG and requested funding to field an interim solution, it  appears to be justification for a predetermined solution, rather than the  deliberate and systematic consideration of capability needs that would  serve as the foundation for the remaining acquisition processes. As such,  its utility as a foundation for subsequent acquisition efforts\u2014for example  identifying an optimal solution and balancing mission requirements with  budget, schedule, and risk considerations\u2014was limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Did Not Use Acquisition Life-cycle Processes to Analyze Alternatives Based on Cost, Schedule, and Risk to Identify an Optimal Solution", "paragraphs": ["DHS did not use the processes in Phase 2 of the Acquisition Life-cycle  Framework to systematically identify the optimal solution based on cost- benefit and risk information. We have long advised that DHS make risk- informed investments of its limited resources. For example, in February  2005, we reported that because the nation cannot afford to protect  everything against all threats, choices must be made about protection  priorities given the risk and how to best allocate available resources.  More recently, we reported in September 2011 that because DHS does  not have unlimited resources and cannot protect the nation from every  conceivable threat, it must make risk-informed decisions regarding its  homeland security approaches and strategies. Phase 2 of the DHS  Acquisition Life-cycle Framework is intended to support these kinds of  trade-off decisions by requiring DHS components to complete an Analysis  of Alternatives that systematically identifies possible alternative solutions  that could satisfy the identified need, considers cost-benefit and risk  information for each alternative, and finally selects the best option from  among the alternatives.", "The Analysis of Alternatives is intended to provide assurance to DHS at  the ADE-2A decision gate that the component has chosen the most cost- effective solution to mitigate the capability gap identified in the Mission  Needs Statement. To provide this assurance and allow DHS to make  trade-off decisions, the guidance states that developing the Analysis of  Alternatives should be a systematic analytic and decision making process  to identify and document an optimal solution that includes an  understanding of the costs and benefits of at least three viable  alternatives. The guidance directs the program to compare the alternatives based on cost, risk, and ability to respond to identified  capability gaps. Finally, the guidance calls for an independent entity to  complete this analysis to ensure that it is done objectively and without  bias or vested interest in the study\u2019s outcome.", "The Gen-3 Analysis of Alternatives, completed in conjunction with the  Mission Needs Statement by the BioWatch Program Office, does not  reflect a systematic analytic and decision making process. Instead, the  Analysis of Alternatives, like the Mission Needs Statement, was designed  to support the decision the department had already made to pursue  autonomous detection. The Analysis of Alternatives maintained that no  modifications to the existing system would satisfy the goals in the IPG,  and as such, it concluded that replacing the deployed technology entirely  with autonomous detectors was the only viable solution. Along these  lines, the Analysis of Alternatives included two alternatives:  1.  expanding program coverage within current BioWatch cities and  additional cities by replacing all currently deployed detectors with  autonomous detection technology, and; 2.  undertaking the same expansion using the currently deployed  detectors but modifying the procedures to allow for filter collections  every 8 hours instead of every 24 hours (a time frame that by  definition would not meet the specific goals of the IPG).", "The analysis did provide some cost information for each alternative, but it  did not fully explore costs or consider benefit and risk information. As with  the Mission Needs Statement, program officials told us that they were  advised that a comprehensive Analysis of Alternatives would not be  necessary because departmental consensus already existed that  autonomous detection was the optimal solution.", "In discussing the cost trade-offs between the autonomous detection  solution and more frequent filter collection using the currently deployed  technology in the Analysis of Alternatives, DHS focused on cost per  detection cycle\u2014that is, the cost each time an autonomous detector tests  the air for pathogens or the cost each time a Gen-2 filter is manually  collected and tested in a laboratory. According to our analysis of the June  2011 Life-Cycle Cost Estimate, cost per detection cycle is estimated to be  seven times lower with the Gen-3 technology than the cost per detection  cycle based on historical data for Gen-2 detectors. However, by only  considering the cost per detection cycle of the two alternatives, the  analysis does not help ensure the pursuit of an optimal solution based on  cost, risk, and capability\u2014as called for in the guidance.", "To help ensure the optimal solution, DHS could benefit from a more  complex and nuanced cost analysis that considers a number of factors in  addition to the cost per detection cycle. For example, although not a cost- effectiveness analysis, table 1 shows that deploying and operating Gen-3  detectors is not necessarily more affordable than the existing Gen-2  deployment. According to our analysis, the total annual cost to operate  Gen-3 is estimated to be about four times more than the cost of the  existing Gen-2 deployment. The higher cost reflects both higher annual  operating costs per detector and an increase in the number of detectors  and jurisdictions covered.", "In addition to a limited cost analysis, the Gen-3 Analysis of Alternatives  contained no analysis of benefits. In fact, it did not identify any benefits of  investment beyond the assumption\u2014inherent in its focus on increasing  the number of detection cycles per day\u2014that earlier detection has the  potential to save lives and limit economic loss, a basic and accepted  principle for all enhanced surveillance efforts. In selecting the optimal  solution, other costs and benefit factors like the examples shown in table  2 could have been helpful.", "Identifying benefits and conducting a more complete analysis of cost and  benefits would help DHS develop the kind of information that would  inform tradeoff decisions and the selection of an optimal solution. For  example, DHS plans to deploy about four times as many Gen-3 detectors  than Gen-2 detectors, and each Gen-3 detector will test the air more  frequently, so the Gen-3 deployment plan will increase the depth and  range of the coverage to be provided. Specifically, Gen-3 is expected to  cover 90 percent of the population in the jurisdictions where it is  deployed, as opposed to 65 percent with the currently deployed  technology. On the basis of the estimated annual program cost and the  percentage of U.S. population covered, we calculated that the estimated  Gen-3 deployment will cost about $4 million annually, on average, for  each 1 percent of population covered within BioWatch jurisdictions (about  $2.7 million more for each 1 percent covered than Gen-2). Moreover,  according to Biowatch program officials, this kind of calculation may  actually underestimate the cost of increasing population coverage by  deploying more detectors, because the relationship between number of  detectors and population covered is not linear. However, because the  Gen-3 Analysis of Alternatives does not include a discussion of benefits,  or a cost-benefit analysis, it does not consider the extent to which  expanding the population covered under the proposed Gen-3 deployment  would contribute to a reduction of risk and at what cost.", "In its evaluation of BioWatch and public health surveillance, the National  Academies stated that the BioWatch program should not expand its  coverage of biological agents or jurisdictions without a clear  understanding of the change\u2019s contribution to reducing mortality or  morbidity in conjunction with clinical case finding and public health.  However, without a discussion of benefits, the Analysis of Alternatives  could not help DHS develop this understanding before approving the  acquisition at ADE-2A. In June 2011, the program office commissioned a  study from Sandia National Laboratories that began to develop a basis for  this kind of understanding of benefits related to public health outcomes.  However, critical information related to both the costs and the benefits of  the planned Gen-3 approach remains to be explored. DHS has  commissioned the Homeland Security Institute (HSI) to conduct an  independent study that has as its overarching objective the  characterization of the state of Gen-3 technology\u2014that is, whether it is  mature enough to continue as an acquisition or whether it needs  additional development work. As part of that study, DHS has asked HSI  to consider, among other things, (1) whether the threat is adequately  described, (2) whether it is possible to determine costs and benefits, and  (3) to what extent prior studies like the Sandia study have been validated  and used to inform plans for Gen-3 deployment. DHS told us that the  study would be completed by September 1, 2012. As of early-September  2012, DHS has not provided us with a copy of the study or responded to  requests to provide an updated timeline for the study.", "Beyond the uncertainty related to the costs and benefits of the planned  Gen-3 approach, there is additional uncertainty about the benefit of this  kind of environmental monitoring because as a risk mitigation activity, it  has a relatively limited scope. As the study committee for the National  Academies evaluation of BioWatch noted, there is considerable  uncertainty about the likelihood and magnitude of a biological attack, and  how the risk of a release of an aerosolized pathogen compares with risks  from other potential forms of terrorism or from natural diseases. The  report also notes that while the BioWatch program is designed to detect  certain biological agents (currently five agents) that could be intentionally  released in aerosolized form, detecting a bioterrorism event involving  other pathogens or routes of exposure requires other approaches. Given  the higher total estimated operating cost for the Gen-3 program, it is  important, especially in an increasingly resource-constrained  environment, to also consider the benefit\u2014in terms of its ability to mitigate  the consequences of a potentially catastrophic biological attack\u2014that the  extra investment provides. These scope limitations provide context in  both the consideration of mission need and in analyzing cost  effectiveness.", "Because the Gen-3 Analysis of Alternatives focuses on justifying total  replacement of Gen-2 technology with an autonomous detection  technology, it did not explore whether another solution might be more  effective. For example, according to BioWatch program officials, it is  possible that other options\u2014including but not limited to deployment of  some combination of both technologies, based on risk and logistical  considerations\u2014may be more cost-effective. Along these lines, program  officials told us that in 2011, to help them manage various budget  contingencies, they prepared a summary of available deployment options  for Gen-3 that includes a mixed deployment of Gen-3 and Gen-2 units.  However, a more comprehensive solution set was not available to be  considered at ADE-2A; nor has such an effort since been undertaken to  inform investment and trade-off decisions at the departmental level. Given  the uncertainty related to the costs, benefits, and risk mitigation potential  of Gen-3, DHS does not have reasonable assurance that the strategy of  expanding and completely replacing the existing Gen-2 technology with  an autonomous detection technology provides the most cost-effective  solution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Did Not Develop Complete and Reliable Performance, Schedule, and Cost Information before Approving the Gen-3 Acquisition", "paragraphs": ["In October 2009, DHS approved the Gen-3 acquisition at ADE-2A\u2014 based on the information contained in acquisition documents provided by  the BioWatch program\u2014authorizing the BioWatch program to proceed  with characterization testing of Gen-3 candidate technologies. One  critical purpose of the ADE-2A documentation set required by DHS\u2019s  acquisition guidance is to describe the expected performance, cost, and  schedule parameters for an acquisition. We reported in June 2010 that  stable parameters for performance, cost, and schedule are among the  factors that are important for successfully delivering capabilities within  cost and schedule expectations. We also reported in May 2012 that  without the development, review, and approval of key acquisition  documents, agencies are at risk of having poorly defined requirements  that can negatively affect program performance and contribute to  increased costs. However, the ADE-2A Acquisition Decision  Memorandum stated that significant data necessary for the proper  adjudication of an ADE-2A decision were missing. Specifically, it noted  that the ADE-2A documentation set did not contain three required  documents, including: (1) a Concept of Operations\u2014intended to provide  critical information on how an acquisition will function in the operational  environment, (2) an Integrated Logistics Support Plan\u2014intended to  document how an acquisition will be supported and sustained through its  life-cycle, and (3) a Life-Cycle Cost Estimate\u2014intended to provide a  credible estimate of the life-cycle cost of the acquisition. Additionally, we  found that certain information contained in the ADE-2A documentation set  on operational requirements, schedule projections, and cost were not  developed using reliable methods as discussed later in this report. For  more information on the limitations of Gen-3 acquisition documents and  processes at ADE-2A, see appendix I.", "As was the case for the Mission Needs Statement and the Analysis of  Alternatives, BioWatch program officials stated that they had to prepare  ADE-2A documentation quickly because ADE-2A had been accelerated  by 14 months. However, in the absence of complete and reliable  information, DHS had limited assurance that the acquisition would  successfully deliver the intended capability within cost and on schedule.  Nevertheless, the Deputy Secretary approved the acquisition, but she  required the program office to provide quarterly progress updates.", "On the basis of the Gen-3 documentation submitted at ADE-2A, DHS  expected to acquire a system that would cost $2.1 billion, be fully  deployed by fiscal year 2016, and meet certain performance  requirements. As shown in table 3, as of July 2012, the performance,  schedule, and cost parameters for the Gen-3 acquisition are significantly  different from the parameters DHS expected when it approved the  acquisition at ADE-2A.", "Regarding performance expectations, the BioWatch program submitted a  revised Operational Requirements Document to DHS for approval that  includes a proposed revision to the key performance parameter for  system sensitivity\u2014 the amount of a pathogen that would have to be  present in the air for the system to detect its presence. DHS acquisitions  guidance requires components to develop key performance requirements  that an acquisition must meet in order to fulfill the program\u2019s fundamental  purpose and close the capability gap(s) identified in the Mission Needs  Statement, and to document these requirements in an Operational  Requirements Document. However, BioWatch program officials told us  that the original sensitivity requirement was based on what DHS thought  the technology could theoretically achieve, and was not informed by a  scientific and risk-informed assessment of what level of sensitivity would  be needed\u2014from an operational perspective\u2014to fulfill the Gen-3 purpose  of mitigating consequences in the event of a biological attack.  Additionally, the process used to set the sensitivity requirement did not  reflect stakeholder consensus about how to balance mission needs with  technological capabilities. Specifically, the BioWatch program did not  prepare a Concept of Operations before ADE-2A. According to DHS  acquisitions guidance, in developing a Concept of Operations,  stakeholders engage in a consensus-building process regarding how to  balance technological capabilities with mission needs in order to gain  consensus on the use, capabilities, and benefits of a system. Because  DHS did not prepare a Concept of Operations before establishing  operational requirements, the sensitivity requirement did not reflect broad  stakeholder engagement in balancing schedule, cost, and risk realities  with achieving a specified mission outcome\u2014for example, a specific level  of population protection.", "During characterization testing, the candidate technology tested was  unable to meet the original sensitivity requirement. According to the  September 2011 Operational Assessment, the system sensitivity  demonstrated during characterization testing was orders of magnitude  lower than the original requirement, meaning that a significantly greater  concentration of a pathogen than specified in the requirement would have  to be present in the air to trigger detection. According to BioWatch  program officials, the original sensitivity requirement was set based on  interest in pushing the limits of potential technological achievement rather  than in response to a desired public health protection outcome. They said  that this led to a requirement that may have been too stringent, resulting  in higher costs and schedule delays without demonstrated mission  imperative.  Because DHS did not ground the sensitivity requirement in  Gen-3 program goals, when the candidate technologies were unable to  meet the requirement, DHS encountered delays and uncertainty about  how to move forward. In response to these concerns, the BioWatch  program directed Sandia National Laboratories to evaluate the level of  system sensitivity that would be necessary for the Gen-3 program to fulfill  its fundamental purpose. The study, which was completed in January  2012, contained findings that, according to BioWatch Program officials,  confirm that the sensitivity requirement could be relaxed without  significantly affecting the program\u2019s public health mission. In response  to this study, the BioWatch program submitted an updated Operational  Requirements Document with a revised sensitivity requirement to DHS in  March 2012 for approval in preparation for ADE-2B, as shown in figure 6.", "The need to reevaluate the sensitivity requirement for the Gen-3  acquisition has contributed to delays in the acquisition schedule. For  example, in August 2011, the BioWatch program requested to postpone  the ADE-2B, scheduled for September 2011, until December 2011 to give  the program time to address the testing issues associated with the  sensitivity requirement. Given that the Sandia study was not available  until January 2012, the program office again requested that ADE-2B be  delayed until March or April 2012. As of September 2012, DHS has not  approved the revised sensitivity requirement and plans to revisit that  decision at the next Acquisition Review Board for ADE-2B. DHS  acquisition guidance states that the accurate definition of requirements is  imperative if an acquisition is to be completed within schedule constraints  and still meet the component and department\u2019s mission performance  needs. It follows that these schedule delays could have been mitigated if  the original sensitivity requirement had been more realistically set using  scientific and risk information to ensure that it aligned with the mission  need of the program and balanced mission goals with technological  feasibility.", "In addition to the impact that changing the sensitivity requirement had on  the acquisition schedule, the change in schedule expectations since  October 2009 can also be explained by DHS not employing reliable  schedule estimation methods to produce the schedule estimate that was  submitted with the Acquisition Program Baseline in the ADE-2A  documentation set. Our prior work has found that realistic acquisition  program baselines with stable requirements for cost and schedule are  among the factors that are important to acquisitions successfully  delivering capabilities within cost and schedule constraints. However,  BioWatch program officials told us that they set the ADE-2A schedule  estimate aggressively because there was pressure to respond quickly to  the call to deploy autonomous detection. Additionally, they reported that  they did not account for risk in the schedule estimates that were included  in the Acquisition Program Baseline for ADE-2A. The BioWatch program  office has revised the acquisition schedule since ADE-2A was held in  2009. The most recent update\u2014completed in January 2012\u2014estimated  full deployment of the Gen-3 system in fiscal year 2022, 6 years later than  anticipated. While the acquisition is currently on track with the January  2012 schedule, the schedule remains subject to uncertainty, in part  because of a pending decision about the acquisition strategy.", "GAO-09-3SP. to engage in a full effort to develop a Life-Cycle Cost Estimate in  accordance with the GAO Cost Estimating Guide ahead of ADE-2A, but  were directed by the department to proceed with the best point estimate  they could derive. Additionally, both BioWatch program and PARM  officials described a climate before ADE-2A in which the department\u2019s  business processes\u2014including acquisition practices\u2014were maturing and  thus were less rigorous in their adherence to best practices for cost and  schedule estimating.", "The BioWatch program has revised the cost estimate using more reliable  methods since the ADE-2A estimate was prepared in 2009. The most  recent update\u2014completed in June 2011\u2014shows the estimated life-cycle  cost for the Gen-3 acquisition to be $5.8 billion (80 percent confidence),  much higher than the $2.1 billion point estimate presented at ADE-2A.  The 2011 Life-Cycle Cost Estimate was aligned with GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating Guide, which recommends that agencies calculate a range of  possible cost estimates based on different risk levels in order to account  for uncertainty. According to the guide, experts agree that program cost  estimates should be budgeted to at least the 50 percent confidence level,  but budgeting to a higher level (for example, 70 percent to 80 percent) is  now a common practice. Moreover, a higher confidence level in cost  estimating may be more prudent, as experts stress that contingency  reserves are necessary to cover increased costs resulting from  unexpected design complexity, incomplete requirements, technology  uncertainty, and other uncertainties that can affect programs, according to  the GAO Cost Estimating Guide. Acknowledging the benefit of a higher  confidence level for cost estimates, the BioWatch program recommended  that the 80 percent confidence level estimate be used for planning  purposes. As such, the $5.8 billion figure presented in the 2011 cost  estimate was calculated at the 80 percent confidence level\u2014meaning that  there is an 80 percent chance that the actual life-cycle cost will be this  amount or less, according to BioWatch officials.", "BioWatch program officials told us that the large difference between the  ADE-2A cost estimate and the June 2011 cost estimate is primarily driven  by the inclusion of risk in the June 2011 estimate, rather than by changes  to the program. However, these officials also noted other factors that  contributed to the difference. For example, the 2009 estimate was not as  robust as the 2011 estimate because it was not based on the work  breakdown structure for the program. Additionally, because of changes in  the schedule estimates, the June 2011 estimate considers costs through  fiscal year 2028, whereas the 2009 estimate considered costs through  fiscal year 2020. These changes in performance, schedule, and cost,  along with maturation in the department\u2019s acquisition management  process, create an opportunity for DHS to reevaluate the mission need  and alternatives in a more comprehensive and systematic fashion, and in  accordance with DHS acquisitions guidance, to help ensure that it invests  its limited resources in the most cost-effective solution possible. In  addition, using comprehensive and systematically developed information,  in conjunction with good practices for cost and schedule estimating like  those described in the GAO Cost Estimating Guide, could help ensure  that the department and policymakers have the most reliable  performance, schedule, and cost information available for decision  making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BioWatch Must Demonstrate System Performance and Receive Approval before Full Deployment, Estimated for 2022", "paragraphs": ["According to DHS officials the remaining steps in the Gen-3 acquisition  include performance testing, operational testing and evaluation,  production, deployment, and sustainment.

To ensure that the full system satisfies the  operational requirements, the BioWatch program intends to design a  testing plan that demonstrates that the full system\u2014including the  information technology network when it is developed\u2014can operate as  intended, while complying with legal restrictions on testing for pathogens  in BioWatch jurisdictions. DHS has not yet finalized a testing strategy,  and the final test plan will depend on the candidate technologies chosen  for testing following ADE-2B. Whatever the strategy, DHS officials from  the BioWatch program and the Science and Technology Directorate office  that oversees testing said that operational test and evaluation will include  a number of subsystem and full system test events from which  performance in an operational environment can be modeled and  extrapolated. Table 4 provides examples of possible test events to  demonstrate Gen-3 performance.", "Collectively, the BioWatch program estimates that this testing will take  approximately 3 years and cost approximately $89 million. During  operational testing and evaluation, the BioWatch program must prepare  for and mitigate several limitations. These limitations include the  following:  Inability to fully test Gen-3\u2019s detection capability: BioWatch  officials told us that legal restrictions on the aerosolized release of all  five BioWatch agents in U.S. cities limit the BioWatch program\u2019s ability  to demonstrate full and subsystem performance in an operational  environment. Without releasing the agents in BioWatch jurisdictions,  the BioWatch program is unable to test the system\u2019s ability to detect  them in the operational environment. According to BioWatch program  officials and DHS S&T officials who assist with test design, designing  laboratory and field tests that can compensate for these limitations on  pathogen use is a goal that is guiding the development of the testing  plan for Operational Testing and Evaluation.", "Inconsistent performance in different operational environments:  The candidate system tested during the characterization field test  performed better at some sites than others. Specifically, detectors  located on underground subway platforms had higher incidences of  malfunction than detectors in other locations. These malfunctions may  be associated with the presence of metallic brake dust; however, this  failure demonstrates different operational environments pose different  challenges, and the BioWatch program plans to conduct laboratory  testing as well as modeling to further assess detector performance  under different operational conditions.", "Difficulty verifying false positive rate: In order to build user  confidence in the system, the BioWatch program has established a  stringent threshold of 1 in 10 million for the false positive rate\u2014that is,  the rate at which the system is allowed to indicate a pathogen is  present when one is not. However, according to BioWatch  documentation, 33.5 years of operational testing would be required to  fully demonstrate that the system meets the established false positive  rate. Therefore, the BioWatch program plans to use data from  laboratory testing to model and extrapolate the probability of a false  positive. According to program documentation, the amount of time  planned for operational testing will be sufficient to reveal any issues  with false positive performance of the candidate technologies tested.", "The goal of the next phase of testing is to demonstrate that Gen-3  candidate technologies can operate as intended in the operational  environment. To achieve that goal, which is required for ADE-3, the  BioWatch program must successfully mitigate these testing limitations.  For example, to address the inconsistent performance in testing  environments, the program must determine whether and how to adjust  laboratory conditions to better reflect the operational environment by  exposing the detectors to contaminants such as dust and pollen.", "To be ready to produce and deploy Gen-3, DHS must demonstrate  technological readiness for the full system based on both individual  component readiness and the maturity of the integration of those  components. In August 2011, on the basis of results of characterization  testing, the Institute for Defense Analysis conducted a Technology  Readiness Assessment\u2014a formal independent review that assesses the  maturity of critical hardware and software technologies to be used in  systems\u2014for Gen-3. Using the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale, which defines levels of  technological maturity on a scale of 1 to 9, the assessment assigned TRL  scores to the Gen-3 candidate technology\u2019s individual critical technology  elements, that is, those subsystems that are vital to the functioning of the  system and are either new or novel applications or pose major technical  risk. This assessment rated all but one of the critical technology elements  it assessed as TRL 7\u2014indicating a relatively high level of maturity for  each technology element assessed. However, the assessment does not  provide an overall TRL for the full Gen-3 system. It notes that doing so  could obscure the strengths and weaknesses of individual system  components, and says that the DOD\u2019s Technology Readiness  Assessment Deskbook, which provides guidance for assigning TRLs,  does not describe how to aggregate TRLs. However, other DOD  guidance specific to chemical and biological defense says that a TRL  evaluation is generally undertaken to establish a system\u2019s level of  maturity relative to a specific purpose, which suggests that the next phase  of testing should result in a technology readiness assessment that  provides an indication of how well these components perform together in  order to meet the mission need of autonomous detection. Furthermore,  we have previously reported that underestimating the complexity of  systems integration can be a cause of significant cost and schedule  growth. DHS also has not assessed the technology readiness of the  data network, a major component of the Gen-3 system, or its integration  into the system because it has not yet been developed. The data network  and its integration will therefore require demonstration prior to production  and deployment of Gen-3.", "If the BioWatch program can demonstrate that the candidate technology  meets requirements and DHS approves the Gen-3 acquisition at ADE-3,  the DHS June 2011 life-cycle cost estimate indicates that Gen-3 is  expected to cost $5.8 billion (80 percent confidence) through June 2028.  As shown in figure 8, approximately $5.7 billion of this total has not yet  been spent and is expected to primarily fund operations once the system  is deployed.", "To prepare for the deployment of Gen-3, the BioWatch program must  work with Gen-3 jurisdictions to prepare sites for detector placement and  to develop location-specific Concepts of Operations to provide key  information and considerations\u2014such as specifying roles and  responsibilities and developing public information and risk communication  messages\u2014that are integral to response operations in the event that  Gen-3 detects a pathogen. Like the Gen-2 system, the Gen-3 system is to  be operated by BioWatch jurisdictions, and therefore the system\u2019s  usefulness in improving response time is expected to be determined, in  part, by each jurisdiction\u2019s willingness to respond to a positive test result,  which, if incorrect could have large monetary costs and public and  political repercussions. According to BioWatch program officials, they  want the jurisdictions to have enough confidence in the system that they  are willing to take action based on positive results from a Gen-3 detector  without confirmatory laboratory testing. Therefore, according to BioWatch  program officials, they have taken steps to increase jurisdictions\u2019  confidence in the Gen-3 system. For example, they provide guidance to  jurisdictions and are in the process of developing a quality assurance  process to track system performance. Furthermore, these officials  anticipate running Gen-2 and Gen-3 concurrently for up to 6 months in  BioWatch jurisdictions, and requiring all candidate technologies to archive  positive samples so that the jurisdictions can run confirmatory laboratory  analysis on the samples."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite Gen-3\u2019s potential to save lives under specific conditions,  uncertainty remains about its general risk mitigation value. DHS  established the strategy to quadruple the number of deployed detectors  and replace all Gen-2 technology with an autonomous solution while  expanding to 20 additional cities without engaging in a robust mission  needs effort to serve as a foundation for subsequent acquisition efforts.  As we have previously reported, because DHS does not have unlimited  resources and cannot protect the nation from every conceivable threat, it  must make risk-informed decisions regarding its homeland security  approaches and strategies. In addition, we have previously reported that  programs that conduct a limited assessment of alternatives before the  start of system development tend to experience poorer outcomes than  programs that conduct more robust analyses. Without a justified mission  need to ground acquisition decision making or a systematic analysis of  the cost-benefits and risk, DHS has pursued goals (such as the time  threshold of 6 hours) and specific technological requirements (such as the  sensitivity threshold) that may or may not support optimal solutions.  Reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives  based on cost-benefit and risk information could help DHS gain  assurance that it is pursuing an optimal solution.", "Furthermore, difficulty attaining the original goals has contributed to  challenges in meeting milestones and deadlines for deployment. In 2009,  when the Acquisition Decision Authority approved the Gen-3 acquisition,  it was anticipated that Gen-3 technologies would be in initial deployment  by 2013 and fully deployed by the first quarter of 2016. In 2011, DHS\u2019s  most recent estimate, which contains significant uncertainty because of  testing limitations, among other reasons, was that full deployment would  be 6 years later, in 2022. Similarly, the $2.1 billion cost estimate  presented to DHS decision makers and Congress for planning purposes  at the start of the acquisition is now $5.8 billion (for the first 13 years of  deployment; only 6 of which are for full deployment) and may still rise  because of lingering uncertainty about the acquisition strategy. These  changes in cost, schedule, and performance, along with maturation in the  department\u2019s business processes\u2014including acquisitions and risk  management\u2014reinforce the importance and provide an opportunity for  DHS to reevaluate the mission need and alternatives in a more robust,  considered, and systemic fashion, as called for in the Acquisition Life- cycle Framework, to help ensure that it makes the most sound  investments possible.

With respect to the second  recommendation to update other acquisition documents to reflect any  performance, cost, and schedule information that might result from  reevaluation, DHS acknowledged that it may be necessary and  appropriate to do so. However, DHS did not agree that it should  implement these two recommendations before continuing the acquisition.", "In its response, DHS stated its intent to issue a solicitation for  performance testing concurrent with the efforts to implement the  recommendations. DHS stated that BioWatch will be required to return to  the Acquisition Review Board prior to issuing a contract stemming from  this solicitation.", "We are pleased that DHS plans to reevaluate the mission need and  alternatives and that the department believes this action would be  beneficial as it seeks to reduce programmatic risk and demonstrate sound  fiscal stewardship in an increasingly constrained fiscal environment.  Additionally, we commend DHS\u2019s stated commitment to use Acquisition  Management Directive 102-01 to ensure consistent and efficient  acquisition management, support, review, and approval. The directive\u2019s  acquisition life-cycle framework is designed to establish a foundation  based on critical examination of the capability gap an acquisition would fill  and to build sequentially on that foundation to support solid, knowledge- based acquisition decision making. To satisfy the larger purpose of the  framework\u2014providing assurance that DHS makes judicious decisions  about how to invest limited resources and implements them effectively\u2014it  is vital that it be used consistently, that each acquisition adheres to the  framework throughout its entire life-cycle, and that specified steps are  completed in a sequential manner to support key acquisition decisions.", "Accordingly, we are concerned by DHS\u2019s intention to continue the  acquisition efforts before ensuring that it has fully developed the critical  knowledge a comprehensive acquisition life-cycle framework effort is  designed to provide. Our work showed that DHS does not have  reasonable assurance that the solution it has been pursuing warrants  investment of limited resources and that it represents an optimal solution.

During discussions with program  officials about the recommendation to reevaluate the mission need, the  officials told us that they had resubmitted the original Mission Needs  Statement to DHS for review. If DHS were to approve the original Mission  Needs Statement and use it to guide the reevaluation of alternatives, it  would overlook the intent of the recommendation. The intent is that DHS  reevaluate existing capability gaps through the mission needs process to  provide a foundation for future acquisition decision making\u2014including the  Analysis of Alternatives\u2014that is grounded in better understanding and  consensus about how filling these gaps will contribute to larger  biodefense needs.
