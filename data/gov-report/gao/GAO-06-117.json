Under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), states conduct annual nursing home inspections, known as surveys, to assess compliance with federal quality and safety requirements. States also investigate complaints filed by family members or others in between annual surveys. When state surveys find serious deficiencies, CMS may impose sanctions to encourage compliance with federal requirements. GAO was asked to assess CMS's progress since 1998 in addressing oversight weaknesses. GAO (1) reviewed the trends in nursing home quality from 1999 through January 2005, (2) evaluated the extent to which CMS's initiatives have addressed survey and oversight problems identified by GAO and CMS, and (3) identified key challenges to continued progress in ensuring resident health and safety. GAO reviewed federal data on the results of state nursing home surveys and federal surveys assessing state performance; conducted additional analyses in five states with large numbers of nursing homes; reviewed the status of its prior recommendations; and identified key workforce and workload issues confronting CMS and states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS's nursing home survey data show a significant decline in the proportion of nursing homes with serious quality problems since 1999, but this trend masks two important and continuing issues: inconsistency in how states conduct surveys and understatement of serious quality problems. Inconsistency in states' surveys is demonstrated by wide interstate variability in the proportion of homes found to have serious deficiencies--for example, about 6 percent in one state and about 54 percent in another. Continued understatement of serious deficiencies is shown by the increase in discrepancies between federal and state surveys of the same homes from 2002 through 2004, despite an overall decline in such discrepancies from October 1998 through December 2004. In five large states that had a significant decline in serious deficiencies, federal surveyors concluded that from 8 percent to 33 percent of the comparative surveys identified serious deficiencies that state surveyors had missed. This finding is consistent with earlier GAO work showing that state surveyors missed serious care problems. These two issues underscore the importance of CMS initiatives to improve the consistency and rigor of nursing home surveys. CMS has addressed many survey and oversight shortcomings, but it is still developing or has not yet implemented several key initiatives, particularly those intended to improve the consistency of the survey process. Key steps CMS has taken include (1) revising the survey methodology, (2) issuing states additional guidance to strengthen complaint investigations, (3) implementing immediate sanctions for homes cited for repeat serious violations, and (4) strengthening oversight by conducting assessments of state survey activities. Some CMS initiatives, however, either have shortcomings impairing their effectiveness or have not effectively targeted problems GAO and CMS identified. For example, CMS has not fully addressed issues with the accuracy and reliability of the data underlying consumer information published on its Web site. The key challenges CMS, states, and nursing homes face in their efforts to further improve nursing home quality and safety include (1) the cost to older homes to be retrofit with automatic sprinklers to help reduce the loss of life in the event of a fire, (2) continuing problems with hiring and retaining qualified surveyors, and (3) an expanded workload due to increased oversight, identification of additional initiatives that compete for staff and financial resources, and growth in the number of Medicare and Medicaid providers. Despite CMS's increased nursing home oversight, its continued attention and commitment are warranted in order to maintain the momentum of its efforts to date and to better ensure high-quality care and safety for nursing home residents. CMS generally concurred with the report's findings. CMS noted several areas of progress in nursing home quality and identified remaining challenges to conducting nursing home survey and oversight activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Numerous congressional hearings since July 1998 have focused attention  on the need to improve the care and safety of the nation\u2019s 1.5 million  nursing home residents, a highly vulnerable population of elderly and  disabled individuals for whom remaining at home is no longer feasible.  Many nursing home residents require help with feeding, toileting,  grooming, or other routine activities of daily living; are cognitively  impaired; or have chronic health care conditions such as heart disease.  Some individuals with chronic conditions are long-term residents of  nursing homes, while others enter nursing homes for a short period, such  as after a hospitalization.

Over time, CMS has refined and expanded these  initiatives, including launching a Web site\u2014Nursing Home Compare\u2014that  has progressively increased the data available to the public about the care  provided by nursing homes. You asked us to review the progress made by  CMS since 1998 in addressing quality and safety problems in the nation\u2019s  nursing homes. In response to your request, we (1) reviewed the trends in  nursing home quality by analyzing nursing home survey results,   (2) evaluated the extent to which CMS\u2019s initiatives have addressed survey  and oversight shortcomings identified by us and CMS, and (3) identified  key remaining challenges to continued progress in ensuring resident  health and safety.", "To assess trends in nursing home quality, we analyzed data from the  federal On-Line Survey, Certification, and Reporting system (OSCAR),  which compiles the results of state nursing home surveys; we focused on  trend data since CMS announced its nursing home initiatives. We have  used OSCAR data since 1997 to track trends in the proportion of homes  found to have harmed residents or placed them at risk of immediate  jeopardy. To better understand the trends identified through our OSCAR  analysis, we evaluated the results of federal comparative surveys for all  states for the period March 2002 through December 2004 and compared  the results for two other time periods\u2014October 1998 through May 2000  and June 2000 through February 2002. Federal comparative surveys are  conducted at nursing homes recently surveyed by the state to assess the  adequacy of the state surveys. We judgmentally selected five large states\u2014 California, Florida, New York, Ohio, and Texas\u2014for additional analysis  based on the change in the proportion of homes cited with serious  deficiencies, geographic representation, and the number of nursing homes.  These five states account for almost 30 percent of the nation\u2019s nursing  homes. CMS officials generally recognize OSCAR data to be reliable. We  have used OSCAR data in prior work to examine nursing home quality  issues and we updated certain data for this report. Throughout the course  of our work, we discussed our analysis of OSCAR data with CMS officials  at both the central office and the regional offices to ensure that the data  accurately reflected state nursing home survey activities.

We also discussed with CMS officials  the initiatives implemented as a result of CMS\u2019s self-assessment of needed  improvements. We focused on four areas: surveys, complaints,  enforcement, and oversight. We discussed the preliminary findings from  our OSCAR data trend analysis with CMS and state survey agency officials.  To assess the remaining challenges to continued improvement of nursing  home oversight, we identified through interviews with CMS and state  survey agency officials key workforce and workload issues that confront  states and CMS in protecting the health and safety of nursing home  residents.

Nursing  homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid are required to  periodically assess residents\u2019 care needs in 17 areas, such as mood and  behavior, physical functioning, and skin conditions, in order to develop an  appropriate plan of care. Such resident assessment data are known as the  minimum data set (MDS). To assess the care provided by a nursing home,  surveyors select a sample of residents and (1) review data derived from  the residents\u2019 MDS assessments and medical records; (2) interview nursing  home staff, residents, and family members; and (3) observe care provided  to residents during the course of the survey.

Examples of specific requirements include the use of fire- or smoke- resistant construction materials, the installation and testing of fire alarms  and smoke detectors, and the development and routine testing of a fire  emergency plan.

Complaints may be filed against a home by a resident, the resident\u2019s  family, or a nursing home employee either verbally, via a complaint  hotline, or in writing. Surveyors generally follow state procedures when  investigating complaints but must comply with certain federal guidelines  and time frames. In cases involving resident abuse, such as pushing,  slapping, beating, or otherwise assaulting a resident by individuals to  whom their care has been entrusted, state survey agencies may notify state  or local law enforcement agencies that can initiate criminal investigations.  States must maintain a registry of qualified nurse aides, the primary  caregivers in nursing homes, that includes any findings that an aide has  been responsible for abuse, neglect, or theft of a resident\u2019s property. The  inclusion of such a finding constitutes a ban on nursing home  employment.", "Deficiencies identified during either standard surveys or complaint  investigations are classified in 1 of 12 categories according to their scope  (i.e., the number of residents potentially or actually affected) and their  severity. An A-level deficiency is the least serious and is isolated in scope,  while an L-level deficiency is the most serious and is considered to be  widespread in the nursing home (see table 1).

We previously  reported that confusion about the definition of actual harm contributed to  inconsistency and understatement in state surveys. Moreover, although  federal comparative surveys conducted from October 1998 through  December 2004 showed a decline in the proportion of serious deficiencies  that were not identified by state surveys, this overall trend masks a more  recent increase from 2002 through 2004 in federally identified  understatement of serious deficiencies. In five large states we examined  with a significant decline in the proportion of homes found to have  harmed residents, federal comparative surveys found that a significant  proportion of state surveys had missed serious deficiencies, that is, state  surveyors either failed to cite the deficiencies altogether or cited them at  too low a level of scope and severity.", "From January 1999 through January 2005, the proportion of nursing homes  nationwide with actual harm or immediate jeopardy deficiencies declined  from about 29 percent to about 16 percent.

CMS regional office officials, however, were concerned about the  magnitude of the decline in serious deficiencies in two states\u2014Texas and  California. The Texas state survey agency noted both some improvement  in quality as well as a significant number of inexperienced surveyors who  it believed were hesitant in citing actual harm. The San Francisco regional  office and state survey agency officials acknowledged that confusion by  state surveyors as to what constituted actual harm had contributed to the  decline in California. The regional office staff discussed this issue with  California survey agency officials and believed that training combined with  the CMS inquiries might have contributed to a recent increase in actual  harm deficiency citations.", "The overall decline in the proportion of federal comparative surveys  nationwide that noted serious deficiencies not identified by state  surveyors across the three time periods we examined masks a reversal of  this trend in the most recent time period analyzed, suggesting ongoing  understatement of deficiencies. The time periods analyzed were October  1998 through May 2000, June 2000 through February 2002, and March 2002  through December 2004. From October 1998 through February 2002, the  proportion of federal comparative surveys nationwide that noted serious  deficiencies that were not identified by state surveyors declined from   34 percent to 22 percent (see fig. 2). However, federal surveys conducted  from March 2002 through December 2004 that found serious deficiencies  not identified by state surveyors increased from 22 percent to 28 percent.  In addition, our work in the five states we examined demonstrates  continued understatement by state surveyors of serious deficiencies that  cause actual harm or immediate jeopardy.", "Because some serious deficiencies found by federal, but not state,  surveyors may not have existed at the time of the state survey, CMS  requires its regional offices to specifically identify on worksheets which  deficiencies state surveyors had missed during the state survey. We  analyzed CMS regional office worksheets for 73 comparative surveys in  five large states\u2014California, Florida, New York, Ohio, and Texas\u2014with a  significant decline in serious deficiencies from January 1999 through  January 2005. Overall, 18 percent of these federal comparative surveys  identified at least one serious deficiency missed by state surveyors,  ranging from a low of 8 percent in Ohio to a high of 33 percent in Florida  (see table 3). Table 3 also shows that in comparative surveys noting  serious deficiencies that state surveyors missed, from one to seven serious  deficiencies were missed. Federal surveyors\u2019 findings of understatement of  serious deficiencies are consistent with our own work. Our July 2003  report analyzed state surveys of homes with a history of harming residents  but whose most current survey identified quality-of-care problems at  below the level of harm; we concluded that about 40 percent of the 76  homes we analyzed had harmed residents, including instances of severe  weight loss; multiple falls resulting in broken bones and other injuries; and  serious, avoidable pressure sores. Similarly, our November 2004 report on  Arkansas nursing home deaths found numerous instances of serious,  understated quality-of-care problems.", "Our prior reports identified five factors that we believe contribute to  inconsistency and the understatement of deficiencies by state surveyors:  (1) weaknesses in CMS\u2019s survey methodology; (2) confusion about the  definition of actual harm; (3) predictability of surveys, which allows  homes to conceal problems if they so desire; (4) inadequate quality  assurance processes at the state level to help detect understatement in the  scope and severity of deficiencies; and (5) inexperienced state surveyors  due to retention problems. CMS has initiatives under way to revise the  survey methodology and address the confusion about what constitutes  harm, and it has taken some steps to reduce survey predictability.  However, CMS did not implement the recommendation in our July 2003  report to strengthen the ability of state quality assurance processes to  detect understatement.

As interim steps, CMS instructed state survey agencies in 1999 to  (1) increase the sample of residents reviewed during surveys and   (2) review available quality indicator information on the care provided to a  home\u2019s residents before actually visiting the home. By using the quality  indicators, which are essentially numeric warning signs of the prevalence  of care problems, to select a preliminary sample of residents before the  on-site review, surveyors are better prepared to target their surveys and to  identify potential care problems. Surveyors augment the preliminary  sample with additional resident cases once they arrive in the home.", "For the longer term, CMS awarded a contract in 1998 to revise the  methodology used to survey nursing homes, and the agency plans to pilot  this new methodology in the fall 2005. Under development for 7 years, the  proposed two-stage, data-driven Quality Indicator Survey (QIS) is intended  to systematically target potential problems at nursing homes. Its expanded  sample should help surveyors better assess the scope of any deficiencies  identified. In stage 1, a large resident sample will be drawn and relevant  data from on- and off-site sources will be analyzed to develop a set of  quality-of-care indicators, which will be compared to national  benchmarks. Stage 2 will systematically investigate potential quality-of- care concerns identified in stage 1. In June 2005, CMS selected five states  to pilot test the new survey methodology. The QIS pilot test will begin  during the fall 2005, with a final evaluation of the pilot due in the fall 2006.  The evaluation will examine the QIS\u2019s cost-effectiveness, focusing on the  time and surveyor team size required under QIS compared to the current  survey methodology, and on the QIS\u2019s impact on deficiency citations.

Our  March 1999 report on complaints had recommended that CMS strengthen  its oversight in these areas. During its 2004 review of state performance,  CMS identified 5 states that did not meet the standard for properly  categorizing complaints and 13 states that did not conduct timely  investigations of all complaints alleging immediate jeopardy to residents;  however, 11 of the 13 states missed the requirement by a small margin.  States failing state performance review standards are asked to submit a  corrective action plan to CMS.", "Second, in January 2004, CMS implemented a new national automated  complaint tracking system, the ASPEN Complaints and Incidents Tracking  System. Our March 1999 report on enforcement noted that the lack of a  national complaint reporting system hindered CMS\u2019s and states\u2019 ability to  adequately track the status of complaint investigations as well as CMS\u2019s  ability to maintain a full compliance history on each nursing home. To  address these concerns, we recommended the development of a better  management information system.

CMS has not issued a  formal report of findings from the state self-assessment, but CMS officials  noted that as a result of resource constraints some states reported having  difficulty maintaining compliance with certain federal requirements, such  as (1) timely entry by state survey staff of information in nurse aide  registries and (2) state notification to nursing homes employing nurse  aides found guilty of abuse at another facility. In our March 2002 report,  we recommended that CMS shorten the state survey agencies\u2019 time frames  for determining whether to include findings of abuse in the nurse aide  registry. Annotations to nurse aide registries are made after final  determinations that abuse occurred, which entail completion of the state\u2019s  investigation as well as adjudication of any appeals. Until the final  determination, residents may continue to be exposed to aides who are  allegedly abusive.

Second, CMS regional offices were inconsistent in conducting state  performance reviews. For fiscal year 2004, five states nationwide did not  meet this standard, but three of the five states were in one CMS region.  Third, the standard for assessing the supportability of deficiencies is  composed of 11 elements that mix major and minor issues. Although CMS  has simplified the standard for assessing the supportability of deficiencies,  we believe that many of the elements reviewed remain essentially  administrative in nature rather than substantive. Of the elements that  make up the standard, only 2 assess the appropriateness of the cited scope  and severity; the remaining elements assess such issues as how the  deficiency is written, including avoiding the use of the passive voice.

First, in its  fiscal year 2004 review, CMS began combining state performance review  results across the different provider types, such as nursing homes and  home health agencies, for which states have oversight responsibility. For  example, CMS calculates one overall state score on the supportability of  deficiencies across provider types, rather than issuing provider-specific  scores. One CMS region suggested that because nursing homes are  generally surveyed by a unique pool of surveyors, combining results in this  manner limits the usefulness of the feedback to state survey agencies.

Some reports, such as survey timeliness,  are used during state performance reviews, while others are intended to  help identify problems or inconsistencies in state survey activities and the  need for intervention.

For example, CMS dropped certain quality indicators that it  found were not sufficiently reliable for public reporting, such as the  facility-adjusted profile prevalence of pressure sores. In addition, CMS  worked with the National Quality Forum to address measurement  problems with the pressure sore quality indicator by developing separate  indicators for short- and long-term nursing home residents; these new  indicators were added to the Web site in January 2004.

As of July 2005, however, 20 percent or more of  surveyors in 20 of the 25 states had 2 years\u2019 experience or less (see table  9). Surveyor vacancy rates in the 25 states ranged from about 3 percent in  Tennessee to 31 percent in Alabama and Florida; overall, 15 states had  double-digit vacancy rates. Officials in 18 states believed that  inexperienced surveyors contributed to interstate variability in the citation  of serious deficiencies. One state survey agency indicated that staff  attrition resulted in a workforce of less experienced surveyors who  demonstrated a hesitance to cite actual harm and contributed to  understatement. State survey agency officials in several states, however,  suggested that the problem for less-experienced surveyors was not  identifying harm but rather investigating and documenting the  circumstances that led to the harm, including facility culpability, a skill  that surveyors develop as they gain more experience.", "Because state survey agency salaries are rarely competitive with the  private sector, state survey agencies told us that it is difficult to retain  surveyors and to fill vacancies. RNs, a major component of states\u2019  surveyor workforce, are in high demand and short supply, according to  AHFSA. Furthermore, 9 states responding to our July 2005 inquiry  indicated that state civil service requirements can make it more difficult to  fill vacancies. Several of the 9 states characterized the hiring process as  either cumbersome or time-consuming, or both, and 1 state noted that the  process takes close to 9 months. Two states reported that they had to  select candidates to interview from a certified list. One of the states  indicated that the certified list often contained unqualified applicants,  while the other state noted that some of the applicants were not the \u201cbest  fit.\u201d Of the 25 states, 21 indicated that they had implemented initiatives to  help retain surveyors. The most popular retention strategies were to  increase starting salaries and to implement flexible surveyor work  schedules. For example, New York instituted a locality pay differential for  New York City. While 5 of the 25 states indicated that they had a state- imposed hiring freeze, 1 state reported that budget pressures prevented it  from taking steps to improve retention rates. A continuing problem cited  by AHFSA is that federal funds are distributed late in the fiscal year, which  does not tie into state budget cycles for approving additional positions.  This problem may be particularly acute in the 5 states that reported having  a hiring freeze."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workload Issues and Competing Priorities Pose Challenges for CMS and States", "paragraphs": ["CMS and states have experienced increased survey workloads due to the  greater intensity of nursing home oversight, the increasing number of  initiatives, and growth in the number of Medicare and Medicaid providers  requiring oversight. This workload growth required the prioritization of  initiatives that, in some cases, has resulted in implementation delays for  some key initiatives. The consensus-building process necessary to bring  initiatives to fruition also has contributed to some delays. The initiatives  likely will continue to compete for priority with other CMS programs,  posing a challenge for efforts to further improve nursing home quality and  safety."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Increased Workload Has Contributed to Delays", "paragraphs": ["Greater nursing home oversight has increased demand on both CMS and  state survey agency resources, causing delays for some key initiatives.  CMS\u2019s increased workload is evident in the labor-intensive state  performance reviews. Since their introduction in October 2000, the  reviews have been gradually expanded from nursing homes to several  other Medicare and Medicaid providers, such as home health agencies and  hospitals. CMS also has significantly increased the number of federal  quality-of-care and fire safety comparative surveys. Such surveys are more  labor-intensive than the alternative type of federal monitoring surveys,  known as observational surveys, because they require an entire federal  survey team rather than a smaller number of federal surveyors. The agency  also has committed considerable resources to developing new data  systems for complaints and enforcement actions while simultaneously  increasing its use of available data to further improve federal and state  oversight. Despite the increased workload, CMS implemented survey staff  reductions of 5 percent in regional offices and 3 percent in its central  office in January 2004. As of August 2005, these staff reductions have  remained in effect.", "As state survey agency workloads grew with the implementation of the  initiatives, they also experienced resource pressures. States are now  required to conduct on-site revisits to ensure serious deficiencies have  been corrected, investigate complaints alleging actual harm on-site and do  so more promptly, and initiate off-hour standard surveys. Thus, surveyors\u2019  presence in nursing homes has increased and surveyors\u2019 work hours have  effectively been expanded to weekends, evenings, and early mornings. The  requirement to impose immediate sanctions on homes that repeatedly  harm residents also has had a workload impact because in the past a grace  period allowed homes to correct deficiencies before the sanctions went  into effect. The imposition of immediate sanctions requires states to track,  which some states do manually, the homes that must be referred for  immediate sanctions and requires CMS and states to act to impose  recommended sanctions that in the past would have been rescinded  because the homes could have corrected the deficiencies during a grace  period. While states\u2019 budget pressures appear to be easing, many state  survey agencies reported hiring freezes, staff vacancies, or high turnover  as of July 2002 when all of these initiatives had already been fully  implemented.", "The number of initiatives that CMS has implemented on its own has  grown, further increasing its workload. For example, CMS added quality  indicator data to its Nursing Home Compare Web site and has involved  QIOs in helping nursing homes to improve quality of care. In addition,  CMS created a task force to develop guidance intended to improve  consistency across states in the imposition of civil money penalties.", "The number of nursing home initiatives simultaneously under  development or being implemented as well as other CMS responsibilities,  such as preparing to implement the new Medicare prescription drug  benefit in January 2006, have necessitated the establishment of priorities  and led to delays and queues. CMS assigned some initiatives, such as the  development and public reporting of quality indicators, a high priority and  implemented them swiftly despite issues related to their validity and the  quality of the underlying data\u2014problems that CMS is still working to  address. In contrast, the revision of the survey process has encountered  delays because of funding shortfalls and has been in process for 7 years.  For example, initial testing of the new methodology in 2002 and 2003 was  limited, even though CMS had already invested $4.7 million in its  development from initiation in 1999 through September 2003. A pilot test  of the new methodology is scheduled to begin in the fall 2005; depending  on the results of the testing, implementation could begin in mid-2007.  Although CMS attaches a high priority to enhancing the information  available to the public on nursing home quality and safety, adding  information on past noncompliance and the fire safety status of nursing  homes are in a queue behind the programming required to implement  higher-priority projects. There is also a regulatory queue, with other,  higher-priority regulations ahead of the notice of proposed rule making to  require retrofitting of nursing homes with automatic sprinklers.", "Delays in implementing the nursing home initiatives are also attributable  to CMS\u2019s need to be responsive to stakeholder input. Appropriately, CMS  seeks input from various stakeholders such as states, regional offices, the  nursing home industry, and resident advocates. For example, CMS sought  input from experts in developing investigative protocols for surveyors.  Due to this lengthy consultative process, combined with the prolonged  delays stemming from internal disagreement over the structure of the  process during the initial stages, CMS has only implemented two  investigative protocols since 2001. Likewise, implementation of the ASPEN  Complaint Tracking System was delayed because during the system\u2019s pilot  test, several states indicated their belief that their existing systems were  superior and opposed the idea of either abandoning these systems or  maintaining separate systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Providers Subject to Surveys Is Growing", "paragraphs": ["Both the overall growth in providers and the anticipated growth in nursing  homes pose additional workload challenges for CMS and states. In  addition to nursing homes, CMS and states are responsible for surveys of  other Medicare and Medicaid providers, such as home health agencies and  hospitals. The number of these providers grew from 39,651 in October  2000 to 45,375 in January 2005, approximately 14 percent. While the  number of nursing homes has decreased slightly during the same period,  from 17,012 to 16,146, the rate of decline has slowed; and as the baby  boom generation ages, increasing the number of elderly needing long-term  care services, the number of nursing homes is expected to grow to meet  the demand. In 2000, 35.1 million people were aged 65 or older. This  number is expected to grow to about 54.7 million by 2020.", "Nursing home survey activities consume the majority of state survey  budgets and resources. Nursing homes make up about 31 percent of  Medicare and Medicaid providers, but account for 73 percent of the  federal budget for oversight of such providers. The funding for nursing  home surveys is disproportionate because the time frames for standard  nursing home surveys are statutory. For those survey requirements not in  statute, CMS determines the survey time frames; these surveys are  therefore a lower priority. Even among nursing home survey activities,  however, annual standard surveys are considered a higher priority than  complaint surveys or initial surveys for which the statute does not dictate  specific time frames. CMS and state survey agency officials recognize  that CMS may have shifted its focus and resources to nursing homes at the  expense of adequate oversight of other providers serving Medicare and  Medicaid beneficiaries, and some states contend that the focus on nursing  home standard surveys has hampered their ability to investigate nursing  home complaints within mandated time frames. For example, according to  a California state survey agency official, California law mandates that all  nursing home resident complaints, not just complaints alleging actual  harm, be investigated within 10 days. Likewise, an official from the  Pennsylvania state survey agency stated that in Pennsylvania, all  complaints must be investigated within 48 hours. California survey agency  officials have told us that a complaint alleging a care problem deserves a  higher priority than a standard survey, which may or may not identify  deficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Nursing Home Initiatives Continue to Compete for Priority", "paragraphs": ["According to CMS officials, key nursing home initiatives continue to  compete for priority with other CMS projects.

CMS officials have indicated that  nationwide implementation of the revised survey methodology could be  affected if its use requires additional survey time or a greater number of  surveyors to conduct each survey. The pilot test of the new methodology,  scheduled for 2005 and 2006, includes an examination of steps to  streamline the revised process, if necessary. Cost considerations limited  the pilot of the new methodology to fewer states than the 20 that  volunteered.", "Investigative protocols for quality-of-care problems. Only three sets  of investigative protocols had been implemented as of November 2005,  and it is unclear whether the contractor\u2019s assessment of the protocols\u2019  effectiveness can be completed before the contract ends in 2006.  Furthermore, unless the contract for the investigative protocols is re-bid,  CMS expects to return to the traditional revision process even though  agency staff believe that the expert panel process used under the contract  produced a high-quality product.", "Federal comparative surveys. CMS hired a contractor in 2003 to further  increase the number of federal quality-of-care comparative surveys, but  dropped funding for quality-of-care comparative surveys from the fiscal  year 2006 contract. The agency reallocated the funds to help state survey  agencies meet the increased survey workload resulting from growth in the  number of other Medicare providers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["CMS has focused considerable attention since 1998 on addressing  weaknesses in state and federal oversight activities in order to better care  for and protect nursing home residents. The agency has implemented  many important improvements in the areas of surveys, complaints,  enforcement, and oversight, such as taking steps to address survey  predictability, issuing additional guidance to ensure timely on-site  investigations of complaints alleging harm to residents, implementing an  immediate sanctions policy to eliminate grace periods for homes cited for  repeat serious violations, and strengthening oversight by conducting  assessments of state survey activities. However, some key activities are  still in process. For example, CMS\u2019s effort to revise the survey  methodology has been underway for 7 years. Given the pivotal role played  by surveys in helping to ensure that nursing home residents receive high- quality care, the development and implementation of a more rigorous  survey methodology is one of the most important contributions CMS can  make to addressing oversight weaknesses. Certain other initiatives, such  as sharing data with the public in an effort to use market forces to drive  quality improvement, also remain in process. Since launching Nursing  Home Compare in 1998, CMS has been aware of accuracy and reliability  issues with the underlying data and began changing its approach to data  integrity in 2005. The agency is working to address issues concerning data  on nursing home staffing that compelled it to temporarily exclude  questionable data from its Web site in July 2005 until its accuracy can be  verified. Because consumers use these data to make decisions about  nursing home care, ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of  nursing home quality data is critical. Even with CMS\u2019s increased efforts to  improve nursing home quality, the agency\u2019s continued attention and  commitment to these efforts is essential in order to maintain and build  upon the momentum of its accomplishments to date."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and State Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided CMS a draft of this report for review. CMS generally  concurred with our findings, noting that progress has been made in many  areas such as surveys and complaint investigations, oversight activities,  and citation of serious deficiencies, but that challenges remain. (CMS\u2019s  comments are reproduced in app. V.) CMS also provided technical  comments, which we included in the report as appropriate. We also  provided the five states we contacted an opportunity to review the portion  of the draft focused on trends in nursing home quality. California, Florida,  Ohio, New York, and Texas provided written comments. California\u2019s  comments focused on clarifying its experience seeking CMS guidance on  the definition of actual harm, but did not state whether it agreed with our  findings. Ohio commented that our report\u2019s findings related to continued  inconsistency and understatement of serious deficiencies by state  surveyors did not apply to its state survey agency. New York stated that  including a more detailed description of states\u2019 efforts to improve nursing  home quality would provide a more balanced view of the reasons for the  decline in serious deficiencies. Florida and Texas generally concurred, but  Texas did not provide specific comments. CMS and states\u2019 specific  comments focused primarily on four issues: understatement of serious  deficiencies, the definition of actual harm, data availability, and challenges  to conducting nursing home survey and oversight activities.", "CMS commented that it remains concerned about the possible  understatement or omission of serious deficiencies, but that it did not  believe that understatement caused the decline in serious nursing home  deficiencies or that understatement was worsening. CMS noted its efforts  to work with states that fail to improve their ability to identify deficiencies  such as withholding funding increases until corrective action plans are  developed. Florida, New York, and Ohio similarly commented that efforts  such as their states\u2019 quality improvement initiatives, regulatory changes to  improve nursing home operations, and engagement of the provider  community have contributed to the decline.", "CMS suggested that including the results of observational surveys in our  analysis of the percentage of federal surveys that found serious  deficiencies missed by states would show that the percentage remained  relatively constant from 2002 to 2004 rather than increasing. As we noted  in our 1999 report, however, comparative surveys are more effective than  observational surveys in identifying serious deficiencies missed by state  surveyors because they are the only oversight tool that provides an  independent federal survey where results can be compared to those of the  state. Observational surveys can serve as an effective training tool for state  surveyors but, in our view, they do not accurately represent typical state  surveyor performance due to the likelihood that state surveyors modify  their performance when they are aware that they are being observed by  federal surveyors.", "Florida and Ohio noted that in addition to comparative surveys, CMS  conducted many observational surveys during the time period studied.  Ohio disagreed that our analysis of federal comparative surveys suggests  that nursing home surveyors in Ohio missed serious deficiencies, citing its  combined performance ratings for observational and comparative surveys.  New York commented that federal comparative surveys often do not  include the same resident sample used in the state survey and that only  looking at comparative surveys provides a narrow analysis of state survey  quality. New York suggested a more detailed analysis of comparative  survey data and consideration of state performance review results. We  note that, in 2002, CMS directed federal surveyors to include at least   50 percent of the residents included in the state survey sample. We also  acknowledge that CMS is conducting state performance reviews as part of  its oversight of state survey activities, but note that the reviews have  shortcomings as described in our July 2003 report. Florida noted that our  analysis of federal comparative surveys that identified missed serious  deficiencies is based on limited data. We acknowledge that our analysis is  based on a small number of surveys, but note that it includes the full  universe of comparative surveys conducted from March 2002 through  December 2004 in the five states we reviewed.", "The range of comments from states reinforces the need for CMS to clarify  the definition of actual harm, as it plans to do. California noted that while  some of its state surveyors were confused about the definition of actual  harm, after discussions with CMS from 1998 through 2004, the survey  agency and CMS are now in agreement on the definition of actual harm.  New York stated that confusion about the definition of actual harm has  been reduced. Ohio noted that its state surveyors are not confused by the  definition of actual harm, but that states have not received clear and  specific guidance from CMS. Florida agreed that clearer guidance would  be useful.", "CMS indicated that it is taking steps to improve the reliability and  accuracy of publicly reported data by identifying suspect data and posting  more detailed information about past noncompliance. As we state in our  report, we believe that consumers should have timely and accurate data to  inform their decisions regarding nursing home care.", "CMS commented that the workload issues described in this report present  challenges beyond those we have previously reported. CMS stated that  continued constraint of resources could \u201clikely cause some erosion of the  gains already made\u201d in the survey and oversight activities to date. To  address the challenges it faces, CMS plans to increase efforts to improve  productivity, determine the cost and value of policies, focus state  performance standards on substantive issues, prioritize survey activities,  coordinate with stakeholders, address increasing fuel costs, and enhance  emergency preparedness. California, Florida, New York, and Ohio  reiterated the staffing challenges they have experienced and the steps they  have taken to address them, some of which are described in this report.  Despite these efforts, California indicated that its staffing challenges have  negatively impacted the investigative process.
