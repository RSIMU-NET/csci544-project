GAO examined how three Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components were carrying out this charge: the Coast Guard, which has overall responsibility for security in the nation's ports; the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP), which awards grants for port security projects; and the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate (IAIP), which has responsibility for developing ways to assess risks across all types of critical infrastructure. GAO's work focused on identifying the progress each DHS component has made on risk management and the challenges each faces in moving further."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The three DHS components GAO studied varied considerably in their progress in developing a sound risk management framework for homeland security responsibilities. The varied progress reflects, among other things, each component's organizational maturity and the complexity of its task. The Coast Guard, which is furthest along, is the component of longest standing, being created in 1915, while IAIP came into being with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003. IAIP, which has made the least progress, is not only a new component but also has the most complex task--addressing not just ports but all types of infrastructure. The Coast Guard and ODP have a relatively robust methodology in place for assessing risks at ports; IAIP is still developing its methodology and has had several setbacks in completing the task. All three components, however, have much left to do. In particular, each component is limited in its ability to compare and prioritize risks. The Coast Guard and ODP can do so within a port but not between ports; IAIP has not demonstrated that it can do so either within or between all infrastructure sectors. Each component faces many challenges in making further progress. Success will depend partly on continuing to improve various technical and management processes that are part of risk management. For example, obtaining better quality data from intelligence agencies would help DHS components estimate the relative likelihood of various types of threats--a key element of assessing risks. In the longer term, progress will depend increasingly on how well risk management is coordinated across agencies, because current approaches in many ways are neither consistent nor comparable. Also, weaving risk-based data into the annual budget cycle of program review will be important. Supplying the necessary guidance and coordination is what the Department of Homeland Security was set up to do and, as the Secretary of Homeland Security has stated, what it now needs increasingly to address. This is a key issue for the department as it seeks to identify relative risks and take appropriate actions related to the nation's homeland security activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The threat of terrorism presents a number of risks to our nation\u2019s seaports  and other types of critical infrastructure.

Although risk  management has long been used for assessing risk in some sectors, such  as environmental issues, health care, finance, and the insurance industry,  the application of risk management principles to the homeland security  area is relatively new. The many areas and activities under homeland  security provide untested and difficult challenges because the source of  the risk is an intelligent adversary with whom there exists little domestic  experience.

The process is dynamic, and although the  various phases appear linear, new information can be entered at any  phase. The framework can be used to inform agency officials and decision  makers of the basic components of a risk management system or can be  used as a stand-alone guide.

Strategic goals at the highest level could be considered an \u201cend- state\u201d followed by a logical hierarchy of major goals and subordinate  objectives composed of clear, concise, measurable activities and timelines  to achieve results and ensure accountability. An organization\u2019s program or  plan and risk planning documents should address risk-related issues that  are central to its mission. Our work related to the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 has produced guidance that  identifies risk for the congressional oversight of federal agencies\u2019 strategic  plans. The consideration of risk in strategic planning may be incorporated  into planning documents or into specific management strategies.", "Currently, it is difficult to translate plans and actions into a clear sense of  how we are progressing in making our nation more secure. One reason is  that homeland security efforts, in general, lack clear goals with  corresponding performance measures to evaluate progress toward these  goals. As others, such as the Gilmore Commission, have stated, a  continuing problem for homeland security has been the lack of clear  strategic guidance about the definition and objectives of preparedness.", "Risk management allows entities to operate more effectively in  environments of uncertainty by providing the discipline and structure in  which to address these issues, since risk management is not an end in  itself, but an important component of an entity\u2019s management process. As  such, risk management is interrelated with, among other things, an entity\u2019s  governance, performance management, and internal controls. The process  of risk management provides the rigor and structure necessary to identify  and select among alternative risk responses whose cumulative effect is  intended to reduce risk, and the methodologies and techniques for making  selection decisions. This process enables entities to enhance their  capability to identify potential adverse events, assess risks, and establish  integrated responses. Further, this phase in the planning process would  include support and buy-in from upper levels of management and  stakeholders. Acceptance for concepts of the model from this group  provides the groundwork for future discussions.", "Finally, various constraints may have an impact on risk management  plans. Some constraints may be imposed by statute, higher-level policy,  budget, or other factors beyond management\u2019s control and may vary with  the scale of the application. Managers at different levels within an  organization will have different degrees of flexibility to institute risk  management countermeasures. An important constraint for federal  agencies, such as DHS, is the role that Congress plays in authorizing and  funding programs. For example, Congress may direct specific actions  affecting how agencies allocate funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Assessment", "paragraphs": ["This phase addresses the process of evaluating the threats and  vulnerabilities of assets so that countermeasures might be instituted to  prevent or mitigate risks. Threat, in the risk management model, concerns  the probability that a specific type of attack will be initiated against a  specific target. It includes any circumstance or event with the potential to  cause loss or damage to the asset. Although agencies may not have enough  information to identify and characterize all threats related to their assets,  known or imagined adverse events would be characterized in some detail.  Effective threat analysis is dependent on an understanding of an  adversary\u2019s intention, motivation, historical data, and capability to  damage. An additional crucial component of risk assessment is  vulnerability, that is, any weakness that an adversary can exploit to harm  or damage the asset. An asset may be highly vulnerable to one mode of  attack but have a low level of vulnerability to another, depending on a  variety of factors, such as countermeasures already in place. While  consequence concerns the result of an adverse event on a particular asset,  criticality is the asset\u2019s relative importance to the entity. A criticality  assessment identifies and prioritizes assets and functions in terms of  specific criteria, such as their importance to public safety and the  economy, as a basis for identifying which structures or processes are  relatively more important to protect from attack. Criticality assessments  are important because they provide, in combination with the framework\u2019s  threat and risk assessments, the basis for prioritizing which assets require  greater protection relative to finite resources and provide information for  later stages in the risk management process. Risk assessments should  utilize the most appropriate subject matter experts in assessing the  components of risk. When dealing with Bayesian probability estimates,  this is critical. In addition, mathematical constructs must be chosen  carefully, specifically tailoring approaches in the context of uncertainty  and data quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["This phase addresses the evaluation of risk reduction methods by  consideration of countermeasures or countermeasure systems and the  costs and benefits associated with them.

Furthermore, a strategy might include risk management  consultants and decision-making tools, such as software that simulates a  particular type of attack. Information developed in previous phases would  inform decisions.", "Specific countermeasures would be considered and prioritized based on a  number of factors, such as the degree of risk reduction they afford and the  cost and difficulty to implement them. Risk assessment may give guidance  to implementing countermeasures or countermeasure systems that may be  used for more than one critical asset, or to prevent, mitigate, or respond to  multiple adverse events occurring simultaneously. In addition, external  risk consultants can be advantageous at this phase in terms of creating a  variety of countermeasure options. While external reviewers cannot  ensure the success of a plan, they can increase the probability of selecting  the most effective countermeasures for the least cost because of their  expertise in the area. Further, risk scenarios might also provide valuable  information pertaining to an entity\u2019s ability to respond to a terrorist event,  evaluate its coordination with other entities, identify problems, and  institute corrective action.", "Finally, a risk management strategy should include a cost-benefit analysis  of countermeasure options as they are a critical element of alternatives  evaluation. Major regulatory actions or capital investments of federal  expenditures generally require a cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness  approach. This approach can be useful in evaluating alternatives, since it  links the benefits from risk-reducing countermeasures to the costs  associated with them. In the development of such analyses, quantitative  impacts affecting both costs and benefits are, to the extent possible,  identified in monetary terms.", "While the core OMB guidance for evaluating countermeasures for  budgetary and regulatory purposes focuses on monetary cost-benefit  evaluation, OMB is essentially silent when costs and benefits cannot be  easily quantified or monetized. Costs that are not generally estimated or  included in monetary terms include opportunity costs, that is, the value of  opportunities forgone because resources are applied to antiterrorism  countermeasures. These costs are most controversial when considered in  areas such as public service programs or services curtailed or cancelled.

Management\u2019s active  participation in this phase is important as decisions are of necessity  influenced by the preferences and value judgments of agency leadership.  For example, some managers will prefer to concentrate countermeasures  on a relatively few critical assets, while others may value distributional  impacts, that is, to distribute resources over a wide variety of assets.  Ideally, a risk management strategy would also identify appropriate  mechanisms to allocate resources, such as grants based on identified  needs. Furthermore, a key factor in the selection of risk reducing  measures is risk tolerance, the level of comfort management has with  various levels of risk. This tolerance may change over time, depending on  new information, changes in financial constraints, and attitude toward  risk. The risk management strategy, with stakeholder input, will identify  what constitutes an acceptable level of risk for assets and how resources  are delegated.", "The risk management strategy reflects consideration as to which risks  should be managed immediately and to what extent, and which risks can  be deferred and addressed at a later time.
