While the three goals in the 2014 strategic plan are broadly similar to those in the previous plan issued in 2012, FHFA changed the weight and wording of the goals (see table) to align the plan more closely with FHFA's statutory responsibilities. Specifically, compared with the 2012 plan FHFA (1) increased its emphasis on maintaining credit availability and foreclosure prevention options; (2) shifted away from shrinking the enterprises as a way to reduce taxpayer risk (focusing instead on transferring credit risk to private investors, for example); and (3) reduced the scope of the securitization infrastructure being built, such as a new technology platform for securitizing mortgages, to focus on meeting the enterprises' current needs.", "In the absence of congressional direction, FHFA's shift in priorities has altered market participants' perceptions and expectations about the enterprises' ongoing role and added to uncertainty about the future structure of the housing finance system. In particular, FHFA halted several actions aimed at reducing the scope of enterprise activities and is seeking to maintain the enterprises in their current state. However, other actions (such as reducing their capital bases to $0 by January 2018) are written into agreements for capital support with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and continue to be implemented. In addition, the change in scope for the technology platform for securitization puts less emphasis on reducing barriers facing private entities than previously envisioned, and new initiatives to expand mortgage availability could crowd out market participants. Furthermore, some actions, such as transferring credit risk to private investors, could decrease the likelihood of drawing on Treasury's funding commitment, but others, such as reducing minimum down payments, could increase it. GAO has identified setting clear objectives as a key principle for providing government assistance to private market participants. Because Congress has not established objectives for the future of the enterprises after conservatorships or the federal role in housing finance, FHFA's ability to shift priorities may continue to contribute to market uncertainty."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider legislation that would establish clear objectives and a transition plan to a reformed housing finance system that enables the enterprises to exit conservatorship.

At the time, the enterprises guaranteed about $4.5 trillion in  mortgage-backed securities (MBS), on par with their current exposure.  The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) provided substantial capital  support to the enterprises as part of senior preferred stock purchase  agreements, as authorized under the Housing and Economic Recovery  Act (HERA), so that the enterprises could continue to support mortgage  finance through the secondary mortgage market in accordance with their  charters. In doing so, Treasury committed to provide funds to the  enterprises to avoid insolvency. Before receiving Treasury support, the  enterprises\u2019 guarantees had been viewed by the market as being  implicitly backed by the federal government. This market perception  lowered the enterprises\u2019 overall cost of doing business. As of September  2016, Treasury had provided about $187.5 billion in funds as capital  support to the enterprises, with an additional $258.1 billion available to  the enterprises should they need further assistance. In accordance with  the terms of the agreements with Treasury, the enterprises had declared  and paid dividends to Treasury totaling about $250.5 billion through  September 2016.", "Congress did not provide direction on reforming the enterprises when it  granted conservatorship authority to FHFA.

To accomplish this goal, the enterprises  purchase conventional mortgages that meet their underwriting standards,  known as conforming mortgages, from primary mortgage lenders such as  banks or savings associations. Mortgage lenders sell mortgages to  transfer risk (especially interest rate risk in the case of fixed-rate  mortgages) or increase liquidity. They can use the proceeds from selling  mortgages to the enterprises to originate additional mortgages, or they  may exchange a pool of mortgages for enterprise-backed MBS, which  they can keep or sell. The enterprises package mortgages they purchase  into MBS, which are sold to investors in the secondary mortgage market.  In exchange for a fee (the guarantee fee), the enterprises guarantee the  timely payment of interest and principal on MBS that they issue. These  fees are typically incorporated into the interest rates charged to  borrowers.

Additionally, the Emergency Economic  Stabilization Act of 2008 directed FHFA and other agencies to implement  plans seeking to maximize assistance for homeowners and encourage  mortgage servicers to take advantage of available programs to minimize  foreclosures.", "HERA authorized the Director of FHFA to appoint FHFA as conservator  or receiver for the enterprises for the purpose of reorganizing,  rehabilitating, or winding up their affairs. As conservator, FHFA was  authorized to take such action as may be necessary to put the regulated  entity in a sound and solvent condition, as well as such action as may be  appropriate to carry on the business of the regulated entity and to  preserve and conserve the assets and property of the regulated entity.  Upon placing the enterprises into conservatorships, FHFA succeeded by  operation of law to the authority of the enterprises\u2019 management, boards  of directors, and shareholders during the period of the conservatorships.  However, according to FHFA, it does not manage every aspect of the  enterprises\u2019 operations.

The objective of the  framework is to enhance transparency and certainty for lenders by  clarifying when a mortgage loan may be subject to repurchase. This  clarity may give lenders more confidence to lend, which helps  maintain borrowers\u2019 access to credit. For example, currently lenders  are eligible for relief from certain representations and warranties when  borrowers make 36 consecutive payments with no more than two  delinquencies of 30 days or less. The enterprises categorized loan  origination and servicing defects and the appropriate remedies  available to address them in the framework and established an  independent dispute resolution program to resolve contested loan- level disputes about repurchase requests. The final piece of the  framework was put in place in February 2016.", "Loss mitigation and foreclosure prevention. In an effort to help  borrowers avoid foreclosure, FHFA worked with the enterprises to  align their servicing policies and develop loss mitigation tools that  included loan modifications, streamlined refinance options, and  foreclosure prevention actions including short sales and deeds-in-lieu  of foreclosure. FHFA and the enterprises also made enhancements  to requirements related to foreclosure alternatives, unemployment  forbearance, and rate-reset notifications. For example, the enterprises  announced in June 2014 that mortgage servicers could approve  eligible borrowers for extended unemployment forbearance without  obtaining prior written authorization from the enterprises. Finally, the  enterprises have used sales of nonperforming loans to transfer pools  of severely delinquent loans to new buyers and servicers with the goal  of providing more favorable outcomes for borrowers while also  reducing losses to the enterprises and, therefore, to taxpayers.", "In addition, FHFA identified a number of new activities, some of which the  enterprises have begun implementing, that serve to expand its efforts to  maintain credit availability and foreclosure prevention as market  conditions improve, including  lowering the minimum down payment from 5 percent to 3 percent; providing for principal forgiveness for an estimated 30,000 borrowers  in default; issuing proposed rules outlining the enterprises\u2019 duty to serve certain  underserved segments of the market; and  transferring funds to a statutory housing trust fund that will be  distributed through grants made to the states.", "FHFA also reframed the enterprises\u2019 actions in multifamily production to  focus on maintaining credit availability rather than on reducing their  market share. Beginning in 2013, FHFA imposed a production cap on  the enterprises\u2019 multifamily business. However, since 2014 FHFA has  allowed the enterprises to exclude from the caps affordable housing  loans, loans to small multifamily properties, and loans to manufactured  housing rental communities. In addition, FHFA increased the 2016  multifamily lending caps for the enterprises from $31 billion to $36.5 billion. The adjustment for 2016 was based on increased estimates of  the overall size of the 2016 multifamily finance market due to continued  high levels of property acquisitions and deliveries of newly constructed  apartment units, as well as record levels of maturing loans that required  refinancing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHFA Shifted Efforts for Reducing Taxpayer Risk Away from Decreasing the Enterprises\u2019 Role", "paragraphs": ["FHFA\u2019s second goal in the 2014 plan, like the corresponding goal in the  2012 plan, is aimed at transferring risk from the enterprises (and  taxpayers) to private investors.

In 2012, the  goal was to \u201cgradually contract the enterprises\u2019 dominant presence in the  marketplace while simplifying and shrinking their operations\u201d (Contract  goal). The 2014 plan rephrases the goal as to \u201creduce taxpayer risk  through increasing the role of private capital in the mortgage market\u201d  (Reduce goal) and shifts away from decreasing the enterprises\u2019 role in the  housing market. In addition, FHFA reduced the weight that activities  under the second goal were given in FHFA\u2019s annual scorecards, from 50  percent in 2013 to 30 percent in 2014 through 2016.", "As FHFA noted in the 2014 strategic plan, its statutory responsibilities as  conservator do not include making policy decisions on the future of  housing finance reform. FHFA officials told us that the current Director did  not believe that shrinking the enterprises\u2019 dominant presence in the  market was FHFA\u2019s decision to make because Congress had not yet  acted on housing finance reform.", "Additionally, FHFA noted that it was concerned about the effects of  shrinking the enterprises\u2019 operations on mortgage market liquidity and the  availability of mortgage credit, which it was seeking to support through its  Maintain goal. In other words, there may have been tension between the  Contract goal and the Maintain goal in the 2012 plan, and shifting risk  from taxpayers to private market participants without contracting the  enterprises\u2019 presence in the market helped eliminate this tension.

Another action was  reframed: the multifamily production activities that in the 2014 plan focus  on maintaining access to credit and are therefore included in the Maintain  goal, as discussed previously.", "In its efforts to support the new focus of the Reduce goal, FHFA has  taken several actions, including the following:", "Credit risk transfers. FHFA directed the enterprises to transfer a  portion of the credit risk they face on the mortgages they securitize to  private investors. These transfers of risk can occur either before  (\u201cfront-end\u201d) or after (\u201cback-end\u201d) the enterprises purchase mortgages.  The enterprises primarily employed back-end risk transfers in the first  3 years of the initiative (2013\u20132015), but recently they have been  trying various structures, including some front-end transfers. Under  the debt issuance structure for credit risk transfers (the structure the  enterprises have used most), the enterprises sell debt to investors  and receive payment up front at the time of the sale. The enterprises  repay the debt based on the performance of a reference pool of  mortgages, in which the investor earns a higher return if the  mortgages perform well and a lower return should they perform  poorly. From 2013 through 2015, the enterprises completed 70  transactions that transferred credit risk totaling $30.6 billion on single- family mortgages with an unpaid principal balance of about $838  billion. In June 2016, FHFA issued a request for input on proposals for  the enterprises to adopt a number of front-end credit risk transfer  structures.", "Private mortgage insurance standards. FHFA and the enterprises  updated eligibility requirements for private mortgage insurers seeking  to insure loans that are eligible for purchase by the enterprises. These  requirements help to ensure the stability of mortgage insurance  companies that are counterparties of the enterprises, reducing  counterparty risk to the enterprises and, by extension, risk to  taxpayers. Among other things, the requirements establish financial  standards for private mortgage insurers to demonstrate adequate  resources to pay claims and operational standards relating to quality  control processes and performance metrics.

Since 2012, the  enterprises had been working to develop the framework to align the  contracts and data disclosures that supported fully guaranteed MBS  issued by the enterprises and craft a set of uniform contractual terms and  standards for transparency for MBS that carried no or only a partial  federal guarantee and that could be broadly accepted by issuers and  investors. To develop this framework, FHFA was incorporating input it  received in 2012 on a proposal for a standardized pooling and servicing  agreement. According to FHFA, by the end of 2013 the enterprises had  made progress toward developing preliminary recommendations for the  framework. However, the 2014 strategic plan did not mention the  framework. FHFA officials said that the effort to develop the framework  was distracting FHFA from focusing on addressing the enterprises\u2019  securitization infrastructure needs, particularly those related to the  implementation of a Single Security (discussed later). They said  discontinuing the work on the framework was part of a strategy to mitigate  risk through managing the scope of the infrastructure they were building.  Additionally, the officials said that private industry groups commented to  FHFA that such an effort should be left to the private sector.", "Despite the change in goal\u2019s scope in the 2014 plan, FHFA is continuing  efforts begun earlier to create a new securitization infrastructure\u2014most  notably, a common securitization platform. The common securitization  platform is a technology and operational platform that will perform many  of the enterprises\u2019 current securitization functions for single-family  mortgages on behalf of the enterprises. FHFA directed the enterprises to  develop a common platform to replace the information technology  platforms at each enterprise that support their securitization activities.  While the common platform is designed to meet the current securitization  activities of the enterprises, it is being built using open architecture and  industry standard software, systems, and data requirements with the goal  of being adaptable for use by other market participants in the future.  According to FHFA officials, focusing first on meeting the known  requirements of the enterprises made the most sense for defining the  scope of the work and managing the project. Nonetheless, they said the  ultimate goal of building an infrastructure that can be used by other  market participants remains an important part of the Build goal and has  informed many decisions FHFA has made.", "FHFA expects the platform to be implemented in two releases:  Implementation of the first release is scheduled to occur before the  end of 2016 and should allow Freddie Mac to use the platform to  issue its current single-class securities. In preparation for the first  release, Freddie Mac and Common Securitization Solutions, LLC, a  joint venture of the enterprises that was formed to operate the  platform, successfully completed system-to-system and end-to-end  testing of the functionality of the platform in early 2016.", "The second release is scheduled for 2018, when both enterprises  plan to use the platform to issue a Single Security, which FHFA is  developing to replace the different MBS they currently offer. Unlike the  enterprises\u2019 current products, the new securities will have the same  features, and the goal is for the market to treat them as fungible  irrespective of the enterprise that issued them. In addition, the  enterprises will be able to commingle first-level and second-level  securities from either enterprise in the second-level securities they  issue. As of July 2016, FHFA had finalized the features of the Single  Security after soliciting and incorporating input from the public. FHFA  also updated loan-level disclosures and announced that the  enterprises will begin issuing these securities in 2018.", "To support the Build goal, FHFA and the enterprises continue to develop  mortgage data standards for the single family loans they purchase  through the Uniform Mortgage Data Program. This program has provided  lenders with common and consistent definitions and specification for  various mortgage data, including appraisal, loan delivery, mortgage loan  application, and closing disclosure information. The enterprises currently  collect standardized appraisal and loan delivery data, and expect to  implement a data collection system for the closing disclosure dataset in  the third quarter of 2017. As part of a new mortgage loan application, the  enterprises released technical requirements and an associated dataset to  electronically capture loan application information to the industry in the  third quarter of 2016.

At the same time, FHFA officials told us that the  strategy was intended to be neutral in terms of the enterprises\u2019 future  structure and left all reform options open. Our analysis comparing FHFA\u2019s  actions with legislative proposals to reform the enterprises\u2019 structure  found that some proposals continue or build upon actions FHFA has  taken, such as the common securitization platform and credit risk  transfers. However, proposals that incorporate the same future structure  for the enterprises do not consistently build upon the same actions. For  example, one legislative proposal that replaces the enterprises with a  single federal agency builds upon FHFA\u2019s credit risk transfer initiative, but  other similar proposals do not explicitly address credit risk transfers. As a  result, FHFA\u2019s actions are not necessary to transitioning to the particular  structures in any of these proposals, such as a single governmental  agency or fully privatized companies. In addition, we found that the  same actions were included in multiple proposals that envisioned different  future structures for the enterprises.", "Industry stakeholders generally said that FHFA\u2019s recent actions have not  advanced or constrained any of the future structures for the enterprises  outlined in legislative proposals. Representatives from two industry  associations told us that FHFA\u2019s recent actions have been neutral as to  the future structure. However, other industry stakeholders who are  members of a third industry association noted that FHFA had taken steps  prior to 2014 to harmonize the enterprises\u2019 policies, procedures, and  products, some of which continued after the publication of the 2014 plan,  such as the development of a Single Security and the common  securitization platform. Taking these steps could facilitate (but would not  require) merging the enterprises into a single entity. But whether that  single entity would be a government agency, government corporation, or  private entity was unclear to these stakeholders. Officials from another  industry association said that instead the enterprises could be  recapitalized as competitors to one another but that it was unclear how  they would be able to balance competing against each other with working  together to ensure the common securitization platform works well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHFA\u2019s Change in Priorities Puts Less Emphasis on Addressing Barriers to Entry into the Secondary Mortgage Market, Adding to Uncertainty", "paragraphs": ["As outlined in the 2012 strategic plan, FHFA set out to address a number  of barriers to entry into the secondary mortgage market. By creating a  common securitization platform using open architecture, a model pooling  and servicing agreement (which evolved into the contractual and  disclosure framework discussed previously), and standardized mortgage  data, along with contracting the enterprises\u2019 presence through increased  guarantee fees, FHFA sought to make entry into the secondary market  easier for private entities. However, over time most of these actions were  scoped down or eliminated, resulting in a reduced emphasis on  addressing barriers. Some industry stakeholders said that FHFA\u2019s shift in  direction sent mixed messages to market participants and increased  uncertainty about the role private entities should be playing in the  secondary mortgage market.", "For example, some industry stakeholders we spoke with perceived a  technological barrier to entry into the secondary mortgage market. The shift in the Build goal from 2012 to 2014 related to the common  securitization platform does not clearly address this barrier as it is less  clear whether private entities will be able to use the platform. According to  FHFA officials, many decisions remain to be made about whether, when,  and for what purposes private entities will be able to use the platform,  which adds to uncertainty.", "As another example, FHFA and the enterprises began developing a  contractual and disclosure framework but decided to halt the effort in  2014. The framework had the potential to help address some of the  governance issues that some industry stakeholders said were holding  back the secondary mortgage market\u2019s private-label MBS. These  governance issues include a lack of alignment of interests among parties  to a securitization transaction and processes for holding servicers for the  underlying mortgages accountable for their performance. Some industry  stakeholders we spoke to said that completing the framework, while  potentially helpful in addressing some issues, would have been unlikely to  fully address the barriers that continue to prevent the private-label MBS  market from growing. According to FHFA officials, the private sector has  worked on developing its own framework, and this effort is ongoing.", "Further, changes to FHFA\u2019s Maintain goal from the 2012 plan to the 2014  plan have expanded the enterprises\u2019 reach to put them in competition with  other market participants. Rather than addressing barriers to entry for  private entities, these actions may enhance rather than lessen the  enterprises\u2019 existing advantages, which serve as barriers to entry and add  to market participants\u2019 uncertainty about their role in the market relative to  the enterprises. For example, allowing down payments as low as 3  percent expands the market segments the enterprises serve. According  to an industry stakeholder, doing so could push other market participants  out of these segments because the enterprises have built-in  advantages\u2014such as lower cost of funding and a government  guarantee\u2014that may make their products more attractive. Another  stakeholder said the proposed rule on the enterprises\u2019 duty to serve  underserved markets, could also increase the enterprises\u2019 competition  with private entities, depending on future decisions.", "Increases in guarantee fees that occurred in the first few years of the  conservatorship began to address the barrier posed by the enterprises\u2019  pricing advantage. According to the Urban Institute, other options for  lenders, such as holding certain loans in portfolio, made more financial  sense as the cost of selling loans to the enterprises increased.  However, not continuing the increases as envisioned in the 2012 plan  under the Contract goal could make these options less attractive than  selling to the enterprises, according to an industry stakeholder. As a  result, lenders may focus on making loans that can be sold to the  enterprises and place less emphasis on reaching segments of the  population that do not qualify for those loans. On the other hand, lower  guarantee fees keep mortgages affordable, which has been the aim of the  Maintain goal in both the 2012 and 2014 plans.", "In addition, the Reduce goal includes developing new front-end credit risk  transfers to increase the amount of risk borne by private entities. Some  industry stakeholders expressed concern that possible options for front- end credit risk transfer transactions could increase barriers to entry for  mortgage originators, depending on how the transactions are structured.  FHFA officials noted that they would be reviewing comments on how to  structure these front-end transactions after the close of the comment  period on October 13, 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whether FHFA\u2019s Actions Reduce the Likelihood of Drawing on Treasury\u2019s Capital Commitment Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["FHFA has taken some actions that could increase the likelihood of  drawing on Treasury\u2019s capital commitment under the agreements as well  as other actions that could have the opposite effect, and the net effect of  these actions is uncertain. Some of FHFA\u2019s newer actions supporting the  2014 plan could increase credit risk and therefore the likelihood of  needing further assistance from Treasury. For example, one industry  stakeholder said allowing the enterprises to purchase riskier mortgages,  such as those with a 3 percent down payment and expanding the  enterprises\u2019 service to certain underserved segments of the market, could  increase the likelihood of a draw on Treasury under the agreements.  However, the underwriting requirements for these mortgages and the fees  the enterprises collect help offset the increased risk. In addition, FHFA  officials noted that these actions currently represent a small portion of the  enterprises\u2019 business and therefore would have a minimal impact on the  likelihood of drawing on Treasury\u2019s funding commitment.", "Several actions FHFA is taking, such as credit risk transfers and the  Single Security, would reduce the likelihood of needing additional  Treasury support, according to FHFA. These and other actions, including  private mortgage insurer standards, the representations and warranties  framework, and loss mitigation and foreclosure prevention activities,  reduce credit risk or counterparty risk to the enterprises. While FHFA  has directed the enterprises to engage in a growing set of credit risk  transfers including front-end transfers, such as deeper mortgage  insurance, the enterprises (as of 2016) have mostly conducted back-end  risk transfers. With back-end transfers, the enterprises hold the credit  risk until they complete the credit risk transfer transactions. In front-end  transactions, private entities agree to take on a portion of the credit risk  before or at the same time the loans are delivered to the enterprises.  FHFA has stated that the enterprises need to issue a large enough  volume of transactions to ensure a liquid market for credit risk transfer  products. But FHFA has also stated that the enterprises need to avoid an  excess supply of any particular product to the market that, for example,  causes investors to abandon the market because the value of their  existing holdings is reduced. Some industry stakeholders we spoke with  noted that the enterprises have not been particularly attuned to investor  demand when determining the timing, volume, and pricing of credit risk  transfer transactions. As a result, investors\u2019 demand for credit risk transfer  transactions may not meet the volume offered, and the enterprises could  find themselves retaining more risk than planned.", "The enterprises\u2019 results from their annual stress tests have improved  each year since 2014 (see fig. 2). Although linking the changes in  results to specific actions they and FHFA have taken is difficult, these  results suggest that draws from Treasury due to negative economic  conditions are less likely than they were several years ago. FHFA officials  stated that loss mitigation actions, sales of illiquid assets from retained  portfolios, and better credit quality in newer loans all contribute to the  improved results, along with improved market factors such as house price  appreciation. According to FHFA, credit risk transfers would also have an  impact on the stress test results, even though the overall effect has been  small given that the program is in the relatively early stages. However,  the stress tests show that both enterprises would still need capital support  from Treasury under a severely adverse economic scenario. As noted  earlier, in January 2018 the enterprises\u2019 capital reserve amount will fall to  $0 as required by the agreements with Treasury, meaning any quarterly  losses\u2014including those due to market fluctuations and not necessarily to  economic conditions\u2014will require additional draws from Treasury under  the agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Has Not Defined Objectives for Concluding the Conservatorships That Would Address Uncertainty", "paragraphs": ["In the 8 years since the enterprises were placed in conservatorships,  Congress has not enacted legislation that establishes objectives for  concluding the conservatorships and the future structure of the  enterprises. One of the long-standing principles we have identified that  should serve as a guide for providing government assistance to private  market participants is setting clear objectives. In this case, clarity on  issues related to comprehensive housing finance system reform is  needed in order for the enterprises to exit conservatorship. According to  FHFA, setting objectives for the conclusion of the conservatorships  should be left to Congress. In a 2014 report, we outlined a framework  consisting of nine elements that Congress could use to assess or craft  proposals as it considers changes to the housing finance system. These  elements are  clearly defined and prioritized housing finance system goals; policies and mechanisms that are aligned with goals and other adherence to an appropriate financial regulatory framework; government entities that have capacity to manage risks; protections for mortgage borrowers and reductions in barriers to protection for mortgage securities investors;  consideration of cyclical nature of housing finance and impact of  housing finance on financial stability;  recognition and control of fiscal exposure and mitigation of moral  hazard; and emphasis on implications of the transition.", "As noted earlier, the 113th Congress considered a number of proposals  for reforming the housing finance system, but none were enacted.

Given the unknown duration of  the conservatorships, without Congress providing explicit direction for the  future of the enterprises, a change in leadership at FHFA could again shift  priorities for the conservatorships and set the enterprises on a new path  with another vision for their role and future structure.

However, Congress has yet to establish objectives for the  future of the enterprises after conservatorship or the future federal role in  housing finance.
