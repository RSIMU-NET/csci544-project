Together, these factors increase the chances for success and help the program achieve desired results. Although incomplete, IRS has taken actions to address these factors. For example, IRS has been developing (1) program performance measures and goals, (2) plans for a computer system to transmit data to PCAs, (3) a method to select cases for PCAs, and (4) contract provisions to govern data security and PCAs' interactions with taxpayers. IRS officials recognize that major development work remains and have plans to finish it. Officials said they would suspend work if PCA authorizing legislation is not passed during 2004. If legislation passes, officials estimated that it would take 18 to 24 months to send the first cases to PCAs. Aware of concerns about the efficiency of using PCAs, IRS intends to study the relative performance of PCAs and IRS employees in collecting tax debts after gaining some experience with them. However, the initial idea for a study would provide limited information to judge whether or when the PCA approach is the best use of resources. The tentative idea--comparing PCA and IRS performance for the same type of simpler cases to be sent to PCAs--does not recognize that IRS officials believe that using IRS employees on such cases would not be the best use of staff. Federal guidance emphasizes efficiently and effectively using resources to achieve results and identifying the most realistic and cost-effective program option. Experience gained in using PCAs and a new IRS case selection process would help officials design such a study."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the last several years, Congress, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  and others have been concerned that performance declines in IRS\u2019s  programs to collect known unpaid taxes due the government might be  affecting taxpayers\u2019 confidence in the fairness of our tax system and  voluntary compliance.  In testimonies and reports, we have highlighted  such declines in the collection programs, including a growing gap between  the number of cases assigned for collection action and the number of cases  closed each year.  Also, the amount of potentially collectable known tax  debt has grown.  As of September 30, 2003, IRS had an inventory of unpaid  taxes with some collection potential\u2014including interest and penalties\u2014of  $120 billion, up from $112 billion the previous year.  According to IRS, the  backlog of outstanding tax debt continues to grow 3 to 4 percent each year.  Because of potential revenue losses and the threat to voluntary  compliance, we have designated collection of unpaid taxes as a high-risk  area for the federal government.", "To help address the growing tax debt inventory, the Department of the  Treasury has proposed that Congress pass legislation to authorize IRS to  use private collection agencies (PCA) to help collect tax debts for simpler  types of cases, paying them out of a revolving fund of tax revenues that  they collect.  IRS officials said that this proposal arose, in part, because of  the belief that Congress was not likely to provide the increased budget to  hire enough IRS staff to work on the inventory of collection cases.    Although the proposal has received support, some have expressed  concerns that it might be unsuccessful, inefficient, or result in taxpayers  being mistreated or having private tax information compromised.  In  addition, some in Congress and elsewhere in the tax community have said  that increasing IRS collection staff\u2014instead of contracting out tax collection\u2014could result in tax debts being collected at less cost.  A 1996  IRS pilot test to contract with PCAs was discontinued, in part, because the  revenue collected was less than IRS\u2019s direct costs plus revenues lost from  using IRS employees to support PCAs rather than to collect taxes.  Our  review of the pilot found that, among other limitations, IRS\u2019s computer  systems and inability to transfer data hampered efforts to send appropriate  cases to PCAs.", "Due to congressional interest in the legislation being considered to  authorize IRS contracts with PCAs to collect simpler tax debts, we  reviewed, as part of our basic legislative responsibility for reviewing  federal programs and activities, various issues related to IRS\u2019s preparations  to implement the proposal, if enacted, and to report on the role of PCAs in  IRS\u2019s overall collections strategy.  Specifically, our objectives were to (1)  identify the critical success factors for contracting with PCAs for tax debt  collection; (2) determine whether IRS has addressed the critical success  factors in developing the proposed PCA contracting program and, if not,  what is left to be done; and (3) determine whether, if IRS receives authority  to use PCAs, it will do a study that will enable policymakers to judge  whether contracting with PCAs is the best use of limited federal funds to  achieve IRS\u2019s collection objectives.", "To identify the critical success factors, we interviewed officials from  selected state revenue departments and federal agencies that use PCAs and  PCA contractors for government debt collection.  We reviewed related  documentation from these sources.  In addition, we analyzed our reports  on contracting practices. For our other objectives, we gathered and  analyzed PCA program development documents and interviewed IRS  officials responsible for developing the PCA program.  We conducted our  work between June 2003 and March 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.  Our scope and methodology are  discussed in detail beginning on page 7."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["IRS has two major programs to collect tax debts: telephone collection and  field collection.  If taxpayers become delinquent (that is, do not pay their  taxes after being notified of amounts owed), IRS staff assigned to the  telephone collection program may attempt collection over the phone or in  writing.  According to IRS officials, IRS collection staff who make phone  calls have not been initiating many calls to ask taxpayers to pay their tax  debts but rather have been responding to phone calls from taxpayers about  mailed tax due notices.  If more in-depth collection action or analyses of  the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay tax debt is required, telephone collection staff  may refer the case to field collections, where staff may visit delinquent  taxpayers at their homes or businesses as well as contact them by  telephone and mail.  Under certain circumstances, the telephone or field  staff are authorized to initiate enforced collection action, such as recording  liens on taxpayer property and sending notices to levy taxpayer wages,  bank accounts, and other financial assets held by third parties.  Field staff  also can be authorized to seize other assets owned by the taxpayer to  satisfy the tax debt.", "As we have previously reported, in recent years IRS has deferred collection  action on billions of dollars of delinquent tax debt and IRS collection  program performance indicators have declined. By the end of fiscal year  2003, IRS\u2019s inventory of tax debt with some collection potential was $120  billion (up from $112 billion in the previous year). As we reported in May  2002, from fiscal years 1996 through 2001, IRS had almost universal  declines in collection performance, including declines in coverage of  workload, cases closed, direct staff time used, productivity, and dollars of  unpaid taxes collected.  Although IRS\u2019s collection workload declined, the  collection cases closed declined more rapidly, increasing the gap between  the number of cases assigned for collection action and the number of cases  closed each year (see fig. 2 in app. I).  As a result, in March 1999, IRS  started deferring collection action on billions of dollars in delinquencies.  By the end of fiscal year 2002, IRS had deferred collection action on about  $15 billion, and, as of May 2003, was deferring action on about one of every  three collection cases.", "Furthermore, IRS\u2019s collection staffing has declined overall comparing 1996  to 2003 (see fig. 3 in app. I) despite IRS\u2019s efforts to increase collection  staffing in its budget requests since 2001.  As we previously reported, IRS  officials have said that collection staffing declines and delays in hiring have  been caused by increased workload in other essential operations (such as  as processing returns, issuing refunds, and answering taxpayer mail), other  priorities (such as taxpayer service), and unbudgeted cost increases (such  as rent and pay increases).", "According to statements by the previous and current IRS commissioners,  IRS\u2019s growing workload has outpaced its resources.  The former IRS  Commissioner\u2019s report to the IRS Oversight Board during September 2002  made a case for additional staff to check tax compliance and collect taxes  owed. The Commissioner recognized that IRS needed to improve the  productive use of its current resources, but also cited a need for an annual  2 percent staffing increase over 5 years to help reverse the trends.   According to the Commissioner, IRS would require 5,450 new full-time  collection staff.  IRS officials said that the PCA program proposal was  undertaken because it is unlikely that IRS will receive funding adequate to  handle the growing collection workload.", "Since current law requires IRS to collect tax debts, legislation has been  proposed to authorize IRS to use PCAs to collect simpler tax debts under  defined activities\u2014including locating taxpayers, requesting full payment of  the tax debt or offering taxpayers an installment agreement if full payment  cannot be made, and obtaining financial information from taxpayers.   Given the limited authorities proposed for PCAs, IRS would refer those  cases that are simplest to collect and have no need for IRS enforcement  action, including cases in which (1) taxpayers filed a tax return showing  taxes due but that have not been paid and (2) taxpayers made three or  more voluntary payments to satisfy an additional tax assessed by IRS but  have stopped the payments.", "In 1996, Congress directed IRS to test the use of PCAs, earmarking $13  million for that purpose. IRS canceled the pilot project in 1997, in part,  because it resulted in significantly lower amounts of collections and  contacted significantly fewer taxpayers than expected (about 14,000 of  153,000 taxpayers).  IRS reported that through January 1997, this program  accounted for about $3.1 million in collections and about $4.1 million in  expenses ($3.1 million in design, start-up, administrative expenses, and  about $1 million in PCA payments).  IRS also reported lost opportunity  costs of about $17 million because IRS collection staff shifted from  collecting taxes to helping with the pilot.", "The current proposal to use PCAs has some significant differences from the  1996 pilot test of PCAs.  First, PCAs in the current proposal will actually try  to resolve collection cases within certain guidelines.  In the 1996 test, PCAs  only contacted taxpayers to remind them of their outstanding tax debt and  suggest payment options.  Second, PCAs under the current proposal will be  paid a percentage of dollars they help collect from a revolving fund of all  PCA collections. In the 1996 test, PCAs were paid a fixed fee for such  actions as successfully locating and contacting taxpayers, even if payments  were not received. Third, IRS will electronically transmit cases and data  about the taxpayer and taxes owed to PCAs.  In 1996, IRS\u2019s computers were  not set up to electronically transmit the cases and data to PCAs.  For the  current proposal, IRS intends to develop the capability to make secure  transmissions to PCAs and protect confidentiality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify the critical success factors for contracting with PCAs for tax  debt collection, we used multiple sources.  We reviewed three of our  reports on leading practices in contracting and interviewed our staff that  review government contracting.  We also interviewed parties with  experience in contracting for government debt collection, including both  tax and non-tax debt, to identify any factors common to both debt types.  Specifically, we interviewed officials from  11 state revenue departments that, according to officials from the  Federation of Tax Administrators (FTA), represented a mix\u2014in  aspects such as amount of resources and PCA roles\u2014of experience in  contracting with PCAs for tax debt collection and provided examples of  program practices in such areas as case selection and use of  performance data; the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service and  Department of Education\u2014two federal agencies with large-scale, non- tax debt collection contracting; and  the three PCA firms that IRS selected as subject matter experts to assist  in drafting the provisions of a contract for PCA collection services.", "To help corroborate the factors that others identified, we interviewed  officials from the IRS office that is developing the proposed PCA program,  the IRS Office of Taxpayer Advocate, and the National Treasury Employees  Union, which represents IRS employees.", "To summarize and categorize the critical success factors identified, we  grouped together similar factors that were most frequently cited by the  officials with experience in government debt collection contracting.  We  first grouped factors associated with the start of a program and with a  maturing program into two broad time-oriented factors, including topics  we identified as implicit in the interviews and documents cited above.   Between these two time-oriented factors, we categorized three other  factors according to the broad topics that were most frequently cited.  To  validate our summarization and categorization, we asked for comments on  our draft list of critical success factors from those who we had consulted to  identify the factors as well as from officials at four additional PCA firms  that, according to interviewed officials from two state revenue  departments and the two federal agencies, had experience in government  debt collection.  In commenting on the draft list of factors, some officials  stressed certain factors more than others or elaborated on selected factors  or subfactors, but generally did not suggest factors beyond those  encompassed in our draft list.  We made changes based on their comments  where appropriate.", "To determine whether IRS has addressed the critical success factors in  developing the PCA contracting program and, if not, what is left to be done,  we interviewed IRS program officials.  We analyzed program documents,  including the draft PCA contract as outlined in IRS\u2019s Request for Quotes  (RFQ) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Form E-300  budgetary document that describes goals and plans for the program.  We  did not attempt to analyze how well or to what extent IRS addressed the  factors, or whether IRS made the right decisions on issues such as the  program goals or measures.", "To determine whether, if IRS receives authority to use PCAs, it will do a  study that will enable policymakers to judge whether contracting with  PCAs is the best use of federal funds to achieve IRS\u2019s collection objectives,  we interviewed IRS program officials.

IRS had estimated originally that the  PCA program would result in $9 billion in tax collections and produce  $7.2 billion in net revenue over 10 years.  The Department of the  Treasury estimated that $1.5 billion in net revenue would be produced  over 10 years.  IRS officials said the differences arise because each  estimate was done differently.  IRS acknowledged that its original  estimate may be too high and is reworking it in light of the Treasury  estimate.", "Under \u201cworkload,\u201d IRS officials said that they are aware of the  importance of selecting the right cases to send to PCAs for collection  and plan to use consumer credit history data on delinquent taxpayers to  identify those that would be more likely to pay if contacted.  IRS  officials said that the new case collection system will extend beyond  selecting cases for PCAs, and that the experience and knowledge IRS  will gain would contribute to IRS\u2019s broader modernization program for  using data to improve how IRS does collection work.  For example, IRS  officials said that, in the future, the case selection data might be used to  help determine which collection method\u2014such as sending notices,  using PCAs, or making in-person contact\u2014might be more effective in  attempting collection from a given taxpayer.", "Under \u201cevaluation,\u201d IRS officials said that they were aware that they had  not developed plans or dates for evaluating the program to assess how  well the PCA program achieves its results.  IRS officials said that  developing the evaluation was premature given the other work needed  to develop the program and lack of legislative authority.  IRS officials  said they intend to start developing the evaluation plan after they  receive this authority and to finish it before sending cases to PCAs.   Evaluation plans developed before program implementation increase  the likelihood that the necessary data and resources for proper  evaluation will be available when needed.", "Many of the factors involve the development of an information system.   Testing of information systems being developed for the PCA program is  an important task left to do.

Because IRS\u2019s  fiscal year 2004 budget was not passed until January 2004, IRS officials said  that, since September 2003, IRS slowed work on the PCA program.   These  officials said that, because of various budgetary procedures, the  appropriated funds were not released to the PCA program until March  2004.  However, the officials explained that IRS, intending to be fiscally  prudent, is delaying spending of the funds until passage of the legislation  appears to be more imminent.", "IRS officials stated that if legislation to authorize the program was not  passed during 2004, IRS eventually would suspend work on developing the  program.  These officials said that they have been balancing and managing  their existing funds and the timing of their work given that the authorizing  legislation might not pass.

During hearings, some witnesses raised similar concerns.", "IRS officials have said that IRS employees might be more effective than  PCAs in collecting delinquent taxes because IRS employees have greater  powers to enforce collections.  These powers (such as tax liens and wage  levies) may enable IRS employees to collect a higher portion of the taxes  from the same types of cases on which PCAs would work.", "IRS officials said that the proposal to use PCAs to collect simpler tax debts  was not based on a judgment that PCAs would necessarily be more  efficient or effective in collecting delinquent tax debt.  Rather the proposal  was based on a judgment that Congress was unlikely to approve a  substantial increase in IRS\u2019s budget to fund additional staff for the  collection function.  Officials believed that the growing inventory of tax  debts was not a good signal to taxpayers about the importance of  complying with their tax obligations. Given constraints in hiring staff, IRS  officials said that using PCAs was the only practical means available to  begin working on significantly more collection cases that otherwise would  not be worked on due to IRS staffing constraints.", "Although this policy judgment served as the rationale behind the PCA  proposal, in March 2004, IRS provided us with projections of revenues and  federal government costs for the proposed PCA program compared to  projections for an alternative approach under which IRS would hire  additional staff to work on the same volume for selected types of cases on  which the PCAs would work.  According to the analysis, PCAs would  generate $4.6 in revenue for every dollar in cost and IRS employees would  generate $4.1.", "We did not review the data and assumptions that underlie these revenue  and cost projections because the comparison that IRS constructed did not  address the relevant economic question for policymakers seeking to reduce  the backlog of uncollected taxes\u2014which is, what is the least costly  approach for reaching a certain revenue collection goal.

They expect to design the study after  authorization to use PCAs is enacted and before sending cases to PCAs.", "Although the study approach will evolve, officials said that they are  considering selecting a sample of the same type of simpler cases that will  be sent to PCAs and having such cases also sent to a group of IRS  telephone collection employees.  The results generated by these IRS  employees and by PCAs would be compared to see which option is more  effective; how effectiveness would be defined and measured would be  determined in designing the study.  This potential design would help answer  the relatively narrow\u2014but important\u2014question of whether and when  PCAs or IRS employees are a better choice for working on the specific  types of cases to be sent to PCAs.", "However, IRS officials told us that using IRS employees on these simpler  cases would be less productive than assigning them to work on a different  mix of collection cases.  These officials said that the simpler cases IRS  plans to assign to PCAs are generally not those cases that IRS would assign  to any additional collection employees, if hired.  IRS employees would  work on more complex cases that fit their skills and enforcement powers  and that have a higher priority due to such factors as the type and amount  of tax debt or length of the delinquency.", "Generally, federal officials are responsible for ensuring that they are  carrying out their responsibilities as efficiently and effectively as possible.   Various federal and IRS guidance reinforces this responsibility.  For  example, according to OMB Circular A-123 \u201cthe proper stewardship of  Federal resources is a fundamental responsibility of agency managers and  staff.  Federal employees must ensure that government resources are used  efficiently and effectively to achieve intended program results.\u201d  OMB  Circular A-94 states that agencies should have a plan for periodic, results- oriented studies of program effectiveness to, among other purposes, help  determine whether the anticipated benefits and costs have been realized  and program corrections are needed.  IRS guidance states that in selecting  among course of action options, IRS managers should determine which is  the most realistic and most cost effective.  Further, IRS has adopted a  critical job responsibility for its managers that specifies their responsibility  to achieve goals by leveraging available resources to maximize efficiency  and produce high-quality results.", "A study that focuses on the least costly approach to collecting a desired  amount of tax debts would be more in line with federal guidance than the  study that officials anticipate performing.  Such a study would more likely  answer the broader question of how IRS can be the most efficient and  effective in achieving its collection goals.  One alternative design might  entail comparing the results of using PCAs to the results from using the  same amount of funds to be paid to PCAs in an unconstrained manner that  IRS determines to be the most effective overall way of achieving its  collection goals.  Determining the most effective and efficient overall way  of achieving collection goals would undoubtedly require some judgment.   However, because IRS is developing a new case selection model for its own  use, after some experience is gained both with using PCAs and with new  IRS case selection processes, IRS should have better data to use in  determining the best way of achieving its collection goals.   If using PCAs as  expected under the current proposal meets IRS\u2019s collection goals at less  cost than the best unconstrained alternative, policymakers could be  comfortable with continuing their use.  If not, policy makers would have  information available to consider whether changes in the use of PCAs  would be appropriate.", "Regardless of the approach chosen, IRS would have to address several  challenges in designing a study to compare the use of PCAs and IRS  employees.  For instance, contracting for PCA assistance may provide  flexibility over hiring additional IRS staff.  To recruit, select, and train the  new staff, IRS could need many months or more and, if experienced staff  assists in training newly hired staff, the experienced staff would not be able  to handle normal workloads.  Further, if the collection workload were to  decrease, IRS may be able to reduce contract commitments more rapidly  than it could reassign and, if needed, retrain IRS staff.   To some extent, the  study would have to account for similar types of direct and opportunity  costs to hire, train, assign, and release employees of the PCA contractor.   Accounting for these and other factors raises challenges to the design of a  comparative study.", "Because IRS would not assign cases to PCAs for collection until 2006, it  will have time to take these challenges into account and to better ensure  that its study would be useful to policy makers.   Further, in designing the  study, IRS would have time to identify the data that would be needed for  the study and develop systems or processes for collecting the data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS has an inventory of over $100 billion dollars of tax debts that has some  potential for being collected.  In recent years, IRS has deferred collection  actions on billions of dollars of debt because it lacked collection staff to do  the work.  The growth in the backlog of unpaid taxes poses a risk to our  voluntary tax system, particularly as IRS has fallen further behind in  pursuing existing as well as new tax debt cases.  We have placed the  collection of unpaid taxes on our high-risk list since 1990 due to the  potential revenue losses and the threat to voluntary compliance with our  tax laws.", "Accordingly, we believe that effective steps need to be taken to improve the  collection of these unpaid taxes.  Because we did not analyze available  options in this review, we are not taking a position on whether the use of  PCAs is a preferable option.  However, doing nothing more than has been  done recently is not preferable.  The compliance signals sent to taxpayers  from the backlog of delinquent tax debts are not appropriate.  When the  majority of taxpayers receiving phone calls from IRS are those who  respond to written IRS notices, taxpayers and practitioners may conclude  that failing to respond to IRS is an effective tactic for avoiding tax  responsibilities.", "If Congress does authorize PCA use, IRS\u2019s planning and preparations to  address the critical success factors for PCA contracting provide greater  assurance that the PCA program is heading in the right direction to meet its  goals and achieve desired results.

Further, given the lack of experience in using PCAs  to collect tax debts, key assumptions are untested.  Accordingly, if  Congress authorizes the use of PCAs, Congress and IRS would benefit from  a study that uses the experience gained with PCAs and by IRS itself in using  new case selection processes to better determine whether and how the use  of PCAs fits into an overall collection strategy that is designed to most  effectively and efficiently collect delinquent taxes.

He said that the  detailed design for evaluating the PCA program will include a study to  ensure that IRS is making the most effective and cost efficient use of total  resources available.", "We are also sending copies to the Secretary of the Treasury, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Director, Office of Management and  Budget, and other interested parties.
