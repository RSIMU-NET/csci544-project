To prevent a repeat of  past mistakes, the Congress legislated explicit controls over IRS systems  modernization spending. Specifically, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  fiscal year 1998 and 1999 appropriations acts limit the obligation of  modernization funds until IRS submits to the Congress for approval an  expenditure plan\u2014which IRS commonly refers to as a spending plan\u2014that  (1) implements the IRS Modernization Blueprint, (2) meets Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) investment guidelines for information  systems, (3) is reviewed and approved by IRS\u2019 Investment Review Board,  OMB, and Treasury\u2019s IRS Management Board and is reviewed by GAO,  (4) meets the requirements of IRS\u2019 system life cycle management program,  and (5) complies with acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines, and  systems acquisition management practices of the federal government.  These legislative conditions are consistent with systems modernization  recommendations that we made to IRS in 1995. Currently, however, our  recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.", "In March 2000, IRS submitted its second spending plan, requesting  $176.3 million from its systems modernization appropriations account  referred to as the Information Technology Investments Account (ITIA). In  April 2000, IRS\u2019 Senate and House appropriations subcommittees approved  $148.4 million of that request and, on the basis of our findings on IRS\u2019  management of the program, specified several conditions for IRS to satisfy.  Recognizing that the $148.4 million would be obligated before another  spending plan was submitted, IRS submitted in late August 2000 what it  called an interim spending plan for $32.8 million as a stopgap funding  measure.", "As agreed, our objectives were to (1) determine whether IRS satisfied the  conditions that the subcommittees specified in their April 2000 letters  approving the interim plan and (2) provide any other observations relating  to the agency\u2019s management of the program.", "The four conditions specified by the subcommittees were: adhere to the March 2000 spending plan as approved and funded or seek  approval to do otherwise; meet the commitments made in the March 2000 spending plan; address modernization management weaknesses and establish the  capability to build systems by hiring an individual to lead the Business Systems Modernization  Office (BSMO), developing mature software acquisition capabilities, clearly defining and applying IRS and contractor roles and creating performance-based task orders, and fully implementing IRS\u2019 life cycle management methodology\u2014 Enterprise Life Cycle (ELC)\u2014and completing and using its enterprise  architecture\u2014Blueprint 2000\u2014to define, direct, and control future  modernization activities; and establish more reliable cost and schedule estimates for the initiatives  outlined in the March 2000 plan.", "On September 21, 2000, we briefed senior IRS officials, including the Chief  Information Officer and the Business Systems Modernization Executive, on  the results of our work. They stated that our briefing was fair, objective,  and helpful. They also provided clarifying points that were incorporated  into the briefing as appropriate. On September 22, 2000, we briefed the  subcommittees\u2019 offices. As requested by your offices, this report transmits  and summarizes the briefing. The briefing slides are in appendix I.", "We performed our work at IRS offices in Washington, D.C., from August  through mid-September 2000, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. See appendix II for details on our scope  and methodology. IRS provided us with written comments on a draft of this  report. Their comments are discussed in the \u201cAgency Comments\u201d section  of this report and reprinted in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since May 1999, IRS has submitted two spending plans and two interim,  stopgap plans. On June 15, 1999, we reported on IRS\u2019 first spending plan,  stating that the $35 million requested satisfied the legislative conditions for  the use of ITIA funds and was consistent with our open recommendations.  We also said that it was an appropriate first step but that the key to success  would be effective implementation of the plan. We recommended that  future plans specify progress against prior plan commitments and that the  next plan clarify the roles and responsibilities of IRS, its prime systems  integration services contractor (PRIME) for modernization, and other  modernization support contractors.", "Because IRS was unable to submit its second plan on time, it submitted in  December 1999 a stopgap request for $33 million and additional time as an  interim measure. We reviewed the request and raised concerns about  projects that were scheduled to begin detailed design and software  development before, among other things, the enterprise architecture was  completed and the ELC was defined and implemented. Later that  December, the appropriations subcommittees approved IRS\u2019 $33 million  funding measure but, in discussions and correspondence, directed IRS to  (1) expedite completion of the architecture and implementation of the ELC  and (2) explain in future expenditure plans how it plans to manage the risk  of performing detailed design or development work if the architecture is  not completed or the ELC is not implemented. Subsequently, IRS  reassessed its modernization program plans and decided to restructure the  program by scaling back its systems development efforts until it addressed  our concerns and put in place the requisite modernization management  capability.", "On March 7, 2000, IRS submitted to the appropriations subcommittees its  second spending plan, which reflected these restructuring decisions and  sought to obligate about $176 million from ITIA. On March 31, 2000, we  briefed the subcommittee and subsequently reported that (1) the plan  satisfied the legislative conditions and was generally consistent with  recommendations contained in our earlier reports and (2) IRS met few of  the commitments in its first spending plan, even though it later received an  additional $33 million and nearly 5 months additional time to do so. We  stated that the key to success would be whether IRS effectively  implemented the second plan. We also stated that until IRS implemented  the plan, it would continue to lack key modernization and technical  controls.", "In April 2000, the appropriations subcommittees approved IRS\u2019 plan for  $148.4 million of the funds requested and underscored the need for IRS to  pursue its restructuring plans by, among other things, directing IRS to  establish modernization management capabilities and controls\u2014including  completion and implementation of the blueprint and systems life cycle  methodology\u2014before it began building systems.", "Recognizing that it would fully obligate the $148.4 million before it was  ready to submit another spending plan, on August 25, 2000, IRS submitted  its second interim plan. This interim plan requested $32.8 million to carry  the modernization program into early fiscal year 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Satisfied Some, But Not All, of the Subcommittees\u2019 Conditions", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not fully satisfy all of the conditions that its appropriations  subcommittees established in their April 2000 letters releasing  modernization investment account funding.

IRS\u2019 position is  that variances from the approved funding levels were small and inevitable  given the scale and complexity of the program and that because IRS is  closely managing the variances, they do not necessitate the subcommittees\u2019  actions.", "In sum, IRS varied from the approved spending levels for twelve program  projects and initiatives. These variances ranged in amount from  approximately $44,000 to $9,000,000. In our view, such variances are to be  expected given the projects\u2019 and initiatives\u2019 complexity and early stage in  the life cycle and the inherent uncertainty associated with  software/systems cost estimating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition 2: Meet the Commitments Made in the March 7, 2000, Spending Plan", "paragraphs": ["IRS did not meet its cost and schedule commitments on most projects and  initiatives in its March 7, 2000, spending plan. For example, Milestone III  for the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) project slipped by 3  months, and the estimated cost for meeting Milestone III rose by about  $1.4 million (9.1 percent). Also, Milestone III for the STIR project slipped 2  months, and its cost increased about $1.4 million (17.0 percent).", "In our view, these cost and schedule variances are to be expected because,  as we previously reported, the milestone commitments for most of the  initiatives in the March 2000 plan were not based on detailed work  breakdown structures and schedules. Rather, they were merely targets that  IRS had represented in its plan as achievable commitments. As a result,  these variances are not good measures of progress.", "Most modernization initiatives, including key projects, have made  important progress since March 2000. For example, the CADE and  e-Services projects each completed the system planning and definition  phase of the ELC, including a preliminary business case showing a positive  return on investment, and both projects have met ELC criteria for  beginning preliminary design work.", "However, one project, CAP, has been approved to begin the detailed design  and development phase (i.e., the system is being built) without sufficient  definition and without a compelling business case to justify treating it as a  near-term investment priority. Specifically, the CAP business case does not show a positive return on investment; the $150 million estimated total project cost does not include the cost to  define and build interfaces with projects that are yet to be defined (i.e.,  Integrated Financial Systems\u2019 standard general ledger, CADE, and  STIR);", "CAP business requirements are not yet sufficiently defined to verify", "CAP was approved to begin the development phase with two important  conditions that could affect the system\u2019s baseline requirements and  functions (and thus cost); and", "CAP integration with other modernization projects is unclear because  CAP is not included in the integrated master schedule and monthly  program management reviews.", "Another project, STIR, was granted approval to begin the preliminary  design phase without a risk-based approach to defining and economically  justifying its requirements (i.e. preliminary security risk assessment,  preliminary security certification package, and preliminary business case).  Such an approach, as discussed in our November 1999 guide on security  risk assessment practices of leading organizations, is a federal  requirement and a key element of successful organizations\u2019 security risk  assessment programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition 3: Address Modernization Management Weaknesses and Establish the Capability to Build Systems", "paragraphs": ["IRS has fully addressed two of the five modernization management  weaknesses cited by the subcommittees. Namely, it has hired a BSMO  executive, and it reports that 20 of its 22 task orders issued since June 2000  are performance based. We reviewed 3 key task orders and found that they  reflected the tenets of performance-based contracting.", "IRS is also making progress in addressing other modernization  management weaknesses. For example, since March 2000, as part of the  ELC, it has defined processes, roles, responsibilities, etc. for implementing  selected Level 2 key process areas of the Software Engineering Institute  (SEI) Software Acquisition Capability Maturity Model  . IRS plans to train  staff and have all projects following these by the November 2000-to- January 2001 timeframe. In September 2001, IRS plans to conduct an  evaluation (via an independent assessor) to ensure compliance with SEI\u2019s  Level 2 requirements. In addition, IRS has taken other steps to increase its  acquisition discipline, such as conducting monthly program management  reviews with the modernization contractor and establishing an integrated  master schedule to track the projects\u2019 schedules and interdependencies.", "In July 2000, IRS defined and baselined most parts of the ELC. Our review  of selected projects (CAP, CADE, and STIR) indicates that the ELC is  generally being followed. Further, IRS has defined IT investment  management controls and is in the process of incorporating them into the  ELC.", "The initial release of IRS\u2019 enterprise architecture was being drafted and  was not yet available for our review, however, some parts of the ELC are  still being developed and finalized (e.g., program control policies and  procedures, 75 to 80 change requests, legacy system impact supplement,  and enterprise architecture management supplement). While IRS did not  satisfy the September 30, 2000, commitments it made in the March 2000  plan for issuing the enterprise architecture and fully implementing the ELC,  it is making important progress and plans to complete both between  November 2000 and January 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Condition 4: Establish More Reliable Cost and Schedule Estimates for the Initiatives Outlined in the March 2000 Plan", "paragraphs": ["IRS has revised and validated its March 2000 spending plan cost and  schedule estimates to increase their reliability. According to IRS, it tasked  the contractor to develop, for each initiative, a detailed work breakdown  schedule of the tasks, deliverables, staff, and time needed to complete the  initiatives in accordance with the ELC. With the resulting staffing and time  requirements, the contractor applied its cost rates to determine cost and  schedule estimates and then submitted the estimates to IRS in task order  proposals. IRS validated these costs during the task order \u201cdefinitization\u201d  process by, among other things, comparing them to historical and current  contractor rates charged to IRS and other federal agencies (e.g., General  Services Administration). IRS then negotiated rates that could not be  validated.

The conditions specified by the subcommittees were: adhere to the March 7, 2000, spending plan as approved and funded or  seek approval to do otherwise; meet the commitments made in the March 7, 2000, spending plan; address modernization management weaknesses and establish the  capability to build systems by hiring a person to lead the business systems modernization office developing mature software acquisition capabilities, clearly defining and applying IRS and contractor roles and creating performance-based task orders, and fully implementing IRS\u2019 system life cycle management  methodology\u2014the Enterprise Life Cycle\u2014and completing and using  its enterprise architecture\u2014Blueprint 2000\u2014to define, direct, and  control future modernization activities; and establishing more reliable cost and schedule estimates for the initiatives  in the March 7, 2000, plan.", "To accomplish our objectives we took several steps. To understand the  scope and content of each, we reviewed IRS\u2019 August 2000 interim ITIA  funding request and other IRS documentation associated with the  initiatives identified in the request. Then, to identify variances, we analyzed  the interim request in relation to the conditions specified in the Senate and  House responses to the March 7, 2000, spending plan. We compared  progress on selected program and project initiatives-as reported in the  request and other modernization documentation and supplemented by  interviews of IRS and contractor officials-against deliverables promised  and commitments made in the March 7, 2000, spending plan. The program  initiatives we compared were Blueprint 2000 and the ELC and the project  initiatives were CAP, CADE, and STIR. We selected (1) the Blueprint 2000  and ELC program initiatives because both are intended to address open  GAO recommendations and (2) the CAP, CADE, and STIR project initiatives  because our reviews of these projects were already under way for the  subcommittees. In addition, we analyzed relevant documentation  concerning the operational status of the Business System Modernization  Office (BSMO), such as plans, status reports, policies and procedures, and  descriptions of IRS and contractor roles and responsibilities. We also  analyzed progress in definitizing task orders and making them performance  based. To do this, we selected three task orders and compared them to  performance-based contracting criteria. The task orders selected were for  CADE, STIR, and the PRIME\u2019s program management office.

We collaborated with the  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) to avoid  duplication of effort in reviewing program and project initiatives and  incorporated the TIGTA results in this briefing where appropriate.
