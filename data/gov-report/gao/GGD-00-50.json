In December 1996, the Advisory Commission to Study the CPI, which was appointed by the Senate Finance Committee, issued a report estimating that the CPI overstates changes in the cost of living by 1.1 percentage points annually. (The Advisory Commission is commonly referred to as \u201cthe Boskin Commission,\u201d after its chairman Michael J. Boskin.) The Commission\u2019s report also included the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s estimate that such an overstatement\u2014that is, bias\u2014 in the CPI would cause a $1.07 trillion rise in the national debt by the year 2008.", "This report responds to your request that we obtain an update from the five former Boskin Commission members of the Commission\u2019s estimate of the CPI bias.

BLS calculates the CPI each month based on a complex methodology that uses prices collected on a wide range of goods and services from outlets throughout urban areas in the United States. The CPI significantly affects the U.S. budget because automatic cost-of-living adjustments in federal income tax brackets, federal retirees\u2019 pensions, and various federal programs, such as Social Security and food stamps, are linked to changes in the CPI.", "Although the CPI is used to make cost-of-living adjustments, it is not, technically, a cost-of-living index. A true cost-of-living index would measure the change in the cost of obtaining a fixed level of economic well- being or utility\u2014something that is not clearly defined. What the CPI measures is clearly defined; it measures the change in prices of a market basket of goods and services purchased directly by urban consumers. These goods and services fall into eight major groups, including food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. (See app. I for more background information on the CPI.)", "In June 1995, out of concern that the CPI may have been inaccurately measuring cost-of-living increases, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee created the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index. The Commission was tasked with determining how effectively the CPI measured the cost of living and inflation and recommending ways to improve the CPI. Appointed to the Commission were five economists, including Michael J. Boskin, Ellen R. Dulberger, Robert J. Gordon, Zvi Griliches, and Dale Jorgenson.", "In December 1996, the Boskin Commission issued its final report, which took the position that different sources of bias in the CPI methodology were causing the CPI to overestimate cost-of-living increases by approximately 1.1 percentage points per year. An underlying reason for the bias, according to the Commission, was that the CPI was based on prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services of fixed quantities from a fixed set of outlets. This resulted in the CPI not taking into account how consumers substitute one item or outlet for another, that is, respond to price increases and opportunities to pay less for goods and services by changing what they purchase and where they shop.", "In addition, the Commission reported that the CPI was biased because BLS did not promptly include new products in the CPI and, therefore, did not measure price changes in many new products. According to the Commission, because the price of a product often decreases after its introduction in the marketplace, delays in including new products in the CPI prevent the CPI from measuring these price decreases. Further, the Commission said that the CPI often erroneously attributed price increases to inflation instead of to quality improvements\u2014advances in products and services that have affected peoples\u2019 lives. For example, the Commission said that the CPI was biased because it did not estimate how much of the increase in medical care costs was due to more successful surgeries and more effective drugs or the replacement of surgery with drugs. Table 1 shows the sources and estimated amounts of bias reported by the Boskin Commission.", "The Commission gave 1.1 percentage points annually as the point estimate of the bias in the CPI and reported that the plausible range for the bias was from 0.8 to 1.6 percentage points annually. The implication of the Commission\u2019s estimate is that the cost of living may have been increasing less than the CPI, decreasing when the CPI showed little or no increase, or decreasing more than the CPI when it showed a decrease.", "Although the Boskin Commission\u2019s estimate of bias in the CPI was controversial, many economists agreed that the CPI probably overstated the level of inflation. However, many believed that there was insufficient data to make an estimate of bias. BLS agreed with the Commission\u2019s estimate of upper level substitution bias but stated that the estimates for lower level substitution and new outlets bias may be too high.  BLS expressed skepticism about the Commission\u2019s estimate of new products/quality change bias and noted that the evidence the Commission used for this estimate was sparse and that the Commission did not have a well-defined methodology for deriving its estimate. In response, the members of the Commission said that future research might find that some parts of the Commission\u2019s estimate were too high, but it might also find that other parts were too low."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify all the methodological changes made to the CPI since December 1996 when the Boskin Commission issued its final report, we obtained a list of methodological changes from BLS in June 1999.

In addition, BLS provided brief descriptions of the methodological changes; reference materials; and, where available, an estimate of the effect of the changes on the CPI and/or subindexes of the CPI.", "To obtain the opinions of the five former Boskin Commission members on how much of the bias in the CPI that the Commission estimated in its December 1996 report remains after recent methodological changes to the CPI, we sent the Commission members a questionnaire. The questionnaire included information provided by BLS on the 10 methodological changes made since December 1996 or announced to take effect in the future.  It asked for estimates of the extent to which the Commission\u2019s estimate of bias could be reduced or increased as a result of each methodological change. In addition, for each methodological change that the former Commission members believed may have reduced or increased the bias, the questionnaire asked which source of bias may have been affected. (See app. II for a copy of the questionnaire sent to the Commission members.) We also provided the former Commission members copies of all the reference material provided by BLS.", "Our questionnaire did not ask the former Commission members about methodological changes that took effect for the CPI calculation before December 1996 because (1) the Commission issued its final report in December 1996 and (2) its final report took into account methodological changes that had been made to the CPI since the Commission\u2019s September 1995 Interim Report.", "Four former members of the Boskin Commission responded to our questionnaire.

Because our objective was to obtain the expert opinion of the former members of the Boskin Commission, we did not attempt to validate their responses or estimates.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from June 1999 through December 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodological Changes to CPI Since Boskin Commission Report", "paragraphs": ["Between December 1996, when the Boskin Commission issued its final report, and June 1999, when we began this review,  BLS had made seven methodological changes that affected the calculation of the CPI.  In addition, as of June 1999, BLS had announced three methodological changes that had not yet been implemented.", "In addition to the seven completed and three planned methodological changes, BLS implemented a major revision of the CPI in January 1998. BLS implements major revisions roughly every 10 years to keep the CPI current and accurate. In the 1998 major revision, as with major revisions in the past, a new market basket of goods and services was introduced into the CPI. The 1998 major revision made other changes, including changes in geographic areas from which prices are collected. Since BLS considers major revisions to be part of the established CPI methodology, it did not include the 1998 major revision in its list of methodological changes.", "The seven methodological changes already completed as of June 1999 are the following:", "Changes in the Methods for Pricing of Hospital Services (hospital services pricing): In January 1997, BLS redefined its categories \u2013 called \u201citem strata\u201d \u2014 of goods and services related to hospital services for which it collects information on price changes. For example, BLS eliminated the item strata for hospital rooms and created a new item strata for hospital services. According to BLS, it did this in order to gather data on price changes for treatments, even if aspects of the treatments had changed. For example, BLS wanted to be able to compare the price of a treatment, even if the treatment changed from being given on an inpatient basis to an outpatient basis. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI.", "Adjustment of Personal Computer Prices (personal computer pricing): In January 1998, BLS implemented a new method for measuring changes in personal computer prices. The new method decomposes the price of personal computers into implicit prices for each important feature and component. According to BLS, the new method enables BLS to adjust for quality improvements in new models when it measures price increases. BLS did not estimate the annual effect of this change on the overall CPI, but it estimated that the change lowered the rate of growth in the personal computer index by approximately 6.5 percent in 1998.", "Accounting for Consumer Substitution within CPI Categories (implementation of the geometric mean estimator): In January 1999, BLS began using a new formula called the geometric mean estimator to combine the prices collected on items each month into indexes for the various item strata. (For example, apples and chicken each have their own item stratum, and BLS calculates indexes for price changes in the item strata.) The geometric mean estimator replaced a formula called the arithmetic mean estimator in most item strata. The geometric mean estimator takes into account that from one period to the next consumers may change the quantity that they purchase of a particular item within an item stratum because of a change in the relative price of the item.", "The item strata for which the geometric mean estimator is being used represent approximately 61 percent of the consumer spending covered by the CPI. They include all item strata in the \u201cfood and beverages,\u201d \u201capparel,\u201d and \u201cother goods and services\u201d major groups. According to BLS, the geometric mean is not being used for some item strata in the other major groups because consumers are less likely to respond to price increases in those item strata by making item substitutions and thereby changing the quantity that they purchase. Therefore, BLS is not using the geometric mean estimator in certain item strata, such as rent of primary residence, electricity, cable television, physicians\u2019 services, and eyeglasses and eye care.", "BLS estimated that implementation of the geometric mean estimator will reduce the rate of growth of the CPI by approximately 0.2 percentage point per year.", "Adjustment of Television Prices (television pricing): In January 1999, BLS implemented a new method for measuring changes in television prices. The new method decomposes the price of televisions into implicit prices for each important feature and component. According to BLS, the new method enables BLS to adjust for quality improvements in new models when it measures price increases. BLS did not estimate the annual effect of this change on the overall CPI, but it estimated that the change would have lowered the rate of growth in the television index by approximately 0.1 percent per year during the period August 1993 to August 1997.", "Changes to the Treatment of Utility Refunds: In January 1999, BLS began disregarding earlier periods\u2019 utility refunds that appear in a consumer\u2019s current bill. Under the previous method for gathering prices for utilities, the refund amount was subtracted from the consumer\u2019s current bill, and the price used in the CPI calculation could have been as low as zero. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI. However, according to BLS, the change will not affect the long-run rate of growth of the CPI.", "Treating Mandated Pollution Control Measures as Price Increases: In January 1999, BLS began treating price increases due to legislatively mandated modifications to goods and services for pollution control purposes as price increases. Before this change, such price increases were regarded as a change in quality and were excluded from the CPI. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI.", "However, according to BLS, any effect will be an increase in the CPI, and the extent of the increase will depend on what future requirements for pollution controls are implemented.", "Revision of the Housing Estimation System: In January 1999, BLS implemented a new housing sample of rental units and an estimation method for homeowners\u2019 housing costs, which uses only data on rental units. Before this change, the housing sample included owner-occupied and rental units, and homeowners\u2019 housing costs were estimated from the costs experienced by renters whose units were comparable to owner- occupied units in the housing sample. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI.", "The three planned methodological changes that were not implemented for the CPI calculation as of June 1999 are the following:", "Change from Area- to Item-Based Rotation Procedures (sample rotation procedures): BLS has changed the process for updating the samples of outlets where it selects items for price collection. The new samples are selected according to expenditure category, such as televisions and soups. The old process updated outlet and item samples by geographic area. In part because of the large number of outlets and items covered, the process of sample rotation takes several years to complete.  According to BLS, the first outlets and items selected under the new sample rotation procedures were used in the CPI for October 1999.", "According to BLS, this change will enable it to introduce new goods into the CPI in a more timely fashion. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI.", "Reduction of the Average Age of Expenditure Weights (age of expenditure weights): According to BLS, it has begun work to enable the future implementation of a methodological change that will result in more timely information being used when the component of the CPI calculation referred to as \u201cexpenditure weights\u201d is updated (the frequency of the updates is the subject of the methodological change discussed below). Expenditure weights are used to determine the extent to which price changes on certain goods will affect the overall CPI. Expenditure weights represent, in essence, the proportion of the typical consumer\u2019s expenditures that are spent on an item or category of goods. Therefore, if ground beef had an expenditure weight of one-third of 1 percent, that would mean that according to CPI data, one-third of 1 percent of the typical consumer\u2019s expenditures are made for ground beef.", "BLS is increasing the size of the sample of consumers surveyed to collect the data used to develop expenditure weights.  According to BLS, this methodological change, along with system enhancements, will reduce the average age of the data for developing expenditure weights from 3-\u00bd years to 2 years beginning with the CPI for January 2002. BLS did not provide an estimate of the annual effect of this change on the CPI.", "Increased Frequency of Expenditure Weights Updates (expenditure weights updates): Beginning with the release of the CPI for January 2002, BLS plans to update expenditure weights every 2 years.

Further, Dr. Boskin and Dr. Dulberger stated that they could not estimate how much reduction in bias could be attributed to some of the methodological changes. Dr. Boskin said that he did not provide a specific estimate when methodological changes likely reduced the bias by less than 0.1 percentage point. In part, to compensate for the reductions they could not provide specific estimates for, Dr. Boskin\u2019s and Dr. Dulberger\u2019s point estimates for the remaining bias in the CPI show a greater amount of bias reduction than the total of the specific estimates they made for individual methodological changes.", "Dr. Boskin said that when the Boskin Commission developed its estimate of bias, it took into account the changes BLS had announced it was planning to make.

Payments to millions of railroad, military, and federal civilian retirees and survivors are also affected by changes in the CPI. The CPI is also used to adjust key elements of the individual income tax to limit the extent to which individuals must pay higher taxes solely because of inflation. For example, the amount allowed for personal exemption, the amount of the standard deduction, and tax brackets are adjusted annually according to changes in the CPI.", "Deflator of selected economic statistical data series: The CPI is used to adjust selected economic statistical series for price changes and to translate these series into inflation-free dollars. Examples of data series that are adjusted by the CPI include retail sales, hourly and weekly earnings, and components of the National Income and Product Accounts.", "The CPI was initiated during World War I, when rapid increases in the prices of goods and services, particularly in shipbuilding centers where workers were demanding wage adjustments, made such an index essential for calculating cost-of-living adjustments. In 1921, BLS began regular publication of an index representing the expenditures of urban wage and clerical workers, which was then called the Cost-of-Living Index. The name of the index was changed to the CPI following controversy during World War II over the index\u2019s validity as a measure of the cost of living. According to BLS, the CPI has always been a measure of the changes in prices for goods and services purchased for family living.", "Major revisions have been made to the CPI about once each decade to update the market basket, with the most recent revision occurring in January 1998.

In the 1978 major revision, BLS began publication of a new index for all urban consumers\u2014the CPI-U. According to BLS, the CPI-U, which represents the expenditures of about 87 percent of the population, takes into account the buying patterns of professional employees, part-time workers, the self-employed, the unemployed, and retired people as well as those previously covered in the CPI.

For example, the 1998 CPI revision was based on CEX data collected from 1993 through 1995, from about 36,000 individuals and families.

For example, if ground beef were assigned a weight representing about one-third of 1 percent of the expenditures of the typical urban consumer; and if beef steaks, such as sirloin and rib steaks, were assigned a smaller weight representing about one-tenth of 1 percent, then the price changes of ground beef would have about 3 times as much impact on the overall CPI as similar price changes for beef steaks.", "Weights derived from consumers\u2019 expenditures, as reported in the CEX, are assigned to the 211 item strata. To compute the weights, BLS first totals the amount spent on an item stratum, such as white bread, during the base weighting period by CEX respondents, whom BLS refers to as consumer units. BLS then divides that total by the number of consumer units, which results in an average expenditure per unit. Next, the average expenditures per unit are weighted with data from the Decennial Census to represent the U.S. urban population. To do so, the average expenditures per unit are multiplied by certain factors to represent the geographic dispersion of the urban population. Finally, these nationwide urban expenditures on the market basket items are totaled into an aggregate amount. The 211 expenditure weights are the percentages of this aggregate amount that are spent on each of the 211 item strata (e.g., white bread).", "Expenditure weights remain fixed until the next major revision of the CPI and serve as a benchmark from which price comparisons are calculated.
