These factors can be found at both the strategic and the transactional levels and should be used together as a comprehensive, but tailored approach to managing service acquisition outcomes. At the strategic level, key success factors include (1) strong leadership that defines a corporate vision and normative goals; (2) sustained, results-oriented communication and metrics; (3) defined responsibilities and associated support structures; and (4) increased knowledge and focus on spending and data trends. The strategic level also sets the context for the transactional level, where the focus is on making sound decisions on individual transactions. Success factors at this level include having (1) valid and well-defined requirements; (2) properly structured business arrangements; and (3) proactively managed outcomes. DOD's current approach to managing service acquisition has tended to be reactive and has not fully addressed the key factors for success at either the strategic or transactional level. At the strategic level, DOD has yet to set the direction or vision for what it needs, determine how to go about meeting those needs, capture the knowledge to enable more informed decisions, or assess the resources it has to ensure departmentwide goals and objectives are achieved. For example, despite implementing a review structure aimed at increasing insight into service transactions, DOD is not able to determine which or how many transactions have actually been reviewed. The military departments, while having some increased visibility, have only reviewed proposed acquisitions accounting for less than 3 percent of dollars obligated for services in fiscal year 2005 and are in a poor position to regularly identify opportunities to leverage buying power or otherwise change existing practices. Actions at the transactional level continue to focus primarily on awarding contracts and do not always ensure that user needs are translated into well-defined requirements or that post-contract award activities result in expected performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2005, the Department of Defense (DOD) obligated more than  $141 billion on service contracts, a 72-percent increase since fiscal year  1996. DOD is increasingly relying on the private sector to provide a wide  range of services, including consulting and administrative support,  information technology services, and weapon system and base operations  support. As the largest buyer of services in the federal government, and  operating in an environment in which the nation\u2019s large and growing  structural deficit will require difficult resource decisions, DOD must  maximize its return on investment and provide the warfighter with needed  capabilities at the best value for the taxpayer.", "Our work and that of others has highlighted examples of long-standing  concerns in planning, executing, and overseeing service acquisition. For  example, GAO has identified DOD contract management to be at high risk  of vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement for more  than a decade. In our 2005 high-risk report update, we noted that with  regard to service acquisition, DOD had not yet fully implemented a  strategic approach to buying services; did not have a comprehensive plan  to ensure it had the right skills and capabilities in its acquisition  workforce; and did not always make sound use of the tools, such as  performance-based service contracting, to acquire the services it needed.", "To ensure that DOD acquires services by means that are in the best  interest of the government and managed in compliance with applicable  statutory requirements, sections 801 and 802 of the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 required DOD to establish a service  acquisition management approach, including developing a structure for  reviewing individual service transactions based on dollar thresholds and  other criteria. Further, in January 2006, additional requirements were  established pertaining to DOD\u2019s service contracting management structure  and oversight processes. This report assesses DOD\u2019s overall approach to  managing service acquisition. Specifically, we (1) identified the key factors  necessary for DOD to emphasize to improve its management of services  and (2) assessed the extent to which DOD\u2019s approach, including its current  management structure, exhibited these factors.", "To perform our review, we made extensive use of our prior work in this  and other related areas, including our January 2002 report that identified  how leading commercial companies took a strategic approach to acquiring  services. For the transactional level, we used our prior work and that of  others on issues related to individual service contract transactions and  held detailed discussions with relevant contracting experts to confirm and  validate key factors. In total, the results of these efforts proffer a model to  improve results in service acquisition management. To assess the extent to  which DOD\u2019s current approach exhibited these characteristics, we  collected and reviewed relevant DOD guidance and policies, including  those that established its current management structure and review  processes. We interviewed officials responsible for implementing the  management structure in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, as well as  each of the cognizant offices within the military departments. We also  obtained information on the types of activities and reviews conducted by  these offices. We visited 20 commands and buying activities to understand  the processes by which these organizations acquire services. We reviewed  various contract files and process documentation for selected service  acquisitions and discussed challenges faced in acquiring services and  efforts to improve service acquisition with policy and contracting  personnel at each of these locations. See appendix I for additional details  on scope and methodology. We conducted our review from August 2005 to  September 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, DOD has increasingly relied on private sector  contractors to provide a range of services, including management and  information technology support. For example, DOD\u2019s obligations on  service contracts rose from $82.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $141.2 billion  in fiscal year 2005 (see table 1). DOD committed 20 percent of its total  service obligations in fiscal year 2005 for professional, administrative, and  management support contracts. Overall, according to DOD, the amount  obligated on service contracts exceeded the amount the department spent  on supplies and equipment, including major weapon systems.", "The growth in service acquisition spending results, in part, from recent  trends and changes within DOD\u2019s acquisition environment, including the  increased use of contracted services. For example, while spending on  services has increased, DOD\u2019s civilian workforce shrank by about   38 percent between fiscal years 1989 and 2002. DOD performed this  downsizing without proactively shaping the civilian workforce to ensure  that it had the specific skills and competencies needed to accomplish  future DOD missions. In June 2006, DOD issued a human capital strategy  that acknowledged that DOD\u2019s civilian workforce is not balanced by age or  experience. DOD further noted that a proposed reduction of an additional  55,000 personnel through fiscal year 2007, continuing increases in the  number of retirement age employees, and the loss of experienced  personnel and institutional knowledge could make it difficult to mentor its  developing workforce. DOD\u2019s strategy identified a number of steps  planned over the next 2 years to more fully develop a long-term approach  to managing its acquisition workforce.", "The increased use of service contracts is also partly attributable to DOD  acquiring capabilities through different acquisition approaches, as well as  needing to meet new requirements and demands. For example, DOD  historically bought space launch vehicles, such as the Delta and Titan  rockets as products. Now, under the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle  program, the Air Force purchases launch services using contractor-owned  launch vehicles. Similarly, after the terrorist attacks on September 11,  2001, increased security requirements and the deployment of active duty  and reserve personnel resulted in DOD having fewer military personnel to  protect domestic installations. Consequently, the U.S. Army awarded  contracts worth nearly $733 million to acquire contract guards at   57 installations.", "DOD has traditionally approached the acquisition of services differently  than the acquisition of products. DOD and military department officials we  interviewed noted that DOD generally views service acquisition as less  risky than the acquisition of weapon systems, in part because many  services are not tied directly to mission accomplishment and tend to be  composed of far more numerous and lower dollar value contracts. DOD  has long focused its attention, policies, and procedures on managing major  weapon systems and typically does so using the cost of the weapon system  as a proxy for risk. For example, DOD classifies its acquisition programs,  including research and development efforts related to weapon systems  and major automated information systems, in categories based upon  estimated dollar value or designation as a special interest. The largest  programs generally fall under the responsibility of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics), while less complex and  risky programs are overseen by the service or component acquisition  executive. Overall, more than 25 percent of DOD\u2019s annual budget is  managed under this framework. For example, as of December 2005, DOD  managed 85 major defense acquisition programs currently estimated to  cost about $1.6 trillion combined over their program life.", "Conversely, we previously reported that DOD\u2019s approach to buying  services is largely fragmented and uncoordinated, as responsibility for  acquiring services is spread among individual military commands, weapon  system program offices, or functional units on military bases, with little  visibility or control at the DOD or military department level. For example,  we noted that    DOD\u2019s information systems could provide data on the amount spent on  services, but the reliability of the information was questionable and the  system itself was seldom used as a tool to manage or identify  opportunities for managing DOD\u2019s supplier base.", "Procurement processes within DOD were not always carried out  efficiently and effectively.", "There were few service contracting-related enterprisewide annual  performance metrics, none of which measured the cost-effectiveness  or quality of services obtained.", "Services differ from products in several aspects and can also be  challenging when attempting to define requirements, establish measurable  and performance-based outcomes, and assess contractor performance.  For example, it can easily take over 10 years to define requirements and  develop a product like a weapon system before it can actually be delivered  for field use. Individual service acquisitions generally proceed through  requirements, solution, and delivery more rapidly. Further, delivery of  services generally begins immediately or very shortly after the contract is  finalized.", "In response to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2002, DOD and the military departments established a service acquisition  management structure, including processes at the headquarters level for  reviewing individual, high-dollar acquisitions. In September 2003, we  reported that this approach did not provide a departmentwide assessment  of how spending for services could be more effective and recommended  that DOD give greater attention to promoting a strategic orientation by  setting performance goals for improvements and ensuring accountability  for achieving those results. In its response, DOD concurred in principle  and agreed that additional actions could strengthen the management  structure as implemented, but also identified challenges for doing so based  on organizational size, complexity, and acquisition environment.", "In January 2006, Congress again enacted legislation with specific  requirements for managing the acquisition of services. Among other  things, the legislation required DOD to  identify the critical skills and competencies needed to carry out the  procurement of services;    develop a comprehensive strategy for recruitment, training, and  deploying employees to meet the requirements for skills and  competencies;    establish contract services acquisition categories, based on dollar  thresholds, for the purpose of establishing the level of review, decision  authority, and applicable procedures;    dedicate full-time commodity managers to coordinate the procurement  of key categories of services;    ensure that contract services are procured by means of procurement  actions that are in the best interests of DOD and entered into and  managed in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, directives,  and requirements;    ensure that competitive procedures and performance-based  contracting are used to the maximum extent practicable; and    monitor data and periodically collect spend analyses to ensure that  funds allotted for the procurement of services are expended in the  most rational and economical manner practicable.", "The requirements pertaining to establishing contract service acquisition  categories were to be phased in over a period of 3 years, with the first  categories, for acquisitions with an estimated value of $250 million or  more, to be established by October 2006. At the conclusion of our review,  DOD issued a policy memorandum aimed at strengthening service  acquisition management in response to the legislation. DOD is to report on  its implementation by January 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing Service Acquisition Requires Both a Strategic and a Transactional Focus", "paragraphs": ["Several key factors are necessary to improve DOD\u2019s service acquisition  outcomes\u2014that is, obtaining the right service, at the right price, in the  right manner.

Success factors to achieve these goals can be  defined at both the strategic and the transactional level, as shown in   figure 1.", "The strategic level is where the enterprise sets the direction or vision for  what it needs, captures the knowledge to enable more informed  management decisions, ensures deparmentwide goals and objectives are  achieved, determines how to go about meeting those needs, and assesses  the resources it has to achieve desired outcomes. The strategic level also  sets the context for the transactional level, where the focus is on making  sound decisions on individual transactions. Our work found that officials  need to ensure that individual service transactions have valid and well- defined requirements, have appropriate business arrangements, and that  performance is being managed\u2014again, while minimizing related risks and  maximizing efficiency. A comprehensive approach would use the strategic  and transactional factors in a complementary manner to tailor  management activity to ensure preferred outcomes.

Effective service  acquisition requires the leadership, processes, and information necessary  for mitigating risks, leveraging buying power, and managing outcomes.  Several factors are needed to implement a strategic approach, including  (1) strong leadership to define and articulate a corporate vision, including  specific goals and outcomes; (2) results-oriented communication and  metrics; (3) defined responsibilities and associated support structures; and  (4) increased knowledge and focus on spending data and trends. See  figure 2 for key factors to achieve a strategic approach to acquiring  services.", "Our work found that organizations seeking to significantly improve service  acquisition outcomes must begin with an established vision and  commitment from senior management. This can come in various ways,  ranging from restructuring the corporate procurement function, providing  greater insight into and authority over the company\u2019s service spending, or  signaling support for a new way of doing business. With an articulated  vision, leaders then have a basis for making commitments to factors  important for realizing the desired end state, such as practices,  procedures, structures, information, and human capital planning. Our  work has shown that when corporate goals and expected outcomes are  not defined, employees becomes less likely to accept new roles or  understand the importance of upcoming changes that are necessary to  reduce risks in service acquisition. These include allowing the sum total of  individual transactions to define the strategy and not providing a context  within which managers of individual transactions can make sound  judgments about the risk and sensitivity of a particular service acquisition.", "Being able to define a strategic vision presupposes that leaders can  determine and articulate a normative position for the future. A normative  position would entail defining what end state or goals they want to achieve  at a specified time. This position can then be translated into specifics, both  in the aggregate and by type, such as  the current volume, type, location, and trends of service acquisitions;  the results the organization wants to achieve in a specified time frame;  the definition of a good service acquisition outcome; and  the characteristics of a service acquisition that make it desirable,  undesirable, or sensitive.", "Critical to establishing a normative position is knowledge of current  service acquisition expenditures, management priorities, and expected  outcomes. The vision could also dictate which services represent risks to  the organization. For example, acquisitions could be deemed low risk  based on minimal cost exposure, high availability of service providers, or  limited criticality for meeting mission requirements. Conversely, high-risk  acquisitions may be those of higher dollar value, mission-critical  requirements, services that are new or being acquired using a different  approach, or any other services determined to need additional corporate- level involvement or oversight based on management priorities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Vision and Goals Must Be Communicated and Used to Measure Progress", "paragraphs": ["Once a vision and desired end state for service acquisition have been  defined, senior management must be both active and persistent in  supporting ongoing efforts, adjusting the strategy to reflect new  information, and moving toward the established normative position.  Communication and metrics are important management ingredients in  terms of overcoming resistance, cultural barriers, and other impediments  to achieving identified goals. Senior leaders also have the responsibility to  communicate and demonstrate a commitment to sound practices deemed  acceptable for the acquisition function. We have previously reported that  DOD faces vulnerabilities in aspects of its senior leadership because of  certain disconnects, including senior positions that have remained unfilled  for long periods of time, the acquisition culture fostered by management\u2019s  tone at the top, and the management approach used in new industry  partnering relationships.", "We have also noted the importance of leadership by senior agency officials  to successfully transform other aspects of DOD\u2019s business operations and  those of other federal agencies. For example, our prior work has shown  that DOD\u2019s substantial financial and business management weaknesses  adversely affect not only its ability to produce auditable financial  information, but also its ability to provide accurate, complete, and timely  information for DOD management and Congress to use in making  informed decisions. We indicated that overcoming these weaknesses  required sustained leadership at the highest level and a strategic and  integrated plan.", "Metrics defining specified outcomes are vital to increasing the likelihood  that changes to practices will successfully contribute to the organizational  vision. While they can differ in nature and be used to varying degrees,  metrics can be used to (1) evaluate and understand performance levels,   (2) identify critical processes that require attention, (3) document results  over time, and (4) report information to senior officials for decision- making purposes. To illustrate this, DOD spends 20 percent of its service  dollars on professional and administrative management support contracts.  If senior DOD officials believe that such volume poses risks, then it can  use this information to establish targets to control and monitor the use of  these services. For example, in March 2006 the Secretary of the Air Force  issued a memorandum directing increased visibility and management of  contract services in support of command functions, in an attempt to save  over $6 billion that would then be used for other transformation initiatives.  If the Air Force follows up by collecting timely data on the individual  service transactions made in this area, it can see whether it is making  progress toward its desired end state. For DOD, risks of not doing this at a  strategic level entail losing momentum and failing to sustain positive  change, and such failures can then be manifested in quick fixes, fire drills,  or changes in policy statements that do not have a material effect on  actual operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Structures and Processes Must Be Defined to Facilitate Service Management Direction", "paragraphs": ["Successful service acquisition management also requires attention to the  organization\u2019s ability to move from a fragmented manner of doing business  to one that is more coordinated and strategically oriented. Primarily, this  involves changing how services are acquired in terms of business  processes, organizational structures, and roles and responsibilities. Our  work with leading commercial firms found that typical changes in this area  include  restructuring acquisition organizations and elevating the procurement  function to improve coordination with other internal organizations and  optimize available resources;    establishing new processes for routine tasks and using cross-functional  teams made up of individuals with various skills to ensure the right mix  of knowledge, technical expertise, and credibility; and    establishing full-time, dedicated commodity managers to provide more  effective management over key services.", "We reported in March 2005 that the Department of Homeland Security was  pursuing similar approaches as it attempted to integrate the various  acquisition functions it inherited upon its establishment in 2003. For  example, the department designated a Chief Procurement Officer with  broad responsibility for its acquisition function and established  commodity councils composed of representatives from across the  department that were assigned responsibility for assessing future  purchasing strategies. We noted, however, that senior agency leadership  needed to address a number of challenges before fully integrating its  procurement function, such as clearly defining the roles and  responsibilities of key offices, and establishing a structure to ensure  continued support for commodity councils\u2014such as appointing full-time  commodity managers.", "In essence, this move toward a more strategic orientation can be  compared to a franchise model of business versus that of individually  owned stores or units. While franchises, like individually owned  businesses, operate at the local level and adapt to the specific needs and  demands of a community, they still must adhere to the consistent set of  standards and processes of the parent organization. For service  acquisition, this translates into recognition that while unique local  requirements need to be understood and met, individual acquisitions  should also be viewed in the context of organizational goals, objectives,  and strategies. In this regard, company officials indicated they can tailor  delivery of services to meet local needs while helping to achieve  organizational cost savings or quality improvement objectives. Risks here  are twofold. First, if a single, monolithic process is used for every service  acquisition regardless of size, sensitivity, or type, it could be overkill for  some transactions and insufficient for others. Second, allowing local  buying activities to operate independent of organizational standards and  processes would impair or defeat an organization\u2019s ability to achieve  desired aggregate goals or outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Knowledge on Spending and Workforce Vital to Managing Services", "paragraphs": ["Organizations also need basic, reliable data on how service dollars are  being spent and the capabilities of the workforce in place to acquire and  manage those services. Company officials who were successful with  improving service acquisition management informed us it was critical to  define the relevant types of information that were required and then  develop the appropriate data systems to collect and provide reliable  spending data. Such data enable senior managers to know not only the  current state of service acquisition, but how far it is from the desired end  state. While the type of information may vary depending on the  organization and the types of services acquired, basic spend analysis data  should include information and trends related to  the type of services being acquired;  the number of suppliers for a specific service the organization is using;  the amount the organization is spending for that service, in total and  with each supplier; and   the units in the organization that are acquiring the services.", "We have previously reported that several civilian agencies have used this  approach to leverage their buying power, reduce costs, and better manage  suppliers of goods and services. For example, we reported in September  2004 that the Departments of Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, among  others, had launched or expanded spend analysis efforts and in turn  realized savings ranging from $1.8 million to $394 million on related  acquisitions. Similarly, we noted in 2005 that the Department of  Homeland Security identified 15 commodity areas as having the potential  to leverage the department\u2019s buying power. In fiscal year 2004, four  commodity councils reported approximately $14.1 million in cost savings  and avoidances. Some councils encountered difficulties due to a shortage  of comprehensive data upon which to draw an accurate and detailed  picture of what was being spent on certain commodities over time, thereby  preventing them from taking full advantage of their strategic sourcing and  spend analysis efforts.", "Equally important and necessary is for an organization to have a  workforce that is manned at the appropriate levels and equipped with the  right skills and abilities. To do this, a comprehensive, data-driven  workforce analysis must be performed in conjunction with establishing  the corporate vision and goals. An organization cannot fully understand  what skills and staffing commitments are necessary at each organizational  level to meet service acquisition requirements until it understands where it  wants to go and how it plans to get there. Once information on spending  and workforce capabilities is known and understood, organizations can be  more strategic in planning and managing service acquisition. The absence  of such data creates several risks, including not knowing how and where  money is being spent on service acquisition or not having the appropriate  workforce skills or staffing levels to ensure it is using sound buying  practices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transactional Focus: Buying the Right Individual Service the Right Way", "paragraphs": ["While the strategic level defines the direction and manner in which an  organization pursues improvements in service acquisition, it is through  individual service transactions that the strategy is implemented. Key  factors at this transactional level include (1) clearly defined and valid  requirements; (2) appropriate business arrangements; and (3) effective  contractor management and oversight. In short, an organization needs to  assure itself that on individual service transactions it is buying the right  thing in the right way and that doing so results in the desired outcome. See  figure 3 for key factors for effectively managing service acquisitions at the  transaction level.", "Establishing a valid need and translating that into a service acquisition  requirement is essential for obtaining the right outcome. Without this, an  organization increases the risk that it will pay too much for the services  provided, acquire services that do not meet its needs, or enter too quickly  into a sensitive arrangement that exposes the organization to financial,  performance, or other risks. Moreover, to establish accurate requirements,  the customer organization would benefit by involving stakeholders that  have knowledge about past transactions, current market capabilities and  the potential supplier base, and budgetary and financial management  issues. The makeup of stakeholders may vary across different transactions  depending on the nature, complexity, and risks. In the end, the purpose of  stakeholders with varied knowledge and skills is to ensure at the earliest  point possible that all aspects of the acquisition are necessary, executable,  and tailored to the level of risk commensurate with the individual  transaction. We have found that when DOD uses similar teaming concepts  to develop and deliver products, the results have included superior  outcomes within predicted time frames and budgets. For example, we  reported in April 2001 that the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle  program used teams to reduce the time needed to make a design decision  from 6 months to about a week.", "Because the nature of service contracts can vary, they naturally require  different approaches in describing requirements. For example, the time,  discipline, and sophistication of a team developing a requirement for  repetitive building maintenance would be considerably less than that of a  team developing a requirement for the first purchase of a space launch  service. Observing these factors, tailored to the individual requirement at  hand, can help to ensure that risks associated with a requirement for a  service acquisition are fully considered before entering into a business  arrangement. This is especially important for service acquisitions, because  once requirements are developed, most transactions move very quickly  into the business arrangement and contracting stages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appropriate Business Arrangements Provide Right Way to Buy Services", "paragraphs": ["Once a requirement has been validated and defined, it becomes necessary  to develop an appropriate business arrangement to meet that need while  protecting the government\u2019s interests. Of course, without a sound  requirement, the business arrangement could be relegated to buying the  wrong service the right way. At a basic level, this includes defining a clear  scope of expected contractor performance, developing an objective means  to assess the contractor\u2019s performance, ensuring effective contractor  selection based on competition and sound pricing, and selecting an  appropriate contracting vehicle. Here again, while these are performed  with respect to the individual transaction, they must be done in the  context of the organization\u2019s strategic vision.", "As an organization undergoes the process for selecting those contractors  that will provide services, there should be clearly established relationships  among what tasks the contractor is expected to perform, the contract  terms and conditions, and performance evaluation factors and incentives.  This is especially true as federal agencies makes adjustments to their  acquisition practices. For example, in recent years, federal agencies have  made a major shift in the way they buy services, turning increasingly to  interagency contracts as a way to streamline the procurement process. In  these cases, an agency can use an existing contract that has already been  awarded by another agency, or turn to another agency to issue and  administer task orders on its behalf, often for a fee. Requirements, roles,  and responsibilities need to be clear to reduce risks. For example, we  reported in July 2005 that DOD customers did not provide the awarding  agency with detailed information about their needs. Without this  information, these agencies did not translate DOD\u2019s needs into well- defined contract requirements that contained criteria to determine  whether the contractor had performed successfully. In the absence of  well-defined outcomes, DOD and the agencies lacked criteria to provide  effective contractor oversight.", "Similarly, competition during the acquisition process is also important in  getting reasonable prices, as offerors put forth their best bid and solution  to meeting the proposed requirements and the government receives the  benefit of market forces on pricing. We have noted, however, that DOD  has, at times, sacrificed the benefits of competition for expediency. For  example, we noted in April 2006 that DOD awarded contracts for security  guard services supporting 57 domestic bases, 46 of which were done on an  authorized, sole-source basis. The sole-source contracts supporting the  last 37 installations were awarded by DOD despite recognizing it was  paying about 25 percent more than previously paid for contracts awarded  competitively.", "When proper management controls are not in place, particularly in an  interagency fee-for-service contracting environment, too much emphasis  can be placed on customer satisfaction and revenue generation rather than  on compliance with sound contracting policy and required procedures,  such as competition. Significant problems in the way contracting offices  carry out responsibilities in issuing the orders for services may not be  detected or addressed by management. For example, in April 2005 we  reported that a lack of effective management controls\u2014in particular  insufficient management oversight and a lack of adequate training\u2014led to  the breakdowns in the issuance and administration of task orders for  interrogation and other services in Iraq, including:  issuing 10 out of 11 task orders that were beyond the scope of  underlying contracts, in violation of competition rules;    not complying with additional DOD competition requirements when  issuing task orders for services on existing contracts;    not properly justifying the decision to use interagency contracting;    not complying with ordering procedures meant to ensure best value for  the government; and  inadequate monitoring of contractor performance.", "Without appropriate attention, there is an increased risk that the  government will pay too much for the purchased service, will be limited in  its access to new and innovative alternatives, or will not be in the proper  position to effectively manage the contractor after an arrangement is  established."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actual Performance Must Be Managed and Assessed", "paragraphs": ["At the transactional level it is also important to implement a post-contract  award process to effectively manage and assess contractor performance to  ensure that the business arrangement is properly executed. Managing and  assessing post-award performance entails various activities performed by  government officials to ensure that the delivery of services meets the  terms of the contract, including adequate surveillance resources, proper  incentives, and a capable workforce for overseeing contractor activities.  Each of these requires metrics and tools to encourage contractors to  provide superior performance and to manage and document that the  contractor\u2019s performance was acceptable. For example, one important  element of this phase is having a plan for assessing performance that  outlines how services will be delivered. In addition, the plan should  provide a mechanism for capturing and documenting performance  information so it can serve as past performance information on future  contracts. Effective use of such a plan can allow the government to  evaluate the contractor\u2019s success in meeting the specified contract  requirements. Further, organizations can use monetary incentives, such as  those provided through award and incentive fee contracts, to promote  desired acquisition outcomes. Finally, quality assurance surveillance\u2014 oversight of the services being performed by the contractor\u2014is important  to ensure that contractors are providing timely and high-quality services  and to help mitigate any contractor performance problems.", "In an environment that demands increased interaction between DOD and  the contractor to ensure expected outcomes, acquisition personnel must  be adequately trained to understand each of these elements and have the  skills to manage service contractors accordingly. Without appropriate  attention through contract completion, we have found that risks exist that  could result in poor contractor performance, services not being delivered  as expected, or payment to contractors for more than the value of the  services they performed. For example, our March 2005 review of   90 contracts showed wide variance in the level of surveillance, including  15 contracts that had no personnel assigned at all for these  responsibilities. According to DOD officials, this condition existed  because surveillance was not as important to contracting officials as  awarding contracts and contracting oversight personnel were not properly  assigned, evaluated on the performance of their duties, or provided  enough time to complete surveillance tasks. In the same way that the  development of requirements for services must be different from the  development of requirements for products, so is the case for overseeing  contractor performance. Given that performance thresholds may vary  greatly, management and oversight of individual service acquisitions may  need to be tailored to meet specific requirements. In some cases, dollar  value may not be a good proxy for determining risk. For example, some  high dollar contracts could pose relatively little risk to achieving the  agency\u2019s mission.

In  addition, it required the military departments to establish a similar  management review process. DOD officials noted in 2003 that this  approach, combined with several other initiatives, was expected to have  significant impact on the acquisition of services. The new management  structure DOD implemented to address identified deficiencies associated  with the management of services established three levels: (1) review by  the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics)  for services acquisitions valued over $2 billion; (2) review by the  component or designated acquisition executive for service acquisitions  valued between $500 million and $2 billion; and (3) review by a  component-designated official for the acquisition of services valued at less  than $500 million. In response to this guidance, the Air Force, Army, and  Navy each developed individual service acquisition review processes and  authorities to support the DOD review requirements and identified  respective decision authorities responsible for conducting execution  reviews to assess progress against metrics.", "DOD and military department officials with whom we spoke indicated that  the review structure has provided the reviewing office with additional  insight on high-dollar value service acquisitions. However, the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics)  lacked complete information on the number and scope of acquisitions of  which it was notified and therefore could not give us a definitive response  as to how many transactions were formally reviewed. Officials from that  office provided a list of 19 service acquisitions that had been notified for  review\u20149 Army and 2 Air Force acquisitions, in addition to 8 acquisitions  from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and  Information Integration), which are subject to review under the guidance  for major automated information systems\u2014but provided no additional  information on the results of those reviews.", "Data provided by officials at the military department level indicated that  through September 2005, 69 acquisitions\u2014representing just under   3 percent of service obligations\u2014had been reviewed by the Air Force,  Army, and Navy under the new process (see table 2).", "While the DOD reviews to date under this process have provided some  additional visibility over high-dollar value service acquisitions, the reviews  tend to focus more on ensuring compliance with applicable statutes,  regulations, and other requirements, rather than on imparting a vision or  tailored method for strategically managing service acquisition. Senior DOD  and military department officials noted that the process is generally not  intended to review program or customer decisions made at lower levels  within the department as to the need for the particular services or to have  a post-contract award follow-up assessment to ensure expected outcomes.  Also, the reviews have not positioned DOD to regularly identify  opportunities to leverage buying power. Further, they noted that the  reviews are largely perceived as a function and responsibility of the DOD  contracting organization, rather than a shared responsibility of the entire  acquisition community, to include the program office and other customers  for services.", "Moreover, DOD\u2019s policy does not require the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to actually review those  acquisitions that exceed the $2 billion threshold. Service acquisitions that  meet this threshold are first reviewed and approved at the military  department level. In turn, the military departments notify the Under  Secretary that a service acquisition exceeding the threshold is available for  review. If there is no response within 10 days, the acquisition is allowed to  proceed without further review. Additionally, at the military department  level, most of the service acquisitions reviewed to date have been  indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. There is no requirement  to review individual task orders that are subsequently issued even if the  value of the task order exceeds the review thresholds.", "We spoke to many officials at buying activities that had proposed service  acquisitions for review under this process.

These officials indicated that the timing of the review process\u2014which  generally occurs well into the planning cycle\u2014is too late to provide  opportunities to influence the acquisition strategy. These officials told us  that the reviews would be more beneficial if they were conducted earlier  in the process, in conjunction with the program office or customer, and in  the context of a more strategic approach to how best to meet the  requirement, rather than simply from a secondary or tertiary review of the  contract and in an area where they have considerable experience and  expertise.

According to DOD documentation, there are thousands  of individual information systems that have been implemented over  decades to meet various mission needs, and rather than providing usable  information, these systems can hinder collecting information needed by  decision makers. Because these systems were developed independently\u2014 often not designed to be interoperable with other such systems\u2014it is a  challenge to share data with other locations or higher organizational levels  in support of broader planning and decision making. Even collecting basic  information on high-dollar services often proves time-consuming. For  example, in April 2005, DOD initiated a formal review of its service  acquisition policy. According to DOD officials, after determining that its  data systems were inadequate to identify and assess the status of service  acquisition policy compliance, the department initiated a data call to each  of the military components asking for a status review of the top 20 service  acquisitions in each military department since inception of the policy.

For example,  DOD\u2019s 2006 Human Capital Strategic Plan noted there are currently efforts  to develop a comprehensive competency model for each functional career  field including the technical tasks, knowledge, skills, abilities, and  personal characteristics required of the acquisition workforce. Similarly,  DAU officials noted that they are revising the training curriculum for  acquisition personnel, in part to provide an increased emphasis on service  acquisition. For example, DAU has an ongoing effort to identify the critical  competencies for service acquisition, determine which of these  competencies require further workforce training, and develop the  appropriate training.

Instead,  DOD service acquisition management activities focus primarily on  awarding the contract. Without clearly defined requirements and attention  after the contract is awarded, DOD cannot be sure it is buying the right  service or using an appropriate means to assess contractor performance.

Several officials  identified actions they have initiated to improve working relationships, but  acknowledged that results have not been uniformly achieved. In part,  these issues arise from cultural differences between the contracting and  acquisition communities concerning their roles in managing various  service acquisition elements.", "Generally the intended customer of a service, such as a program office,  has the responsibility to identify what type of service it requires, the level  of performance or quality needed, the period of performance, and the  available budget. To avoid problems with the later stages of the acquisition  process, and depending on the complexity of the services needed, early  involvement of the contracting and other functional communities is  important. However, contracting officers we spoke with frequently  commented that the initial statements of work prepared by the customer  were often insufficient, unclear, or not expressed in performance-based  terms, requiring considerable rework. In addition, officials told us it is  important that contracting officers fully understand exactly what the  customer needs in order to get the best business arrangement for the  government. However, contracting officers did not always have the  necessary knowledge or expertise to understand the requirement, such as  translating specific requirements into the statement of work. According to  contracting officials, the resulting frustrations are heightened when  customers identify the need to award a contract for the services in a short  time period.", "Similarly, because services are generally funded on an annual basis,  contracting officers are often faced with many pressures at the end of each  fiscal year. For example, officials at the Navy Fleet Industrial Supply  Center in Philadelphia noted the impact of DOD\u2019s recent policy requiring  contracting officers to approve task orders with a value of $100,000 or  more if they are issued against a non-DOD contract. While this does  provide greater visibility in an area of previous concerns, the officials we  spoke to indicated that the policy was issued without first assessing the  impact on the contracting workforce or whether the customer was fully  aware of the new process requirements. Consequently, contracting  personnel were faced with a significant increase in workload, much of it at  the end of the fiscal year. As many of these contracting officials had not  been involved with the original negotiation or award of the contract, and  because of the short time frames needed to issue the orders, they felt  pressured to review and approve task orders without being able to fully  assess whether the overall approach was the most effective or efficient.", "The lack of technical knowledge and training was raised as an issue at  several commands we visited. For example, at many locations, officials  commented on the lack of contracting knowledge on the part of the  customer. One contracting manager told us he would be willing to pay for  contracting-related training for customers, so that they could better  understand how to prepare various contract documents, such as a  performance-based statement of work or an award fee evaluation plan.  Contracting officials told us that such documents can be difficult to  prepare without sufficient planning and input from customers who are  familiar with what needs to be accomplished. Similarly, contracting  officers at one location told us that they sometimes have to alter  acquisition approaches because it is too difficult to develop evaluation  plans that can be used by customers to effectively evaluate contractor  performance. Program officials also commented on the lack of technical  knowledge on the part of the contracting community. One Air Force  program official told us that he is required to use the general base  contracting office to procure advanced medical services, even though the  contracting officers usually do not have related technical knowledge and  sometimes have difficulty understanding the requirement. Shared  knowledge and communication are therefore important for ensuring that  customers and contracting personnel are placed in the best position to  achieve expected outcomes.", "Officials at some locations reported that better acquisition outcomes can  result from establishing effective working partnerships. For example, Air  Force Space Command officials noted that one of their major service  acquisitions involves support for base operations in Thule, Greenland. The  Air Force has relied on contractors to provide these services for more than  four decades and believed their experience on the program illustrates key  aspects needed to promote a successful acquisition. These officials noted  that the service is a high priority and receives considerable attention from  senior management. Additionally, the command employs a team-based  approach to the acquisition, which means that personnel from both the  customer and contracting communities are assigned and remain on the  acquisition team throughout the development of the requirements,  associated acquisition strategy, and contracting approach. Further, to help  develop the requirements, the team receives considerable input from  program personnel and the contracting officer\u2019s technical representative  as to the contractor\u2019s performance, and makes use of monthly reports that  measure key performance parameters. By including personnel from all  stages of the acquisition process\u2014program managers, contracting officers,  and quality assurance personnel\u2014Space Command officials believed they  were able to make adjustments to their requirements that allowed the  contract to be priced in a manner that reduced cost risk to the  government. Command officials and those involved in the Thule service  acquisition acknowledge, however, that they have not been able to  consistently replicate this success on all other acquisitions.", "Because of the recognized need to improve communication and share  knowledge between customers and the acquisition workforce, some of the  buying commands we visited have taken actions to promote  communication and timely interaction. For example, the Army\u2019s  Communications and Electronics Command colocated senior contracting  officers with customers to promote better communication and more  cooperation between the two communities. These staff members, referred  to as customer service representatives, establish early lines of  communication by participating in management meetings with the  customers to identify future acquisition needs.

In some cases, the commands have established  additional procedures to review specific areas of interest, such as the  proposed use of an interagency contract or to ensure that task orders  under multiple award contracts comply with competition requirements.", "Despite these reviews, however, we have identified examples of  potentially poor contracting practices and the pressure to meet customer  demands. For example,    On one acquisition, an Army contracting officer issued a task order for  a product that the contracting officer knew was outside the scope of  the service contract. The contracting officer noted in an e-mail to the  requestor that this deviation was allowed only because the customer  needed the product quickly and cautioned that no such allowances  would be granted in the future.", "The Navy has established Seaport-enhanced, a centralized electronic  ordering system that competes and issues task orders for multiple  customers for program management support contracts.

Many  command officials noted the difficulties in doing so, since service  acquisitions involve a wide range of activities that necessitate different  measures of quality or performance from each other or from acquisitions  involving products or major weapon systems. Often, these officials noted  that their measure of success is reflected in terms of customer satisfaction  or the number of complaints received from the customers.", "Command officials noted that cost, delivery, or schedule performance  measures may not be as effective on service contracts as for products or  weapon systems. In this regard, the officials noted that services are often  1-year efforts in which schedule performance provides limited insights.  Similarly, these officials noted that many of their service contracts, which  are often cost reimbursable or time-and-materials in nature, are funded on  a quarterly basis and are limited by the amount of funds made available. In  these cases, program officials noted that if more funds are made available  than expected, the customer may increase the number of staff or labor  hours to be provided; conversely, funding reductions will be reflected in  commensurate reductions in the number of staff or labor hours. In either  case, measuring changes in cost or hours is more reflective of the  availability of funding, rather than an indication of contractor  performance. Command officials noted that their information systems  generally do not provide a capability to assess service acquisition  outcomes.", "Additionally, the ability to conduct oversight within DOD\u2019s management  structure is often constrained by resources and workforce availability. For  example, Air Force documentation suggests that 90 percent of planning  activity is focused on getting the contract awarded, leaving very little for  contract administration and oversight. Further, DOD officials noted that  organizations like the Defense Contract Management Agency do not  perform the same level of surveillance functions for services as they do for  products. The Defense Contract Management Agency generally assembles  integrated program support teams to deliver support at prime contractor  facilities, which in turn supply business and technical support and furnish  program managers with insight into program execution at the prime  contract level, as well as the major and critical subcontract tiers. Senior  DOD officials told us that because services tend not to rise to the level of a  program, the Defense Contract Management Agency does not always  provide the resources to support those acquisitions.

For example, the Air Force, in  conjunction with the Army, developed a strategic approach to acquiring  wireless services and generated projected savings of 30 percent annually  for just one of its service providers.

DOD has taken action, but  action has not necessarily equated to progress. At this point, DOD is not in  a good position to say where service acquisition is today in terms of  outcomes, where it wants service acquisition to be in the next few years,  or how to get there. This makes it difficult to set the context within which  individual organizations can make informed judgments on service  acquisition transactions. Without this context, DOD will not be in a  position to determine  the current volume, type, location, and trends of service acquisition;  the results DOD wants to achieve in the next 3 to 5 years in each of  these areas;  the definition of a good service acquisition outcome;  the characteristics of a service acquisition that make it desirable,  undesirable, or sensitive;  the risks that need to be managed at each stage of a transaction; and   the conditions under which a transaction should be referred for review.", "Given the diverse nature of services that DOD acquires, multiple sources  of risk, and wide variety of organizations that are involved in individual  acquisitions, until this basic information is available and understood, it  may not be to possible to develop an ideal departmentwide review process  or organizational structure. For example, while setting dollar thresholds as  a basis for reviewing an individual service acquisition is an improvement  over no review, dollars are not always a good proxy for risk. Moreover,  when a service acquisition reaches the review stage, the requirement and  proposed business arrangement are set and expediency becomes an issue  as the contract is ready to be awarded. Ultimately, the majority of  individual service acquisition decisions will be made by organizations at  the local level. The people making these decisions will have to make  judgments regarding the risks and soundness of requirements, sources,  competition, contract types, and execution follow-up. Their decisions will  also trigger which acquisitions receive higher level review. Of primary  importance now is to provide a context for these organizations in which  they can make tailored decisions and recommendations that remain  consistent with DOD\u2019s overarching views of risk, desirable outcomes, and  direction for service acquisition.

We primarily used our  January 2002 report that identified how leading commercial companies  took a strategic approach to acquiring services. In addition, we reviewed  previous GAO reports related to overall contract management and those  related to individual service contract transactions, specifically in areas  such as business transformation, interagency contracting, strategic  sourcing, and contract surveillance. To confirm and validate key factors,  we held detailed discussions with relevant defense contracting experts in  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics); the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and  Information Integration); the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of  Defense (Business Transformation); the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense (Health Affairs); and the Defense Acquisition University. In  addition, we spoke with various offices within each of the military  departments, including the Air Force Program Executive Office (Combat  and Mission Support); the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Policy  and Procurement); the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research,  Development, and Acquisition); and the Air Force Information Technology  Commodity Council.", "To assess the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD)  approach, including its current management structure, exhibited these  characteristics, we reviewed relevant DOD guidance and policy  memoranda, including those that established its current management  structure and review processes. We interviewed officials responsible for  implementing the management structure within the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, as well as each of the offices mentioned above. Discussions  with these officials focused on DOD and military department service  acquisition approaches, including those in put in place in response to  sections 801 and 802 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2002 and other service contracting issues and initiatives. Data  collected includes the number of service contract management reviews  that have occurred under the newly implemented structure as well as the  composition and purpose of those review boards. We obtained  information on the types of activities and reviews conducted by these  offices, including the number and value of service acquisitions they  reviewed.", "To document and analyze the processes by which individual military  commands and buying activities acquired services, we visited 20 locations.  We selected these locations based both on recommendations from DOD  officials and from our own internal knowledge. While our selection of  locations cannot be generalized to the population of all DOD contracting  locations, those selected represented each of the military services and  represented a range of DOD service types. Locations visited include:    Air Force Space Command, Colorado Springs, Colorado;    Air Force 21st Space Wing, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado Springs,    Air Force 50th Space Wing, Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado    Air Force 460th Space Wing, Buckley Air Force Base, Aurora,    United States Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado;    Army Contracting Center of Excellence, Arlington, Virginia;    Army Contracting Agency, Fort Carson, Colorado Springs, Colorado;    Army Communications and Electronics Command, Fort Monmouth,    Army Information Technology, E-Commerce and Commercial  Contracting Center, Alexandria, Virginia;    Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Alexandria, Virginia;    Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, District of    Naval Supply Systems Command, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania;    Navy Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;    Navy Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia;    Navy Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, San Diego, California;    Naval Personnel Development Command, Norfolk, Virginia;    Navy Space and Warfare Command, San Diego, California;    Naval Education and Training Command (NETC), Pensacola Naval Air    NETC Professional Development and Technology Center, Pensacola,    TRICARE Management Activity, Acquisition Management and Support,  Aurora, Colorado.", "We conducted field observations at these locations and distributed a  structured set of questions to solicit information from contracting officials  designated to respond to our inquiry. Discussions with these officials  focused on the level and type of contracting activity and service  acquisition management approaches. These discussions centered on topics  such as service acquisition culture and relationships between contracting  personnel and customers (including program office and user personnel),  changes in policy and practice under the new review structure, challenges  faced in acquiring services, efforts to improve individual service  acquisitions; databases for capturing service contract data, performance  based contracting, strategic sourcing, and other service acquisition  initiatives. We discussed the review processes for selected service  acquisitions (as determined by buying activity officials); including those  that met criteria for review by either the Office of the Secretary of Defense  or the military departments and, for comparison, those that were not  subject to review at these levels. We reviewed contract file documentation  to examine standard processes, review authority, requirements  determination, and risk management activity. Information collected  included contract solicitations, acquisition strategies, status reports,  performance certifications; review and approval checklists, and other  contract specific documents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Tim DiNapoli, Assistant Director;   Brian Mullins; Christina Cromley Bruner; Whitney Havens;   Moshe Schwartz; Andrew Redd; Julia Kennon; and John Krump made   key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
