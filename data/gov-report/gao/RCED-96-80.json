This report focuses on one component of the portfolio\u2014emergency disaster loans. The emergency disaster loan program, administered by USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA)provides assistance to farmers who sustain losses resulting from adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters. The objectives of our work were to analyze the financial condition of the emergency loan portfolio and identify factors that contribute to the financial risk associated with these loans. We also examined the extent to which farmers attempted to minimize the need for this type of government loan by purchasing insurance to protect their farming operations.", "We conducted our work at FSA headquarters and at state and county offices in California, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, and New York. Our work included analyzing information in FSA\u2019s centralized computer databases on the payment status of emergency loans. In addition, we mailed a survey to FSA county officials to obtain detailed information about a random sample of 600 loans made during fiscal years 1992-94 (see apps. II and III).

Emergency disaster loans cover actual physical and production losses so that farmers can return to normal farming operations. The emergency loan program consists entirely of subsidized loans, offered at interest rates below those offered by other federal farm loan programs. As of January 1996, the emergency loan interest rate was 3.75 percent, while rates for other types of loans, such as operating and farm ownership loans, were 6.5 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively.", "Emergency loans are made available in specific counties when disasters are declared by the President, the Secretary of Agriculture, or the FSA Administrator. Farmers may use loan funds for a variety of purposes, including land restoration, farm operating costs, family living expenses, and debt refinancing. Under the Food Security Act of 1985, applicants are ineligible for emergency loans for crop losses if they did not purchase insurance for crops planted or harvested after December 31, 1986, assuming it was available. However, in most years, the Congress has waived this requirement.", "Currently, the maximum emergency loan assistance available to a farmer for any single disaster is the amount necessary to restore the farm to its condition preceding the disaster, not to exceed (1) the sum of 80 percent of the production losses plus 100 percent of the physical losses not reimbursed by other sources or (2) $500,000, whichever is less. Farmers can qualify for additional emergency loans following subsequent disasters. There is no limit on the total amount of emergency loan debt that a farmer may accrue.", "Over the years, changes have occurred in the emergency disaster loan program. The program was expanded in the 1970s to achieve objectives other than the recovery from actual disaster losses, such as helping farmers survive during periods of financial stress or make major adjustments in their farming operations. However, during the 1980s, restrictions were placed on the availability of emergency loans, including the $500,000 limit for each disaster. As shown in table 1, the number and total value of emergency loans have varied greatly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Our Previous Reports Have Highlighted the Risks in FSA\u2019s Farm Loan Programs", "paragraphs": ["Problems with FSA\u2019s farm loan portfolio are not new.

In 1992, we reported that the taxpayers\u2019 interests were not being protected in these programs, the agency had evolved into a source of continuous farm credit for many borrowers, and billions of dollars in debt were being written off. Large losses continue to plague the programs.", "We also issued two reports that focused specifically on emergency disaster loans. In November 1987, we reported that delinquencies in the emergency disaster loan program were increasing, and we suggested that the Congress consider whether credit, particularly less restrictive credit, was the proper vehicle for providing disaster relief and whether a proper balance of risk existed between the farmer and the government. In September 1989, we reported on the federal government\u2019s strategies for responding to natural disasters affecting agriculture\u2014direct cash payments, subsidized loans, and subsidized insurance (crop insurance).We concluded that crop insurance was the most effective of the three disaster assistance strategies in part because it could minimize the government\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Large Losses in the Emergency Loan Program Are Likely to Continue", "paragraphs": ["Although the amount of the outstanding emergency loan principal and the amount owed by delinquent borrowers have declined, FSA\u2019s emergency loan program continues to exhibit the problems that we first identified in 1987.

Much of the portfolio is held by borrowers who are delinquent or who have previously had difficulty repaying emergency or other types of FSA loans. Furthermore, borrowers have already had difficulty repaying recent loans, which reflect the most current changes to the agency\u2019s emergency lending policies and practices.", "As of September 30, 1995, FSA had over $3 billion in outstanding emergency loan principal to 42,093 borrowers. Of that amount, about $1.8 billion, or 58.6 percent, was held by borrowers who were delinquent on emergency loans, a percentage that has been fairly consistent over the last several years, as shown in table 3.", "Payment status alone, however, does not provide a complete measure of the potential risk associated with the portfolio. This indicator excludes borrowers who may be current on emergency loan payments but who have previously had problems repaying emergency loans or other types of FSA farm loans. These problems required FSA to restructure payment schedules or forgive debt. As of September 30, 1995, such borrowers held approximately $665 million, or 21.8 percent, of the outstanding emergency loan principal. When this principal is combined with the principal owed by delinquent borrowers, about $2.5 billion, or 80.4 percent, of the outstanding emergency loan principal is held by borrowers who are at risk.", "This overall picture of potential risk in the emergency loan portfolio reflects both past and present lending policies and practices. To better assess the risk associated with current loans, we examined the status of loans made during fiscal years 1992 through 1994.", "FSA made 6,302 emergency loans totaling $279 million to 5,753 borrowers during this period. Although these loans are relatively new\u2014from 1 to 4 years old\u2014repayment problems have already surfaced. Through September 30, 1995, FSA had forgiven $1.2 million in uncollectible principal and interest on 41 of these loans. In addition, on the basis of our sample of 600 loans, we estimate that payments were delinquent on approximately 25 percent of the loans as of January 10, 1995."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weak Lending Policies and Practices Add to Inherent Risk of Emergency Loans", "paragraphs": ["The likelihood that farmers will repay emergency loan debt is diminished by the nature of the loans. Emergency loans are inherently riskier than other types of farm loans because they are made to help farmers recover from losses rather than generate new income. This problem is compounded by weak lending policies and the agency\u2019s failure to implement existing lending requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lending Policies Are Weak", "paragraphs": ["Three lending policies expose the government to potential losses by allowing borrowers who have poor credit histories or are in a very weak financial position to obtain loans. First, the provisions of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act as amended (P.L. 87-128, Aug. 8, 1961) do not prohibit borrowers who received prior FSA debt forgiveness from obtaining additional farm loans, including emergency loans. We identified 293 borrowers who obtained $11.6 million in emergency loans during fiscal years 1992 through 1994 after having about $51 million in unpaid debt forgiven. As of September 30, 1995, 27 percent of these borrowers were already experiencing problems repaying the recent emergency loans. The following example illustrates this problem:", "A New York vineyard owner, an FSA farm loan borrower since 1978, received a 1993 emergency loan of $9,640 for crop losses resulting from a drought. FSA made this loan after having forgiven approximately $207,000 on five other farm loans in 1990. In January 1995, the borrower was delinquent on the 1993 emergency loan. FSA classified this borrower as being unlikely to repay the loan.", "Second, FSA\u2019s method for determining an applicant\u2019s ability to repay a loan does not provide for contingencies. The current \u201ccash flow\u201d lending criterion requires only that an applicant have an estimated income equal to the estimated expenses in order to qualify for a loan. It does not provide a cushion for any unanticipated expense that may occur during the life of the loan. On the basis of our sample of loans made during fiscal years 1992 through 1994, we estimate that FSA made about 62 percent of the emergency loans to borrowers whose anticipated income exceeded their expenses by less than 10 percent. Furthermore, about 17 percent of these borrowers attained these minimal cash flows only because FSA rescheduled or forgave debt on which the borrowers had failed to honor repayment schedules. As of September 30, 1995, approximately 37 percent of the borrowers with cash flow margins of less than 10 percent were behind on their loan payments or had required debt restructuring or forgiveness after receiving their emergency loans. For borrowers with cash flow margins of 10 percent or more, this percentage dropped to about 28 percent. The following example shows the kinds of problems that can arise when cash flow margins are minimal:", "A Michigan fruit producer applied for a 1992 emergency loan because of freeze damage. FSA approved the application, even though the applicant\u2014an FSA borrower since 1985\u2014had a poor payment history and a projected income exceeding his projected expenses by only $2. This borrower\u2019s cash flow margin was low even after FSA rescheduled existing loans on which he could not make payments. In 1993, the 1992 emergency loan was rescheduled because the borrower had not made payments; in 1994, the debt was forgiven; and, as of July 1995, the borrower was again delinquent on other FSA loan payments, and the county supervisor expected additional losses to the government.", "Finally, there is no limit on the amount of emergency loan indebtedness an individual borrower may accumulate. Although assistance for a single disaster is limited to the amount necessary to restore a farm to its predisaster condition or $500,000, whichever is less, a farmer can obtain additional emergency loans for subsequent disasters. As of September 30, 1995, 696 borrowers had each accumulated emergency loan principal in excess of $500,000, with a cumulative total in excess of $800 million. These borrowers had a higher rate of delinquency than those with less outstanding emergency loan principal. Specifically, borrowers with more than $500,000 in emergency loan principal had a delinquency rate of 82 percent, while those with $500,000 or less in emergency loan principal had a delinquency rate of about 30 percent. The following example illustrates the large emergency loan indebtedness that a borrower can accumulate and the types of repayment problems that can result:", "A Maryland farmer who operated a dairy and produced multiple crops had seven emergency loans with outstanding principal balances totaling approximately $850,000 as of September 30, 1995. According to an FSA county official, the borrower has been unable to repay the emergency loans on schedule, and FSA has deferred payments for 5 years. We noted that FSA compounded this problem in 1992 by providing an emergency loan that exceeded the borrower\u2019s eligibility level for the disaster by $101,000. FSA did not reduce the borrower\u2019s eligible losses, as required, by the amount of reimbursements received from the USDA\u2019s Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).", "The Congress is considering legislation that would strengthen two of the lending policies that expose the government to risk. In February 1996, the Senate passed a bill that generally would prohibit USDA from making farm program loans, including emergency loans, to borrowers whose debts have been forgiven\u2014a proposal similar to one made by USDA. This bill would also restrict a borrower\u2019s outstanding emergency disaster loan principal to a maximum of $500,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lending Requirements Are Not Followed", "paragraphs": ["Reviews by FSA and USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) noted weaknesses in FSA\u2019s emergency loan lending practices. Among other things, these reviews found that FSA field officials do not always receive accurate information in determining applicants\u2019 loan eligibility.", "To determine whether its field offices are complying with its lending requirements, FSA conducts Coordinated Assessment Reviews (CAR). For fiscal years 1992 through 1995, FSA completed CARs of 369 emergency loans. As shown in table 4, for at least 14 percent of the loans reviewed, FSA field offices had not verified information on the level of an applicant\u2019s disaster loss, debt, or income before approving the loan. While FSA considers noncompliance rates of more than 15 percent to be unacceptable, any noncompliance increases the government\u2019s financial risk. FSA officials noted, however, that in times of certain natural disasters, such as the Midwest flooding in 1993, the need to assist people quickly sometimes takes priority over following every detailed lending requirement.", "The OIG also found problems with lending practices. According to December 1994 and March 1995 reports, six of seven emergency loans reviewed in Wisconsin and Illinois were overstated because they were not based on the most current and accurate information available at the time of the loan closings. Specifically, six borrowers received loans totaling about $100,000 more than they were entitled to receive because FSA approved the loans on the basis of information about the borrowers\u2019 eligibility that FSA believed to be accurate but later found to be in error. In commenting on a draft of this report, FSA officials told us that they verified the information when they approved the loans, but the information changed before they closed the loans. Furthermore, according to these officials, their current standards do not require them to reverify information that is provided by other USDA agencies, such as the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Few Borrowers Use Insurance to Protect Their Property", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that subsidized crop insurance, compared to other forms of federal assistance such as loans and direct payments, is an efficient and equitable method of providing disaster assistance. Although we did not perform a detailed analysis of why borrowers did not obtain insurance, FSA county officials reported that most borrowers who chose not to purchase insurance did so because they did not consider coverage to be cost-effective. Our sample of loans made during fiscal years 1992 through 1994, before recent crop insurance reform legislation provided coverage at minimal cost, indicates that very few borrowers obtained insurance to protect their crops against losses resulting from natural disasters, even though insurance was frequently available.", "More specifically, we estimate that about 96 percent of the emergency loans made during fiscal years 1992 through 1994 covered crop losses, 4 percent covered real property losses, and 8 percent covered losses of other property, including livestock. In most cases, crop insurance coverage was available to the borrowers either through FCIC or other sources. However, as shown in table 5, the borrowers frequently did not purchase coverage, even when both options were available. The table also shows that a smaller percentage of the borrowers rejected hazard insurance.", "The following example illustrates a situation in which a borrower did not obtain crop insurance:", "An Iowa corn and soybean farmer, whose emergency loan application showed annual nonfarm income of $34,500 and about $8,000 in cash and certificates of deposits, did not obtain either FCIC or other crop insurance, even though both were available. The farmer lost $64,090 in crops as a result of flooding in 1993 and received approximately $21,000 in USDA disaster assistance, as well as an emergency loan for $34,480 in 1994. As of January 1995, this borrower was delinquent on the emergency loan payments. FCIC coverage would have cost $1,151 and paid the borrower about $15,200 for crop losses.", "According to FSA county officials, most borrowers did not buy insurance because they did not consider coverage to be cost-effective. The Food Security Act of 1985 makes applicants ineligible for emergency crop loss assistance if federal crop insurance was available to them and they did not purchase it for crops planted or harvested after December 31, 1986. This eligibility requirement has had little impact, however, because it has been waived in most years by subsequent disaster legislation enacted to minimize the economic hardships that some farmers might face in the absence of federal assistance. These waivers have not been targeted to grant relief to selected types of borrowers. Rather, the waivers have been made available to all who were interested in obtaining emergency loans in a particular year.", "The crop insurance reform legislation enacted in 1994 may increase the use of crop insurance among those seeking USDA benefits, such as emergency loans, and decrease the availability of ad hoc disaster assistance for crop losses. The Federal Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994, which became effective in 1995, generally conditions the receipt of USDA benefits, including emergency loans and price support benefits, upon an applicant\u2019s having obtained at least the minimum level of crop insurance available under the act, known as catastrophic risk protection, at a cost ranging from $50 to $600 for a borrower. The 1994 act also made the passage of agricultural disaster assistance legislation more difficult.", "Apart from crop loss insurance, the Congress is now considering legislation that may increase the use of hazard insurance by farmers. The agricultural credit legislation passed by the Senate in 1996 would prohibit USDA from making emergency loans to farmers or ranchers unless the applicants had hazard insurance that insured their property at the time of the loss. The level of insurance needed to satisfy this requirement would be determined by the Secretary of Agriculture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s emergency loan program has lost billions of dollars in debt that has not been repaid, and it stands to lose billions more, given the characteristics of the borrowers currently holding emergency loans.

However, these changes would not correct the weaknesses stemming from FSA\u2019s cash flow lending policy.", "The 1994 insurance reform legislation strengthens the requirement that farmers have insurance in order to receive federal assistance, including emergency loans. In most years, the Congress has waived similar requirements for obtaining emergency loans, reflecting its desire to assist farmers suffering from the economic consequences of natural disasters. The Congress has, historically, granted waivers to all farmers who sought loans within a given year. Continued use of this blanket type of waiver may contribute to concerns about equity. For example, borrowers who, on a one-time basis, neglected to obtain insurance, would be treated in exactly the same way as borrowers who have repeatedly chosen not to obtain insurance and have relied, instead, on federal assistance to cover their losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to the Secretary of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["We continue to believe that our 1989 recommendation to USDA to strengthen its cash flow lending policy has merit.

These options could include (1) prohibiting borrowers who have previously been granted insurance waivers from receiving additional waivers and/or (2) reducing the amount of an emergency loan to exclude the value of the proceeds that would have been available if the borrower had chosen to purchase the required insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to FSA for its review and comment.
