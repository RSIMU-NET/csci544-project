This report addresses (1) savings and other benefits the FSSI program has achieved, and (2) lessons identified and incorporated into OFPP's category management initiative. GAO analyzed FSSI spending, savings, and adoption data for all seven active FSSIs for fiscal years 2011 through 2015; reviewed OMB, OFPP, Leadership Council, and GSA strategic sourcing and category management guidance; and interviewed GSA and FSSI program officials and OFPP staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2011 through 2015, federal agencies reported spending almost $2 billion through the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiatives (FSSI) GAO reviewed and reported an estimated total of $470 million in savings. Federal agencies' low use of the FSSIs, however, diminished the potential savings that could have been achieved. For example, in fiscal year 2015, federal agencies spent an estimated $6.9 billion on the types of goods and services available through these FSSIs. Of this amount, $4.5 billion was considered \u201caddressable\u201d and could have been spent through the FSSIs, but just $462 million was. While total savings reported for fiscal year 2015 came in at $129 million\u2014a savings rate of 28 percent\u2014had all of the agencies directed their addressable spending through FSSIs, up to $1.3 billion in savings could have been achieved, assuming the same savings rate. See figure.", "GAO found that FSSI use has been low, in part, because Leadership Council agencies, a cohort of large federal agencies responsible for FSSI governance, directed only 10 percent of their collective spending to the FSSIs. FSSI guidance requires agencies to develop plans to transition from existing agency vehicles to FSSIs, but Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFFP) staff and General Services Administration (GSA) officials stated such plans were not collected or used to monitor FSSI use. Ensuring agencies submit these plans and monitoring them is consistent with internal control standards to evaluate and hold agencies accountable for performance.", "OFPP's category management initiative largely incorporates key lessons learned from the FSSIs into guidance, such as addressing small business concerns and obtaining data on prices paid. OFPP, however, has not yet ensured that agency-specific targets and performance measures for adoption of FSSI and category management solutions are set. Until OFPP takes action to do so, it is at risk of agencies underutilizing existing FSSI and category management solutions and, in turn, of diminished cost savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To increase potential savings, GAO is making 6 recommendations, including that OFPP ensure agencies submit transition plans, monitor their use, and ensure agency specific targets and performance metrics to measure adoption of FSSI and category management solutions are set.

In 2005, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) tasked the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy (OFPP) to identify commodities (goods and services)  to be purchased more effectively and efficiently through strategic  sourcing. In response, the General Services Administration (GSA) and  Department of the Treasury established the Federal Strategic Sourcing  Initiative  (FSSI) program to address government-wide opportunities to  strategically source commonly purchased goods and services and  eliminate duplication of efforts across agencies.

This approach includes strategic sourcing, but also  includes a broader set of strategies, such as developing common  standards in practices and contracts, and improving data analysis and  information sharing to better leverage the government\u2019s buying power and  reduce unnecessary contract duplication and yield other benefits. Under  the category management initiative, federal procurement spending is  organized into 10 common categories such as information technology  (IT), travel, and construction, which, according to OFPP, altogether  accounted for $275 billion in fiscal year 2014 federal spending. Each  category is led by a team of senior government executives who is to  develop a government-wide strategic plan for smarter buying with clear  metrics and outcomes. Category management is also a Cross-Agency  Priority (CAP) goal.", "Given the potential savings that could be achieved with category  management, you asked us to examine the FSSI program and lessons  learned.

For the GSA FSSIs which report spending based on vendor reported  transactional data, we obtained documentary and testimonial evidence on  the internal controls used by vendors, the FSSI teams, and the FSSI  Program Management Office to ensure the accuracy of the spending  data. For three of the six GSA FSSIs, we also collected and reviewed a  non-generalizable sample of transactional data reports. For Information  Retrieval, we reviewed quarterly spending reports and interviewed  relevant officials about the process used to collect and review data. We  determined that the spending data for the GSA FSSIs were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes but that the spending data for Information  Retrieval lacked internal controls, were inconsistent, and contained  errors. As a result, the Information Retrieval data were not sufficiently  reliable and we excluded the information from our analyses.", "For savings data, we reviewed the methodologies used by each FSSI to  calculate savings and compared them with savings principles approved in  2014. Each of the current GSA FSSIs uses transactional data to calculate  the difference between a baseline unit price and the FSSI price.  Information Retrieval does not calculate savings based on changes in  price, but rather, reports administrative savings as discussed later in the  report. Due in part to the inconsistent spending data, we were also not  able to independently  verify the savings data reported for Information  Retrieval and did not include these figures in our report. We also collected  and reviewed data on FSSI adoption, as well as OMB and GSA efforts to  obtain agency commitments to use the FSSIs and increase FSSI  adoption. We interviewed OMB and GSA officials to identify factors that  explain agency adoption of the FSSIs. We also interviewed GSA  procurement officials about the factors affecting their use of the FSSIs  and obtained documents from the FSSIs explaining why certain agencies  did not use specific FSSIs, but we did not interview officials from the  largest and highest spending procurement agencies responsible for FSSI  approval and oversight regarding the factors affecting their respective  agencies\u2019 use of the seven FSSIs we reviewed.

A strategic sourcing effort begins after an opportunity is identified,  usually through a spend analysis. Spend analyses provide knowledge  about how much is being spent for given products and services, who the  buyers and suppliers are, and where opportunities exist for leveraged  buying and other tactics to save money and improve performance. Based  on such analysis, organizations evaluate and prioritize commodities for  strategic sourcing.", "In 2013, we identified five foundational principles critical to carrying out an  effective strategic sourcing approach: maintaining spend visibility,  centralizing procurement, developing category strategies, focusing on  total cost of ownership, and regularly reviewing strategies and tactics.  Within those principles, leading companies highlighted the importance of  identifying the most cost effective sourcing vehicles, clearly defining and  communicating policies in order to eliminate unapproved purchases, or  \u201crogue buying,\u201d and ensuring that spending goes through approved  contracts. Taken together, these principles enable companies to identify  market trends, share knowledge about suppliers, make more informed  contracting decisions, and take advantage of opportunities to save money  and buy more efficiently.

In  response to OMB direction, the Department of the Treasury and GSA,  with support from OFPP, partnered to launch the FSSI program in  November 2005 to strategically source commonly purchased products  and services. The FSSI program was chartered under the purview of the  Chief Acquisition Officer\u2019s Council and the Strategic Sourcing Working  Group with OFPP ultimately responsible for providing oversight and  guidance as well as ensuring the overall effectiveness of the program.  The Working Group, comprised of representatives of various agencies,  was responsible for vetting and approving initiatives and sourcing  strategies, and establishing standards, processes, and policies. The FSSI  Program Management Office within GSA was established to support the  Working Group and coordinate the efforts of the agencies designated as  executive agents to implement individual  FSSI initiatives; provide  guidance and oversight; review information and recommendations; and  makes strategic program decisions.", "In December 2012, OMB issued guidance that formalized a governance  structure, provided additional requirements, and identified key  characteristics of federal strategic sourcing efforts. For example, key  characteristics included the use of tiered pricing or other appropriate  strategies to reduce prices as cumulative sales volume increases, and  contractual requirements with vendors to provide sufficient pricing, usage,  and performance data to enable the government to improve commodity  management practices on an ongoing basis. Noting that the majority of  federal spending is driven by a small number of large agencies, OMB  established the Strategic Sourcing Leadership Council (Leadership  Council) and called on the seven largest and highest spending agencies  and the Small Business Administration to take a leadership role on  strategic sourcing. The Leadership Council is chaired by the  Administrator of OFPP and comprised of representatives from the  Departments of Defense (DOD), Energy, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs; GSA; the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA); and the Small Business  Administration. See appendix IV for key provisions from the 2012 OMB  strategic sourcing memorandum.", "The Leadership Council is expected to propose plans and management  strategies to maximize the use of strategic sourcing efforts. For example,  in 2013, the Leadership Council established a three step key decision  point process for developing, approving, and overseeing the FSSIs which  is described in GSA\u2019s FSSI guidance. The Leadership Council must  provide approval at each step in order for a prospective FSSI to progress  through the strategic sourcing process and obtain the requisite  designation. Figure 1 summarizes the key decision point process.", "For the first key decision point, any interested agency can present a high  level opportunity analysis for a commodity which they believe may be a  FSSI candidate. If the Leadership Council approves the candidate at the  first key decision point, a commodity team is formed to develop and refine  the commodity strategy and develop a solution strategy. If the Leadership  Council approves the second key decision point, the commodity team is  allowed to execute the strategy. After execution, the commodity team is to  summarize the solution and assess success. If the new solution proves  valuable, then it is approved at the third decision point and given \u201cFSSI\u201d  designation and, it is to become mandatory to the maximum extent  practicable. Because the key decision point process is relatively new, it  has not been fully applied to all of the current FSSIs in our review. For  example, Janitorial and Sanitation Supplies and Maintenance, Repair,  and Operations Supplies are listed on GSA\u2019s FSSI website although they  have not been formally approved as FSSIs at the third key decision point.", "After determining the scope and the total government-wide spending on  the commodities covered by the proposed solution, the commodity team  is to refine the scope by establishing a baseline for the amount of  spending that can potentially be addressed by the solution. This baseline,  referred to as addressable spend, is to be used to measure FSSI  adoption by calculating the amount of actual spending through the FSSI  compared to the total addressable spend and is required for approval at  the second key decision point. Addressable spend may identify some  spending as non-addressable to accommodate agency needs or unique  circumstances such as existing agency contractual arrangements where  termination costs would be prohibitive and legislative or other authorities  unique to an agency. If an agency seeks to exclude a portion of spending  from the addressable spend total, the agency must provide the basis for  the exclusion to the commodity team. If resolution is not reached at the  commodity team level, the request for exclusions will be presented to the  Leadership Council for discussion and resolution.", "Using the approved addressable spend as a baseline, Leadership Council  agencies are required to provide the lead agency with non-binding  commitment letters stating an agency\u2019s intended volume of purchases  through the proposed solution, for purposes of negotiation and pricing,  prior to award. These letters do not obligate the agency to use a solution  if, for example, the pricing, terms, and conditions, are not aligned with  expectations. Nonetheless, the lead agency is to describe how each  Leadership Council agency will transition from existing vehicles to the  new solution. The lead agency is also responsible for ongoing  management of the FSSI including keeping prices competitive, monitoring  vendor performance, tracking agency adoption, and managing to  performance metrics including savings and small business achievement  against benchmarks, among other things. According to OMB\u2019s  addressable spend guidance, identifying addressable spend, determining  conditional commitment levels, and measuring adoption rates are critical  to the success of strategic sourcing.", "Further, the Leadership Council is to continuously monitor information on  performance and promote agency adoption, among other things. To  assist their effort, GSA established the FSSI Program Management Office  to monitor overall FSSI program usage for all commodities, to collect and  analyze performance data, and to provide an assessment to the  Leadership Council. The office is also tasked with disseminating best  practices, providing guidance on performance measures and data  collection, and recommending improvements to the FSSIs.", "In addition to formalizing the governance structure for government-wide  strategic sourcing efforts, OMB also identified an interim CAP goal for  strategic sourcing in February 2012. CAP goals were introduced in the  fiscal year 2013 federal budget and focused on 14 major issues including  strategic sourcing. The strategic sourcing CAP goal statement for fiscal  years 2013 and 2014 directed agencies to increase their use of FSSI  vehicles by at least 10 percent in both fiscal years 2013 and 2014.

We also reported that the program faced key challenges in  obtaining agency commitments to use new FSSIs and in increasing the  level of agency spending directed through FSSI vehicles. Further, we  found that the FSSI program had not yet targeted any of the  government\u2019s 50 highest-spend products and services for strategic  sourcing. As such, we concluded that the focus only on low-risk, low- return efforts diminished the government\u2019s ability to fully leverage its  enormous buying power and achieve other efficiencies. To help ensure  that government-wide strategic sourcing efforts further reflect leading  practices, we recommended that OMB and OFPP issue an updated  memorandum or other directive to federal agencies on calculating savings  and establish metrics to measure progress toward goals; and direct the  FSSI program to assess whether each top spend product and service  government-wide is suitable for an FSSI, with a plan to address those  products or services that were suitable for strategic sourcing. OMB and  OFPP implemented our recommendation in part by establishing the  Leadership Council to lead efforts to increase the government-wide  management and sourcing of goods and services.

We found that GSA  generally considered small businesses and small disadvantaged  businesses, but lacked data and performance measures.

Consistent with OMB guidance and  to track the effect of strategic sourcing on small businesses, we  recommended that the Administrator of GSA establish performance  measures on the inclusion of small businesses in strategic sourcing  initiatives. In response to this recommendation, GSA issued guidance in  April 2015 that provided information on how to determine baseline data  for small business participation in strategic sourcing initiatives and annual  requirements for assessing small business participation relative to that  baseline. Moreover, the guidance requires a corrective action plan if a  strategic sourcing initiative falls below the baseline for two consecutive  quarters. GSA also created a strategic sourcing template to track baseline  small business participation and monitor the change in small business  spending for each individual strategic sourcing initiative, as required by  OMB. To help ensure that agencies are tracking the effect of strategic  sourcing on small businesses, we recommended that OFPP monitor  agencies\u2019 compliance with the requirement to maintain baseline data and  performance measures on small business participation in strategic  sourcing initiatives.

Had agencies spent the entire $4.5 billion of addressable spending  through the FSSIs and achieved a similar savings rate of 28 percent, we  estimate that up to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015 savings could have  been achieved (see figure 3).", "We identified several factors that contributed to low utilization including  weaknesses in OFPP and Leadership Council oversight and various  factors unique to the individual FSSIs. For example, in fiscal year 2015,  the seven large procurement agencies within the Leadership Council  reported spending $268 million through the FSSIs, less than 10 percent of  the $2.8 billion that GSA estimated was the combined addressable  spending for those agencies during the same period. In 2012, OMB  directed Leadership Council agencies to promote, to the maximum extent  practicable, strategic sourcing practices within their agencies including  issuing and enforcing mandatory use policies for government-wide  solutions, such as the FSSIs. FSSI guidance on the key decision point  process requires information from each Leadership Council agency  concerning how each Leadership Council agency will transition from  existing vehicles to the FSSIs. While some Leadership Council agencies  provided commitment letters and issued mandatory use policies for  FSSIs, most that did used the FSSIs far less than their letters suggested  and none of the FSSIs included individual agency transition plans from  Leadership Council agencies to increase FSSI adoption as required. In  addition, according to OFPP staff and GSA officials, neither OFPP nor the  Leadership Council revisited those commitments or held agencies  accountable for meeting them or provided monitoring to ensure that  transition plans from existing agency vehicles to the FSSIs were provided.  Standards for internal control in the government highlight the need to  enforce accountability by evaluating performance and holding  organizations accountable.", "Similarly, for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, OMB established new measures  for the strategic sourcing CAP goal to include Leadership Council agency  adoption of the FSSIs, but did not establish targets and performance  measures either at the aggregate or agency level, as discussed later in  the report. OFPP staff reported that the Leadership Council agencies  provided input into spending projections for fiscal years 2015 and 2016  which are being used for internal management purposes although the  Leadership Council agencies did not, at an aggregate level, meet their  spend targets in fiscal year 2015. As of the first quarter of fiscal year  2016, FSSI CAP goal measures are no longer tracked although existing  FSSIs will not expire for years to come. In addition to accountability,  federal internal control standards call for agencies to monitor and  evaluate results. OFPP in coordination with the Leadership Council,  however, had not set targets and measures for individual Leadership  Council agencies to gauge progress over time and hold individual  Leadership Council agencies accountable for results. Until the Leadership  Council and OFPP create a means to incentivize Leadership Council  agencies to use FSSIs that they help create and approve, and measure  results against individual agency targets, the FSSIs are at risk of  continuing to experience low use and by extension missed opportunities  for savings.", "Additionally,  several of the individual  FSSIs experienced challenges that  affected, to varying degrees, their efforts. For example:", "The Office Supplies FSSI estimated Leadership Council agencies\u2019  addressable spend to be $410 million, but these agencies only spent  $55 million through the FSSI in fiscal year 2015. Office Supplies  officials attributed the low spending in fiscal year 2015 to delays  during the acquisition process which compressed the amount of  overlap between the second and third generation of the FSSI. As a  result, when the FSSI contracts were awarded and unsuccessful  offerors filed bid protests, the FSSI experienced a 6-month lapse in  service. For example, the Air Force, with an estimated $36 million in  addressable spending in fiscal year 2015, suspended its mandatory  use policy due to the protests and did not reinstate it until March 2015.  Office Supplies officials also attributed low spending through the FSSI  to an overall decline in the government-wide market for office supplies  which according to officials has shrunk from $1.5 billion in fiscal year  2012 to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015 due to factors such as  increased telework and reductions in agency procurement budgets.", "The Wireless FSSI estimated that the combined addressable spend of  Leadership Council agencies to be nearly $700 million, but they only  spent $12 million through the vehicle in fiscal year 2015. The Wireless  program reported that although six Leadership Council agencies were  buying off the vehicle, there had been few large enterprise buys due  to the limited ability of agency acquisition teams to centralize the  funding which pays for these service plans and devices. Wireless  program officials also noted that they did not fully take into account  when existing agency contracts would expire. For example, the  program noted that several agencies needed up to 3 years to migrate  from existing agency contracts to the FSSI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSSIs Generally Incorporated OMB Characteristics to Help Foster Savings", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, OMB identified the minimum characteristics of strategic sourcing  vehicles to increase savings and enable the government to improve its  commodity management practices.

Transactional data refers to the information generated when the  government purchases goods or services from a vendor including specific  details such as descriptions, part numbers, quantities, and prices paid for  the items purchased. The collection and use of transactional data is  foundational to strategic sourcing as it allows the government to perform  active commodity management, monitor pricing changes to ensure that  the benefits of strategic sourcing are maintained, and to calculate savings  based on changes in price.

Prior to the creation of the  Leadership Council in 2012, legacy FSSIs including the first and second  generations of Office Supplies and Domestic Delivery Services, as well as  Print Management, calculated savings based on methods approved by  their respective commodity teams in accordance with guidelines approved  by the Strategic Sourcing Working Group, the governance body which  preceded the Leadership Council. These approaches generally consisted  of comparing prices offered under the FSSI program to the prices offered  under GSA\u2019s Federal Supply Schedule program. Office Supplies  officials acknowledged that this approach may have overstated savings  by four to five percent because the schedule price represents a ceiling  price that GSA negotiates with vendors and not the prices paid which can  include additional discounts. Further, as we have recently reported,  published schedule rates may not represent the actual prices paid under  the schedule which can include additional discounts and better pricing  due to competition at the task order level.", "In 2012, we recommended that OFPP issue direction to federal agencies  that includes guidance on calculating savings. In 2014, the Leadership  Council approved savings principles to include savings based on price,  cost avoidance, and administrative savings. According to the guidance,  the baseline unit price used to calculate price savings should be either the  current schedule lowest quartile price, the lowest price on any contract for  similar quantity, or a lower price available from an existing vehicle or data  source identified by a commodity team member and agreed to by the  Leadership Council. Further, savings methods are to be proposed and  approved as part of second key decision point and approved by the  Leadership Council.", "Office Supplies, now in its third generation, has used the transactional  data it has collected over time to refine its savings methodology and  reduce price variation. Office Supplies program officials told us that  starting in fiscal year 2014, the Office Supplies FSSI began to use the  lowest quartile price from the schedule as a baseline when four or more  price points are established. Office Supplies also uses transactional data  to reduce price variance for identical goods. Referred to as the dynamic  pricing model, the program requires vendors to offer prices that fall within  10 percent of the lowest price offered. As an example, an FSSI official  stated that an identical toner cartridge might be listed for anywhere from  $100 to $300. Dynamic pricing reduces this variability  by capping the  price for goods offered to no more than 10 percent greater than the  lowest price. GSA officials emphasized that it took 3 years for the Office  Supplies FSSI to collect and standardize sales data to include part  numbers, manufacture name, and quantity which has allowed them to  implement a more precise methodology. A senior GSA official reported  that the Janitorial and Sanitation Supplies FSSI and the Maintenance,  Repair, and Operations Supplies FSSI will both adopt the lowest quartile  method of calculating savings and dynamic pricing once they have the  data to do so.", "Wireless FSSI officials told us that they collect and analyze transactional  data from vendors, and can share the average discount available through  the FSSI, but that contractual terms prohibit the FSSI from sharing the  actual prices paid that ordering agencies pay which are often lower,  unless a federal agency requests such information from the FSSI. The  officials told us that this restriction inhibits the FSSI\u2019s ability to  demonstrate to agencies savings that could be achieved through use of  the FSSI. Until this issue is addressed by clarifying the contract terms, the  program will remain limited in its ability to make a business case to  agencies on the potential cost savings from using the Wireless FSSI.", "Information Retrieval officials reported that they collect transactional data  from a limited number of vendors, but do not use that data to report  spending or as the basis to calculate savings based on changes in price.  Information Retrieval officials reported that after obtaining Leadership  Council approval for FSSI designation, the program negotiated  transactional data reporting requirements with 5 of its 69 vendors, those  with aggregate sales above $3 million as of fiscal year 2014. Because  Information Retrieval does not collect transactional data from all of its  vendors, it lacks the data needed to calculate savings based on price.  Rather, Information Retrieval calculates and reports administrative  savings based on a methodology it developed which estimates savings  based on assumptions about the number of hours a typical agency would  spend on similar procurements and agency labor rates for contracting  staff. While the Leadership Council recognizes administrative savings in  its 2014 savings principles, we excluded Information Retrieval\u2019s savings  figures from our report in part because of inconsistencies and errors in its  spending data that impeded our ability to independently  verify the savings  data.", "The GSA FSSI Program Management Office is responsible for ensuring  oversight and support of the FSSIs including monitoring compliance with  FSSI standards.

OFPP staff  agreed with our assessment that a key lesson learned from the FSSIs is  that stronger enforcement mechanisms are needed to increase agency  compliance with category management plans and goals. A senior OFPP  staff noted that the early premise of strategic sourcing was that agencies  would readily use new strategic sourcing vehicles, but that level of use  has been inconsistent.", "OFPP staff stated that individual  category management memorandums  include stronger compliance requirements and mechanisms than were  present under the FSSI program to drive compliance. For example,  OMB\u2019s October 2015 policy for workstations, June 2016 policy for  software licenses, and August 2016 policy for mobile devices all direct  agency Chief Information Officers to take specific actions within their  agencies using new authorities and responsibilities provided to them  under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act to  improve their agencies\u2019 IT management policies and practices. For  example, OMB\u2019s October 2015 memorandum on workstations includes  several provisions intended to encourage agency compliance such as  prohibiting agencies from issuing new solicitations for laptops and  desktops and directing them to leverage three existing solutions. It also  directs agency Chief Acquisition Officers and Chief Information Officers to  work together to develop transition and implementation plans for both the  technical and acquisition aspects of the policy. Specifically, Chief  Acquisition Officers were directed to provide baseline spend data for  purchases made through the approved vehicles and identify when the  agency will phase out existing contracts for workstations and transition to  the preferred vehicles. Chief Information Officers were directed to develop  implementation instructions for the use of standard configurations, the  prohibition on new awards, oversight, compliance, and other  management measures. Table 5 describes some of the key provisions of  OMB\u2019s category management policy for workstations.", "OMB\u2019s June 2016 memorandum on enterprise software and August 2016  memorandum on mobile devices and services follow a similar approach  to the workstation policy in that they specify key responsibilities and  requirements. For example, the Enterprise Software Category Team was  established under category management and is co-managed by GSA,  DOD, and OMB to guide the development of government-wide software  license agreements for mandatory agency use. Under the policy, OMB is  to encourage or direct use of existing best in class software licensing  agreements. The memorandum further requires agencies to develop  implementation plans, in accordance with guidance, to address how  agencies will move from their existing agreements to those mandated  under category management. Agencies must also justify and obtain  approval to pursue new agreements that overlap or conflict with the  mandated agreements. Similarly, the mobile devices and services  memorandum directs agencies to baseline their usage for devices and  services; reduce the number of contracts for mobile devices and services  and transition to a government-wide solution or solutions; and modify  demand management practices to optimize plan pricing and device  refresh schedules.", "To help drive category management success, OFPP staff told us that they  anticipate requiring the use of specific vehicles or agreements and  requiring agencies to develop transition and implementation plans in  subsequent category management memorandums. OFPP staff  acknowledged that the IT category is unique in that it leverages efforts  under the PortfolioStat initiative as well as the authorities provided to  Chief Information Officers under the Federal Information Technology  Acquisition Reform Act. However, OFPP staff indicated that OFPP can  exercise its authority provided to the Administrator under the Office of  Federal Procurement Policy Act to direct agencies to take certain  actions. For example, under the Act, the Administrator is to provide  overall direction of procurement policy and promote economy and  efficiency in federal procurements.", "Additionally,  OFPP is also reviewing and updating its business case  guidance for new interagency and agency-specific acquisitions to ensure  awareness and appropriate coordination with the Leadership Council.

The purpose of the policy is to  ensure that the expected return from investment in a contract or  agreement is worth the effort and cost associated with planning,  awarding, and managing a new vehicle, and to address unjustified  duplication among contracts. Under the revised policy, category  managers will be responsible for reviewing new agency business cases  and advising the Leadership Council of potential duplication or  opportunities for new or expanded strategic sourcing initiatives.", "While OFPP\u2019s October 2015 workstation memorandum established  aggregate goals for adoption, it did not establish specific adoption goals  or targets for individual  agencies to achieve. Specifically, the  memorandum calls for civilian agencies to increase their spending  through Leadership Council-approved vehicles to 75 percent by the end  of fiscal year 2018, but it did not provide specific targets for the  Leadership Council agencies to achieve. Further, the overarching  guidance to implement category management\u2014the Leadership Council  charter as updated in April 2016 and the Leadership Council\u2019s May 2015  category management guidance\u2014do not specify the extent to which  specific Leadership Council agencies should adopt category management  solutions.

Moreover, the May 2015 guidance  explains that Leadership Council agencies should advocate for advancing  category management initiatives and increasing adoption of solutions, but  does not include a process to specify a minimum level of use or other  targets and performance measures by agency. Moreover,  standards for  internal control in the government highlight the need to evaluate  performance and hold organizations accountable. Given the low use of  FSSIs by the Leadership Council agencies, OFPP may be at risk of  repeating that outcome unless it clarifies expectations and establishes a  process in guidance regarding agency-specific targets and measures for  Leadership Council agency adoption of category management initiatives  and FSSIs and ensures that these targets and measures are set."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Lesson Learned: Targets and Measures to Increase Agency Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Our work found that the FSSI program lacked agency-specific targets and  measures to increase agency accountability.

But unlike leading  companies that use their strategic sourcing vehicles 90 percent of the  time, federal agencies directed less than 10 percent of their spending on  the goods and services offered under the FSSIs, resulting in a missed  opportunity to potentially have saved billions of dollars over the last 5  years. In fiscal year 2015 alone, GSA reported that agencies saved $129  million out of the $462 million spent through the FSSIs, representing a  savings rate of 28 percent. Had agencies spent the entire amount of  addressable spending through the FSSI and achieved a similar rate of 28  percent, we estimate that up to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2015 savings  could have been achieved. The low usage rates for the FSSI program are  not unique. For example, our prior work found that agencies managed  only 10 to 44 percent of their IT services spending through their preferred  strategic sourcing contracts.", "OFPP\u2019s category management initiative dwarfs the size and scope of the  FSSI program by targeting two-thirds of federal spending. Given the scale  of category management, it is imperative that the lessons of implementing  the FSSIs are learned and addressed. Chief among those lessons is that  the large procurement agencies that make up the Leadership Council and  govern the FSSI and category management initiatives must themselves  be more accountable for achieving results. These agencies fell short in  using the very same FSSIs that they approved, including providing  transition plans for how agencies would migrate to use of FSSI solutions  as required under FSSI guidance. While many of the lessons learned  during the course of the FSSI program have been reflected in the initial  category management efforts, neither the April 2016 Leadership Council  charter nor the Leadership Council\u2019s May 2015 category management  guidance establish expectations and a process for setting agency-specific  targets and measures to assess adoption of solutions and performance.  Moreover, since the category management CAP goal provides regular  updates on progress, agency accountability for results would be  enhanced by including agency specific progress against targets and  performance measures. Given the low agency usage of the FSSIs,  without such actions, and ensuring these targets and measures are set,  OMB, and specifically the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, will lack  the means to monitor progress and hold large procurement agencies  accountable for using existing FSSIs or best in class solutions identified  under subsequent category management efforts. Considering the  magnitude of spending targeted by category management, taking these  actions will increase the likelihood that category management will deliver  on its promise to substantially change the federal procurement landscape  and generate substantial savings and other benefits for federal  customers.", "At a tactical level, the GSA FSSI Program Management Office is  responsible for ensuring oversight of the FSSIs, including monitoring  compliance with FSSI standards. In two cases, more engagement by the  office may be beneficial. For example, the Library of Congress\u2019s  Information Retrieval FSSI collects transactional data to only a limited  extent and does not use that data to calculate savings. GSA FSSI  Program Management Office officials, however, indicated that they had  not, until recently, engaged with the Information Retrieval FSSI to ensure  compliance with FSSI standards. Similarly, the Wireless FSSI negotiated  contractual terms that limit its ability to share actual prices paid with other  federal agencies. Collecting and using transactional data and sharing  prices paid information across federal agencies are key provisions of  strategic sourcing and are identified in current strategic sourcing  guidance.

We also received technical comments  from OMB and GSA which we incorporated, as appropriate.", "OMB did not provide written comments on the draft report, but in oral  comments, OMB staff generally agreed with our recommendations and  identified several actions to address them. OMB actions include in part,  the October 2016 issuance of a draft circular for public comment to  implement category management practices.", "Regarding our recommendation that OFPP ensure that transition plans  are submitted and monitored as required by guidance, OMB staff agreed  that transition plans should comply with guidance. OMB staff indicated,  however, that retroactively requiring agencies to submit FSSI transition  plans is not needed because all of the FSSIs are currently being  evaluated against category management best in class criteria as part of  the migration to a category management approach. OMB staff stated that  for example, the Office Supplies FSSI has been designated as a best in  class solution, which will require agencies to submit transition plans. The  OMB draft circular on category management also provides that OMB will  issue policy on the agency migration process to best in class solutions.", "We believe these actions, if implemented, meet the intent of our  recommendation. Given that transition plans were also required under  FSSI guidance but were not submitted, it will be important for OMB to  assure that agencies follow through on submitting required plans going  forward.", "Regarding our second and third recommendations that OFPP establish  an expectation that Leadership Council agencies develop agency-specific  targets for use of solutions approved and revise guidance to establish a  process for setting targets and performance measures, OMB staff agreed  with the need for agency-specific targets for use of best in class solutions.   OMB staff noted that they plan to establish targets by large spend  agencies for best in class solutions and update category management  governance and reporting procedures and processes as needed. OMB  staff also agreed that Leadership Council agency progress toward  implementing category management should be tracked and measured.  Both OMB staff and the draft circular on category management indicate  that spend under management will be used as the principal measure by  which OMB will assess adoption of category management.  As noted  earlier in our report, spend under management tracks progress in areas  such as data and metrics to monitor adoption of category management  practices. OMB staff indicated that they plan to evaluate at least annually  agencies\u2019 spend under management results, which includes agency  adoption of best in class solutions, and then review with agency leaders  progress toward meeting goals.", "Regarding our fourth recommendation to report on agency specific  targets and metrics as part of the category management CAP goal, OMB  staff indicated that results achieved relative to CAP goal targets will be  reported on a quarterly basis on Performance.Gov. In addition, OMB will  track agency spend through best in class contracts and these data will  likely be used as an internal category metric and shared with the  agencies. Taken together, these actions are responsive to our  recommendations; however, given the low use of the FSSIs, OMB should  continue to carefully monitor category management implementation as it  moves forward and ensure that OFPP uses the planned targets and  measures noted above to hold agencies accountable for individual  results. In short, greater accountability can lead to increased savings.", "In GSA\u2019s written comments, GSA agreed with our recommendations to  provide oversight and support to the Information Retrieval FSSI and  determine whether the Wireless FSSI should modify contract terms to  better share prices paid data. GSA plans to conduct a gap analysis of the  Information Retrieval FSSI and its compliance to FSSI standards to  include determining unmet practices required for collecting and using  transactional data for the FSSI program management office government- wide oversight and reporting, as well as providing the Library of Congress  with FSSI best practice tools and resources related to collecting  transactional data and calculating savings.

This report addresses (1) the extent  to which savings and other benefits have been achieved by the FSSI  program, and (2) lessons, if any, from the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy (OFPP) and General Services Administration (GSA)  implementation of the FSSI program and the extent to which those  lessons have been incorporated into OFPP\u2019s category management  initiative.", "We focused our review on seven FSSIs that were active between fiscal  years 2011 and 2015: (1) Office Supplies; (2) Domestic Delivery Services;  (3) Print Management; (4) Wireless; (5) Maintenance,  Repair, and  Operations Supplies; (6) Janitorial and Sanitation Supplies; and (7)  Information Retrieval. This covers the period since we last assessed FSSI  implementation through the last full year for which FSSI spending and  savings data was available. GSA is the executive agent for all the FSSIs  except Information Retrieval which is administered by the Library of  Congress. We excluded the Telecommunications Expense Management  FSSI which ceased operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014  because limited data on the program were available. FSSIs establish  multiple award blanket purchase agreements, basic ordering agreements,  and/or indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, through which  federal agencies may obtain the specific goods and services they need.", "To determine the extent to which savings and other benefits have been  achieved through the seven FSSIs, we collected and reviewed agency  reported data on spending, savings, and adoption. We also reviewed  FSSI guidance on the key decision point process and program  documents, and interviewed officials responsible for each of the FSSIs  under our review as well as the FSSI Program Management Office within  GSA which is responsible for monitoring overall FSSI program  performance and usage regardless of the lead agency managing the  initiatives.", "For government-wide and addressable spending data, we reviewed  agency reported data, acquisition plans, business case analyses, and key  decision point documents prepared for Leadership Council review. We  also reviewed relevant Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and  GSA guidance and interviewed FSSI program officials to clarify our  understanding of how each program developed its government-wide  spending figures. These figures were typically based on a variety of data  sources including data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation, and purchase card data. Since government-wide spending  figures are estimates and not actual performance, we reviewed the  methods used to formulate them and found them to be reasonable and  the data sufficiently reliable for providing appropriate context for the  actual spending that went through the FSSI vehicles. We also reviewed  program documents and interviewed FSSI program officials to better  understand the basis and rationale for spending excluded from  addressable spending. This baseline, referred to as addressable spend,  is to be used to measure FSSI adoption by calculating the amount of  actual spending through the FSSIs as a percentage of the total  addressable spending through the FSSIs and is required for approval at  the second key decision point.", "For FSSI spending and savings data, we took a number of steps to  assess the reliability of the data reported by each FSSI. For the GSA  FSSIs which report spending based on vendor reported transactional  data, we obtained documentary and testimonial evidence on the internal  controls used by vendors, the FSSI teams, and the FSSI Program  Management Office to ensure the accuracy of the spending data  reported. For three of the six GSA FSSIs, we also collected and reviewed  a non-generalizable sample of transactional data reports. The Library of  Congress does not report spending through the Information Retrieval  FSSI based on vendor reported data although it collects a limited amount  of such data, and we took similar steps to assess their reliability. We  determined that the spending data for the GSA FSSIs were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes but that the spending data for Information  Retrieval lacked internal controls, were inconsistent, and contained  errors. As a result, the Information Retrieval spending data were not  sufficiently reliable and we excluded it from our analyses.", "For savings data, we reviewed the methodologies used by each FSSI to  calculate savings and compared them with the savings principles  approved by the Leadership Council in 2014, which include price savings,  cost avoidance, and administrative savings. Each of the GSA FSSIs uses  transactional data to calculate the difference between a baseline unit  price and the FSSI price. While the FSSIs varied in the precision of their  methods, we verified that they generally complied with Leadership  Council guidance for calculating savings and confirmed with GSA officials  that these methods were approved by their respective commodity teams  or the Leadership Council. Information Retrieval does not calculate  savings based on price, but rather reports administrative savings. While  guidance allows FSSIs to report administrative savings, due in part to the  inconsistencies and errors in the Information Retrieval\u2019s spending data,  we could not independently  verify the savings data reported and did not  include those figures in our report.", "For adoption rates reported by the FSSIs, we focused our analysis on  fiscal year 2015. We verified that the adoption rates reported by GSA  were calculated correctly based on the addressable and actual spending  reported. We also performed our own calculations to determine the  adoption rates for Leadership Council agencies based on the addressable  and actual spend data reported by GSA.", "To better understand the factors that explain agency adoption of the  FSSIs, we reviewed guidance on the key decision point process which  was established by the Leadership Council in 2013 as a framework for  the development, approval, and oversight of the FSSIs. We identified  requirements for Leadership Council agencies to provide the FSSIs with  commitment letters based on their addressable spending and to issue  mandatory use policies as appropriate and assessed the extent to which  those agencies actually used the FSSIs in accordance with the  commitments they provided and mandatory use policies they  implemented. We also interviewed GSA procurement officials about the  factors affecting their use of the FSSIs and obtained documents from the  FSSIs in which agencies explained their rationale for not using specific  FSSIs, but we did not interview officials from each agency within the  Leadership Council regarding the factors affecting their respective  agencies\u2019 use of the seven FSSIs we reviewed. In addition, we  interviewed FSSI program officials and senior leadership officials within  GSA and OMB about Leadership Council agency adoption of the FSSIs,  as well as government-wide adoption more generally.", "We also assessed the extent to which the seven FSSIs incorporated key  characteristics identified by OMB to include the collection and use of  transactional data, the calculation of savings based on changes in price,  and the use of tiered pricing to reduce prices as cumulative sales volume  increases. For each FSSI we interviewed FSSI program officials and  collected program documents such as acquisition plans, contract  documents specifying contractual terms requiring vendors to provide  certain data and information on the use of tiered discounts.", "To determine what lessons, if any, from OFPP and GSA implementation  of the FSSI program and the extent to which those lessons have been  incorporated into OFPP\u2019s category management initiative we reviewed  the seven current FSSIs and conducted interviews with GSA and Library  of Congress officials responsible FSSI implementation, as well as GSA  officials and OFPP staff responsible for oversight. Based on this review,  we identified lessons learned which can be generally applied to category  management and corroborated our findings with GSA officials and OFPP  staff responsible for the implementation and oversight of the FSSI  program to determine which lessons were key. We also reviewed  category management policy and guidance and independently  assessed  the extent to which these lessons had been incorporated.
