GAO was asked to determine (1) which federal agencies are involved in efforts to promote the use of woody biomass, and actions they are undertaking; (2) how these agencies are coordinating their activities; and (3) what agencies see as obstacles to increasing the use of woody biomass, and the extent to which they are addressing these obstacles."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most woody biomass utilization activities are implemented by the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Energy (DOE), and the Interior, and include awarding grants to businesses, schools, Indian tribes, and others; conducting research; and providing education. Most of USDA's woody biomass utilization activities are undertaken by the Forest Service and include grants for woody biomass utilization, research into the use of woody biomass in wood products, and education on potential uses for woody biomass. DOE's woody biomass activities focus on research into using the material for renewable energy, while Interior's efforts consist primarily of education and outreach. Other agencies also provide technical assistance or fund research activities. Federal agencies coordinate their woody biomass activities through formal and informal mechanisms. Although the agencies have established two interagency groups to coordinate their activities, most officials we spoke with emphasized informal communication--through e-mails, participation in conferences, and other means--as the primary vehicle for interagency coordination. To coordinate activities within their agencies, DOE and Interior have formal mechanisms--DOE coordinates its activities through its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, while Interior and BLM have appointed officials to oversee, and have issued guidance on, their woody biomass activities. In contrast, while the Forest Service recently issued a woody biomass policy, it has not assigned responsibility for overseeing and coordinating its various woody biomass activities, potentially leading to fragmented efforts and diluting the impact of these activities. The obstacles to using woody biomass cited most often by agency officials were the difficulty of using woody biomass cost-effectively and the lack of a reliable supply of the material; agency activities generally are targeted toward addressing these obstacles. Some officials told us their agencies are limited in their ability to address these obstacles and that incentives--such as subsidies and tax credits--beyond the agencies' authority are needed.

Federal researchers estimate that from 90 million to 200 million acres of  federal lands in the contiguous United States are at an elevated risk of fire  because of abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation, and that these  conditions also exist on many nonfederal lands. Addressing this fire risk  has become a priority for the federal government, which in recent years has  significantly increased funding for fuels reduction. Fuels reduction is  generally done through prescribed burning, in which fires are deliberately  lit in order to burn excess vegetation, and mechanical treatments, in which  mechanical equipment is used to cut vegetation. Figure 1 shows before and  after photos of a site that was thinned to reduce the risk of fire.", "Although prescribed burning is generally less expensive than mechanical  treatment, prescribed fire may not always be the most appropriate method  for accomplishing land management objectives\u2014and in many locations it is  not an option, either because of concerns about smoke pollution or  because vegetation is so dense that agency officials fear that a prescribed  fire could escape and burn out of control. In such situations, mechanical  treatments are required, generating large amounts of wood\u2014particularly  small-diameter trees, limbs, brush, and other material that serve as fuel for  wildland fires.", "Woody biomass can be put to many uses. Small logs can be peeled and used  as fence posts, or can be joined together with specialized hardware to  construct pole-frame buildings. Trees also can be milled into structural  lumber. Using computer-operated equipment, some mills can manufacture  lumber from logs as small as 4 inches in diameter. Other wood products  such as furniture, flooring, and paneling can be produced. Woody biomass  also can be chipped for use in paper pulp production and other uses\u2014for  example, a New Mexico company combines juniper chips with plastic to  create a composite material used to make road signs.", "Woody biomass also can be converted into other products, including liquid  fuels such as ethanol and other products such as adhesives. Finally, woody  biomass can be chipped or ground for energy production\u2014for example, to  fire power plants, or produce steam or hot water heat for manufacturing  processes or buildings. Figure 2 shows a trailer full of wood chips being  emptied into a container at a California power plant fueled by woody  biomass; figure 3 shows chips ready to be fed into a boiler.", "Citing biomass\u2019s potential to serve as a source of electricity, fuel,  chemicals, and other materials, the President and the Congress have  encouraged federal activities regarding biomass utilization\u2014but until  recently, woody biomass received relatively little emphasis.

To discuss woody biomass developments  and to coordinate their efforts, the departments established an interagency  Woody Biomass Utilization Group, which meets quarterly.", "Another interdepartmental collaboration effort is the Joint Biomass  Research and Development Initiative, a joint USDA and DOE grant  program authorized under the Biomass Research and Development Act of  2000. The program provides funds for research on biobased products. In  fiscal year 2004, the two departments awarded $25 million to 22 projects,  and cost sharing by private sector partners raised the value of the projects  to nearly $38 million. While the program generally promotes all forms of  biomass rather than targeting woody biomass, in 2004 the grant solicitation  included woody biomass as an area of emphasis and, according to a USDA  official, 10 projects emphasizing or incorporating woody biomass were  funded that year, for a total of about $7.7 million. For example, the Hayfork  Biomass Utilization and Value Added Model for Rural Development project  in California received about $503,000 to support the design and early  implementation phases of a biomass utilization facility, including a log sort  yard, small log processor, and wood-fired electrical generation plant.  Another California project, the Small-Scale, Biomass-Fired Gas Turbine  Plants Suitable for Distributed and Mobile Power Generation, received  about $242,000 to evaluate the economic benefits of using forestry residues  for generating power in small-scale power plants.

Activities to be performed by the  association under the agreement include organizing national and regional  workshops on woody biomass utilization and developing outreach  materials to stimulate investment in small wood industries and bioenergy.", "USDA, DOE, and Interior also participate in joint activities at the field level.  NREL and the Forest Service have collaborated in developing and  demonstrating small power generators that use woody biomass for fuel.  These generators, known as BioMax units, are being demonstrated at  several sites, including a high school in Walden, Colorado, and a furniture- making business at the Zuni Pueblo in New Mexico. Figure 4 shows the  BioMax 15 power generator.", "The Forest Service also collaborates with Interior in awarding and funding  grants under the Fuels Utilization and Marketing program, a jointly funded  grant program targeting woody biomass utilization efforts in the Pacific  Northwest. Another collaborative effort at the field level involves a Forest  Service rural community assistance coordinator specialist in the Southwest  Region and includes officials from BLM and the state of New Mexico, as  well as environmental group and utility company representatives. In  addition to studying woody biomass availability and conducting market  assessments, this biomass working group is proposing policy changes  favorable to woody biomass. It also has studied barriers to biomass use and  provided input on project designs so that projects are less likely to be  challenged.", "The agencies also are collaborating with state and local governments to  promote the use of woody biomass. The Forest Service, NREL, and BLM  entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Jefferson County,  Colorado, in 2004 to study the feasibility of developing an electricity  generating facility using woody biomass from forest thinning projects  intended to reduce the risk of wildland fire. In addition to the agencies and  Jefferson County, the agreement included the Colorado State Forest  Service and a local energy utility. In its January 2005 feasibility study, the  partnership reported that about 166,000 tons of biomass would be available  each year from forest thinnings and new construction waste. With this  development, the local energy utility announced that it would consider  converting a boiler at one of its plants to burn biomass to generate steam  heat for downtown Denver buildings.", "Another example of federal agencies working with local governments  involves a power plant in Canon City, Colorado, that uses coal and wood  chips to fire its boilers. The power plant announced in January 2005 that it  plans to sell renewable energy certificates to help recover costs associated  with introducing the renewable fuel source. The wood chips used in the  power plant are produced by forest-thinning operations conducted by BLM,  the Forest Service, and state and local governments, while the  environmental and market analysis for the project was co-funded by DOE.", "Yet another example of local cooperation involves a January 2005  \u201cdeclaration of cooperation\u201d signed in central Oregon by officials from the  Forest Service, BLM, state and tribal government, the timber industry, and  environmental groups.

A Forest Service official told us  that similar levels of effort existed in 2001 and 2002, but that the level of  effort in 2004 declined because of reduced funding levels. The Forest  Service currently is preparing a report summarizing the activities carried  out under EAP grants nationwide.", "Forest Service officials told us that EAP grant funds are distributed among  Forest Service regional and national units, which in turn allocate the funds  according to regional or national priorities, respectively. For example, the  Northern and Intermountain Regions decided to use their regional EAP  allocations not only to fund Economic Recovery\u2014a Forest Service  program providing financial and technical assistance to improve the  economic, environmental, and social conditions of rural communities\u2014but  also to fund two regional woody biomass grant programs, one focusing on  using small-diameter wood to create specialty products such as flooring,  paneling, and wood-plastic composites and the other focusing on biomass  utilization for energy production. This second program, known as the  Fuels for Schools program, provides grant funds to help public schools  retrofit their fuel and gas heating systems to woody biomass heating  systems that reduce heating costs. The Darby School District in Montana,  for example, provides heat to three schools with wood burning boilers; this  conversion reduced its fuel bill by about 43 percent during the first year of  operation. The project requires about 500 tons of woody biomass per year,  the byproduct of about 50 acres\u2019 worth of fuel reduction treatments,  according to project officials. As of December 2004, according to Forest  Service officials, three Fuels for Schools projects (including the Darby  School District) had been completed, and about 20 schools had completed  engineering analyses and were preparing to apply for grant funds. Figure 5  shows the automated wood chip conveyor installed to provide fuel to the  boiler as part of the Darby School District project.", "The Forest Service has created an additional grant program in response to  a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005,  authorizing up to $5 million for grants to create incentives for increased use  of biomass from national forest lands. A congressional committee report  accompanying the act directed the Forest Service \u201cto develop this program  with the clear intent to make grants that will result in increased  commercial use of biomass products, and which will thereby result in  reduced overall hazardous fuels program costs.\u201d Specific Forest Service  goals for the grant program are to (1) help reduce management costs by  increasing the value of biomass and other forest products generated by  hazardous fuel treatments, (2) create incentives and reduce the business  risk for increased use of biomass from national forest lands, and (3)  institute projects that target and help remove economic and market  barriers to using small-diameter trees and woody biomass. Grants will be  awarded for up to 3 years in amounts from $50,000 to $250,000, and will  require a 20 percent match on the part of grantees; applications are due  May 16, 2005, with awards to be announced by June 1, 2005.", "Two other USDA agencies---the Cooperative State Research, Education,  and Extension Service (CSREES) and USDA Rural Development\u2014maintain  grant programs that potentially include woody biomass utilization  activities.

CSREES also provides  grants to states for research under the McIntyre-Stennis Act of 1962, which  was enacted to promote forestry research by state colleges and  universities. Projects can fall into one of eight areas listed in the act, one of  which is the utilization of wood and other forest products. However, this  grant program does not emphasize wood products over the other areas,  and a CSREES official told us that most funded projects address issues  other than woody biomass.", "USDA Rural Development oversees grant and loan programs targeting  renewable energy, potentially providing support to woody biomass  utilization activities. Within Rural Development, the Rural Business- Cooperative Service oversees the renewable energy grant program  authorized by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002,  emphasizing renewable energy systems and energy efficiency among rural  small businesses, farmers, and ranchers. In September 2004, $22.8 million  was awarded to a total of 167 recipients; however, most grants were  directed toward projects using wind power or agricultural biomass rather  than woody biomass. Also within Rural Development, the Rural Utilities  Service maintains a loan program for renewable energy projects.

The agency does have an internal group\u2014the Woody Biomass  Utilization Team\u2014that meets to discuss woody biomass issues, but this  group does not have responsibility for implementing the policy. And  according to some Forest Service officials we spoke with, agency woody  biomass activities have been opportunistic, arising from local awareness of  and interest in the issue rather than from a national strategy for  approaching the issue. One Forest Service headquarters official told us that  the agency\u2019s woody biomass activities have been \u201ca grassroots effort on the  part of those who have a real burning passion for improving utilization.\u201d   However, according to this official, individuals who do not share that  passion have not been involved in woody biomass because there has been  no central requirement or strategy for addressing the woody biomass issue.  Another headquarters official told us that the extent to which woody  biomass has been addressed has depended on the knowledge, interest, and  availability of the local forest staff and the presence of local markets for  woody biomass. Several field officials we spoke with share this view; one  field official told us that there is a great deal of interest in woody biomass  technology on the part of field staff, but not much coordination and no  formal strategy, while another noted that woody biomass activities are  \u201clargely dependent on local risk taking.\u201d Yet another field official told us  that there is no coordinated approach within the Forest Service to woody  biomass; instead, determining what activities to undertake is left up to the  forests and ranger districts, and depends on local leadership.", "The Forest Service does have an individual, located within the agency\u2019s  State and Private Forestry branch, who generally serves as the agency\u2019s  primary point of contact for woody biomass utilization.

One  headquarters official within the agency stated that without stronger central  authority or a stronger woody biomass policy, the Forest Service will find it  difficult to effect change because while the agency\u2019s primary woody  biomass official can discuss technology, innovation, supply, and other  issues, he lacks the authority to influence land management practices.", "Two officials attributed the Forest Service\u2019s lack of a coordinated woody  biomass effort to the agency\u2019s decentralized culture, with autonomy at the  ranger district, national forest, and regional level. One official told us that  this culture serves the agency well for some purposes but works against the  agency when it tries to promote an idea or issue\u2014such as woody biomass  utilization\u2014that has not been widely emphasized. Another official noted  that each region in the Forest Service has considerable autonomy in  developing its own policies, setting its own priorities, and establishing its  own procedures, and that, while there is often value in having ideas  originate from the field, a more formalized structure is often more effective  at accomplishing overall agency objectives. According to this official, the  woody biomass issue has reached the stage where a formalized,  coordinated national strategy is appropriate.", "One official told us that the Forest Service\u2019s emphasis on fuel reduction  planning and implementation efforts under the National Fire Plan had  focused the agency\u2019s attention away from woody biomass. The 10-year  comprehensive strategy for implementing the National Fire Plan contains  four overall goals:  (1) improving fire prevention and suppression, (2)  reducing hazardous fuels, (3) restoring fire-adapted ecosystems, and (4)  promoting community assistance, which includes woody biomass  utilization. This official told us that the Forest Service\u2019s emphasis on goals  1 and 2 has reduced its ability to focus on the other goals, and \u201cnow that the  biomass is starting to pile up,\u201d it is time for the Forest Service to begin  focusing on woody biomass.

Officials  told us that the products that can be created from woody biomass\u2014 whether wood products, liquid fuels, or energy\u2014often do not generate  sufficient income to overcome the costs of acquiring and processing the  raw material. For example, a Forest Service researcher in California  estimated that the cost of generating electricity from woody biomass was  about 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour, including costs to harvest, transport, and  process the material, as well as operations, maintenance, and capital  amortization costs. However, the same researcher noted that at the time of  his study, the wholesale price paid for power in California was 5.3 cents per  kilowatt hour\u2014meaning that, without receiving additional income for their  electricity, producers of woody biomass-generated electricity would lose  about 2.2 cents for each kilowatt hour generated if they sold their  electricity on the wholesale power market.", "One factor contributing to the difficulty in using woody biomass cost- effectively, according to 23 officials, is the cost incurred in harvesting and  transporting woody biomass. For example, one Forest Service official  pointed out that while a single 18-inch-diameter tree of a given height  contains the same volume as 20 4-inch-diameter trees of the same height, it  is much more expensive to harvest 20 trees than 1. Two officials told us that  when the end use for woody biomass calls for chipped or ground  material\u2014for example, for use in power plants\u2014it is often more efficient  to chip the material in the forest and haul the chips to the plant rather than  hauling the unprocessed woody biomass. However, these officials noted  that the vehicles typically used to haul chips\u2014known as chip vans\u2014cannot  navigate many forest roads, which were designed for logging trucks.  Because hauling material in smaller vehicles is more costly, this adds to the  difficulty in using the material cost-effectively. Officials pointed out that  small installations located close to woody biomass sources will have lower  transportation costs, enhancing their ability to use the material cost- effectively. Schools and other buildings located in communities near  forests are thus particularly well-positioned for woody biomass use,  according to officials\u2014especially if these buildings are heated with natural  gas or fuel oil, because once buildings convert their heating infrastructure  to accept woody biomass, they can be heated at a lower cost by using  woody biomass than by using natural gas or fuel oil. However, officials also  noted that such installations consume relatively small amounts of woody  biomass.", "Five officials primarily involved in research and development noted the  costs involved in converting woody biomass to liquid fuels such as ethanol.  For example, the chemical makeup of wood makes it more difficult and  expensive to convert into ethanol than other substances such as corn,  according to officials. Thus, although ethanol represents a potentially  large opportunity for utilizing woody biomass (because of the demand for  transportation fuels), the availability of cheaper raw materials such as corn  presents an obstacle to its use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Obstacles Cited Include the Lack of a Reliable Supply of Woody Biomass from Federal Lands and Internal Barriers to Effective Promotion of Woody Biomass", "paragraphs": ["Of the 44 officials we spoke with, 22 told us that even if cost-effective  means of using woody biomass were found, the lack of a reliable supply of  woody biomass from federal lands presents an obstacle because business  owners or investors will not establish businesses without assurances of a  dependable supply of material. Officials identified several factors  contributing to the lack of a reliable supply, including the lack of widely  available long-term contracts for forest products, environmental  opposition to federal projects, and the shortage of agency staff to conduct  activities. Regarding long-term contracts, projects that use stewardship  contracting authority may include contracts of up to 10 years\u2014potentially  stabilizing the long-term supply of woody biomass\u2014whereas projects  conducted outside of this authority must use contracts of a shorter  duration. Agency officials cited one stewardship project\u2014the White  Mountain project in Arizona, which has a 10-year duration and is expected  to treat 50,000 to 250,000 acres\u2014as an example of the benefits of  stewardship contracting in stabilizing supply. An official told us that two  manufacturers are negotiating with the contractor to establish  manufacturing plants using woody biomass removed as part of the project.  According to this official, without the assurance of supply offered by a  long-term contract, these manufacturers would not have shown interest.  However, another official pointed out that Forest Service stewardship  contracts must be approved at the regional level, making their use more  cumbersome than other contract types.", "Adding further to the uncertainty of supply, 10 officials told us that  environmental opposition poses an obstacle\u2014for example, in the form of  appeals and litigation that delay planned projects. Finally, according to five  officials, staffing constraints make accomplishing projects in a timely  manner difficult even without external opposition; two Forest Service  officials told us that even if long-term contracts were available and  environmental opposition were not a factor, the lack of staff still hampers  the agency\u2019s ability to implement projects.", "Six officials cited internal agency barriers that hamper agency  effectiveness in promoting woody biomass utilization. Prior to the Forest  Service\u2019s January policy statement on woody biomass, one Forest Service  official told us that the lack of a strong policy stating that using woody  biomass is preferable to piling and burning it hampered the agency because  no incentive existed for \u201cfield staff to think creatively about how to move   to potential users.\u201d This official told us that even if the  Forest Service received no payment for the material, putting it to use was  better than piling and burning it\u2014which also brings no revenue\u2014and this  preference should be embedded in policy. Two Forest Service officials also  noted that the agency\u2019s mechanisms for designing and implementing  projects were still geared toward larger, merchantable timber to the  detriment of woody biomass. One official stated that \u201cthe Forest Service  needs to improve its capabilities to design treatments, contracts, and  agreements that will encourage utilization of smaller diameter material,\u201d  while another official echoed this view by stating that \u201ctimber operations   account for the bulk of institutional  knowledge about material removal.\u201d Finally, several officials stated that  federal agencies have not been effective in communicating the potential  benefits of fuel reduction. According to the officials, fuel reduction would  reduce fire suppression and rehabilitation costs, avoid damage to  watersheds, avoid smoke pollution, and the like. Officials told us that  communicating these benefits could reduce opposition to fuel reduction  projects, which was cited as a factor in the uncertainty of woody biomass  supply.", "Other officials cited the lack of agency commitment to the issue. For  example, a BIA official told us that BIA has not provided the resources and  structure required for promoting and developing woody biomass utilization  projects. Six officials told us that more funds should be devoted to  researching new or less expensive ways to use woody biomass in order to  overcome economic obstacles to its use. And two Forest Service officials  cited that agency\u2019s lack of a woody biomass policy as an obstacle to  effective agency promotion of woody biomass utilization.", "A variety of other obstacles were noted as well. One official told us that  some large facilities such as prisons could use woody biomass to generate  their own electricity for less than the cost of electricity sold by electrical  utilities. However, such facilities generally would need to have electricity  available from the grid in the event that their own generators were  unavailable\u2014and, according to this official, utilities can charge rates for  this electricity (known as standby power) that are equal to the rates  charged for electricity that is actually delivered. In other words, for every  hour the utility is prepared to deliver electricity to the facility, the utility  charges a fixed portion of the rate that would have been charged had the  electricity actually been delivered\u2014100 percent of the rate in some cases,  according to this official. As a result, installations would pay not only the  costs of generating their own electricity but also the standby power rates  charged by the utility\u2014costs that, when combined, may exceed the cost of  simply purchasing electricity from the utility. Withdrawing from the  electricity grid entirely can be problematic as well; this official stated that  utilities can charge fees\u2014known as exit fees\u2014for doing so.", "Another obstacle cited by officials is the lack of a local infrastructure for  harvesting, transporting, and processing woody biomass, including loggers,  mills, and appropriate equipment for treating small-diameter material.   Three Forest Service officials we spoke with told us that in some cases the  decline in federal logging has left areas without any infrastructure at all,  while in other cases the infrastructure that is left is equipped to handle  large trees rather than woody biomass. According to officials, contractors  need equipment designed for handling woody biomass rather than larger  trees in order to cost-effectively harvest and transport the material.  However, contractors may not have the capital to purchase this new  equipment, and may be unable to obtain loans without assurances of a  long-term supply of woody biomass."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Efforts Are Generally Targeted toward the Obstacles Identified, but Officials Cited the Need for Additional Actions Such As Subsidies and Tax Credits", "paragraphs": ["The agency activities we identified were generally targeted toward the  obstacles agency officials cited.

A Forest Service official in New Mexico has been meeting with  environmental groups to try to obtain consensus on the need for forest- thinning activities. Obtaining consensus can reduce the likelihood of  environmental opposition, making Forest Service projects easier to  accomplish and allowing a steadier supply of biomass.

According to several officials, the obstacles to using woody biomass cost- effectively are simply too great to overcome by using the tools\u2014grants,  outreach and education, and so forth\u2014at the agencies\u2019 disposal. One  official stated that \u201cin many areas the economic return from smaller- diameter trees is less than production costs. Without some form of market  intervention, such as tax incentives or other forms of subsidy, there is little  short-term opportunity to increase utilization of such material.\u201d Three  officials stated that subsidies have the potential to reduce the per-acre cost  of thinning, because if there is a market for woody biomass, contractors  will be willing to harvest the material for a lower fee, knowing that they can  recoup some of their costs by selling the material. According to these  officials, subsidies thereby create an important benefit\u2014reduced fire risk  through hazardous fuels reduction\u2014if they promote additional thinning  activities by stimulating the woody biomass market.", "Officials told us that tax incentives, subsidies, and low-interest loans may  serve to stimulate infrastructure for harvesting, processing, and  transporting woody biomass, and that such assistance should target not  only larger plants and facilities but smaller operators as well. Harvesters  and loggers, for example, could use the assistance to purchase the  expensive equipment and machinery required to treat woody biomass and  thus help to build the required infrastructure.", "It is not only federal officials who hold this view. In testimony before the  Congress, the owner of a sawmill that uses woody biomass to generate  electricity for the mill stated that woody biomass-to-energy does not work  as a stand-alone enterprise. According to this individual, \u201cThe cost  structure associated with removing woody biomass from the forest,  hauling the material to a facility and converting the fiber into a product  suitable for electricity production is prohibitive without massive  subsidization.\u201d", "Others see a need for state requirements that utilities procure or generate a  portion of their electricity by using renewable resources, known as  renewable portfolio standards. Forest Service officials in the Southwest  Region are encouraging states in the region to enact renewable portfolio  standards that include a woody biomass component. These officials are  urging states to go beyond simply requiring electricity from renewable  resources and require, or provide favorable treatment of, electricity  generated from woody biomass produced as part of forest restoration  projects. The official primarily responsible for this effort stated that \u201cusing  this biomass source will help lower costs and allow restoration activities to  occur on many more thousands of acres than present budgets allow.\u201d", "Agency officials generally did not specify the level of subsidies or tax  credits they thought necessary, and not all officials believe that these  additional steps are efficient or appropriate. One official told us that,  although he supports these activities, the creation of tax incentives and  subsidies would create enormous administrative and monitoring  requirements. Another official stated that although federal policy changes  such as increased subsidies could address obstacles to woody biomass  utilization, he does not believe they should be made. Rather, he believes  that research and development efforts, combined with market forces, will  eventually result in \u201cequilibrium\u201d\u2014in other words, in woody biomass  utilization finding its appropriate level. If cost-effective uses of woody  biomass can be found, its utilization will increase. Yet another official  stated that while production tax credits or subsidies may be successful in  getting businesses or industries started, he does not believe they are  sustainable over the long term. In addition, he is reluctant to create credit-  or subsidy-dependent businesses that would be at the mercy of the annual  appropriations cycle. Instead, market-driven solutions are more  appropriate\u2014for example, providing information to exploit the existing  market, or developing requirements or incentives (such as renewable  portfolio standards) that create a market on their own.", "Further, not all agree with the assumption that the market for woody  biomass should be expanded. One agency official told us he is concerned  that developing a market for woody biomass may result in overuse of  mechanical treatment (rather than prescribed burning) as the market  begins to drive the preferred treatment. In other words, given a choice  between mechanical thinning and prescribed burning, a forest manager  might choose mechanical thinning not because it was the most appropriate  tool for the project at hand but to satisfy the demand for woody biomass.  This official stated that \u201cif we do that, we are not being good stewards of  the land.\u201d", "Environmental group representatives also have urged caution in taking any  steps that expand the market for woody biomass. Representatives of one  national environmental group told us that relying on woody biomass as a  renewable energy source will lead to overthinning, as demand for woody  biomass exceeds the supply that is generated through responsible thinning.  They also questioned the incentive to create or reconstruct roads in the  forests to facilitate inexpensive transportation of woody biomass because  they believe doing so introduces unwanted side effects\u2014increased erosion  and sedimentation, increased access to areas of the forest that previously  had no roads, and increased maintenance and enforcement costs for the  federal agencies. Finally, the representatives questioned the true energy  gain of using woody biomass\u2014that is, whether the energy involved in  harvesting, transporting, and processing woody biomass exceeds the  energy contained in the biomass\u2014stating that \u201cit doesn\u2019t make economic  sense to burn expensive gasoline to get cheap biomass.\u201d However, they  stated that the benefits gained by using the biomass rather than piling it in  landfills or leaving it in the forest where in some locations it would  continue to pose a significant fire risk may justify any net energy loss."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The amount of woody biomass resulting from increased thinning activities  could be substantial, adding urgency to the search for ways to use the  material cost-effectively rather than simply disposing of it. The use of  woody biomass, however, will become commonplace only when users\u2014 whether small forest businesses or large utilities\u2014can gain an economic  advantage by putting it to use. Federal agencies are targeting their activities  toward overcoming this and other obstacles\u2014for example, by providing  technical assistance and grant funds to businesses facing economic  challenges in using woody biomass. But some agency officials believe that  these efforts alone will not be sufficient to stimulate a market that can  accommodate the vast quantities of material expected.", "While additional key steps may be necessary at the federal and state levels,  we believe the agencies will continue to play an important role in  stimulating woody biomass use. However, while both DOE and Interior  have designated individuals or offices for coordinating woody biomass  activities, no individual or office within the Forest Service has been  similarly designated. Without an individual or office with responsibility for  overseeing and coordinating woody biomass activities within the agency,  the Forest Service can neither ensure its multiple activities contribute to  the agency\u2019s overall objectives nor assess the effectiveness of individual  activities. Further, by taking a piecemeal approach to the issue, the agency  risks diluting the impact of its activities because different agency units may  be emphasizing different priorities. Some local variation may be  appropriate\u2014to account for regional differences in infrastructure, for  example, or in forest type.
