Since its inception in 1974, PBGC's assets have grown from about $34 million to almost $80 billion in 2010, largely through assets received in plan terminations. Despite significant swings in PBGC's investment history, there has been little focus on the extent to which it has met its investment goals, the nature of its investment policies or how they compare with best practices in the industry. GAO examined (1) how PBGC's investment objectives have changed over time and the outcomes associated with those changes, (2) the performance of PBGC's investments, and (3) how well PBGC's investment policies and operations comport with best practices in the industry. To address these questions, GAO reviewed PBGC's investment policy statements and operational procedures; analyzed data on investments; and interviewed PBGC officials, officials from several state pension plans and foreign pension insurers, and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["PBGC's investment objectives and stated asset allocation targets have changed frequently in the last 8 years, alternating between more conservative and more aggressive approaches to investing. Yet these changes in stated objectives had only a moderate effect on PBGC's actual asset allocation because, for a variety of reasons, PBGC did not meet its targets. In our review of their investment history, we found that PBGC did not routinely monitor transaction costs related to its policy shifts and, at certain times, significant transaction costs were incurred. For example, we determined based on data obtained from PBGC's investment managers that nearly $75 million in transaction costs were incurred during the economic downturn which coincided with the period when the 2008 policy was being implemented and subsequently suspended. Using seven benchmarks, one of which was a Pension Protection Act benchmark that GAO constructed, GAO's analysis shows that PBGC's investments performed better than most benchmarks on an asset-only basis, but tended to underperform all seven of the benchmarks when returns were assessed together with the growth in liabilities. GAO notes that both analyses have limitations and can be seen by some experts as incomplete. However, GAO's method of analysis is consistent with how financial economics literature suggests investment performance analysis should be conducted. Finally, GAO's analysis found no apparent adverse effect on PBGC's investment performance as a result of changes in policy. PBGC's policy statements and operating procedures are incomplete and do not provide sufficient guidance to ensure sound implementation of its investment policies. The investment policies issued by PBGC's board for strategic guidance in the planning and execution of investments have generally lacked a number of provisions recommended by the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute; Independent Fiduciary Services; and other experts of sound investment management, such as the Government Finance Officers Association. Moreover, according to our review and based on interviews with PBGC staff, the policy statements have been insufficiently detailed to provide adequate guidance for staff. In addition, PBGC's Corporate Investments Department's staff have largely functioned without the benefit of fully-developed and documented operating procedures. Although PBGC has grown from a relatively small agency to one holding almost $80 billion in assets, its policies and procedures still reflect in many ways its small agency past. To ensure that PBGC can effectively and consistently meet its obligation to manage a fund of this size and its liabilities, PBGC's board and its management must enact better stewardship, standards, and procedures to ensure that PBGC can effectively and consistently meet its obligation to conduct the many investment related functions it performs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the PBGC and its board of directors (1) develop and maintain comprehensive investment policy statements and (2) develop a complete set of operating procedures and guidelines for its investment activities.

Created in 1974 as a federal guarantor of these plans, PBGC finances its  operations through insurance premiums paid by plan sponsors, funds  received from terminated pension plans, and money earned from the  investment of these funds. Despite PBGC\u2019s financial holdings of almost  $80 billion, the agency currently faces a cumulative deficit of more than  $23 billion. Alternating between more conservative and more aggressive  investment strategies, PBGC has revised its investment policy several  times since its inception. You asked us to study:    how PBGC\u2019s investment objectives have changed over time, whether  policy goals were met, and what impact have those changes had on  transaction costs;    how changes in investment policy have impacted investment returns; and    what methodology did PBGC use to execute investment policy changes  over the past 10 years and how well did PBGC comport with best practices  in the industry in terms of development, execution, and oversight of its  policies.", "To answer these questions, we collected and analyzed information using  several methods. To identify changes to PBGC\u2019s investment objectives,  policies, and associated costs, we examined the agency\u2019s investment  policy statements, interviewed agency staff responsible for implementing  them, and obtained data on costs from staff and transition managers. Our  analysis did not include PBGC\u2019s recently released investment policy  statement in late May 2011, since it was issued just after the completion of  our audit work.  To analyze the performance of PBGC\u2019s investments, we  also obtained PBGC data on assets and liabilities and conducted a  portfolio performance evaluation of PBGC\u2019s Single Employer Total Fund\u2019s  monthly returns from October 1976 to December 2009. This analysis  compared the fund\u2019s return performance to that of several benchmark  portfolios using a variety of portfolio performance statistics. To determine  how well PBGC comported with industry best practices regarding the  development, execution, and oversight of their policies, we reviewed  investment policy guidance from the Department of Labor, the Chartered  Financial Analyst Institute, and the Government Finance Officer\u2019s  Association. We then compared policy elements from such guidance with  PBGC\u2019s investment policies, and interviewed PBGC staff, a former PBGC  director, members of the Investment Advisory Committee, and board  representatives to obtain information about PBGC operations.  We also  interviewed and examined documents from domestic private and public  insurers, domestic pension plan sponsors, and foreign public insurers. For  additional discussion of our scope and methodology, see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) created  PBGC as a government agency to help protect the retirement income of  U.S. workers with private-sector defined benefit plans by guaranteeing  their benefits up to certain legal limits. PBGC administers two separate  insurance programs for these plans: a single-employer program and a  multiemployer program. The single-employer program covers about 34  million participants in approximately 26,000 plans. The multiemployer  program covers 10 million participants in another 1,500 collectively  bargained plans that are maintained by two or more unrelated employers.  If a multiemployer pension plan is unable to pay guaranteed benefits when  due, PBGC will provide financial assistance to the plan, in the form of a  loan, so that benefits may continue to be made up to the guaranteed  benefit limits. However, if the sponsor of a single-employer plan is in  financial distress and does not have sufficient assets to pay guaranteed  promised benefits, the plan will be terminated and PBGC will likely  become the plan\u2019s trustee, assuming responsibility for paying benefits to  participants as they become due, up to the guaranteed benefit limits. Most  of PBGC\u2019s $102.5 billion in liabilities are due to future benefit payments  owed to participants of underfunded plans terminated under the single- employer insurance program.", "To finance these liabilities, PBGC currently has approximately $80 billion  in assets. PBGC\u2019s funds primarily come from three sources: insurance  premiums paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans, assets acquired from  terminated plans, and investment income earned on these assets. For  example, in 2010 all plans insured by PBGC paid a total of approximately  $2.3 billion in premiums. In addition, PBGC took over the assets from 147  defined benefit plans in fiscal year 2010, which totaled approximately $1.8  billion. Finally, over the course of the same year, PBGC recorded $7.8  billion in earnings from its investment portfolio, including interest,  dividends, and capital gains.", "PBGC holds its assets in essentially two separate funds: the PBGC trust  fund and the PBGC revolving fund (see fig. 1). The PBGC Trust Fund  holds assets received from terminated plans and the return on investing  the assets held in the trust fund, while the PBGC Revolving Fund consists  of premium receipts and the return on investing the premium receipts.  Benefit payments and financial assistance are paid from the revolving  fund, and then the trust fund reimburses the revolving fund through a  proportional payment at least annually.", "PBGC has grown significantly since the end of its first year of operation.  As of June 30, 1975, the agency had $34 million in assets and $1.2 million in  liabilities. At the end of fiscal year 2010, however, the trust and revolving  funds combined contained about $80 billion in assets (see fig. 2), to cover  total liabilities of $102.5 billion, leaving a deficit of approximately $23  billion.", "PBGC is governed by a three-member board of directors, which consists of  the Secretary of Labor (Chair), the Secretary of the Treasury, and the  Secretary of Commerce. The board is responsible for policy direction and  oversight of PBGC\u2019s finances and operations. The board of directors is  responsible for establishing and overseeing the policies of the corporation,  including the approval of the corporation\u2019s investment policy statement.  Under its bylaws, the board is required to review the corporation\u2019s  investment policy statement at least every two years and approve the  investment policy statement at least every four years. Each board member  must designate an official (not below the level of an assistant secretary) to  support the board\u2019s oversight.  Board representatives are given the  authority to act for all purposes under the bylaws, subject to some  actions\u2014such as approving the corporation\u2019s investment policy  statement\u2014being ratified by the board members. The board members  often rely on these department representatives to conduct much of their  PBGC related work on their behalf.", "PBGC uses institutional investment management firms to invest its assets,  subject to the agency\u2019s oversight and in accordance with the investment  policy statement as approved by its board and applicable legal  requirements. For example, ERISA provides different requirements  concerning how the assets held in the revolving fund and the trust fund can  be invested. ERISA requires the PBGC Revolving Fund to be, in part,  invested in U.S. obligations.  PBGC has more flexibility to invest trust fund  assets in other investments, and, along with revolving fund investments, the  corporation\u2019s investment policy statement provides direction on how these  assets are to be invested. With respect to the trust fund, PBGC does not  determine the specific investments to be made, but instead relies on its  investment managers\u2019 discretion to invest a portion of the funds consistent  with the benchmarks and risk criteria provided to each investment manager.  When PBGC receives assets from terminated plans, PBGC determines  whether the assets fit into the agency\u2019s current investment policy objectives.  For incoming assets that do not fit with their current policy, PBGC uses  investment managers to liquidate them, as soon as practicable, and then  reinvests the proceeds into assets that do align with PBGC policy.", "In its role as an insurer, PBGC\u2019s responsibilities are similar to those of  other institutions that conduct such functions. However, the corporation  also faces structural challenges that are not shared by other insurers,  which gives the corporation less control over the terms by which it insures  pension plans and constrains its ability to manage its risk of loss (see table  1). For example, in contrast with information provided by pension insurers  in Canada and the Netherlands, PBGC tends to have less control over the  terms by which it insures pension plans. Only Congress, through  legislation, can change premiums or plan funding requirements for defined  benefit plans in the United States.", "Beginning in 2003, recognizing PBGC\u2019s long-term financial challenges, we  included PBGC\u2019s single-employer insurance program on our list of \u201chigh- risk\u201d programs needing attention and congressional action; in 2009, we  added PBGC\u2019s multiemployer program as a program of concern. Both  programs remain on our high-risk list today."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frequent Policy Changes Occurred, but Changes to Actual Asset Allocation Were Moderate", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s investment policy has changed frequently since 1990, alternating  between more conservative and more aggressive approaches to  investment. The frequent changes in policy have had a moderate impact on  PBGC\u2019s actual allocation of assets since 1976 because there were no  allocation targets in place prior to 1990 and the policy targets after that time  were rarely ever met. Meanwhile, the transaction costs for the reinvestment  of assets during each policy period have fluctuated with shifts in the market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Investment Objective Changes Have Had Moderate Effect on Actual Asset Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Since 1990, PBGC has shifted its investment policy five times. The shifts in  investment policy that occurred in 1990 and 2004 were aimed at strategies  that immunized against interest rate exposure by increasing the allocation  of fixed-income securities.  PBGC\u2019s investment policy was shifted in 2009 to  a more conservative strategy of taking on a higher allocation of fixed- income securities. In contrast, shifts in investment policy that occurred in  1994 and 2008 were aimed at strategies that maximized returns by  increasing the allocation of equities. Shifts in policy of this frequency are  thought to reflect an undisciplined approach to investing. Experts we  interviewed stated that a more disciplined approach would require that  PBGC change its investment policy no more than once every 5 to 7 years,  except to review the policy during unusual circumstances, such as the  recent market crash or when taking over the assets of a large terminated  plan. They noted that it can take up to 5 years for a policy to be fully  implemented and to have an impact that can be evaluated. Moreover, these  experts stated that a long-term and disciplined investment policy is needed  in order to minimize the costs associated with shifts in policy. Since 1990,  PBGC\u2019s investment policy was in place for more than 5 years only once\u2014 during the period from 1994 to 2004. All other policies were in place for  shorter periods, generally about 2 to 4 years (see fig. 3).", "PBGC\u2019s actual allocation of its total assets (both revolving fund and trust  fund combined) reflects these changes in policy to some extent, but the  impact has been tempered by a number of factors. First, PBGC must  comply with certain statutory investment restrictions. Therefore, because  PBGC only invest the assets of its revolving fund in U.S. obligations which  are fixed-income securities, accomplishing its investment policy goal is, in  effect, limited to reallocating the assets of its trust fund \u2014that is assets  acquired from terminated plans under PBGC trusteeship. Second, during  the period between 2004 and 2008, PBGC adopted the practice of using  only assets of newly terminated plans to move toward new allocation  targets, rather than reinvesting assets already in its trust fund. When in  place, this practice further limited the amount of assets PBGC could use to  meet its target allocations. Third, market conditions, at times, hindered  PBGC in reaching its allocation targets by reducing the overall value\u2014and  as a result, the proportion\u2014of assets invested in a particular sector.  Finally, the frequency with which allocation targets changed also affected  PBGC\u2019s ability to make significant changes in its allocation. During each  period a policy was in place, PBGC made progress toward reaching new  allocation targets with varying success before a new policy was adopted.", "In May 1990, PBGC adopted a new investment policy calling for a decrease  in the proportion of equities to no more than 35 percent of its portfolio.  This policy was initiated by PBGC\u2019s then newly appointed executive  director in response to both an increase in unfunded liabilities and to the  results of a commissioned study that examined PBGC\u2019s liabilities and  investment options. The study of PBGC\u2019s trust and revolving funds  together recommended that PBGC reduce its equity exposure and increase  its allocation in long-duration fixed-income assets. Accordingly, PBGC  adopted a new investment policy that focused on matching its assets with  its liabilities and targeted an asset allocation of no more than 35 percent in  equities and no less than 65 percent in fixed income. In 4 months, PBGC  decreased its equity allocation from 43 percent to 33 percent and was able  to maintain this allocation range throughout the period for which the 1990  policy was in effect.", "In October 1994, PBGC adopted a new investment policy that focused on  maximizing the return on its investments by investing more heavily in  equities in order to reduce the agency\u2019s deficit by achieving higher rates of  return. Although no explicit asset allocation was specified in the  investment policy statement, PBGC\u2019s 1994 annual report stated that, along  with the adoption of the new investment policy, the agency had raised its  ceiling for its equity allocation to 50 percent. The assets in PBGC\u2019s  revolving fund is, pursuant partially to statute and partially to PBGC  policy, invested only in U.S obligations which are fixed-income assets,  hindering PBGC\u2019s efforts to increase its overall equity allocation.  However, in the years that followed, the agency attempted to raise equity  levels by investing all its trust fund assets into equities. In this way, over  the course of fiscal year 1994, PBGC increased its actual equity allocation  from 17 percent to 30 percent. During the subsequent 7 years this policy  was in place, PBGC\u2019s equity allocation peaked in 1999 at 44 percent, and  over the period, averaged about 35 percent according to data provided by  the agency.", "In 2004, PBGC adopted a new investment policy that would, similar to the  1990 policy, match PBGC\u2019s assets to its liabilities by emphasizing fixed- income investments and limiting exposure to market risk. The 2004 policy  reduced the allocation target for equities down to the 15 to 25 percent  range and raised the allocation target for fixed-income securities to 75 to  85 percent. To implement this policy, however, PBGC\u2019s board directed  staff to use only assets acquired from newly terminated plans, rather than  to transition core trust fund assets already under management. As a result,  according to PBGC officials, the volume of assets available to transition  toward the target allocations was limited and the agency was not able to  lower its allocation of equities down to the target range during the time  this policy was in effect.", "In 2006, PBGC adopted a new policy as a result of its biennial review  process. It allowed PBGC to invest in international securities, a departure  from the past. The agency\u2019s overall investment policy, however, remained  the same, with equity allocation targets set at 15 to 25 percent and fixed- income allocation targets set at 75 to 85 percent. Despite this new policy,  once again, PBGC officials said that the agency did not receive enough in  newly trusteed assets to be able to shift its equity allocation down to this  target range. Also, during most of this period, the returns on PBGC\u2019s equity  investments outpaced those of its fixed-income investments, further  hindering the agency\u2019s attempt to reach this allocation target. Equities  were achieving returns of 11 to 17 percent in fiscal years 2006 and 2007,  while the returns of its fixed-income investments were around 1 to 3  percent annually. Hence, according to PBGC, the actual allocation hovered  between 27 to 32 percent in equities and 67 to 72 percent in fixed income  throughout this period.", "PBGC changed its investment policy again in 2008 with the goal of seeking  to maximize returns on its investment. To this end, PBGC adopted an  investment policy with target asset allocations of 45 percent in equities; 45  percent in fixed income; and 10 percent in alternative investments, such as  real estate and private equity. In addition, the policy called for expansion  into two new subclasses of fixed-income securities: high yield and  emerging market debt. In February 2008, when the policy was adopted, 28  percent of PBGC\u2019s assets were invested in equities. To move quickly  toward its newly adopted allocation targets, PBGC decided to abandon its  practice of relying only on newly acquired assets from terminated plans to  transitioning a portion of core trust fund assets as well. PBGC transitioned  nearly $5.7 billion from its existing trust fund investments in fixed-income  securities to equities. Despite these efforts, the financial crisis and a 35  percent decline in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index  between early February 2008 and May 2009 caused PBGC\u2019s actual equity  allocation to drop to as low as 23 percent during this period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "2009 to Present", "paragraphs": ["In May and June 2009, PBGC\u2019s three board members issued a resolution  instructing staff to cease implementing the 2008 investment policy.

Transactions already initiated were allowed to proceed, but no  new transactions were permitted until the board representatives issued  investment policy guidance in July 2009, since the board had not also  issued a new investment policy statement after it ceased the 2008 policy.  Instead, this new interim policy called for a return to the actual portfolio  composition as it was on March 31, 2009, which was 26.5 percent in  equities and 73.5 percent in fixed income. This interim guidance served as  the official policy.  Since then, PBGC has transitioned its newly acquired  assets to fixed-income investments.

Some transaction costs are always  incurred with the assumption of assets from newly terminated plans and  with the management of existing investments, but the magnitude of these  costs can vary dramatically depending on the volume and type of assets  being transitioned, the investment policy or goal in place, and the market  conditions during the transition period. PBGC does not have a routine  process for tracking the transaction costs associated with different  investment policies, and does not consider these costs when developing  new investment strategies.", "Transaction costs for reinvestment of assets generally consist of  commissions, fees and certain taxes (referred to as explicit costs), and  opportunity costs, due to market changes during the transaction (referred  to as implicit costs). PBGC typically uses specialized transition  investment managers when transitioning large pools of assets to keep  explicit costs down through economies of scale and by taking advantage  of other services offered by these managers. However, opportunity costs  can vary widely based on market conditions, and can result in either a net  loss or a net gain. Taking both explicit and implicit costs together, when  transactions net an amount lower than the original value of the assets, a  loss occurs; when transactions net an amount greater than the original  value of the assets, a gain occurs. Although PBGC does not routinely track  and conduct analytics on the transaction costs associated with  implementing different investment policies, we were able to compile the  costs incurred during each period a policy was in place from 2004 forward  by obtaining records from PBGC officials as well as PBGC\u2019s external  transition managers, as summarized in table 2.", "From 2004 to 2008, PBGC\u2019s investment policy remained primarily the  same: to transition assets from newly terminated plans to increase the  level of fixed-income investments. When the 2004 policy was being  implemented, assets valued at $8.8 billion were transitioned, and positive  market conditions helped PBGC realize a net gain of $40.5 million (or 46  basis points). When the 2006 policy was being implemented, assets of  about $2.6 billion were transitioned, but declining market conditions  towards the end of this period contributed to a loss of $7.6 million (or 30  basis points).", "In 2008, PBGC\u2019s investment policy shifted to increasing the level of equity  investments and certain subclasses of fixed-income securities and the  agency opted to use assets already in the trust fund, as well as newly  terminated plan assets, to accelerate implementation of the policy. In  total, assets of about $13 billion were transitioned while this investment  policy was in place, with $5.4 billion moving from fixed-income securities  to equities and $7.6 billion moving from one type of fixed-income  securities to others (specifically, from long-duration securities to high- yield and emerging market debt). These transactions were completed in  three phases. According to PBGC\u2019s own records, phase one was  performed in an \u201cad hoc\u201d manner and transaction costs were not tracked.  Assets transitioned during this phase totaled approximately $3.7 billion.  Phase two was more structured (referred to as \u201ccoordinated sales\u201d), with  PBGC assigning each fixed-income investment manager an amount of trust  fund assets to sell over a 5-month period, allowing trades to be made on  favorable trading days at the discretion of the investment manager. About  $7.9 billion in assets were transitioned during this phase. During phase  three, termed the \u201crunoff\u201d phase, the 2008 policy had been suspended, but  PBGC officials told us they decided not to cancel the trades for about $1.4  billion in assets that their investment managers already had initiated. Due  in part to the market downturn during the period the 2008 policy was in  place, the transaction costs associated with asset trades of about $9.3  billion that were tracked during the last two phases of the transition  totaled nearly $74.6 million (or 80 basis points). According to one PBGC  investment manager, some trades related to the 2008 transition incurred  opportunity costs of 400 to 500 basis points.", "In July 2009, a new interim directive was issued to decrease the level of  equity investments back to the asset distribution held as of March 31, 2009.

This occurred  because either the benchmark portfolio had a mix of assets that had a  higher correlation with the liability return, or, in cases where the  correlations were lower, the benchmark portfolio had sufficient returns to  compensate for the lower correlations for the period we examined.  However, the dynamic portfolio, which maintains the same asset allocation  as the PBGC total fund, performed as well as the S&P 500 benchmark and  out performed the Barclays Capital and Post Fiscal Year 2002 benchmarks  as well as the PBGC portfolio\u2014three portfolios that have significant  allocations to bonds.

Moreover, the PPA benchmark and other portfolios with a  significant weighting toward equity would likely not perform as well if  incoming cash-flows from new plan terminations were included in the  analysis. Rather than determining a particular asset allocation, this  analysis highlights that an approach that was not only mindful of returns,  but also accounted for the correlation between asset returns and the  liability return, was more likely to result in an investment policy for PBGC  that achieved higher risk-adjusted performance for the 1976 to 2009  period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Clear Evidence that Fluctuation in the Allocation of Investments Had Adverse Effect on Performance", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis found no link between the frequent changes in PBGC\u2019s  investment policy since 1990 and the actual allocation between equity and  fixed-asset investments.

Hence,  changes remained within a narrow range of a portfolio mix between fixed- income and equity allocations. As a result, although some shifts in actual  allocations did occur, we found no conclusive evidence that fluctuations in  the proportional allocation between equity and fixed-income investments  had a notable adverse impact on PBGC returns.

Hence, it is equally important for PBGC to have a well- developed investment policy statement as it is for these other institutions.  According to one expert, \u201can investment policy statement (IPS) is a  foundational document for a pension fund\u2019s investment program. The  essential purposes of the IPS are to articulate the consensus view of the  board regarding the overall investment program and to document policies  and procedures regarding major issues.\u201d", "However, we found items included in the PBGC\u2019s policy statements often  are insufficiently detailed to provide adequate guidance for staff  concerning certain investment objectives.

We compiled a list of 25 items these  organizations recommended be included in an investment policy  statement in order to provide sound strategic guidance across the key  areas of governance, investment objectives, and risk management. We  then examined PBGC\u2019s policy statements against these items and found  certain items were often missing (see table 4).

Further, while most of PBGC\u2019s statements  include a discussion of hiring and monitoring asset managers, they do not  assign responsibility for these tasks to a specific group. By contrast, the  investment policy statement of the United Kingdom\u2019s pension insurer,  Pension Protection Fund, and most of the public pension plans that we  reviewed do assign responsibility for these tasks to specific groups, such  as the public plan\u2019s investment advisory committee.

In addition, the board has an oversight responsibility to ensure that  PBGC is executing the board\u2019s policy in appropriate ways. According to  PBGC staff, because of the lack of specific guidance in the policy  statements, there have been instances when staff have had to request  further policy guidance from PBGC\u2019s board and the board had not always  been responsive. For example, in 2004, the board had instructed staff to  limit costs by using only incoming assets to transition to the new allocation  target. When adherence to this directive, together with a low level of liquid,  incoming assets caused the agency to miss its new allocation targets, staff  told us they asked for guidance but did not receive it. More recently, in May  and June 2009, the board members issued a resolution directing staff to  cease implementation of the 2008 investment policy, but did not approve a  new investment policy statement and did not provide further investment  guidance. In response, PBGC\u2019s Corporate Investments Department\u2019s (CID)  staff wrote a memo to PBGC\u2019s acting director indicating that they were  concerned about the lack of a defined policy to provide direction to CID  staff with respect to asset allocation.

The  Pension Protection Fund also identified nine risks that might affect its  investments and identified approaches to mitigate those risks. Six of the  eight public pension plans we reviewed also included a return target and a  risk tolerance in their investment policies. One expert stressed, in  particular, the importance of documenting tolerance for risk in the  investment policy cautioning that without such documentation, a firm  risks making changes at a bad time (selling at a deep discount) or in  response to political pressure.

For example, according to  PBGC\u2019s Inspector General, PBGC had actually undergone several  transition related activities\u2014such as the selection of three investment  management firms for strategic partnership contracts for managing $2.5  billion in PBGC assets\u2014before risks and mitigating methods related to the  transition were even documented. In addition, CID staff provided a group  of documents covering a number of transition related activities that had  several notable weaknesses.

We started our  review with PBGC\u2019s 1990 investment policy because it was the first  investment policy that specified asset allocation targets, such as the  proportion of assets to be invested in fixed-income assets versus equities.  For each of these policies, we identified the overall objective, such as  whether the policy attempted to maximize earnings using a higher  proportion of equities or reduce risk by increasing the proportion of fixed- income securities matched to the duration of their liabilities. We also  identified the percentages of each type of asset required by the policy,  such as the percentage allocated to equities versus fixed-income  investments, and compared these target allocations to actual allocations as  stated in PBGC\u2019s annual reports, internal trust and revolving fund data,  and other financial information received from PBGC officials.

However, even this fixed allocation portfolio is  really based upon the PBGC Total Fund, for the portfolio weights for the  Post Fiscal Year 2002 Benchmark portfolio are a stylized representation of  the PBGC Total Fund weights over the course of allocation period 4. In  addition, note that, despite having fluctuating asset allocations, the PBGC  Total Fund has outperformed the Post Fiscal Year 2002 Benchmark\u2014in  the sense of having higher risk-adjusted performance measure values\u2014 over significant subperiods of time in the past.

In contrast to  the results for the asset-only analysis, the PBGC Total Fund had weaker  performance than the Dynamic Benchmark in that its Adjusted Sharpe  ratio was lower for the overall time period (October 1976 to December  2009). Despite the switch in the performance rankings of the PBGC Total  Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark, there are many similarities between  the asset-liability performance analysis results and the asset-only  performance analysis returns. The areas of similarity are as follows:  1.  Under- or over-performance pattern across \u201cdecade\u201d and asset  allocation periods. The PBGC Total Fund underperformed the  Dynamic Benchmark for two out of the four decade subperiods and  two out of the four asset allocation regimes on a risk-adjusted, net-of- liability return basis, according to the Adjusted Sharpe ratio statistic  values.  2.  Lack of materiality of investment expenses. Deducting investment  expenses from the PBGC Total Fund returns in the asset-liability  context did not affect the performance ranking of the PBGC Total  Fund relative to the Dynamic Benchmark on an Adjusted Sharpe ratio  basis (in those periods for which investment expenses data were  available).  3.  Tendency to perform relatively worse in regimes where equity asset  allocation is greater or rising. The PBGC Total Fund\u2019s relative  performance has tended to be worse in asset allocations periods where  there is an elevated or rising allocation to the equity asset class. For  example, as in the asset-only analysis, the PBGC Total Fund returns,  net of the liability returns, had an Adjusted Sharpe ratio below that of  the Dynamic Benchmark in allocation period 1 (which was  characterized by a rising allocations to the equity sector). Also, as in  the asset-only case, the PBGC Total Fund underperformed the  Dynamic Benchmark on a net of liability return basis in allocation  period 3, according to the Adjusted Sharpe ratio scores. In allocation  period 4, when the average allocation to equities in the PBGC Total  Fund portfolio was lower than in allocation regime 3, the PBGC Total  Fund had a higher Adjusted Sharpe ratio than the Dynamic Benchmark  did. However, unlike the asset-only case, the PBGC Total Fund  Adjusted Sharpe ratio was less than that of the Dynamic Benchmark in  allocation period 2, when the PBGC Total Fund allocation to equities  was falling and to bonds was rising. The similarity of the seemingly  inverse relation between the PBGC Total Fund Adjusted Sharpe ratio  value and the magnitude of the allocation to the equities asset class  reinforces the impression that elevated allocations of the PBGC Total  Fund to the equity asset class had adverse impact on PBGC Total Fund  returns net of the liability returns in an asset-liability context as well as  when the portfolio returns are considered in isolation from the liability  returns in an asset-only context. However the patterns in the equity  asset allocation and its relationship to performance should not be  viewed as implying causality.  4.  Mean excess return prominence as a driver of risk-adjusted  performance metric values across subperiods. In every sub-period and  asset allocation regime where the excess mean return (net of the  liability return) for the PBGC Total Fund exceeded the excess mean  return (net of the liability return) for the Dynamic Benchmark  portfolio, the Adjusted Sharpe ratio for the PBGC Total Fund exceeded  the Adjusted Sharpe ratio for the Dynamic Benchmark.", "Given all of the similarities between the results of the performance  comparisons in the asset-liability and asset-only contexts, the reason for  the contrast between the PBGC Total Fund\u2019s underperformance of the  Dynamic Benchmark in the asset-liability context and its outperformance  in the asset-only context appears to be risk. In the asset-only performance  comparison analysis, the PBGC Total Fund\u2019s riskiness\u2014as measured by  the standard deviation and semi-standard deviation of the returns\u2014-was  lower than that of the Dynamic Benchmark portfolio. However, in the  asset-liability context, the results indicate that the PBGC Total Fund  returns have greater standard deviation and semi-standard deviation  values than the returns for the Dynamic Benchmark, suggesting that the  PBGC Total Fund returns (net of the liability returns) are riskier and more  volatile than the Dynamic Benchmark returns (net of the liability returns).  One factor that likely played a role in elevating the PBGC Total Fund\u2019s  riskiness above that of the Dynamic Benchmark is the correlation of the  actual asset returns with the liability returns (not the correlation between  the liability returns and the asset returns net of the liability returns). For  the overall sample period, the PBGC Total Fund actual returns had lower  correlation with the liability returns \u2014both scaled by the funding ratio and  unscaled\u2014than the Dynamic Benchmark. Higher correlation makes it  more likely that movements in the liability return are accompanied by  movements in the asset portfolio return in the same direction and of  similar magnitude. Such co-movement of the actual asset returns and the  liability returns helps reduce the volatility of the asset returns net of the  liability returns.", "Lower correlation has the opposite effect of higher correlation\u2014lower  correlation reduces co-movement between asset returns and liability  returns and thus elevates the riskiness of asset returns net of the liability  returns. Thus, the extent to which the riskiness of the PBGC Total Fund  exceeds the riskiness of the Dynamic Benchmark on a net-of-liability  return basis probably reflects, at least in part, the extent to which the  liability returns are less correlated with the PBGC Total Fund\u2019s actual  returns than with the Dynamic Benchmark actual returns. However, the  question of why the PBGC Total Fund would be less correlated with  liability returns than the Dynamic Benchmark would require a more  detailed investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of the Effect of Fluctuations in the PBGC Total Fund\u2019s Asset Allocation upon PBGC Performance in the Asset- Liability Context", "paragraphs": ["The results of comparing the performance measures of the PBGC Total  Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark returns, net of the liability return, to  the performance measures of the static portfolios are that the Dynamic  Benchmark outperforms two out of the six static portfolios\u2014the Post  Fiscal Year 2002 Benchmark and the Barclays Capital Long-Term  Government Credit Index\u2014and is roughly tied in performance with the  S&P 500. However, the PBGC Total Fund did not outperform any of the  benchmarks. Moreover, two out of the three best-performing portfolios  have significant allocations to bonds and equities versus representing only  a single asset class.", "In order to detect potential sources of underperformance, as measured by  the Adjusted Sharpe measure, in the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic  Benchmark, we conducted a detailed comparison of various performance  metrics for these two portfolios to performance metrics for the PPA  benchmark portfolio\u2014the portfolio that had the highest Adjusted Sharpe  measure for the overall October 1976 through December 2009 sample  period and, by that measure, the best risk-adjusted performance. This  detailed comparison suggests that a major source of the  underperformance of the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark  relative to the PPA benchmark portfolio was weakness in the mean excess  return, for both portfolios had lower mean excess returns for the overall  sample period the mean excess return of the PPA benchmark portfolio.  However, both the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark  portfolios appeared to be less risky than the PPA portfolio inasmuch as  the returns on both portfolios had lower standard deviation and semi- standard deviation than the returns on the PPA portfolio. Thus, the  primary immediate reason both portfolios have lower Adjusted Sharpe  ratios than the PPA benchmark is that their returns (net of the liability  return) had lower mean excess returns than the PPA benchmark return  (net of the liability return) not because they were more risky than the PPA  benchmark. One other feature of the results that underscores the extent to  which both portfolios were less risky than the PPA benchmark on an  asset-liability basis is that the returns (net of the liability return) for both  portfolios had lower standard deviations than the return (net of the  liability return) for the PPA benchmark for every decade sub-period in the  case of the Dynamic Benchmark and for three out of the four decade  subperiods in the case of the PBGC Total Fund.", "Although the statistics clearly suggest that weakness in the mean excess  return played a role in lowering the risk-adjusted performance of both the  PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark portfolios, the evidence  provided by the performance measures about whether the variation over  time in asset allocations associated with both portfolios necessarily  lowered the risk-adjusted performance of their returns on a net-of-liability  basis is less clear. For example, on the one hand, the Dynamic Benchmark  has a lower Adjusted Sharpe ratio for the overall sample period\u2014and by  that metric, weaker risk-adjusted performance\u2014than several static  portfolios; however, on the other hand, it also outperforms other fixed  allocation portfolios on an Adjusted Sharpe ratio basis, which suggests  that fluctuations in asset allocations alone do not immediately imply  underperformance on a risk-adjusted basis.", "In general, the evidence from the performance metrics is too ambiguous to  support the conclusion that the variation in the asset allocations inherent  in the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark portfolio necessarily  lowered the risk-adjusted performance of the returns of both portfolios  within the asset-liability analysis. Furthermore, there are subperiods  where the returns (net of the liability returns) for both dynamic portfolios  have higher Adjusted Sharpe ratios than the PPA benchmark, even though  this portfolio had the highest Adjusted Sharpe ratio for the overall sample  period. In particular, both the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic  Benchmark have higher Adjusted Sharpe ratios than the PPA benchmark  for two out of the four decade subperiods; also, the Adjusted Sharpe ratios  for both portfolios exceed that of the PPA benchmark for one of the four  asset allocation regimes, a period of 8 years. The lengths of time over  which the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark outperform, on  a risk-adjusted basis, the best static portfolio over significant subperiods  of the overall sample period does not indicate that the fluctuations in the  asset allocations for the PBGC Total Fund and the Dynamic Benchmark  alone are a preeminent source of weakness in the risk-adjusted  performance of the returns for both portfolios in the asset-liability context.", "This analysis has primarily (although not exclusively) focused on the  comparison of the risk-adjusted performance of the two dynamic  portfolios to the performance of the PPA benchmark, the static portfolio  which had the strongest risk-adjusted performance. However, if the focus  is expanded to include comparisons across all of the static and dynamic  portfolios, another feature of the results emerges. That is, the influence of  the correlation between the portfolio returns and the liability return on the  riskiness and the risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio returns net of  the liability return. This influence is emphasized in the results for the best  three performing portfolios over the period studied\u2014the PPA benchmark,  the Wilshire 5000, and the Life Insurance Benchmark portfolio  performance results. The PPA benchmark and the Life Insurance  Benchmark both have adjusted Sharpe ratios that equal or exceed that of  the Wilshire 5000 for the overall sample period even though the mean  excess return of the Wilshire 5000 for the overall sample period is 49  percent greater than that of the Life Insurance Benchmark and 31 percent  greater than that of the PPA benchmark. Because both the PPA and the  Life Insurance Benchmark have lower mean excess returns than the  Wilshire 5000, the source of their strong adjusted Sharpe ratio  performance in comparison to the Wilshire 5000 rests in the riskiness of  the returns for those two portfolios (in comparison to the Wilshire 5000).  As shown in table 7, both portfolios have distinctly lower standard  deviations and semi-standard deviations\u2014two measures of riskiness\u2014 than the Wilshire 5000. Specifically, the annualized standard deviation of  the Life Insurance Benchmark returns is 49 percent less than that of the  Wilshire 5000 returns, and the semi-standard deviation of the Life  Insurance Benchmark portfolio returns is 46 percent less than the semi- standard deviation of the Wilshire 5000 returns. Similarly, the annualized  standard deviation of the PPA benchmark returns is 32 percent less than  the annualized standard deviation of the Wilshire 5000 returns, and the  annualized semi-standard deviation of the PPA benchmark returns is 30  percent less than the semi-standard deviation of the Wilshire 5000 returns.", "By examining the correlation of the PPA benchmark, the Life Insurance  Benchmark, and the Wilshire 5000 returns with the liability return in  conjunction with the standard deviation values for the returns on those  three portfolios, one can observe the potential role of the correlation in  reducing the riskiness of the PPA and Life Insurance Benchmark return  (net of the liability returns). In particular, the correlation of the returns on  both the PPA and Life Insurance Benchmark portfolios with the liability  return are distinctly higher than the correlation of the return on the  Wilshire 5000 with the liability return. As shown in table 7, the correlation  of the Wilshire 5000 return with the scaled liability return is 0.29, but the  analogous correlation statistic for the PPA benchmark return is 0.51 (76  percent higher than the Wilshire 5000 correlation statistic) and for the Life  Insurance Benchmark portfolio is 0.74 (155 percent higher than the  Wilshire 5000 correlation statistic). Furthermore, it appears that, the  higher the correlation, the lower the risk, since the benchmark portfolio  that has returns with the highest correlation with the liability return\u2014the  Life Insurance Benchmark\u2014has the least risk. When considering all eight  portfolios being studied (instead of only the three portfolios with the  strongest risk-adjusted performance), the four portfolios with the highest  correlations with the liability return have the four lowest standard  deviations, and the four portfolios with the lowest correlations have the  four highest standard deviation estimates. Also, with the exception of the  two portfolios with the highest correlation scores and lowest standard  deviation values, the rankings of the standard deviation values matches  the rankings of the correlation estimates (in ascending order by standard  deviation and descending order by correlation). The strong relation  between extent of correlation with the liability return and risk highlights  how the relatively strong correlation of the PPA and the Life Insurance  Benchmark returns with the liability return seems to contribute to  lowering the riskiness of the returns (net of the liability return) of these  two portfolios, enhancing their Adjusted Sharpe ratio values and risk- adjusted performance (according to the Adjusted Sharpe ratio statistic).", "The apparent linkage between the risk-adjusted performance metric and  the correlation between the actual portfolio return and the liability return  is most likely a reflection of the effect of the correlation between the  actual portfolio returns and the liability returns on the volatility of the  portfolio returns net of the liability return. As was discussed in the  comparison between the performance of the PBGC Total Fund and the  Dynamic Benchmark, higher correlation between the (actual) portfolio  returns and the liability returns implies a greater degree of co-movement  between the asset returns and the liability returns, and greater co- movement between the asset returns and the liability returns weakens or  lowers the volatility of the portfolio returns net of the liability return. One  reflection of the lowered volatility for the portfolio returns net of the  liability return is a lowered standard deviation value, and a lower standard  deviation value helps elevate the Adjusted Sharpe ratio value, implying  stronger risk-adjusted performance.", "The strong relation between the correlation statistic and the Adjusted  Sharpe measure values provide at least a partial explanation of why two  out of the three portfolios that have the best risk-adjusted performance (as  indicated by their Adjusted Sharpe ratio scores) all have allocations to the  bond asset class sector of 40 percent or more. The portfolio of the  liabilities consists mostly of annuities and annuity-like instruments, all of  which are obligations of the PBGC. To the extent that annuities are fixed- income contracts, the portfolio of liabilities is essentially bond-like in  nature. Hence, the fact that the asset portfolios that have a significant  allocation to bonds have return behavior that is more similar to, and thus  would have higher correlation with, the liability returns is not surprising.", "Among the three portfolios that have the returns with the strongest risk- adjusted performance, the returns for the two portfolios that have the  highest allocation to bonds (the PPA benchmark and the Life Insurance  Benchmark) also have other desirable characteristics. For instance, these  two portfolios (as opposed to the Wilshire 5000) have returns which, net of  the liability return, have higher skewness for the overall sample than the  Wilshire 5000. The higher skewness of the returns for the PPA benchmark  and the Life Insurance Benchmark portfolios suggests that those portfolios  are less likely to have months where the return on the asset portfolio falls  extremely short of the growth in the PBGC liabilities than the Wilshire  5000. Minimization of the instances where the asset returns fall extremely  short of the liability returns would help prevent further growth of the  already sizeable PBGC funding deficit.", "The desirable implications of the higher skewness can be seen through  other statistics. Note that the minimum values for the PPA Benchmark and  the Life Insurance Benchmark portfolios are less extreme. That is, they are  less negative than for the Wilshire 5000. To get a sense of how much \u201cless  extreme\u201d they are, note that the minimum monthly net-of-liability return  for the PPA Benchmark is negative 12.39 percent and for the Life  Insurance Benchmark is negative 15.09 percent in contrast to the  minimum negative return value for the Wilshire 5000 of negative 24.42  percent. Because returns on the two highest-performing benchmark  portfolios with significant allocations to bonds\u2014the PPA Benchmark and  the Insurance Benchmark portfolios\u2014have less extreme negative values,  lower semi-standard deviations, and lower standard deviations than the  returns on Wilshire 5000, there is a strong possibility that the probability  distributions associated with these returns have assign less probability to  on extreme negative values than the probability distribution associated  with the Wilshire 5000 returns, characteristics that are consistent with and  are associated with the PPA and Life Insurance Benchmark portfolio  returns having skewness statistic estimates that exceed the (negative)  skewness statistic for the Wilshire 5000 returns.", "The fact that the three best performing portfolios over the 1976 through  2009 period in this particular analysis were the PPA benchmark, the  Wilshire 5000, and the Life Insurance Benchmark does not necessarily  mean that any of these portfolios would be appropriate for the PBGC  going forward. The results of any particular analysis will depend on the  performance statistics used and how these performance statistics balance  risk and reward, and criteria would also need to be established for  meaningful differences in these measurements. Also, as noted earlier, an  asset allocation exercise would look at multiple possible future scenarios,  not one particular historical period. High allocation to equities would be a  particularly controversial matter for the PBGC because of the lower, and  potentially, negative correlation between equity returns and new claims.
