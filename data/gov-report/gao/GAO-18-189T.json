Specifically:", "VA relies on the SCIP process to plan and prioritize capital projects, but VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year's planned project narratives before knowing if their previous submissions have been funded. The overlapping budget cycle, which is outside of VA's control, combined with other SCIP limitations\u2014including subjective narratives, long time frames, and restricted access to information\u2014make it difficult for VA to rely on SCIP to accurately identify the capital necessary to address its service and infrastructure gaps. VA concurred that it needs to address SCIP limitations that are within its control, as GAO recommended; VA has made some progress in implementing the recommendation has made some progress in implementing the recommendation.\\", "The VAIP process is estimated to cost $108 million and to produce market-level service delivery plans and facility master plans. However, the VAIP master plans incorrectly assume that all future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities without considering alternatives, such as purchasing care from the community. GAO recommended that VA consider discontinuing the VAIP facility master plans pending an assessment of their value as a facility-planning tool. VA agreed with the recommendation and is implementing it while pursuing a national realignment strategy..", "Key elements of the Department of Defense's (DOD) 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process could benefit VA's asset and infrastructure review. The key elements included: (1) establishing goals for the process, (2) developing criteria for evaluating closures and realignments, and (3) establishing an organizational structure to develop closure and realignment options. GAO identified key challenges that affected DOD's implementation of BRAC 2005 and the results achieved; these challenges would need to be addressed if VA is to successfully apply the process. These challenges included: (1) large, complex recommendations required sustained senior leadership's attention and a high level of coordination among many stakeholders, and (2) the large number of actions that depend on each other for successful implementation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the April 2017 report, GAO made recommendations related to capital planning and stakeholder involvement.

VA is also one  of the largest federal property-holding agencies. In September 2014, VA\u2019s  reported inventory included 6,091 federally owned buildings and 1,586  leased buildings. However, in recent decades, the veteran population and  preferences have shifted. VA has recognized this shift and the need to  modernize its aging infrastructure and align its real property assets to  provide accessible, high-quality, and cost-effective services to veterans.  Aligning VA facilities to improve veteran access to services integrates two  of GAO\u2019s high risk areas: veterans\u2019 health care and federal real property.  In 2015, GAO placed veterans\u2019 health care on its High Risk List due to  persistent weaknesses and systemic problems with timeliness, cost- effectiveness, quality, and safety of the care provided to veterans. In  2003, GAO placed federal real property management\u2014including  management of VA real property\u2014on its High Risk List due to long- standing challenges, such as effectively disposing of excess and  underutilized federal property.", "DOD has repeatedly applied the BRAC process to reduce the amount of  unneeded property that it owns and leases. DOD has undergone five  BRAC rounds since 1988 as a means of reducing excess infrastructure  and realigning bases to meet changing force structure needs. The most  recent BRAC round in 2005 also provided opportunities for furthering  transformation and fostering jointness. As a result of these rounds, DOD  reported that it had reduced its domestic infrastructure and transferred  hundreds of thousands of acres of unneeded property to other federal  and nonfederal entities. DOD data show that the department generated  an estimated $28.9 billion in net savings or cost avoidances from the prior  four BRAC rounds through fiscal year 2003 and expects to save about $7  billion each year thereafter. Regarding the 2005 BRAC round, we  estimated that DOD saved about $15.2 billion from fiscal years 2006  through 2011 with an annual recurring savings of $3.8 billion beginning in  fiscal year 2012. These savings reflect money that could be applied to  other higher priority defense needs as well as savings from what DOD  estimated it would likely have spent to operate military installations had  they remained open.", "Our testimony today is based on our April 2017 report examining VA\u2019s  efforts to align its facilities with veterans\u2019 needs, and on numerous GAO  reports related to the BRAC process as summarized in June 2011 and  March 2012 testimonies.

For our April 2017 report, we reviewed  VA\u2019s facility-planning documents and data and interviewed VA officials in  headquarters and at seven medical facilities selected for their geographic  location, veteran population, and past alignment efforts.

In such instances, it is often difficult  and costly for VA to modernize, renovate, and retrofit these older  facilities. In June 2017, VA reported that its facility inventory includes 430  vacant or mostly vacant buildings that are, on average, more than 60  years old, and an additional 784 buildings that are underutilized.", "The historic status of some VA facilities adds to the complexity of  converting or disposing of them. In 2014, VA reported holding 2,957  historic buildings, structures, or land parcels\u2014the third most in the federal  government after DOD and the Department of the Interior. In some  instances, it may be more expensive to renovate than to demolish and  rebuild outdated facilities. In other cases, however, there may not be an  option to demolish if these buildings are designated as historic. For  example, planning officials at four medical facilities in our review told us  that state historic preservation efforts prevented the VA from demolishing  vacant buildings, even though these buildings require upkeep costs and  pose potential safety hazards. (See fig. 1.)", "VA has also encountered challenges to its facility alignment efforts, in  part, because it has not consistently followed best practices for effectively  engaging stakeholders. VA may align its facilities to meet veterans\u2019 needs  by expanding or consolidating facilities or services. Stakeholders\u2014 including veterans; local, state, and federal officials; Veterans Service  Organizations; historic preservation groups; VA staff; and Congress\u2014 often view changes as working against their interests or those of their  constituents, especially when services are eliminated or shifted from one  location to another. We found that VA has not consistently engaged with  stakeholders, and, in some cases, this inconsistency resulted in  adversarial relationships that reduced VA\u2019s ability to better align facilities  with the needs of the veteran population.", "In our April 2017 report, we recommended that VA improve stakeholder  communication guidance and evaluate its efforts.

For example, the time between when planning  officials at VA medical facilities begin developing the SCIP narratives and  when they are notified that a project is funded has taken between 17 and  23 months over the past 6 fiscal-year\u2019s SCIP submissions. (See fig. 2.)  As such, VA routinely asks its facility planners to submit their next year\u2019s  planned project narratives before knowing if their project submissions  from the previous year have been funded.", "An official from the office that oversees SCIP told us that the timing of the  budgeting process, which is outside VA\u2019s control, contributes to these  delays. While these aspects are outside of VA\u2019s control, VA has chosen  to wait about 6 to 10 months to report the results of the SCIP scoring  process to the medical facilities. This situation makes it difficult for local  officials to understand the likelihood that their projects will receive  funding. A VA official said that for future SCIP cycles, VA plans to release  the scoring results for minor construction and non-recurring maintenance  projects to local officials earlier in the process. At the time of our review,  however, the official did not have a time frame for when VA would do this.  Although VA acknowledges many of these limitations, it has taken little  action in response. Federal standards for internal control state that  agencies should evaluate and determine appropriate corrective action for  identified limitations on a timely basis. If VA does not address known  limitations with the SCIP process, it will not have reasonable assurance  that SCIP can be used to accurately identify the capital necessary to  address VA\u2019s service and infrastructure gaps.", "In our April 2017 report, we recommended that VA address identified  limitations to the SCIP process, including limitations to scoring and  approval, and access to information.

However, the VAIP process\u2019s facility master plans assume all  future growth in services will be provided directly through VA facilities.

Other goals for the  2005 BRAC process included fostering jointness among the four  military services, reducing excess infrastructure, and producing  savings. Prior rounds focused more on reducing excess infrastructure  and producing savings.", "Develop criteria for evaluating closures and realignments. DOD  proposed selection criteria, which were made available for public  comment via the Federal Register. Ultimately, Congress enacted the  final BRAC selection criteria in law with minor modification and  specified that four selection criteria, known as the \u201cmilitary value  criteria,\u201d were to be given priority in developing closure and  realignment recommendations. Further, Congress required that the  Secretary of Defense develop and submit to Congress a force  structure plan that described the estimated size of major military units  needed to address probable threats to national security for the 20- year period beginning in 2005, along with a comprehensive inventory  of global military installations. In authorizing the 2005 BRAC round,  Congress specified that the Secretary of Defense publish a list of  recommendations for the closure and realignment of military  installations inside the United States based on the statutorily-required  20-year force structure plan and infrastructure inventory, and on the  final selection criteria.", "Estimate costs and savings to implement closure and  realignment recommendations. To address the cost and savings  criteria, DOD developed and used the Cost of Base Realignment  Actions (COBRA) model, a quantitative tool that DOD has used since  the 1988 BRAC round to provide consistency in potential cost,  savings, and return-on-investment estimates for closure and  realignment options. We found the COBRA model to be a generally  reasonable estimator for comparing potential costs and savings  among alternatives. (See fig. 3.)", "As with any model, the quality of the output from COBRA was a direct  function of the data DOD included in the model. Also, DOD\u2019s COBRA  model relied to a large extent on standard factors and averages and  did not represent budget quality estimates that were developed once  BRAC decisions were made and detailed implementation plans were  developed. Nonetheless, the financial information provided important  input into the selection process as decision makers weighed the  financial implications\u2014along with military value criteria and other  considerations\u2014in arriving at final decisions about the suitability of  various closure and realignment options.", "Establish an organizational structure. The Office of the Secretary  of Defense emphasized the need for joint cross-service groups to  analyze common business-oriented functions. For the 2005 BRAC  round, as for the 1993 and 1995 rounds, these joint cross-service  groups performed analyses and developed closure and realignment  options in addition to those developed by the military departments.  Our evaluation of DOD\u2019s 1995 BRAC round found that few cross- service recommendations were made, in part because of the lack of  high-level leadership to encourage consolidations across the  departments\u2019 functions. In the 1995 BRAC round, the joint cross- service groups submitted options through the military services for  approval, but few were approved. The number of approved  recommendations that the joint cross-service groups developed  significantly increased in the 2005 BRAC round. This increase was, in  part, because high-level leadership ensured that the options were  approved not by the military departments but rather by a DOD senior- level group, known as the Infrastructure Steering Group. As shown in  figure 4, the Infrastructure Steering Group was placed organizationally  on par with the military departments.", "Establish a common analytical framework. To ensure that the  selection criteria were consistently applied, the Office of the Secretary  of Defense, the military departments, and the seven joint cross- service groups first performed a capacity analysis of facilities and  functions. Before developing the candidate recommendations, DOD\u2019s  capacity analysis relied on data calls to hundreds of locations to  obtain certified data to assess such factors as maximum potential  capacity, current capacity, current usage, and excess capacity. Then,  the military departments and joint cross-service groups performed a  military value analysis for the facilities and functions based on primary  military value criteria, which included a facility\u2019s or function\u2019s current  and future mission capabilities, physical condition, ability to  accommodate future needs, and cost of operations.", "Develop BRAC oversight mechanisms to improve accountability  for implementation. In the 2005 BRAC round, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense for the first time required the military  departments to develop business plans to better inform the Office of  the Secretary of Defense of the status of implementation and financial  details for each of the BRAC 2005 recommendations. These business  plans included: (1) information such as a listing of all actions needed  to implement each recommendation; (2) schedules for personnel  relocations between installations; and (3) updated cost and savings  estimates by DOD based on current information. This approach  permitted senior-level intervention if warranted to ensure completion  of the BRAC recommendations by the statutory completion date.", "Involve the audit community to better ensure data accuracy. The  DOD Inspector General and military department audit agencies  played key roles in identifying data limitations, pointing out needed  corrections, and improving the accuracy of the data used in the  process. In their oversight roles, the audit organizations, which had  access to relevant information and officials as the process evolved,  helped to improve the accuracy of the data used in the BRAC process  and thus strengthened the quality and integrity of the data used to  develop closure and realignment recommendations. For example, the  auditors worked to ensure certified information was used for BRAC  analysis and reviewed other facets of the process, including the  various internal control plans, the COBRA model, and other modeling  and analytical tools that were used in the development of  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Challenges Affecting DOD and the Commission in BRAC 2005", "paragraphs": ["We identified two key challenges that affected DOD\u2019s implementation of  BRAC 2005 and would need to be addressed for VA to adopt a BRAC- like process for its asset and infrastructure review.", "Some transformational-type BRAC recommendations required  sustained senior leadership attention and a high level of  coordination among many stakeholders to complete by the  required date. Implementation of some transformational BRAC  recommendations\u2014especially those where a multitude of  organizations had roles to play to ensure the achievement of the goals  of the recommendation\u2014illustrated the need to involve key  stakeholders and effective planning. For example, the Defense  Logistics Agency committed sustained high-level leadership and  included relevant stakeholders to address implementation challenges  faced with the potential for disruptions to depot operations during  implementation of the BRAC consolidation recommendation. To  implement the BRAC recommendations, the agency had to develop  strategic agreements with the services that ensured that all  stakeholders agreed on its plans for implementation, and had to  address certain human capital and information technology challenges.", "Large number of actions and interdependent recommendations  complicated the implementation process. The large number and  variety of BRAC actions presented challenges during implementation.  The BRAC 2005 round had more individual actions (813) than the four  prior rounds combined (387). The executive staff of the Commission  told us that it was more difficult to assess the costs and the amount of  time for the savings to offset the implementation costs since many of  the recommendations contained multiple interdependent actions, all of  which needed to be reviewed. Specifically, many of the BRAC 2005  recommendations were interdependent and had to be completed in a  sequential fashion within the statutory implementation period. In cases  where interdependent recommendations required multiple relocations  of large numbers of personnel, delays in completing one BRAC  recommendation had a cascading effect on the implementation of  other recommendations. Specifically, DOD had to synchronize the  relocations of over 123,000 people with about $24.7 billion in new  construction or renovation. Commission officials told us that in prior  BRAC rounds each base was handled by a single integrated  recommendation. However, in BRAC 2005, many installations were  simultaneously affected by multiple interconnected BRAC  recommendations. Given the complexity of interdependent  recommendations, the Office of the Secretary of Defense required the  military departments and defense agencies to provide periodic  updates on implementation challenges and progress.", "Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members of the Committee,  this concludes our prepared statement.
