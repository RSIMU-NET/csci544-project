Employers were required to comply with the law for coverage that began on or after October 3, 2009. The Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of the Treasury share oversight for MHPAEA. MHPAEA also requires GAO to examine trends in health insurance coverage of MH/SU. This report describes (1) the extent to which employers cover MH/SU through private health insurance plans, and how this coverage has changed since 2008; and (2) what is known about the effect of health insurance coverage for MH/SU on enrollees' health care expenditures; access to, or use of, MH/SU services; and health status. GAO surveyed a random sample of employers about their MH/SU coverage for the most current plan year and for 2008. GAO received usable responses from 168 employers--a 24 percent response rate. The survey results are not generalizable; rather, they provide information limited to responding employers' MH/SU coverage. GAO reviewed published national employer surveys on health insurance coverage and interviewed officials from DOL, HHS, and other experts. GAO also reviewed studies that evaluated the effect of MH/SU coverage on enrollees' expenditures, access to, or use of, MH/SU services, and health status."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most employers continued to offer coverage of MH/SU since MHPAEA was passed. Of the employers that responded to GAO's survey, 96 percent offered coverage of MH/SU for the current plan year and for 2008, before MHPAEA was passed. Approximately 2 percent of employers reported offering coverage for only mental health conditions but not substance use disorders for the current plan year and for 2008. Conversely, about 2 percent of employers reported discontinuing their coverage of both MH/SU or only substance use disorders in the current plan year. The types of MH/SU diagnoses included and excluded in employers' MH/SU benefits remained consistent between the current plan year and 2008. Of the employers who provided information about diagnoses included in their MH/SU benefits for both the current plan year and 2008, 34 percent reported that their most popular plan in the current plan year excluded at least one MH/SU diagnosis from their benefits, and 39 percent of employers reported excluding at least one MH/SU diagnosis from their benefits for the 2008 plan year. The most common change to MH/SU benefits reported among those who responded to the survey was enhancing benefits through the removal of treatment limitations, such as the number of allowed office visits. Reported use of lifetime dollar limits on MH/SU treatments also declined from 2008 to the current plan year. Among employers who reported information on cost-sharing, copayments and coinsurance amounts for in-network providers generally stayed about the same, fluctuating minimally from 2008 to the current plan year. Published national employer surveys on health insurance coverage also reported results consistent with GAO's survey data. Employers may continue to modify certain nonfinancial requirements--such as changes to the services they cover (the scope of services) and nonquantitative treatment limits--in their MH/SU benefits in response to agencies' issuance of final implementing regulations for MHPAEA. Officials from DOL and HHS reported that the final regulations may provide additional detail on these nonfinancial requirements. Research suggests that coverage for MH/SU has a varied effect on enrollees. Research examining the effect of health insurance coverage for MH/SU on enrollee expenditures generally found that the implementation of parity requirements reduced enrollee expenditures. Studies that examined the effect of health insurance coverage for MH/SU on enrollee access to, and use of, MH/SU services had mixed results, with some studies indicating there was little to no effect and others indicating that there was some effect--such as finding that restricting coverage had a negative effect on use of services. Little research has explored the relationship between health insurance coverage and health status. Of the studies we reviewed, two examined the effect of health insurance coverage for MH/SU on enrollee health status and found different effects. GAO provided a draft of the report to DOL and HHS. Both agencies provided technical comments, which have been incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["An estimated 26 percent of American adults suffer from some type of  mental health condition each year, with about 6 percent of them suffering  from a severe mental health condition such as schizophrenia or major  depression.

Types of  MH/SU services can include: counseling, case management, partial hospitalization,  inpatient treatment, vocational rehabilitation, and a variety of residential programs. MH/SU  treatment may also include prescription drugs. In addition, patients with acute symptoms  may be treated by personnel in emergency rooms and hospital units, and by MH/SU crisis  and outreach specialists. Patients with more subacute symptoms are treated by personnel  in hospitals, day treatment programs, mental health center programs, and by different  types of individual practitioners.

Employers often limited the coverage of  MH/SU through the use of plan design features that were more restrictive  for MH/SU benefits than for medical/surgical benefits. Prior to MHPAEA,  MH/SU benefits were commonly subject to higher cost-sharing features  such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance; more restrictive  treatment limitations such as the number of covered hospital days or  outpatient office visits; and limited out-of-network providers. Also, there  were concerns that employers would limit the MH/SU treatment enrollees  could receive by excluding specific MH/SU diagnoses, such as eating  disorders, from their benefits.", "For example, prior to MHPAEA, an employer\u2019s plan could cover unlimited  hospital days and outpatient office visits and require 20 percent  coinsurance for outpatient office visits for medical/surgical treatment  while, for MH/SU, that same plan could cover only 30 hospital days and  20 outpatient office visits per year and impose 50 percent coinsurance for  outpatient office visits. Additionally, an employer\u2019s plan might limit the  MH/SU diagnoses for which treatment was covered.", "Employers provided more limited coverage of MH/SU prior to MHPAEA  primarily because of concerns about the cost of providing coverage for  individuals with MH/SU. Concerns about the high costs associated with  long-term, intensive psychotherapy and extended hospital stays,  particularly for some diagnoses such as schizophrenia or major  depression, could have prompted employers to impose treatment  limitations on outpatient office visits and hospital days, and limits on  annual or lifetime dollar amounts for treatment of MH/SU.", "To help address the discrepancies in health care coverage between  mental illnesses and physical illnesses, Congress passed MHPAEA  which strengthened federal parity requirements. coverage terms for MH/SU\u2014when those services are offered\u2014be no  more restrictive than coverage terms for medical/surgical services.", "Under MHPAEA, employers are not required to offer MH/SU coverage.
