Although HUD has taken actions to improve its acquisition management--such as instituting full-time contract monitoring positions and improving its contracting information system--weaknesses remain that limit HUD's ability to identify and correct contractor performance problems, assure that it is receiving the services for which it pays, and hold contractors accountable for results. HUD, in particular, its multifamily housing program, does not employ processes and practices that could facilitate effective monitoring. For example, HUD's monitoring process does not consistently include the use of contract monitoring plans or risk-based strategies, or the tracking of contractor performance. HUD has not ensured that individuals responsible for managing and monitoring contracts have the appropriate workload, skills, and training that would enable them to effectively perform their jobs. For example, according to HUD's records, over half of the staff who are directly responsible for monitoring contractor performance have not received required acquisition training. HUD's management information systems do not adequately support its acquisition workforce in their efforts to manage and monitor contracts. Specifically, key information in HUD's contracting system is not reliable and HUD's financial systems do not readily provide complete and consistent contracting obligation and expenditure data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) assists millions of Americans through programs that help to encourage home ownership, house the poor, and promote economic development.

As HUD dramatically downsized its staff in the 1990s\u2014 from about 13,500 people to around 9,000 today\u2014the scope of its mission and the needs of the people it serves did not decrease. As a consequence, HUD came to rely more and more on private contractors to help carry out its mission. These contractors deliver programs and perform many functions that used to be done by HUD\u2019s staff, including those in its mortgage insurance and rental assistance program areas\u2014areas we have found to be at high risk for fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.

In a related assignment, we also reviewed fiscal year 2001 disbursements under multifamily housing\u2019s property disposition contracts using an automated approach to identify unusual transactions and payment patterns. To assess the workload, skills, and training of the acquisition workforce, we conducted a survey of HUD\u2019s acquisition workforce and obtained information on training and certification of the acquisition workforce, both in the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) and at the program level.

To accomplish these diverse missions, HUD relies on third parties, including contractors, to administer many of its programs. As shown in figure 1, according to data HUD reported to the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC), for fiscal year 2000, HUD obligated the bulk of its contracting dollars\u2014over 96 percent\u2014in three categories of contracting: automated data processing and telecommunications services for about $254 million; operation of government-owned facilities for about $195 million for one of its multifamily contractors; and over $600 million for professional, administration, and management support services contracts, such as real estate brokerage services, technical assistance, and other services.", "According to HUD data, about $640 million of the $1.2 billion contract obligations for fiscal year 2000 are for Office of Housing contracts; much of this contracting was for services HUD needs to manage its foreclosed single-family and multifamily housing inventory, which HUD acquires when borrowers default on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). According to HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2001 annual performance report, the Secretary holds single-family property with a value of about $2.4 billion and multifamily property with a value of about $750 million as of September 30, 2001. In its single-family program, HUD contracts for management and marketing contractors who are responsible for securing, maintaining, and selling the houses that HUD acquires when the owners default on their loans. HUD also contracts for property management services, such as on-site management, rent collection, and maintenance, for multifamily properties it acquires through foreclosure. HUD\u2019s two largest multifamily property management contractors have an obligated value of about $650 million over 5 years.", "Contracting is conducted in HUD\u2019s Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) in Washington D.C., or by one of HUD\u2019s three Field Contracting Operations (FCO) offices located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; and Denver, Colorado. OCPO contracts for information technology and other services in support of HUD headquarters. FCO offices primarily contract for services related to the business operations of HUD\u2019s field offices and specialized centers. For example, contracting officers in one FCO assist HUD\u2019s two Multifamily Property Disposition Centers (located in Atlanta, Georgia, and Ft. Worth, Texas) in contracting for and overseeing the property management contractors that are responsible for the day-to-day management of foreclosed multifamily properties.", "HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing field offices and two Property Disposition Centers are responsible for the oversight of various programs to provide affordable multifamily housing.

HUD\u2019s multifamily housing field offices\u2014comprising 18 hub offices and their associated 33 program centers\u2014also contract for inspections of the construction of multifamily properties built under its FHA-insured and assisted multifamily housing programs, which are for the construction of housing for the elderly and disabled. Multifamily Housing has four full- time GTRs located in Atlanta and Ft. Worth who are responsible for monitoring most field multifamily contracts; two GTRs are assigned to the Property Disposition Centers and two are responsible for the construction inspection contracts.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) establishes uniform policies and procedures for acquisitions by all executive agencies. The FAR establishes procedures for all aspects of the contracting process, from solicitation to post award monitoring, including responsibilities of the various members of the acquisition team such as the contracting officer. Also in 1974, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Act created OFPP within the Office of Management and Budget to provide, among other things, governmentwide policies for agencies in procurement matters. OFPP\u2019s Guide to Best Practices for Contract Administration recommends the use of a contract administration plan for good contract administration. According to the guide, this plan should specify the performance outputs and describe the methodology used to conduct inspections of those outputs.", "HUD supplements the FAR through its own regulations called HUD\u2019s Acquisition Regulation (HUDAR) and its Procurement Policies and Procedures Handbook. The handbook specifies various monitoring tools that the GTR may use to monitor contractor performance, such as a quality assurance plan, a contractor\u2019s work plan and schedule of performance, or progress reports. The purpose of the monitoring is to ensure that (1) the contractor performs the services and/or delivers the products of the type and quality that the contract requires, (2) performance is along the most efficient lines of effort, (3) performance and deliverables are timely, (4) performance is within the total estimated cost, and (5) HUD will be able to properly intervene when performance is deficient. For example, according to the handbook, often the best way for a GTR to determine the quality of the contractor\u2019s performance is through an actual inspection of work or products. Inspections may be routine, unannounced, or a combination of the two, and the contract should specify any requirement for routine inspections, such as the frequency and dates, or other occurrences that would trigger an inspection. The handbook does not establish specific monitoring requirements, such as timetables for review or numbers of site visits; however, some of the policies established by individual program offices do include such requirements. For example, the Office of Multifamily Housing\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures No. 5 requires that HUD staff visit construction sites at least twice during construction to verify the performance of the inspection contractor who is responsible for inspecting actual construction of the project.", "The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires executive agencies, through consultations with OFPP, to establish education, training, and experience requirements for acquisition workforces at civilian agencies. Under implementing guidance issued by OFPP, an agency\u2019s acquisition workforce\u2014including its contracting officers, contract specialists, purchasing agents, contracting officer representatives, and contracting officer technical representatives\u2014must meet an established set of contracting competencies. In addition, OFPP has identified specific training requirements for personnel in the contracting and purchasing occupation series. OFPP further required that agencies have policies and procedures that specify career paths and mandatory training requirements for acquisition positions and that agencies collect and maintain standardized information on the training of its acquisition workforce.", "A strong internal control system provides the framework for accomplishing management objectives, accurate financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations. Effective internal controls, including monitoring, serve as checks and balances against undesired actions, thereby providing reasonable assurance that resources are effectively managed and accounted for. A lack of effective internal controls puts an entity at risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Monitoring is a particularly critical management control tool for HUD because its housing programs rely extensively on various third parties, such as contractors, to achieve HUD\u2019s goals. For many years, HUD has been the subject of criticism for management and oversight weaknesses that have made its programs vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In January 2001, we recognized the credible progress that HUD had made in improving its management and operations, and we reduced the number of HUD program areas deemed to be high risk to two of its major program areas\u2014single family mortgage insurance and rental housing assistance. These program areas include the single family and multifamily property disposition activities cited earlier and comprise about two-thirds of HUD\u2019s budget.", "We, HUD\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) have reported on weaknesses in HUD\u2019s contract administration and monitoring of contractors\u2019 performance over several years. For example, starting in 1998, we reported on the performance of HUD\u2019s single-family contractors\u2014that HUD did not have an adequate system in place to assess its field offices\u2019 oversight of real estate asset management contractors. In three offices that we reviewed, none of the offices adequately performed all of the functions needed to ensure that the contractors met their contractual obligation to maintain and protect HUD-owned properties. HUD\u2019s OIG completed a comprehensive review of HUD\u2019s contracting operations in 1997 and found that a lack of adequate planning, needs assessment, good initial planning, monitoring, and cost control on several multimillion dollar contracts left HUD vulnerable to waste and abuse. The OIG found contract monitoring to be very lax throughout the program areas. The GTRs and GTMs had a poor understanding of their roles and responsibilities, allowing HUD to be overbilled, improperly authorizing contract tasks, accepting less than complete contract work without financial credits or adjustments, and could not document whether certain tasks were completed. In a followup review in 1999, the OIG reported that HUD\u2019s reforms had laid the groundwork for an effective acquisition process; however, they concluded that HUD\u2019s contracting attitudes and practices had not changed significantly. In May 1997, NAPA, reported that HUD\u2019s procurement process took too long; FHA\u2019s oversight of contracted services was inadequate; and FHA sometimes used contracting techniques that limited competition. In 1999, NAPA issued its final report on the results of their study and noted that HUD had made progress toward improving its procurement processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Increased Contracting Activities and Taken Steps to Improve Acquisition Management", "paragraphs": ["HUD\u2019s contracting obligations have been on an upward trend in recent years; HUD reports that its contracting obligations increased from about $786 million in fiscal year 1997 to almost $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2000 (in 2001 constant dollars), or about a 62 percent increase within 5 years.Much of this increase in contracting activity is compensating for staff reductions in the early 1990\u2019s from about 13,500 to about 9,000 by March 1998 and the need to contract out for activities previously done by HUD employees, and for new functions, such as the physical building inspections of public housing and multifamily insured projects, initiated under recent management reforms. Figure 2  shows the change in HUD\u2019s contracting dollars from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2000 (in 2001 constant dollars).", "With recent management reform initiatives, HUD now contracts out for many activities formerly done by HUD employees, as well as for new functions. For example, HUD\u2019s Homeownership Centers (HOC) hired contractors to review single-family loan files and issue mortgage insurance. HUD staff, which formerly performed these functions, then became contract monitors. HOCs also contracted out for a new type of contractor to manage and market acquired single-family properties. They also awarded other contracts to inspect 10 percent of the properties handled by each of the management and marketing contractors and review 10 percent of the management and marketing contractors\u2019 property case files each month. HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing contracted out work previously done by HUD employees that included inspections of repairs and inspections during construction of insured and assisted multifamily properties.", "The department expects its reliance on contracting to continue on an upward trend. Although HUD\u2019s Deputy Secretary has expressed an interest in possibly returning some of this contract work to HUD employees, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget proposed that federal agencies make at least 5 percent of the full-time equivalent positions that are determined to be commercial activities subject to competition between public and private sectors in fiscal year 2002 and an additional 10 percent in fiscal year 2003. HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget set a goal of opening 290 additional HUD positions to competition in fiscal year 2003 and an additional 580 positions in fiscal year 2004. HUD is also planning to renew some of its major contracts in the near future that involve substantial financial commitments over an extended period of time. HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2002 procurement forecast includes plans to award new contracts for its major multifamily property management activities, with an expected cost of $800 million over 5 years.

For example, HUD instituted full-time GTR positions in its program offices to assist in contract administration. HUD also created a GTR certification program in 1998 to establish standard training requirements for HUD staff who serve as GTRs and to provide them with an understanding of the federal contracting process as implemented at HUD. In addition to classroom training, HUD has also developed on-line GTR training to supplement the classroom training.", "In 1997, HUD created a centralized management information system, called the HUD Procurement System (HPS), to assist in managing its contracts. HUD upgraded the system in fiscal year 1998 to consolidate and combine headquarters and field contracting data and to improve integration with HUD\u2019s financial systems. As a result, for the first time HUD had one source for contracting data. In 1999, the HUD Office of Inspector General recognized that HUD had shown substantial strides in automating the department\u2019s procurement data and establishing the necessary financial linkages to integrate HPS with HUD\u2019s core accounting system.", "HUD also hired a Chief Procurement Officer and created a Contract Management Review Board in 1998 to improve contract administration and procurement planning. The Contract Management Review Board reviews all contracts over $500,000 to provide a departmentwide planning perspective. In addition, HUD has increased its training budget for those in acquisition positions (i.e., $66,871 in fiscal year 2000 to $163,537 in fiscal year 2002).", "In addition, HUD has implemented a compliance and monitoring initiative in order to assist staff in prioritizing their responsibilities and directing their resources. This initiative, although not specifically targeted to contract monitoring, emphasizes the importance of risk-based approaches to monitoring. HUD reported that over 1,200 staff were trained through fiscal year 2001, and the department\u2019s fiscal year 2003 annual performance plan anticipates increasing the number of trained staff to more than 2,000.", "Despite the improvements HUD has undertaken, we have continued to identify deficiencies in HUD\u2019s acquisition management.

We concluded that HUD\u2019s acquisition management was one of the significant challenges facing HUD in its attempts to sustain the progress of its management reform and move toward its goal of becoming a high-performing organization.

HUD\u2019s Procurement Policies and Procedures Handbook provides a framework for the monitoring of contractors and establishes various monitoring tools that GTRs should use to ensure that contractors are held accountable for results, including a contract administration plan, a quality assurance plan, and a contractor\u2019s work plan and schedule of performance. However, our review of 43 active contracts out of 49 contracts administered by HUD\u2019s Office of Multifamily Housing found that the GTRs on 30 of these contracts\u201470 percent\u2014did not make use of any of these plans. Among these plans, OFPP\u2019s Guide to Best Practices for Contract Administration describes a contract administration plan as essential for good contract administration. According to OFPP, this plan must specify the performance outputs and describe the methodology used to conduct inspections of those outputs. According to our survey, only 23 percent of HUD\u2019s GTRs use contract administration plans and 32 percent reported that they had never heard of such a plan. In 1999, HUD\u2019s Inspector General found that HUD\u2019s various offices did not consistently develop and implement formal contract monitoring plans and recommended that HUD develop and disseminate a model comprehensive contract-monitoring plan for HUD-wide GTR use. In our review of active multifamily housing contracts, we found that although HUD reported to the Inspector General it had implemented this recommendation, there was no evidence of such a model comprehensive contract-monitoring plan in use by Multifamily Housing.", "In addition to its limited use of monitoring plans, HUD has not effectively incorporated a risk-based approach into its process for overseeing contractors. In recent years, HUD has emphasized developing risk-based approaches to managing and monitoring its programs, including establishing a Risk Management Division within the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and developing a training program and desk guide to help staff understand and prioritize their monitoring responsibilities. However, we found little evidence that the concept of risk-based management is used in HUD\u2019s oversight of its contracts. Our past work found that HUD\u2019s efforts to perform risk-based monitoring and performance evaluations on its single family property disposition contractors met with limited results\u2014some field offices did not perform required assessments while, others did not perform them as often as required.", "Our more recent work in HUD\u2019s multifamily program found little evidence that the concept of risk management or risk-based monitoring has been applied to contract oversight. Acquisition workforce staff said they were unaware of any requirements to apply a risk-based methodology to their monitoring efforts, and we saw no evidence of any formal risk assessments in our review of the Multifamily program\u2019s 43 active contract files. While staff indicated that a risk-based approach would be useful, they generally told us that monitoring is conducted based on the availability of travel funds and location of staff, or after a significant contractor performance problem has been identified.", "A key component to developing effective monitoring plans and incorporating risk-based approaches to monitoring is tracking past and current contractor performance; however, we found little evidence that HUD tracks contractor performance systematically. The HUD Procurement System (HPS) allows its acquisition workforce across HUD\u2019s programs to track contract milestones and deliverable dates, as well as document and record contractor performance information\u2014information that could aid in the contract monitoring process. However, we found that these data fields are often not used. The scheduled deliverable date data field was left blank 35 percent of the time, and the contractor performance data field was incomplete in 73 percent of contracts that are inactive and closed. The Deputy Secretary directed that effective January 2000 contractor products and performance would be tracked in HPS, initially for all new contracts over $1 million.", "Contractor oversight problems in HUD\u2019s multifamily housing programs are further compounded by the lack of clearly defined GTR and GTM roles. For example, in the Multifamily Property Disposition Centers, GTR and GTM roles and responsibilities are not defined consistent with HUD\u2019s policy, possibly resulting in gaps in the monitoring process. HUD\u2019s Procurement Policies and Procedures Handbook states that \u201ca GTR or GTM may not provide any direction to the contractor in those areas of responsibility assigned to another GTR or GTM,\u201d so as to avoid providing potentially conflicting guidance. However, the Multifamily Property Disposition Centers modified their contracts to change any place where the term \u201cGTR\u201d is used to the term \u201cGTR/GTM\u201d instead. The effect of this change is that the GTRs and GTMs would have the same responsibilities, which is what the guidance sought to avoid so that conflicting instructions could not be given to the contractors. The roles are further complicated by a decision the Property Disposition Centers made to name managers as GTMs on the two property management contracts, in one case assigning the Center Director as a GTM. HUD\u2019s handbook states that the GTR is responsible for monitoring GTM activities. By designating managers as GTMs, HUD has created a situation in which the property management GTRs are essentially overseeing the work of their supervisor or of someone in a management position, in a reporting line above them.", "As noted above, HUD is attempting to improve its oversight and monitoring of contractors. For example, Multifamily Housing implemented a structure in which four full-time GTRs will provide oversight for procurement actions of more than $100,000 in the field. The Property Disposition Center has also developed GTR and GTM protocols for the various types of services for which it contracts out, in an attempt to more clearly define the roles and responsibilities of these positions.

HUD\u2019s oversight and monitoring of contractors consists mainly of reviews by HUD staff of progress reports and invoices prepared by the contractors, as well as email correspondence and telephone conversations between HUD staff and contractors. Site visits to multifamily properties to oversee contractor activities do not occur on a routine basis, particularly for the two largest multifamily housing program contracts, which constitute a total value of almost $650 million in obligations over 5 years for the management of HUD\u2019s inventory of foreclosed multifamily properties. Although HUD\u2019s multifamily property disposition handbook calls for GTRs or GTMs to conduct quarterly on-site physical inspections of the properties, the specific guidance related to that requirement has not yet been developed.", "Site visits do not routinely occur largely because the properties in HUD\u2019s property disposition inventory are located throughout the country, while the GTRs and GTMs responsible for the oversight of these properties are located in Atlanta, Georgia, and Ft. Worth, Texas, with the exception of one GTM located in New York City, New York. A consistent theme among the GTRs and GTMs we interviewed is that they believe that in order to effectively do their jobs, they should probably be conducting a greater number of on-site visits, but they lack the time and resources that would allow them to do so. Some noted that the failure to visit the properties stems from the workload\u2014the GTM\u2019s are assigned multiple properties under the property management contracts that are usually not in good condition and are located in different parts of the country\u2014and that it is difficult to keep up with everything that needs to be done. Restraints on travel funds were often cited as the reason for not making visits.", "The property disposition center staff are not the only multifamily housing staff experiencing difficulties making on-site visits to assess contractor performance. HUD also contracts with inspectors who monitor construction of HUD-assisted and insured multifamily projects throughout the phases of construction and during the 1 year warranty period after completion of construction. HUD\u2019s construction inspection guidance requires that HUD employees make at least two site visits during construction to assess the performance of the construction inspectors. However, GTMs for these contracts also report being unable to make site visits, due to other job responsibilities and because the projects are dispersed over a wide geographic area and HUD lacks the necessary travel funds. GTMs for these inspection contracts told us that they primarily rely on reviews of reports from the contractors to assess the contractors\u2019 performance.", "To address its inability to do more on-site monitoring, the multifamily housing program uses another inspection contractor to visit selected properties and perform property management reviews of some properties managed by the two property management contractors. However, according to data maintained by HUD, this inspection contractor made 31 visits to 26 properties for the Atlanta Property Disposition Center since 1997, although the property management contractor managed over 100 properties during that period. The inspection contractor was not used at all by the Ft. Worth Property Disposition Center for the almost 150 properties in its inventory. We also found that in those cases where the inspection contractor identified a problem, HUD does not routinely follow up on those deficiencies to make certain the problems have been resolved. Instead, the multifamily housing program staff accepted correspondence from the property management contractors as evidence that deficiencies were resolved. According to staff, HUD does not routinely follow up because of limited resources. HUD will sometimes make a site visit to verify that the problems have been resolved, but field staff told us that there normally are not enough travel funds to make a special follow-up visit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Monitoring Limit HUD\u2019s Ability to Prevent Contractor Fraud, Waste, or Abuse", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in HUD\u2019s monitoring processes limit the department\u2019s ability to identify and correct contractor performance problems, hold contractors accountable, and assure itself that it is receiving the services for which it pays.", "We have reported that HUD has experienced similar difficulties monitoring the contractors that are responsible for managing and disposing of its foreclosed single-family properties for several years. In 1998, we reported that although HUD\u2019s single-family guidance establishes various methods for monitoring the performance of its single-family real estate asset management contractors, such as conducting monthly on-site property inspections, these methods were not consistently used in a way that would assure HUD that contractors were meeting their contractual obligations. Without adequate on-site inspection, HUD could not be assured that it was receiving the services for which it had paid. We found similar conditions in May 2000 when we reviewed the new marketing and management contractors HUD acquired to replace the earlier contractors, and in July 2001, we found that HUD\u2019s oversight of these contractors remained inadequate  As recently as February 2002, in audits of HUD\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the independent auditor identified HUD\u2019s monitoring of its single-family property inventory as a significant internal control deficiency.

As we reported, one of HUD\u2019s multifamily property management contractors bypassed HUD\u2019s controls on numerous occasions by (1) alleging that construction renovations were emergencies, thus not requiring multiple bids or HUD pre-approval, and (2) splitting renovations into multiple projects to stay below the $50,000 threshold of HUD required approval. Over 18 months HUD authorized and paid for approximately $10 million of renovations, of which each invoice was for less than $50,000, at two properties.

The Chief Financial Officer sponsors the system. All HUD offices use HUDCAPS to control and manage administrative and program budgets. For example, since fiscal year 2000, the obligations and expenditures for all of FHA\u2019s administrative contracts (i.e., headquarters and field) are processed from the HUDCAPS system. PAS & LOCCS are two financial systems that are integrated. PAS is the project- level funds control system and is used to record, control, and report on the commitment, obligation, and expenditure of funds. LOCCS is the payment control system that is used by those requesting payments. Together, PAS& LOCCS is an accounting system that tracks the reservation, obligation, and expenditure of funds, and it is the department\u2019s primary disbursement and cash management system for the majority of HUD programs. For example, obligations and expenditures associated with the Office of Public and Indian Housing\u2019s (PIH) contracts are tracked in these systems. Further, prior to fiscal year 2000, LOCCS was the financial system that maintained information on FHA\u2019s administrative contracts in the field. The Chief Financial Officer sponsors this system. SAMS tracks information on single-family properties that HUD acquires due to foreclosure; the system tracks the property from acquisition to sale and the system is used to manage the properties. For example, this system tracks the expenditures that are associated with contracts for services provided by closing agents; this system does not track obligations. CCARS tracks and disburses funds received by FHA, from the Department of the Treasury, to various internal FHA offices. These funds are received electronically and are downloaded into the CCARS database daily. Prior to FY 2000, CCARS maintained obligation and expenditure information on FHA\u2019s administrative contracts in headquarters. CSMS/PMS tracks HUD-held Multifamily properties and certain HUD-held defaulted notes, which are in mortgagee-in-possession (MIP) status.   CSMS/PMS performs several management and accounting functions for these properties (e.g., property management, tax servicing, tenant leases, accounts receivable, accounts payable and disbursements processing, financial accounting, and management reports). A HUD contractor maintains CSMS/PMS. Macola is Ginnie Mae\u2019s financial system.

HUD has defined its acquisition workforce to include contract officers, contracting specialists, purchasing agents, GTRs, and GTMs. Therefore, our report recommends that HUD assess the skills and capabilities of its existing acquisition workforce, not simply the contract officers and contracting specialists in the 1102 series. 2.  We believe that the report accurately and properly distinguishes the different acquisition positions at HUD--including GTRs, GTMs, and various OCPO staff--and accurately reflects the federal training requirements associated with these positions.  Specifically, the Clinger- Cohen Act mandates that executive agencies, through consultations with OFPP, establish specific education, training, and experience requirements for acquisition workforces.  Under implementing guidance issued by OFPP, an agency\u2019s acquisition workforce\u2014 including its contracting officers, contract specialists, purchasing agents, contracting officer representatives, and contracting officer technical representatives, which HUD calls GTRs\u2014must meet an established set of contracting competencies.  HUD has developed a GTR training program in response to federal requirements; however, we found that a significant portion of staff serving in this capacity have not received this training.  In addition, HUD has identified GTMs as part of its acquisition workforce and HUD\u2019s policies permit the duties and responsibilities of GTRs to be delegated to GTMs; and its draft Acquisition Career Management Plan\u2014which establishes training requirements for HUD\u2019s acquisition workforce\u2014states that the GTR training requirements also apply to GTMs.  Therefore, we remain concerned that, according to HUD\u2019s records, a significant portion of the department\u2019s GTRs have not received training and that 93 percent of GTMs have not received any specialized acquisition training. 3.  We agree that GTMs may not require the same level of training as GTRs; however, HUD policies and handbooks indicate that providing acquisition training to GTMs is necessary and is part of its intent.  And therefore, as discussed in comment 2, we remain concerned that, according to HUD\u2019s records, 93 percent of GTMs have not received any specialized acquisition training.  We revised the report to reflect the increases in HUD\u2019s training budgets discussed in its response. 4.  As discussed in comment 2, we recognize that HUD is providing required training to some members of its acquisition workforce and we are encouraged by HUD\u2019s plans to assess the training needed for GTRs and GTMs to more effectively monitor contractor performance. However, we remain concerned that not all components of HUD\u2019s acquisition workforce are receiving the required training and, based on the reasons discussed in comment 2, we made no changes to our conclusions or recommendations. 5.  We recognize that HUD has multiple information systems that are used to manage and monitor the department\u2019s contracting activities and that some might be better suited to track the deliverables of specific types of contracts than others.  However, we found that HUD staff were not utilizing HPS to its fullest potential, including its ability to track deliverables.  We clarified the wording in our report to make clear that we are not suggesting that HPS be used to track specific deliverables for all HUD contracts. 6.  HUD\u2019s emphasis on reviewing subcontractor work would not necessarily identify the improper payments we found.  The improprieties occurred, in part, because the vendors split the work into multiple invoices to fall below HUD\u2019s established threshold of review and subcontractor requirements.  HUD\u2019s plan to review the property management  subcontracting file documentation and on-site invoices to assure that work orders were not deliberately split to avoid competition and/or HUD approval is a step to assist in catching such irregularities; however, we believe that part of developing a risk-based approach and monitoring contractor performance is to include monitoring those disbursements made by the property management contractors that are under the dollar threshold for individual anomalies and unusual disbursement patterns to identify potentially improper billing practices. 7.  The review of improper payments that HUD refers to was part of a separate congressional request to review disbursement processes that are particularly susceptible to improper payments and determine whether improper payments occurred. Based on our review of the multifamily disbursements, it was evident that the existing internal controls would not prevent and detect improper payments in the normal course of business.  Consequently, a random sample approach was unnecessary, and we used our data mining approach to search for and identify irregularities that indicated the existence of possible improper payments.  While the annual financial statement audit is designed to broadly assess internal controls, the auditors would not necessarily focus their work on payments not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements. Our improper payments review was not limited by such constraints and therefore, could be a much more detailed analysis of the areas that we determined to be particularly susceptible to improper payments. 8.  We modified the report to reflect these clarifications."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above Amy Bevan, Dan Blair, J Bryant, Anne Cangi, Bonnie Derby, Eric Diamant, Colin Fallon, Evan Gilman, Barbara Johnson, Irvin McMasters, Andy O\u2019Connell, Mark Ramage, and Nico Sloss made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
