Agencies must design and administer merit promotion programs to ensure a systematic means of selection for promotion based on merit and these programs must conform to five key requirements outlined in title 5. GAO found that the USMS merit promotion plan, as revised in November 2016, aligned with each of these five requirements. For example, the first requirement states that agencies must establish merit-based procedures for promoting employees that are available in writing to candidates. The USMS merit promotion plan, which is available to employees, outlines such procedures.", "USMS is taking steps to improve how it monitors the implementation of the scoring component of its process to rate promotion applications, but lacks documented guidance to ensure consistent compliance with its merit promotion policy. GAO found that USMS does not adequately monitor the rating process, which allowed for conflicts of interest with raters who may compete with candidates whose applications they score. USMS also does not monitor the rating process to ensure that raters complied with a key requirement\u2014that raters decline to score applications of candidates with whom there is a conflict of interest, such as a supervisor-employee relationship. USMS is implementing a process change that, if implemented effectively, can address these two deficiencies. The new process entails having a third-party contractor, rather than USMS employees, determine candidates' scores. Finally, GAO found that USMS lacks documented guidance on rater scoring. USMS only provides verbal guidance to instruct raters on how to score the experience category of merit promotion packages, creating inconsistent application of the guidelines. Employees GAO met with expressed the view that such discrepancies create the perception that the rating process is unfairly subjective. Developing clear and specific documented guidance on how raters should apply the benchmark guidelines could minimize scoring inconsistency and potential rater subjectivity for both the current rating process and the new competency-based assessment.", "USMS has taken limited steps to understand and address employee concerns about the promotion process. An estimated 41 percent of USMS respondents to the 2016 Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey strongly disagreed or disagreed that USMS promotions are merit-based, while 34 percent strongly agreed or agreed, and 25 percent neither agreed nor disagreed. During discussion groups GAO held at four USMS district locations across the U.S., employees frequently expressed negative views and many indicated low or no trust that the process is fair and merit-based. Although USMS has acknowledged employees' negative perceptions of the promotion process, it has not developed an agency-wide action plan in accordance with federal guidance to better understand the nature and causes of employee concerns across districts and divisions. Providing specific and consistent information to employees about key steps in the merit promotion process and internal management decisions could improve transparency and help mitigate employee perceptions of favoritism that have negatively impacted employee morale."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USMS develop specific rater guidance and develop and implement an agency-wide action plan to better understand and address employee concerns, among other steps.

For example, based on this review  USMS revised its scoring process to remove points awarded to  candidates for service in an acting (temporary promotion) capacity.  Furthermore, in November 2016, a Senate Judiciary Committee report on  improper hiring practices and whistleblower reprisal noted that USMS had  begun implementing changes in response to the January 2016 JMD  review, such as incorporating and elaborating on restrictions against  nepotism.

We selected these sites  based on a range of geographic locations and a medium-to-large district  size to obtain a wide representation of employees and maximize the pool  of employees available to meet with us. At each location, we interviewed  the U.S. Marshal and Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal, and conducted  separate discussion groups with GS-14, GS-13, and GS-12 level law  enforcement employees. For the discussion groups, we used a structured  interview questionnaire, which focused on implementation of USMS merit  promotion processes and potential concerns about merit promotion  practices. Collectively, we met with a total of 93 USMS employees,  including 4 U.S. Marshals, 4 GS-15 Chief Deputy U.S. Marshals, 7 GS-14  Assistant Chief Deputy U.S. Marshals and Chief Inspectors, 24 GS-13  Criminal Investigators (which included both supervisors and non- supervisors), and 54 GS-12 Deputy U.S. Marshals.

Employees seeking a lateral reassignment to  another district or division are not required to submit a merit promotion  application package during the open season, but instead submit  documentation to the merit promotion staff to confirm their eligibility for a  lateral reassignment. Thus, a GS-13 employee who serves as a rater may  directly compete as a lateral candidate with a GS-12 employee seeking a  promotion to the same position. Some USMS employees in our  discussion groups expressed the view that the rating process is biased  due to this potential conflict of interest.

Specifically, USMS guidance states that raters are  expected to decline to score a candidate\u2019s application if there is a conflict  of interest with the candidate, for example, a former employee or  supervisor relationship or a close personal relationship. USMS officials  explained that using two raters to score each merit promotion application  is intended to mitigate personal bias. However, during our discussion  groups, 4 employees who had served as raters said they had directly  observed raters scoring applications for employees with whom there  existed possible conflicts of interest. Additionally, 18 employees in our  discussion groups told us they had heard from colleagues who served on  rating panels that raters have used personal knowledge of candidates to  influence their scoring. Another 16 employees expressed a related  concern that raters can see the names of the applicants they are scoring.

In February 2017, during the course of our review, USMS  announced a planned change to the process the agency uses to assess  the experience component of candidate applications. Under the existing  process, USMS raters collectively score the experience narrative  component, which helps determine the overall merit promotion score. The  planned change entails having a third-party contractor, rather than USMS  employees, determine candidates\u2019 competency scores using a scenario- based competency assessment. As part of the new process, USMS also  updated the scoring rubric based on the new competency assessment,  which includes the elimination of the experience category (see table 3).", "USMS started to implement this change to the process during the  summer 2017 promotion cycle for GS-13 promotions.

According to USMS officials, they typically  use temporary promotions to fill open positions between merit promotion  cycles. A temporary promotion may also be used to temporarily promote  a GS-14 employee to the Chief Deputy position in the event a U.S.  Marshal resigns and the Chief Deputy becomes the acting U.S. Marshal.  According to title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the USMS  Merit Promotion Plan, individual employees may receive noncompetitive  temporary promotions or details to a higher-graded position, or a position  with known promotion potential, if the total time spent in any  noncompetitive position is 120 days or less within a 12-month  timeframe. USMS may also fill open positions between cycles using  another type of temporary promotion for up to one year; however,  employees are required to compete for temporary promotions beyond 120  days through the merit promotion process. These requirements help  USMS use a systematic process of selection according to merit. We  analyzed all 844 noncompetitive temporary promotion selections (of 120  days or less) from October 2015 through February 2017 and found 9  instances in which the USMS exceeded the regulatory limit of 120 days  for individual employees. These 9 instances exceeded the statutory limit  by approximately 30 days on average, while ranging from 5 days to 103  days.", "USMS officials acknowledged that because they manually enter the  noncompetitive temporary promotion end dates into the system that  contains the temporary promotions data, they have made errors in  reviewing these dates, such as incorrectly adding dates for candidates  who have received multiple noncompetitive temporary promotions that  exceeded a 12-month timeframe. According to HRD, this system has  internal checks and controls to ensure an employee\u2019s temporary  promotion does not go beyond the not-to-exceed date. For example, the  system does not allow an employee who received a noncompetitive  temporary promotion to a higher grade level to continue to be paid at the  higher level beyond the date the temporary promotion is set to expire  unless HRD processes an action to extend the promotion. Otherwise, to  ensure the employee continues to be paid, HRD must process an action  to revert the employee back to their original grade level. USMS officials  explained that they must manually review instances in which employees  receive multiple noncompetitive temporary promotions within a year, to  ensure the total time spent serving in these positions does not exceed  120 days during any 12-month period.", "Despite having identified relatively infrequent instances of non- compliance, we note that agencies are required to comply with federal  regulations. As a result of our review, USMS took immediate steps to  strengthen its internal controls to ensure its compliance with these  temporary promotion regulations. Specifically, USMS reported to us that  they developed a spreadsheet to help staffing specialists correctly  calculate the number of days the employee is eligible for a temporary  promotion.

For example, they stated that some raters determined  scores based on whether a candidate\u2019s narrative contained the specific  language in the benchmark. Other raters, by contrast, determined scores  based on whether the candidate met the intent of the benchmark,  regardless of whether the candidate included the specific language in the  benchmark. As a result, employees in our discussion groups explained  that highly qualified candidates with relevant management and  supervisory experience may receive a low experience score if a rater  determines that the candidate did not use the exact language appearing  in the benchmarks.", "Furthermore, 70 of 85 employees (82 percent) expressed the view that  inconsistent scoring of similarly qualified candidates creates the  perception that the rating process is unfairly subjective. Specifically, they  asserted that comparable candidates with similar types of experience  have received vastly different scores depending on which raters scored  their applications. Two employees in different districts also said that they  re-submitted the same experience narrative as the prior year, and  received a significantly different score each year. Additionally,  approximately 20 employees contended that raters may be influenced by  their own professional experiences. For example, raters who have  operational experiences that are different from candidates\u2019 experiences  may not sufficiently understand the duties or professional experiences  described by candidates. Consequently, they argued, these raters may be  limited in their ability to fairly rate some candidates\u2019 experiences.", "Although USMS is implementing a new competency assessment process  for GS-13 merit promotions, it is not clear at this time whether the new  process will address concerns about inconsistent rater scoring because  the agency plans to use new benchmarks that were developed by a third- party contractor in collaboration with USMS subject matter experts to  determine candidate scores. According to USMS officials, the new  process will entail professionally trained assessors using evaluation  guidelines to assess how well USMS promotion candidates respond to  scenario-based questions. In collaboration with the contractor, USMS  also developed evaluation guidelines that include plans for monitoring  quality assurance over the rating process. For example, according to  USMS officials, the third-party contractor will conduct random spot checks  to assess the consistency with which raters apply the new benchmarks  and will provide USMS a report on the results of the quality assurance  monitoring. However, given that USMS implemented these changes near  the end of our review, we did not assess the implementation of the new  process or the related quality assurance monitoring. Furthermore, until  USMS determines a timeframe for implementing the new competency  assessment at the GS-14 and GS-15 levels, the current rating process  will remain in effect.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for agency  management to determine the consistency with which controls are  applied.

While most employees (51 of 70, or  73 percent) answered that sometimes qualified candidates get promoted;  several explained during our discussion groups that they believe the  promotion of less qualified\u2014or unqualified\u2014employees occurs frequently  enough to affect morale. Further, 47 of 84 employees (56 percent) noted  that morale has deteriorated as a result of merit promotion processes or  selections.

From  their perspective, there have been instances where candidates with high  promotion package scores and good reputations as supervisors have not  been promoted, while lower scoring candidates with poor reputations as  supervisors who have personal relationships with decision-makers have  been promoted. Further, 36 employees in our discussion groups said they  believed that career-enhancing opportunities, such as temporary  promotions, which improve employees\u2019 promotion potential by providing  them with directly related experience in positions for which they may be  competing, are often provided unfairly to employees based on personal  relationships.", "Employees in our discussion groups also expressed the view that some  employees receive more guidance on their application from supervisors  than do others, which they attributed to favoritism. As part of the merit  promotion process, supervisors are required to verify the experience  statements submitted by candidates. We found that among the limited  number of supervisors with whom we met, there were varying  interpretations of their responsibility in meeting this requirement.  Specifically, 1 supervisor viewed his role as strictly verifying the  experience and providing no further input. However, 7 other supervisors  viewed their role as providing guidance and mentorship to employees by  offering advice for improving candidate applications. Finally, 5 additional  supervisors said they provided additional guidance to employees only  when specifically requested. Of the 85 employees in our discussion  groups, 28 indicated that they believed supervisors helped certain  candidates develop their merit promotion packages, which provides an  unfair advantage over candidates who do not receive such guidance.", "Additionally, nine employees raised concerns that USMS has sometimes  expanded certificate of eligibles lists inconsistent with USMS policy to  include preselected, favored candidates. According to the USMS Merit  Promotion Plan, if there are more than five candidates applying for a  position, at least the top five scoring candidates will generally be included  on the list and subsequently referred for candidate selection. In some  circumstances, more than five eligible candidates are allowed to be  placed on the list. For example, if there is a tie for the last position on the  list, all candidates with that score will be included. Additionally,  candidates with a score within one point from the fifth highest scoring  candidate would also be included on the list. Finally, if there are multiple  vacancies for the same position (same series, grade, title, and location),  one additional name for each vacancy may be added to the list.", "To examine USMS compliance with this policy, we analyzed certificate of  eligibles lists and the corresponding candidate scores for fiscal years  2015 and 2016. For fiscal year 2015, we examined all 213 position  vacancies and found 2 instances where additional candidates were  included on the list inconsistent with USMS\u2019 established policy.  Specifically, these 2 lists contained the names of candidates with scores  that were more than one point below the fifth highest-scoring candidate,  and of these 2 instances, 1 candidate was promoted. For fiscal year  2016, we examined all 224 position vacancies and did not find any  inconsistencies with USMS\u2019 established policy.", "Whistleblowers who raised concerns about improper promotion practices  to Congress had alleged that USMS managers used selective placement  factors to limit competition for certain positions or to tailor vacancy  announcements for preselected, favored candidates. Similarly, five  employees in our discussion groups expressed the view that USMS used  selective placement factors to limit competition or pre-select certain  candidates.

In fiscal year  2015, there were 213 vacancy announcement positions, and 12  contained selective placement factors. We found USMS had not  completed a job analysis justification for any one of these 12  announcements. In fiscal year 2016, there were 224 vacancy  announcements, and 15 contained selective placement factors. USMS  completed a job analysis justification for all 15. For part of fiscal year  2017, there were 171 vacancy announcements, and 23 contained  selective placement factors, each of which had a justification.

HRD officials also noted that as part of the new competency-based  assessment process, candidates will receive detailed instructions and  guidance on how candidates will be assessed for each competency. HRD  officials acknowledged that informing candidates about key merit  promotion steps, such as making the certificate of eligibles, would help  improve transparency and employee morale.

In an update provided to DOJ  on plans for addressing employee engagement challenges identified in  the FEVS, USMS reported that the primary employee engagement  challenges are the geographical dispersal and management structure of  district offices (since USMS districts are led by political appointees, who  have different management styles). To address this challenge, USMS  disseminated an agency-wide memorandum emphasizing to all  employees that each employee and manager has an individual  responsibility to take action to improve engagement at the local level.
