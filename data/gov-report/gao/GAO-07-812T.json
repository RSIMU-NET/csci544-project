Project sponsors frequently identified two key issues for FTA to consider as it moves forward in implementing SAFETEA-LU changes: (1) further streamline the Small Starts program and (2) fully incorporate economic development as a criterion in the New Starts and Small Starts evaluation and rating processes. According to our analysis of the number and types of requirements for New Starts and Small Starts application processes, the Small Starts process has fewer requirements. However, project sponsors said that FTA should further streamline the process by, for example, eliminating requests for duplicate information requested in required worksheets. SAFETEA-LU added economic development to the list of project justification evaluation criteria that FTA must use to evaluate and rate projects. However, FTA currently assigns a weight of 50 percent each to cost-effectiveness and land use in calculating a project's overall rating--the other 4 statutorily identified criteria, including economic development, are not weighted. We previously reported that FTA's reliance on two evaluation criteria to calculate a project's overall rating is drifting away from the multiple-measure evaluation and rating process outlined in statute. Further, without a weight for economic development, project sponsors say, the evaluation and rating process does not reflect an important benefit of certain projects. FTA officials said they are currently working to develop an appropriate economic development measure as part of their upcoming rulemaking. The New Starts pipeline--that is, projects in different stages of planning--has changed in size and composition since the fiscal year 2001 evaluation and rating cycle, and a variety of factors have contributed to these changes. Since then, the number of projects in the New Starts pipeline has decreased by more than half. Additionally, the types of projects in the pipeline have changed during this time frame, as bus rapid transit projects are now more common than commuter or light rail projects. FTA officials attributed the decrease in the pipeline to their increased scrutiny of applications to help ensure that only the strongest projects enter the pipeline, and to their efforts to remove projects from the pipeline that were not advancing or did not adequately address identified problems. Project sponsors GAO interviewed provided other reasons for the pipeline's decrease, including that the New Starts process is too complex, time-consuming, and costly. Our survey results reflect many of these same reasons for the decline in the pipeline. Despite these concerns, GAO's survey of project sponsors indicates future demand for New Starts, Small Starts, and Very Small Starts funding. The sponsors GAO surveyed reported having 137 planned projects and intend to seek New Starts, Small Starts, or Very Small Starts funding for almost three-fourths of these projects.

As you  know, since the early 1970s, a significant portion of the federal  government\u2019s share of new capital investment in mass transportation has  come through the New Starts program. Through the New Starts program,  FTA identifies and recommends new fixed-guideway transit projects for  funding\u2014including heavy, light, and commuter rail; ferry; and certain bus  projects. Over the last decade, the New Starts program has provided state  and local agencies with over $10 billion to help design and construct  transit projects throughout the country.", "More recently, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation  Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) created, and FTA  implemented, what is commonly called the Small Starts program. This  program is intended to advance smaller-scale projects through an  expedited and streamlined evaluation and rating process. Small Starts  projects are defined as those with a total cost of less than $250 million,  and which require less than $75 million in funding from this program. FTA  subsequently introduced a new eligibility category within the Small Starts  program called Very Small Starts, which is for projects that have a total  capital cost of less than $50 million. Very Small Starts projects will qualify  for an even simpler and more expedited evaluation and rating process than  Small Starts projects. In July 2006, FTA issued interim guidance on the  Small Starts and Very Small Starts programs to govern the administration  of the programs until the final rule is issued. FTA expects the final rule to  be issued April 2008.", "Although SAFETEA-LU made a number of changes to the New Starts  program, including the creation of the Small Starts program, it also  maintained many program requirements imposed by previous authorizing  legislation. For example, SAFETEA-LU, like the Transportation Equity Act  for the 21st Century, directs FTA to prioritize projects for funding by  evaluating, rating, and recommending potential projects on the basis of  specific financial commitment and project justification criteria\u2014including  mobility improvements, cost-effectiveness, economic development, land  use, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. Using these  statutorily identified criteria, FTA evaluates potential projects annually  and as a condition for advancement into each phase of the process,  including preliminary engineering, final design, and construction. FTA  refers to projects in the preliminary engineering or final design phases as  the \u201cpipeline\u201d through which successful projects advance to receive  funding.", "My testimony today examines (1) FTA\u2019s implementation of SAFETEA-LU  changes to the New Starts program, (2) the extent and nature of changes  in the New Starts pipeline since the fiscal year 2001 evaluation and rating  cycle, and factors that have contributed to trends in the program; and (3)  projected trends for the New Starts and Small Starts pipelines. My  comments are based on our ongoing work for the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs as well as our body of work on the New Starts  program. We plan to complete our ongoing work and report in full to the  Committees this summer. For our ongoing work, we surveyed all project  sponsors that are located in urbanized areas with populations over 200,000  and that have an annual ridership of over 1 million. In total, we surveyed  215 project sponsors, asking them about their past experiences with the  New Starts program and plans to apply to the program in the future. Of the  215 project sponsors, 166 project sponsors responded to the survey\u2014for a  survey response rate of 77 percent. We also interviewed 15 project  sponsors, including all 10 sponsors who applied for the Small Starts and  Very Small Starts programs for the fiscal year 2008 evaluation cycle. The  other 5 project sponsors were selected on the basis of their agencies\u2019  experience with the New Starts process, size, and location. In addition, we  interviewed FTA officials and representatives from industry associations.  We also reviewed FTA\u2019s guidance on the New Starts and Small Starts  programs, the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) for  Small Starts, and the provisions of SAFETEA-LU and of its predecessor,  the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), that address  the New Starts program. We conducted our work from November 2006  through April 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.", "FTA has made progress in implementing SAFETEA-LU changes, including  issuing guidance for the New Starts program and interim guidance for the  Small Starts program.

In addition, the types of projects in the  pipeline have changed, as bus rapid transit projects are now more  common than commuter or light rail projects, although they still represent  a small amount of the total cost for all projects in the pipeline. FTA  officials and project sponsors offered different reasons for the decrease in  the New Starts pipeline. FTA officials said that they had increased their  scrutiny of applications to help ensure that only the strongest projects  enter the pipeline. According to these officials, they took steps to remove  projects from the pipeline that were not advancing or that did not  adequately address identified problems\u2014although the officials noted that  most project sponsors voluntarily withdrew projects from the pipeline  rather than having FTA remove them. Project sponsors we interviewed  provided other reasons for the decrease in the New Starts pipeline. In  particular, they maintained that the New Starts process is too complex,  time-consuming, and costly. Our survey results confirm some of the  reasons offered by project sponsors. Among the project sponsors we  surveyed with completed transit projects, the most common reasons given  for not applying to the New Starts program was that the process is too  lengthy or that the sponsor wanted to move the project along faster than  could be done in the New Starts process. About two-thirds of these project  sponsors reported that their most recent project was eligible for the New  Starts program, yet more than one-fourth of them did not apply to the  program. The lengthy nature of the New Starts process is due, at least in  part, to the rigorous and systematic evaluation and rating process  established by law\u2014which we have previously noted could serve as a  model for other transportation programs. FTA has recognized that the  process can be lengthy and in 2006, FTA commissioned a study to  examine, among other issues, opportunities for accelerating and  simplifying the process for implementing the New Starts program.

Project sponsors  we surveyed also indicated that they were considering a range of project  type alternatives in their planning. The most commonly cited alternatives  were bus rapid transit and light rail. Our survey results also indicate that,  through its Small Starts and Very Small Starts programs, FTA is attracting  project sponsors that would not otherwise apply for the New Starts  program or have not previously applied to the New Starts program.

FTA generally funds New Starts projects through full funding  grant agreements (FFGA), which establish the terms and conditions for  federal participation in a New Starts project. FFGAs also define a project\u2019s  scope, including the length of the system and the number of stations; its  schedule, including the date when the system is expected to open for  service; and its cost.", "For a project to obtain an FFGA, it must progress through a local or  regional review of alternatives and meet a number of federal requirements,  including requirements for information used in the New Starts evaluation  and rating process (see fig. 1). New Starts projects must emerge from a  regional, multimodal transportation planning process. The first two phases  of the New Starts process\u2014systems planning and alternatives analysis\u2014 address this requirement. The systems planning phase identifies the  transportation needs of a region, while the alternatives analysis phase  provides information on the benefits, costs, and impacts of different  options, such as rail lines or bus routes. The alternatives analysis phase  results in the selection of a locally preferred alternative, which is intended  to be the New Starts project that FTA evaluates for funding, as required by  statute. After a locally preferred alternative is selected, the project sponsor  submits an application to FTA for the project to enter the preliminary  engineering phase. When this phase is completed and federal  environmental requirements are satisfied, FTA may approve the project\u2019s  advancement into final design, after which FTA may approve the project  for an FFGA and proceed to construction, as provided for in statute.

These evaluation criteria reflect a broad range of benefits and  effects of the proposed project, such as cost-effectiveness, as well as the  ability of the project sponsor to fund the project and finance the continued  operation of its transit system. FTA assigns the proposed project a rating  for each criterion and then assigns a summary rating for local financial  commitment and project justification.

Furthermore, FTA established the Very Small Starts  program, which has even fewer application and document submission  requirements than the Small Starts program.", "Despite these efforts, many of the project sponsors we interviewed find  the Small Starts application process time consuming and costly to  complete, and would like to see FTA further streamline the process.  Frequently, project sponsors said that the current Small Starts application  process takes as long and costs as much to complete as the New Starts  application process, even though the planned projects cost less. For  example, a project sponsor who applied for the Small Starts program told  us that FTA asks its applicants to submit templates used in the New Starts  application process that call for information not relevant for a Small Starts  project. For example, while project sponsors are only required to submit  an opening year travel forecast as part of their Small Starts application, the  template FTA provides project sponsors asks for information on additional  forecasting years. The project sponsor suggested that FTA develop a  separate set of templates for the Small Starts program that would ask only  for Small Starts-related information. FTA officials told us that in these  cases, they would not expect project sponsors to provide the additional  information that is not required. Another project sponsor we interviewed  told us that although FTA tried to streamline the process by requiring  ridership projections only for the opening year of Small Starts projects, the  environmental impact statement still mandates the development of multi- year ridership projections. Such extensive ridership projections take a  considerable amount of work, staff time, and funding to produce. Several  other project sponsors who applied to the Small Starts or Very Small  Starts programs expressed additional concerns about having to provide  duplicate information, such as project finance and capital cost data that  can be found in other required worksheets. FTA officials do not believe  that such duplicate information is burdensome for projects sponsors to  submit.

Furthermore, FTA noted that  some economic development impacts may represent transfers between  regions rather than a net benefit for the nation, raising questions about the  usefulness of these benefits for a national comparison of projects. We  have also reported on many of the same challenges of measuring and  forecasting indirect benefits, such as economic development and land use  impacts. For example, we noted that certain benefits are often double  counted when evaluating transportation projects. We also noted that  indirect benefits, such as economic development, may be more correctly  considered transfers of direct user benefits or economic activity from one  area to another. Therefore, estimating and adding such indirect benefits to  direct benefits could constitute double counting and lead to  overestimating a project\u2019s benefits.

FTA officials told us that project  sponsors are generally aware of FTA\u2019s efforts to better manage the  pipeline.", "Although FTA has taken steps to remove inactive or stalled projects from  the pipeline, FTA officials noted that most projects have been withdrawn  by their project sponsors, not FTA. According to FTA data, 23 projects  have been withdrawn from the New Starts pipeline between 2001 and  2007. Of these, 16 were withdrawn at the request of the project sponsors, 6  were removed in response to efforts initiated by FTA, and 1 was removed  at congressional direction (see fig. 3). Of the projects that were  withdrawn by project sponsors, the most common reasons were that the  projects were either reconfigured (the project scope or design was  significantly changed) or reconsidered, or that the local financial  commitment was not demonstrated. Similarly, FTA initiated the removal  of 4 of the 6 projects for lack of a local financial commitment, often  demonstrated by a failed referendum at the local level. Of the 23 projects  withdrawn from the New Starts pipeline, 3 were expected to reenter the  pipeline at a later date.", "The project sponsors we interviewed provided other reasons for the  decrease in the number of projects in the New Starts pipeline. The most  common reasons cited by project sponsors are that the New Starts process  is too complex, costly, and time-consuming:    Complexity and cost of the New Starts process: The majority of  project sponsors we interviewed told us that the complexity of the  requirements, including those for financial commitment projections and  travel forecasts\u2014which require extensive analysis and economic  modeling\u2014create disincentives to entering the New Starts pipeline.  Sponsors also told us that the expense involved in fulfilling the application  requirements, including the costs of hiring additional staff and private  grant consultants, discourages some project sponsors with fewer  resources from applying for New Starts funding.", "Time required to complete the New Starts process: More than half of  the project sponsors we interviewed said that the application process is  too time-consuming or leads to project delays. One project sponsor we  interviewed told us that constructing a project with New Starts funding (as  opposed to without) delays the time line for the project by as much as  several years, which in turn leads to increased project costs as inflation  and expenses from labor and materials increase with the delay. The  lengthy nature of the New Starts process is due, at least in part, to the  rigorous and systematic evaluation and rating process established by  law\u2014which we have previously noted could serve as a model for other  transportation programs. In addition, FTA officials noted that most project  delays are caused by the project sponsor, not FTA. Other reasons cited by  project sponsors for the decrease in the pipeline include that project  sponsors are finding other ways to fund projects, such as using other  federal funds or seeking state, local, or private funding. One project  sponsor remarked that sponsors try to avoid the New Starts process by  obtaining a congressional designation, so that they can skip the  cumbersome New Starts application process and construct their project  faster. In addition, three other project sponsors we interviewed said that  since the New Starts process is well-established and outcomes are  predictable, many potential project sponsors do not even enter the  pipeline because they realize their projects are unlikely to receive New  Starts funding.", "Our survey results also reflect many of the reasons for the decline in the  New Starts pipeline. Among the project sponsors we surveyed with  completed transit projects, the most common reasons given for not  applying to the New Starts program were that the process is too lengthy or  that the sponsor wanted to move the project along faster than could be  done in the New Starts process. About two-thirds of these project  sponsors reported that their most recent project was eligible for New  Starts, yet more than one-fourth of them did not apply to the program .  Instead, these project sponsors reported using other federal funding and  state, local, and private funding\u2014with other federal and local funding  being the most commonly used and private funding least commonly  used\u2014to fund their most recently completed project. Further, we also  found that two-thirds of the large project sponsors we surveyed applied to  the New Starts program for its most recently completed project while only  about one-third of medium and smaller project sponsors did. Other  reasons these project sponsors cited for not applying include sufficient  funding from other sources to complete the project, concern about  jeopardizing other projects submitted for New Starts funding, and  difficulty understanding and completing the process and the program\u2019s  eligibility requirements.", "FTA is considering and implementing different ideas on how to improve  the New Starts process\u2014many of which would address the concerns  identified by project sponsors. For example, FTA has recognized that the  process can be lengthy and in 2006, FTA commissioned a study to  examine, among other issues, opportunities for accelerating and  simplifying the process for implementing the New Starts program.  According to FTA officials, one of the study\u2019s recommendations was to  implement project development agreements to solidify New Starts project  schedules and improve FTA\u2019s timeline for reviews. FTA officials told us  that they are implementing this recommendation, and have already  implemented project schedules for three New Starts projects in the  pipeline. In addition, in February 2007, FTA proposed the elimination of a  number of reporting requirements. FTA\u2019s Administrator stated that FTA  will continue to look for ways to further improve the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Future Demand for New Starts and Small Starts Programs Expected", "paragraphs": ["Our survey of project sponsors indicates that there will be a future  demand for New Starts, Small Starts, and Very Small Starts funding. About  forty-five percent (75 of 166) of the project sponsors we surveyed reported  that they had a total of 137 planned transit projects, which we defined as  those currently undergoing an alternatives analysis or other corridor- based planning study. According to the project sponsors, they anticipate  seeking New Starts, Small Starts, or Very Small Starts funding for 100 of  these 137 planned projects. More specifically, they anticipate seeking New  Starts funding for 57 of the planned projects; Small Starts funding for 29 of  the planned projects; and Very Small Starts funding for 14 of the planned  projects (see fig 4). Although the project sponsors we surveyed indicated  that they were considering a range of project type alternatives in their  planning, the most commonly cited alternatives were bus rapid transit and  light rail.", "All of the Small Starts and Very Small Starts project sponsors we  interviewed view the new Small Starts and Very Small Starts programs  favorably. These project sponsors told us that they appreciate the  emphasis FTA has placed on smaller transit projects through its new  programs and the steps FTA has taken to streamline the application  process for the programs. The project sponsors also told us that the Small  Starts and Very Small Starts programs address a critical and unmet  funding need, and that they believe their projects will be more competitive  under these programs then under the New Starts program because they  are vying for funding with projects and agencies of similar size. FTA told  us that they have been responsive in providing assistance on the program  when contacted.", "Our survey results also indicate that, through its Small Starts and Very  Small Starts programs, FTA is attracting project sponsors that would not  have otherwise applied for the New Starts program or have not previously  applied to the New Starts program. For example, project sponsors  indicated that they would not have applied for New Starts funding for 14 of  the 18 Small Starts and Very Small Starts projects identified in our survey,  if the Small Starts and Very Small Starts programs had not been  established. In addition, of 28 project sponsors that intend to seek Small  Starts or Very Small Starts funding for their planned projects, 13 have not  previously applied for New Starts, Small Starts, or Very Small Starts  funding.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
