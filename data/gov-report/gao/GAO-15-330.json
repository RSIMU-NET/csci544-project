LIHTC encourages private equity investment in low-income housing through tax credits. HFAs receive an annual allocation of tax credits and competitively award the credits to owners of qualified projects. GAO was asked to review the administration and oversight of the program. This report addresses, among other things, (1) IRS oversight of LIHTC and (2) how LIHTC administration and oversight compare with that of other tax credit programs. GAO reviewed regulations and guidance for monitoring HFAs and taxpayers; analyzed information on IRS audits of HFAs; reviewed selected programs that award tax credits similarly to LIHTC; and interviewed IRS, HUD, and HFA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Internal Revenue Service (IRS) oversight of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program has been minimal. Specifically, since 1986 IRS conducted seven audits of 56 state housing finance agencies (HFA) on which IRS relies to administer and oversee the program. (HFAs are state-chartered authorities established to meet affordable housing needs.) Federal internal control standards call for monitoring to be performed continually in the course of normal operations and be ingrained in agency operations. Oversight of HFAs has been minimal, partly because LIHTC is viewed as a peripheral program in IRS in terms of its mission and priorities for resources and staffing. Without such reviews, IRS cannot determine the extent of noncompliance and other issues at HFAs.", "IRS jointly administers other programs: the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit with the National Park Service and the New Markets Tax Credit with the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund in the Department of the Treasury. The federal agencies that work with IRS to oversee these programs have missions consistent with the purposes of these programs; they also conduct monitoring, report on performance, and collect data. For example, officials of both agencies told GAO that staff routinely conduct site visits and other project reviews. In these cases, IRS also is able to benefit from the other federal agencies' policy and subject-matter expertise. Likewise, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) experience in administering affordable housing programs and working with HFAs may benefit IRS in its administration and oversight of the LIHTC program. More specifically, HUD relies on state and local housing agencies (including HFAs) to implement its programs and already has processes and procedures in place to oversee them. Although GAO and others have identified weakness in HUD's program evaluation and oversight activities, HUD has taken steps to address some of these issues and its existing processes and procedures constitute a framework on which further changes and improvement can be made. Moreover, IRS is not well positioned to oversee LIHTC. Since 1990, IRS has been on GAO's high-risk list due to significant capacity challenges and incomplete monitoring of tax law enforcement. IRS's budget has been reduced by 10 percent and enforcement program performance and staffing levels have declined since 2010.", "Joint administration with HUD could better align program responsibilities with each agency's mission and more efficiently address existing oversight challenges. Under joint administration, IRS could retain responsibilities consistent with its mission (as it does in the other two tax credit programs). For example, IRS could continue to enforce taxpayer compliance. Assigning oversight responsibilities to HUD could involve additional resources for HUD. For LIHTC and the other two programs, GAO found that each used different mechanisms to fund administrative responsibilities. For instance, Historic Rehabilitation uses fees to fund its program, including oversight, while New Markets requests funding through annual appropriations. The level of resources that would be needed to perform an adequate level of oversight of HFAs is not known. An estimate of potential costs and funding options for financing enhanced federal oversight of the LIHTC program could benefit the agency involved and provide useful information to Congress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider designating HUD as a joint administrator of the program. HUD's role should include oversight responsibilities (such as regular monitoring of HFAs) to help address deficiencies GAO identified. Treasury agreed HUD could be responsible for analyzing the effectiveness of LIHTC, with IRS continuing to enforce tax law. HUD and IRS did not comment on the matter for congressional consideration. HUD supported consideration of a structure for enhanced interagency coordination. The association representing HFAs disagreed with the matter.

HFAs are state- chartered authorities established to meet the affordable housing needs of  the residents of their states and administer a wide range of affordable  housing and community development programs. Each state receives an  annual allocation of LIHTCs, determined by statutory formula according to  population. HFAs then competitively award the tax credits to owners of  qualified rental housing projects that reserve all or a portion of their units  for low-income tenants. Developers typically attempt to obtain funding for  their projects by attracting third-party investors that are willing to  contribute equity to the projects; the project investors then can claim the  tax credits.", "We and others have observed that severe resource constraints could  affect the ability of IRS to administer its programs.

HUD and Treasury officials noted that in practice, LIHTC projects usually  exceed these minimum affordability requirements by setting aside nearly  all of their units for low-income households.", "In return, taxpayers can earn a tax credit over a 15-year period (the  compliance period) if they meet the affordability requirements, but can  claim the credit over an accelerated time frame (the 10-year credit  period), beginning in the year in which the property is placed in service  (ready for occupancy) or, if the taxpayer chooses, the succeeding taxable  year. IRS can recapture (take back) some or all of the credits received  by taxpayers if the taxpayers have not met the requirements during the  compliance period. In addition, properties awarded credits after 1989  must comply with the affordability requirements for at least another 15  years (the extended use period) but are no longer subject to recapture  after the compliance period. HFAs may impose longer affordability  restrictions on properties than the minimum 30-year period. The three  time periods begin on the same day\u2014the first day of the tax year in which  the building is placed in service, or if taxpayers elect, the beginning of the  following tax year. The allowable credit may be reduced (in part or in  whole) for the tax year if taxpayers were not compliant with the code  requirements.

IRS did not comment on the matter for congressional  consideration (to designate HUD as a joint administrator of the program  responsible for oversight).", "Treasury agreed that it would be useful for HUD to receive ongoing  responsibility for, and resources to perform, research and analysis on the  effectiveness of LIHTCs in increasing the availability of affordable rental  housing. Treasury noted that such research and analysis is not part of  IRS\u2019s responsibilities or consistent with its expertise in interpreting and  enforcing tax laws. However, Treasury stated that responsibility for  interpreting and enforcing the code should remain entirely with IRS.  Similarly, our report notes that under joint administration, IRS could retain  certain key responsibilities consistent with its tax administration mission.  In considering the utility of HUD\u2019s expanded role in LIHTC, Treasury  noted that research and analysis by HUD might help address whether  HFAs\u2019 allocations of LIHTCs affirmatively addressed fair housing  concerns and whether the allocations have been effective in meeting  other congressional goals. Treasury further observed that if HUD\u2019s  research and analysis indicated a need for additional interpretation or  guidance, then Treasury and IRS could improve guidance or change the  approach to enforcement. Coordinating on findings from any analyses  conducted by HUD would be a positive step towards strengthening  oversight of the program. As our report notes, IRS has performed minimal  oversight of HFAs, particularly in terms of analyzing QAPs and  conducting on-site or desk audits of HFAs. Thus, leveraging the  experience and expertise of another agency with a housing mission may  help offset some of IRS\u2019s limitations in relation to program oversight. HUD  could assume certain oversight responsibilities, such as reviewing QAPs  of HFAs, monitoring of HFAs\u2019 compliance with key responsibilities,  identifying goals and performance measures, and collecting more  programwide data.", "HUD did not expressly comment on the matter for congressional  consideration (to designate HUD as a joint administrator of the LIHTC  program responsible for oversight). However, it supported consideration  of a structure for enhanced interagency coordination on housing policy,  including the LIHTC program. HUD noted that such a structure could help  ensure the program\u2019s alignment with federal housing goals, such as  creating affordable housing in areas of high opportunity and fueling  reinvestment in high-poverty communities. HUD has conducted dedicated  research on LIHTC; for example, on the effect of incentives in state QAPs  on the location of LIHTC properties. However, HUD noted that Congress  would need to appropriate additional resources to any agency assigned  the responsibility to provide oversight, review QAPs, and conduct further  in-depth research on LIHTC. HUD stated that it did not receive any  appropriations authorized for its collection of LIHTC tenant data, which  delayed HUD\u2019s ability to publicly release data. Our report also notes that  assigning programmatic oversight responsibilities for LIHTC to another  agency could require additional staff and other resources. We examined  other tax credit programs with joint administration and found that each  used varying mechanisms to fund its activities, including user fees and  appropriations, which could serve as examples of how an agency may  fund new oversight of LIHTCs.", "NCSHA disagreed with our matter for congressional consideration.  NCSHA stated that if Congress believed more oversight was needed,  NCSHA would prefer to see Congress place those resources within  Treasury and IRS to build on the program expertise in those agencies,  partly because it asserted that HUD has \u201cvirtually no experience\u201d with the  LIHTC program. NCSHA noted that state HFAs have worked closely with  Treasury and IRS to ensure proper administration of the program. Our  report recognizes the various ways that IRS officials work with state HFAs  to implement the program, but it also notes significant oversight  deficiencies in IRS\u2019s administration of the program. Our report also  highlights several reasons why HUD may be an appropriate agency to  jointly administer certain aspects of the LIHTC program. First, HUD is the  federal government\u2019s lead housing agency, and as such, has  responsibilities for reporting on federal efforts to meet the nation\u2019s  affordable housing and fair housing goals. Second, HUD has experience  working with HFAs on various programs, including its rental assistance  programs, and through its risk-sharing agreements with HFAs. LIHTC  projects also may be recipients of funds from other federal programs,  including HUD-administered programs such as HOME and project-based  Section 8 rental assistance. Third, HUD has a framework (processes,  procedures, and staff) in place for program evaluation and oversight of  state and local agencies that could be expanded and strengthened.  Finally, HUD already has a data collection role in the LIHTC program.  While this role is limited to mandatory data collection on tenant  characteristics, such as race and income, and voluntarily maintaining data  on LIHTC properties, a joint oversight role could allow HUD to directly  collect nationwide data on LIHTC properties needed to assess program  effectiveness. Whereas currently, statutory restrictions prevent the  disclosure of taxpayer information collected by IRS to HUD. As a result,  we maintain HUD, an agency with a housing mission and whose current  programs regularly interact with the LIHTC program, is in a better position  to perform some oversight functions for LIHTC. Also, in commenting on  this report, Treasury recognized that it would be useful to have HUD  receive ongoing responsibility for research and analysis on the  effectiveness of LIHTCs.", "NCSHA also questioned if it was fair of GAO to judge Treasury and IRS  oversight by the amount of data collected or number of audits conducted  and with seemingly little attention to the program\u2019s successful housing  results. In the report, we cite that monitoring should occur in the course of  normal operations, be performed continually, and be ingrained in the  agency\u2019s operations. IRS does not regularly review QAPs or conduct on- site reviews of HFAs. More specifically, IRS had conducted only seven  audits of HFAs since the program\u2019s inception in 1986. IRS officials stated  the lack in oversight was caused by a lack of resources and competing  demands. Furthermore, we note that activities need to be established to  monitor performance measures and indicators, which includes comparing  data so that analyses can be conducted. However, we found that IRS has  not set goals or assessed performance for the program, collected limited  data needed to administer and enforce the tax code, and the data it  collected are not reliable. The LIHTC program is the largest source of  federal assistance for developing affordable rental housing and cost an  estimated $8 billion in forgone revenue in 2014. Therefore, it is critical  that program managers and congressional decision makers have reliable  data available to judge the effectiveness and level of compliance of the  program.", "NCSHA also stated that joint administration of the LIHTC program would  create additional red tape (a new level of bureaucracy) and could result in  reduced program effectiveness and housing production. Our review  focused on IRS\u2019s oversight functions, including monitoring taxpayers and  state HFAs and reviewing program data for program effectiveness and  compliance. We did not suggest a comprehensive change to how IRS  administers LIHTC. Rather, we recommend an approach to provide  Congress and taxpayers with a greater understanding of how the program  operates and performs. In our review of other tax credit programs (similar  in purpose and structure to LIHTC) that were jointly administered by IRS  and other federal agencies, we found the other federal agencies provided  key oversight and administrative support, such as monitoring,  performance measurement, and data collection. Under joint  administration with HUD, IRS, with its tax expertise, could continue to  retain certain key responsibilities in implementing the program in  partnership with state HFAs. Joint administration of the program will  involve dividing responsibilities for one program across two agencies, and  our expectation would be that IRS and HUD will carefully define their  respective roles and responsibilities and have clear lines of  communication to help ensure the program does not create any  unnecessary inefficiencies, such as duplicative or overlapping  requirements for HFAs.  In addition, Congress can define specific  requirements and limits of each agency\u2019s oversight responsibilities.", "Finally, NCSHA noted that HFAs have a track record of outstanding  performance in affordable housing finance and that Congress and the  Administration entrusted HFAs to administer federal housing programs. In  addition, NCSHA stated GAO had positively recognized HFAs for the  LIHTC program in past reports. We acknowledged in our report that the  LIHTC program was the largest federal program for increasing the supply  of affordable rental housing and the design of the program can result in  HFAs and other entities, including investors and syndicators, providing  project oversight. We also made these points in prior work. But we also  noted in prior work dating to 1997 that procedures for reviewing QAPs  and monitoring compliance could be improved, and that LIHTC data were  not sufficient to measure program success. Joint administration with an  agency with a housing mission could help offset these longstanding  deficiencies in IRS\u2019s oversight of the program.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

More specifically, this report  (1) discusses how the LIHTC program is administered; (2) evaluates  processes for overseeing the LIHTC program; and (3) compares the  administration of other tax credit programs with LIHTC.", "To determine how the LIHTC program is administered, we reviewed IRS  regulations and guidance that describe IRS\u2019s roles and responsibilities in  administering the LIHTC program, including overseeing HFAs and  taxpayers. We also reviewed documentation on the role of HFAs,  investors, and syndicators in the program. Because LIHTC projects are  often financed with funds from other programs, we reviewed the  monitoring requirements for some federal programs present in LIHTC  projects, such as the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program  and project-based Section 8. To illustrate the number of LIHTC projects  containing other federal funding, we also reviewed a publication issued by  the National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) on survey  results. We assessed the reliability of these data by interviewing NCSHA  officials and reviewing documentation on survey techniques used to  collect the data. We determined the data were reliable for our purposes of  reporting on other funding sources for LIHTC projects. We interviewed  officials from IRS, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Department  of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), selected HFAs, and NCSHA  on the administration of the program. We also conducted interviews at the  Georgia HFA and Illinois HFA to help provide examples of how the  programs were administered at the state level. We selected these two  HFAs based on prior work conducted at these locations for other GAO  reports on the Tax Credit Assistance Program (TCAP), administered by  HUD, and the Grants to States for Low-Income Housing Projects in Lieu  of Low-Income Housing Credits (Section 1602) program, administered by  Treasury. Our prior work is relevant because it assessed HFA  administration and oversight of these programs and because we discuss  TCAP and 1602 in this report. We also selected these sites because of  their proximity to GAO locations. Moreover, we interviewed a certified  public accounting and consulting firm, Novogradac & Company LLP. We  selected this firm because of its role in the LIHTC working group\u2014a  forum for participants in the LIHTC program to work together to resolve  technical and administrative issues relating to the LIHTC program\u2014and  because of the information on the firm\u2019s website on HFAs and guidance  for the LIHTC program.", "To evaluate processes for overseeing the LIHTC program, we reviewed  applicable forms and guidance used to monitor the program, and  reviewed IRS audits of HFAs conducted from 2003 to 2014 to determine  the frequency with which audits were conducted and the types of findings  identified. We reviewed IRS\u2019s process for identifying and conducting  audits on taxpayers claiming LIHTCs from 2001 to 2013 and how the  results of these audits were used to inform management about the types  of noncompliance and to track the effectiveness of program monitoring.  We reviewed federal internal control standards to identify key activities  that help ensure that a program addresses requirements and appropriate  actions are taken to address program risks. We also reviewed the  strategic and annual reports of IRS, Treasury, and HUD to determine the  program goals and outcome information available for the LIHTC program.  We analyzed information contained in IRS\u2019s Low-Income Housing Credit  database from December 2005 to August 2014. Specifically, we reviewed  available information from forms on the credit allocation and certification  (form 8609) and the noncompliance or building disposition (form 8823).  We assessed the reliability of the database by reviewing documentation,  performing electronic testing, and interviewing the relevant officials  responsible for administering and overseeing the database. We also  conducted reasonableness checks on the data to identify any missing,  erroneous, or outlying figures. We determined we would not be able to  rely on the data to perform our analysis. Therefore, we limited our  discussion of the database to the type of information collected, the extent  to which the information was collected, and potential analysis that could  be conducted if the data were more complete and accurate. We also  reviewed an IRS staff proposal for statutory changes to allow IRS to  disclose certain protected information so that HUD could help assess the  completeness of the data it received on LIHTC tenant characteristics and  reviewed a prior GAO report that discussed statutory exceptions related  to data sharing of confidential taxpayer information. Lastly, we  interviewed IRS and selected HFA officials about monitoring procedures  for the LIHTC program and Treasury and HUD officials on program goals  and outcomes and statutory barriers that may prevent information sharing  for the LIHTC program.", "To compare the administration of other tax credit programs with LIHTC,  we reviewed tax credit programs administered by IRS to identify those  that are most similar in purpose and structure to LIHTC. We focused on  the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit and New Markets Tax Credit  programs because, similar to the LIHTC program, both are aimed at  encouraging community development and each is jointly administered by  IRS and another federal entity\u2014the Department of Interior\u2019s National Park  Service (NPS) and Treasury\u2019s Community Development Financial  Institutions (CDFI) Fund, respectively. In addition to administrative  structures, our review focused on how these two programs conducted  monitoring, used performance measures, and collected data. We  reviewed prior GAO reports related to each of these programs.  Moreover, we reviewed HUD\u2019s role in working with state and local  agencies and its role in the LIHTC program. We also reviewed  information available in the State HFA Factbook: NCSHA 2012 Annual  Survey Results to gain an understanding of how HFAs use fees to  administer the LIHTC program. We assessed the reliability of these data  by interviewing NCSHA officials and reviewing documentation on survey  techniques used to collect the data. We determined the data were reliable  for our purposes of reviewing how HFAs use fees to administer the LIHTC  program. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the Departments of  Interior and Treasury and the CDFI Fund concerning the administration of  the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit and New Markets Tax Credit  programs and how the programs funded administrative costs. We met  with IRS officials to discuss their role in the administration of the Historic  Rehabilitation Tax Credit.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2014 through July  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
