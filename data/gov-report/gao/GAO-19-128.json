For  example, we have reported that for decades, the Navy has sought to  reduce ship crew size based, in part, on the assumption that some  manual tasks could be automated and fewer people would be needed to  operate a ship.", "Yet this growing dependence on software and IT comes at a price. It  significantly expands weapons\u2019 attack surfaces. According to DOT&E,  any exchange of information is a potential access point for an adversary.  Even \u201cair gapped\u201d systems that do not directly connect to the Internet for  security reasons could potentially be accessed by other means, such as  USB devices and compact discs. Weapon systems have a wide variety of  interfaces, some of which are not obvious, that could be used as  pathways for adversaries to access the systems, as is shown in figure 3.", "DOD systems are also more connected than ever before, which can  introduce vulnerabilities and make systems more difficult to defend.  According to the DSB, nearly every conceivable component in DOD is  networked. Weapon systems connect to DOD\u2019s extensive set of  networks\u2014called the DOD Information Network\u2014and sometimes to  external networks, such as those of defense contractors. Technology  systems, logistics, personnel, and other business-related systems  sometimes connect to the same networks as weapon systems.

Experts we interviewed as well as officials  from program offices, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and some  military test organizations explained that, until around 2014, there was a  general lack of emphasis on cybersecurity throughout the weapon  systems acquisition process. Others have reported similar findings. For  example, the DSB reported in 2013 that although DOD had taken great  care to secure the use and operation of the hardware of its weapon  systems, it had not devoted the same level of resources and attention to  IT systems that support and operate those weapons and critical IT  capabilities embedded within the weapon systems. The National  Research Council reported in 2014 that much broader and more  systematic attention to cybersecurity was needed in the acquisition  process and that the Navy was in the \u201ccrawl\u201d stage of a \u201ccrawl-walk-run\u201d  journey. Similarly, the Navy reported in 2015 that there was a lack of  attention to cybersecurity in the acquisition process and platform IT  systems were not engineered with cybersecurity as a key component.", "In the past, consideration of cybersecurity was not a focus of the key  processes governing the development of weapon systems. It was not a  focus of key acquisition and requirements policies nor was it a focus of  key documents that inform decision-making. For example, until a few  years ago, DOD\u2019s main requirements policy did not call for programs to  factor cyber survivability into their key performance parameters. Key  performance parameters are the most important system capabilities,  called \u201crequirements,\u201d that must be met when developing weapon  systems. They are established early on in an acquisition program and  drive system design decisions. They are also used as a benchmark to  measure program performance and are reviewed during acquisition  decisions and other oversight processes. Because cybersecurity key  performance parameters were not required, Joint Staff officials and some  program officials said that many current weapon systems had no high- level cybersecurity requirements when they began, which in turn limited  emphasis on cybersecurity during weapon system design, development,  and oversight. In addition, Joint Staff officials said that, historically,  cybersecurity was not a factor in analyses of alternatives. This analysis is  an important early step in acquiring a new weapon system and informs  decisions about the relative effectiveness, costs, and risks of potential  systems that could be developed. By not considering cybersecurity in  these analyses, decisions about which system to develop were made  without consideration of whether one proposed system might be more  inherently vulnerable from a cyber perspective than others.", "Programs\u2019 lack of cybersecurity requirements may have also contributed  to challenges with incorporating cybersecurity into weapon systems  testing. Specifically, DOT&E and service test agencies said that prior to  around 2014, program offices tried to avoid undergoing cybersecurity  assessments because they did not have cybersecurity requirements and  therefore thought they should not be evaluated. Furthermore, test officials  said that many within DOD did not believe cybersecurity applied to  weapon systems. As a result, fewer cybersecurity assessments were  conducted at that time in comparison to recent years.", "By not incorporating cybersecurity into key aspects of the requirements  and acquisition processes, DOD missed an opportunity to give  cybersecurity a more prominent role in key acquisition decisions.  Numerous officials we met with said that this failure to address weapon  systems cybersecurity sooner will have long-lasting effects on the  department. Due to this lack of focus on weapon systems cybersecurity,  DOD likely has an entire generation of systems that were designed and  built without adequately considering cybersecurity. Bolting on  cybersecurity late in the development cycle or after a system has been  deployed is more difficult and costly than designing it in from the  beginning. Not only is the security of those systems and their missions at  risk, the older systems may put newer systems in jeopardy. Specifically, if  DOD is able to make its newer systems more secure, but connects them  to older systems, this puts the newer systems at risk.

Many weapon systems use such systems to carry out essential functions.  For example, a ship may use industrial control systems to control engines  and fire suppression systems. According to NIST, industrial control  systems were originally designed for use in trusted environments, so  many did not incorporate security controls.

Because  weapon systems can be very large, complex, systems of systems with  many interdependencies, updating one component of a system can  impact other components.

Officials from one  program we met with said they are supposed to apply patches within 21  days of when they are released, but fully testing a patch can take months  due to the complexity of the system. Even when patches have been  tested, applying the patches may take additional time. Further, weapon  systems are often dispersed or deployed throughout the world. Some  deployed systems may only be patched or receive software  enhancements when they return to specific locations. Although there are  valid reasons for delaying or forgoing weapon systems patches, this  means some weapon systems are operating, possibly for extended  periods, with known vulnerabilities.", "Exacerbating matters, some program offices may also not yet have a  solid understanding of the cybersecurity implications of their systems\u2019  designs, including their systems\u2019 connectivity.

Several program officials we  met with felt that weapon systems were more secure than other types of  systems and noted that they typically did not have direct connections to  the Internet. In fact, weapon systems have more potential avenues of  attack than may be apparent, such as radio communications receivers  and radar receivers. Furthermore, the National Research Council  reported in 2014 that individual warfare domains do not fully grasp risks  within their own domain, let alone those that can be introduced through  other domains.

In one case, it took a two-person test team just one hour to gain  initial access to a weapon system and one day to gain full control of the  system they were testing. Some programs fared better than others. For  example, one assessment found that the weapon system satisfactorily  prevented unauthorized access by remote users, but not insiders and  near-siders. Once they gained initial access, test teams were often able  to move throughout a system, escalating their privileges until they had  taken full or partial control of a system. In one case, the test team took  control of the operators\u2019 terminals. They could see, in real-time, what the  operators were seeing on their screens and could manipulate the system.  They were able to disrupt the system and observe how the operators  responded. Another test team reported that they caused a pop-up  message to appear on users\u2019 terminals instructing them to insert two  quarters to continue operating.

For example, in some cases, simply scanning a system caused parts of  the system to shut down. One test had to be stopped due to safety  concerns after the test team scanned the system. This is a basic  technique that most attackers would use and requires little knowledge or  expertise. Poor password management was a common problem in the  test reports we reviewed. One test report indicated that the test team was  able to guess an administrator password in nine seconds. Multiple  weapon systems used commercial or open source software, but did not  change the default password when the software was installed, which  allowed test teams to look up the password on the Internet and gain  administrator privileges for that software. Multiple test teams reported  using free, publicly available information or software downloaded from the  Internet to avoid or defeat weapon system security controls.", "Test reports we reviewed make it clear that simply having cybersecurity  controls does not mean a system is secure.

Test teams reported that they portray realistic  threats and environments. However, the nature of tests imposes  limitations on testers that do not apply to potential adversaries. For  example, DOD officials said that most cybersecurity assessments are  conducted over a few days to a few weeks. One test report indicated that  the cybersecurity assessment was cut short due to external factors so the  test team only had 41 hours to work with the system. In contrast, DOD  officials we spoke to said that a determined adversary could spend  months or years targeting our systems.", "Further, because test teams have a limited amount of time with a system,  they look for the easiest or most effective way to gain access, according  to DOD officials we met with and test reports we reviewed.

DOD officials we spoke to said that the department has  increased the amount of long-term assessments it conducts in recent  years. Weapon systems cybersecurity assessments may also be limited  in the types of attacks that are portrayed so entire categories of  vulnerabilities are not currently addressed in some cyber assessments.  The test reports we reviewed tended to portray nascent to moderate  threats and generally did not target special components like industrial  control systems and non-Internet enabled devices which our adversaries  could target. Similarly, counterfeit parts pose cybersecurity risks to  weapon systems, but were not within the scope of the cybersecurity tests  that we reviewed.", "System-specific limitations can also affect test results. Officials from one  service test agency noted that in at least one case, they could not fully  assess a system\u2019s cybersecurity because portions of the system\u2019s  networks and data were proprietary. The system utilized the contractor\u2019s  corporate networks, which the test team was not allowed to attack. In  several tests, a weapon system\u2019s connections to external systems were  either limited or had to be simulated. One test report we reviewed noted  that the test team was not allowed to use classified networks to attack a  weapon system due to security concerns. Another test was conducted in  a lab environment so the test team had to simulate external  communications. Although there are practical reasons for limiting the  duration and scope of cybersecurity assessments, these limitations mean  that DOD may not fully understand the extent of weapon system cyber  vulnerabilities, as is reflected in figure 5.", "Many program officials we met with indicated that their systems were  secure, including some with programs that had not had a cybersecurity  assessment. Some systems have not yet undergone testing either  because they are not far enough along in the acquisition process,  because they were fielded prior to DOD\u2019s emphasis on penetration  testing, or out of concern that cybersecurity tests would interfere with  operations. Systems that have not been tested are not necessarily more  or less secure than systems that have been assessed.

For example, officials from a  DOD agency we met with expressed confidence in the cybersecurity of  their systems, but could not point to test results to support their beliefs.  Instead, they identified a list of security controls they had implemented.  However, security controls must be properly designed and implemented  in order to be effective.

These officials stated that cyber assessments were  unrealistic if they relied on the program office to identify problem areas for  the test team.

DOD and Congress have also begun promising initiatives to help DOD  improve its understanding of its weapon systems cyber vulnerabilities and  take steps to mitigate their risks.

DOD officials said the  department has had cybersecurity policies in place for decades, but  applied them to weapon systems only in the past few years. For example,  DOD\u2019s Risk Management Framework (RMF) is similar to its  predecessor\u2014DOD\u2019s Information Assurance Certification and  Accreditation Process\u2014which called for application of an extensive series  of controls to protect DOD networks and information systems. However,  RMF applies these controls more widely to weapon systems  cybersecurity. Another important change is that, in recognition that  systems cannot be 100 percent secure, DOD has begun to emphasize  cyber resiliency in some of its policies. The idea behind cyber resiliency is  to identify and protect key elements of a system to ensure that they can  continue to operate, possibly with limited capabilities, during a cyber  attack. This entails designing in features such as durability, redundancy,  and added protections for certain components.", "Lastly, key policies that govern the requirements and acquisition  processes now address cybersecurity. These changes have the potential  to bring greater attention to cybersecurity in weapon systems  acquisitions. Rather than being treated as distinct from the acquisition  process, cybersecurity is to be integrated into key acquisition activities,  such as requirements development, technology maturation, and testing.  Examples of this, as called for in various policies, include the following:", "Requirements. Identify cybersecurity requirements and how the  information flows into, out of, and through the systems. This helps  identify the system\u2019s attack surface and informs the system\u2019s design  and cybersecurity controls. Cybersecurity should become part of the  requirements trade space.", "Technology maturation. Focus early prototyping in part on buying  down cybersecurity risks prior to system development.

The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition and Sustainment) is leading this initiative in collaboration with  military test organizations. DOD is compiling existing vulnerability  information and conducting some new tests to provide information about  the cybersecurity posture of individual systems, concentrating mostly on  fielded systems. These assessments are important, in part because some  of those systems did not undergo cybersecurity testing prior to fielding  and DOD does not have a permanent process in place to periodically  assess the cybersecurity of fielded systems. Furthermore, vulnerabilities  and risks can change after fielding as system software becomes obsolete.", "As part of this initiative, for two mission areas, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) has been trying to  incorporate cybersecurity into large scale military exercises to take a  more integrated look at impacts of vulnerabilities across systems. The  goal is to understand how vulnerabilities in some systems may affect  DOD\u2019s ability to achieve its mission and to identify what other options are  available to complete a mission if certain capabilities were disabled or  degraded. This work is also important, but for different reasons. DOD\u2019s  developmental and operational tests focus primarily on vulnerabilities in  individual systems rather than across broader mission areas. However,  as previously discussed, attackers do not necessarily limit themselves to  one system and may move from one system to others.

However, our  prior work has found sustained leadership support of DOD initiatives to be  key to maintaining their momentum. We also reported that there is risk  that DOD will not fully implement some tasks it has begun to improve  weapon systems cybersecurity if leadership does not continue to monitor  their progress. For example, we reported in 2017 that DOD\u2019s Principal  Cyber Advisor closed out the task on assessing weapon systems called  for under The DOD Cyber Strategy.

Test officials said  that once their staff members have gained experience in DOD, they tend  to leave for the private sector, where they can command much higher  salaries. According to a 2014 RAND study, personnel at the high end of  the capability scale, who are able to detect the presence of advanced  threats, or finding the hidden vulnerabilities in software and systems, can  be compensated above $200,000 to $250,000 a year, which greatly  exceeds DOD\u2019s pay scale.", "Even when cybersecurity positions are filled, it may not necessarily be  with the right expertise. Officials from some program offices said that  general cybersecurity expertise is not the same as weapon systems  cybersecurity expertise. For example, officials said that professional IT  certifications are not the same as systems security engineering expertise,  which is essential to designing cyber-resilient systems. According to  various program officials, weapon systems cybersecurity is a specialized  area. Cybersecurity subject matter experts require knowledge of (1)  DOD\u2019s acquisition process; (2) technical knowledge of the specific  weapon system\u2014such as radar or aircraft, and (3) cybersecurity  knowledge. However, it is difficult to hire and maintain a workforce with  the needed knowledge due to its highly specialized nature. Without this  expertise, it will be difficult for programs to effectively implement  cybersecurity policies and guidance. For example, the RMF allows  programs to determine which controls are most appropriate to apply, but  a knowledgeable workforce is necessary for making such decisions.", "DOD has various efforts underway to recruit and develop the skills of  DOD\u2019s cybersecurity workforce, according to several DOD officials. For  example, the services are aiming to recruit cybersecurity analysts by  using internships and engaging in partnerships with secondary schools  and universities. In addition, the services are developing and offering  courses to grow expertise within their existing acquisition workforce. DOD  is determining how to share specialized expertise related to weapon  systems cybersecurity. Specific efforts related to this include the Cyber  Developmental Test Cross Service Working Group that meets quarterly  and invites industry expertise to present cutting edge techniques as well  as a \u201ccapture the flag\u201d competition, which will now be offered to other  services as well.

It is difficult to find the correct balance  between protecting information, so that it is not accessible to potential  adversaries, and sharing it, so that DOD has an informed workforce. For  example, classification is important because it protects information about  vulnerabilities, and in some cases, intelligence methods. Access to  information about vulnerabilities makes it easier for potential adversaries  to attack DOD systems. Similarly, limiting the distribution of classified  information to those who have the need to know is likewise important  because it reduces the likelihood that internal and external threats will  access it. Although DOD officials explained that there is no DOD-wide  cybersecurity classification guidance, Air Force guidance and DOD  officials indicated that vulnerabilities in fielded systems are typically  classified as at least Top Secret or Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented  Information, and details of threats are more restricted. This high level of  classification for weapon systems cyber vulnerabilities and threats helps  protect sensitive information, but it makes it difficult for DOD to share  information about aspects of weapon systems cybersecurity with  cybersecurity personnel across DOD. For example, some experts told us  that flawed designs can still be found in new systems if their designers  were not aware that they resulted in vulnerabilities in other systems. More  generally, because they are not sharing vulnerability and threat  information across programs, programs are unaware of their full risk  exposure and DOD may have less insight into vulnerabilities across its  weapon systems portfolio. Officials from most organizations we spoke to,  including NSA, acknowledged challenges with sharing information across  all levels within DOD. Examples of these challenges are listed in table 5.", "Although limitations to information sharing can lead to inefficiencies and  other challenges, DOD has so far opted to favor protection of  information\u2014perhaps because the stakes are so high if it does not. As we  mentioned previously, one of the reasons potential adversaries collect  information on weapon systems is because the better they understand a  weapon system, and especially what vulnerabilities it may have, the more  options they have to attack it.
