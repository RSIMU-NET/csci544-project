GAO was asked to (1) describe the nature of offshoring activities and the factors that encourage offshoring, (2) discuss what U.S. government data show about the extent of this practice by the private sector and federal and state governments, and (3) discuss available data on the potential effects of services offshoring on the U.S. economy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["No commonly accepted definition of \"offshoring\" exists, and the term has been used to include various international trade and foreign investment activities. Services that U.S.-based organizations purchase from abroad are considered imports. They may also be linked to U.S. firms' investments overseas--for example, U.S. firms may invest in overseas affiliates as a replacement for, or as an alternative to, domestic production. In recent years, services offshoring has been facilitated by factors, such as the Internet, infrastructure growth in developing countries, and decreasing data transmission costs. Organizations' decisions to offshore services are influenced by potential benefits such as the availability of cheaper skilled labor and access to foreign markets, and by risks, such as geopolitical issues and infrastructure instability in countries that supply the services. U.S. government data provide some insight into the extent of services offshoring by the private sector, but they do not provide a complete picture of the business transactions that the term offshoring can encompass. Department of Commerce data show that private sector imports of some services are growing. For example, imports of business, professional, and technical services increased by 76.8 percent from $21.2 billion in 1997 to $37.5 billion in 2002. From another perspective, Commerce's data also show that in 2002 U.S. investments in developing countries that supply offshore services were small compared to those in developed countries and that most services produced abroad are sold primarily to non-U.S. markets. Regarding public sector offshoring, the total dollar value of the federal government's offshore services contracts increased from 1999 through 2003, but the trend in the dollar value shows little change relative to all federal services contracts. No comprehensive data or studies show the extent of services offshoring by state governments. Government data provide limited information about the effects of services offshoring on U.S. employment levels and the U.S. economy. The Department of Labor's Mass Layoff Survey data show that layoffs attributable to overseas relocation represent a small fraction of overall total mass layoffs. However, the survey identifies only a portion of total layoffs because the survey does not cover establishments with fewer than 50 employees. Other government data show greater than average job declines since 2001 in occupations and industries commonly associated with offshoring, but other factors, such as the recent recession, may contribute to these declines. Some private researchers predict that offshoring may eliminate 100,000 to 500,000 IT jobs within the next few years, while others note that offshoring can also generate benefits, such as lower prices, productivity improvements, and overall economic growth."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although attention has long focused on offshoring in the manufacturing  sector of the U.S. economy, more recently concerns have been raised about  the nature and extent of offshoring in the services sector and its effects on  the U.S. workforce. Offshoring generally refers to the practice, by either  U.S. companies or government entities, of replacing services produced  domestically with imported services. Advances in information technology  (IT) and communications, coupled with a large pool of educated workers in  some developing countries, allow organizations to move services jobs  overseas as part of a larger trend towards globalization. Organizations  move services jobs, such as those involved in software programming or  telephone call centers, to lower-wage locations, such as India, the  Philippines, and Eastern Europe. Offshoring causes controversy because  some jobs are lost immediately and visibly, while other potential impacts  such as lower costs, job creation in other sectors, and economic growth are  less visible, more diffuse, and typically delayed.", "You requested that we examine the available data to provide more  information about the offshoring of information technology and other  services.

Although the service  (e.g., a computer program, a database, or a telephone call) may be supplied  digitally through telecommunication lines, rather than physically crossing  the border like a good (e.g., an automobile import), it still is supplied by a  foreign-based producer and paid for by a U.S.-based importer.", "Most U.S. domestic output consists of services. In 2002, services-producing  industries accounted for about 78 percent of the U.S. private sector  economy (when measured in terms of gross domestic product) compared  to 22 percent for goods-producing industries. (See fig. 1.)  Similarly, U.S.  private sector employment is concentrated in service-producing industries  (79 percent) compared to goods-producing industries (21 percent).  However, it is important to note that goods-producing industries may also  employ workers in \u201cservices\u201d occupations (e.g., computer programmers or  accountants).", "Services are a relatively small share of U.S. imports, compared with their  share of the U.S. economy.

Services make up a greater share of U.S. exports but still account for  only 30 percent of the total. Services trade may be relatively small relative  to the size of services output in the U.S. economy partly because some  services (e.g., haircuts, housing, and hospitals) are difficult or impossible  to trade internationally. Overall, U.S. imports of services accounted for only  about 3 percent of U.S. consumption of services in 2002.", "According to the World Trade Organization, the United States is the world\u2019s  largest importer of commercial services, with 13.3 percent of the world\u2019s  share.

In particular, recent  developments in the telecommunications industry, such as technology  improvements, infrastructure growth in developing countries, and  decreasing data transmission costs, have facilitated the use of offshoring.  First, according to several studies, improvements in telecommunications  capabilities, such as advances in routing and switching technologies that  enable the distribution of voice and data services, have increased the  reliability and service quality of global voice, data, and Internet  communications. Second, the growth of the global telecommunications  infrastructure has provided developing countries cost-effective  infrastructure options, such as wired landline and satellite communication  services to communicate across national borders. Third, global data traffic  has substantially increased since the early 1990s, while the cost of  transporting data has declined, thereby making the offshoring of services  that rely on the transmission of data more cost effective.", "Other IT advances, such as greater standardization of business applications  and network protocols, have increased system interoperability and thus  further facilitated offshore sourcing. Among others, universal computing  standards and protocols, such as the Transmission Control  Protocol/Internet Protocol, have enabled businesses to communicate  worldwide through the use of e-mail and collaborative tools, such as video  conferencing, instant messaging, and shared whiteboard technologies.  Additionally, the worldwide use of the personal computer in conjunction  with the global availability of the Internet have enabled organizations to  digitally share and transmit documents over private networks using  encryption applications for added security. According to a technology  research firm\u2019s forecast, the use of private networks will continue to  increase due to widely available network-based solutions that support  increased access options, security, and new applications.", "In addition to technological factors that allow services to be conducted  offshore, an organization may choose this option because it expects to  realize various benefits. According to several business studies, the primary  reason organizations engage in offshore sourcing is to reduce costs.  Specifically, due to competitive pressures and increasing customer demand  for innovative products, businesses are using offshoring as a way to reduce  their internal costs structures, such as sales, general, and administrative  costs. The labor cost differential between the United States and developing  nations can be significant. According to a technology research firm,  organizations that offshore accounting and customer service to China can  potentially save 30 to 50 percent in labor costs compared to keeping those  processes in Tokyo, London, or Chicago. Moreover, the hourly wage rate  for programmers in the U.S. can be up to three times that of programmers  in India. For example, a leading e-business software company reportedly  was able to achieve 40-45 percent lower costs per overseas employee  compared to hiring equivalent senior developers in the United States.", "Other expected benefits of offshoring include access to skilled workers and  providers that use disciplined processes and the facilitation of a round-the- clock work schedule. For example, according to the National Association  of Software and Service Companies, India\u2019s chamber of commerce for the  IT services and software industry, approximately 140,000 students  graduated in an IT-related engineering field from degree and diploma  colleges and universities in India during the 2003-2004 academic year.  According to one study, a media and publishing company incorporated  highly skilled overseas senior developers, architects, and project managers  into its Web site development project, which reportedly led to an  accelerated delivery schedule, reduced costs, and increased customer  service. In addition, as of July 14, 2004, of the 74 worldwide organizations  that have been certified at the highest rating in the Capability Maturity  Model Integration model created by the Software Engineering Institute at  Carnegie Mellon University, 48 are headquartered outside the United  States. This is important because our work and other best practices  research have shown that the application of rigorous practices to the  acquisition or development of IT systems or the acquisition of IT services  improves the likelihood of success. Moreover, offshoring can facilitate  operating on a 24-hour, 7-day schedule across numerous time zones,  thereby allowing companies to meet worldwide customer needs. For  example, according to one study, a financial services unit of a Fortune 50  company has operations in overseas countries that provide around-the- clock in-bound and out-bound call centers, accounting services, IT help  desks, document storage, and software implementation.", "Although offshoring can be beneficial, organizations also face risks that are  relevant to decisions about whether or not to offshore services. Commonly  cited offshore sourcing risks include unrealized cost savings due to  unforeseen expenses, geopolitical concerns, cultural differences, and  infrastructure instability. For example, organizations that engage in  offshoring can incur additional costs in conducting overseas business  operations in order to, for instance, establish high-speed  telecommunications links, acquire new software licenses, and pay for  travel expenses. According to one study, expectations in cost reduction  are not always met because outsourcing contracts can be developed with a  poor understanding of current costs and little insight into how costs will  change as the environment changes. In addition, it is important to  consider the destination country\u2019s stability, legal system, and contract  enforcement in making offshoring decisions. For example, one factor in  assessing the legal system is whether adequate intellectual property  protections, such as laws and regulations, are in place to ensure that  sensitive company data are protected from unauthorized disclosure or use.  Cultural differences can also pose a potential risk because business  attitudes, including timeliness and punctuality, country accents, and  holiday schedules, may be different than those in the United States. For  example, overseas call center and customer service employees have  reportedly sometimes found it difficult to establish a rapport with  consumers due to a lack of understanding of language accents. A leading  financial services company reportedly requires its application managers to  go through a cultural exchange program designed to foster a better  understanding of domestic and overseas business norms. Lastly, despite  public utility infrastructure improvements, some countries\u2019 businesses still  face infrastructure risks, such as the reliance on energy, telephone, and  networks that may be susceptible to intermittent disruptions and outages.  Our prior work indicates the importance of organizations considering both  the benefits and risks associated with sourcing decisions before adopting  any particular approach, such as offshoring, into their business strategies  and plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Offshoring Affects Various Types of Business Functions and Occupations", "paragraphs": ["Business functions and service occupations associated with offshoring,  combined with other distinguishing process features, provide additional  detail on offshoring of services. Business functions associated with  offshoring tend to be those that are digitized, capable of being performed at  a distance, and whose product delivery can be managed using relatively  new forms of advanced telecommunications. Examples of these business  functions include software programming and design, call center  operations, accounting and payroll operations, medical records  transcription, paralegal services, and software research and testing.  According to some studies, the criteria for successful offshoring of services  include business functions that involve 1) a high information content that  can be standardized and digitized, 2) job processes that can be separated  and documented step-by-step, and 3) no face-to-face customer service  requirements. Although occupations associated with services offshoring  were predominantly in the IT sector, IT-enabled jobs are also vulnerable to  offshoring and span several occupational classifications. These categories  include business and financial operations, office and administrative  support, medical transcriptionists, paralegals and legal assistants, and  architecture and engineering.

In 2002, affiliated trade accounted for $26.8 billion, or 71  percent of all BPT services imports. Data for affiliated trade in BPT  services are not broken down by country or by the particular subcategories  of BPT services discussed below. Data for unaffiliated trade do provide this  detail and show that U.S. imports of BPT unaffiliated services grew from  $6.4 billion in 1997 to $10.7 billion in 2002, an increase of 67.2 percent.", "This partial list of subcategories under BPT services include the following  offshored services:  accounting, auditing, and bookkeeping;   architectural, engineering, and other technical;   computer and data processing;   database and other information;   management, consulting, and public relations; and   research, development, and testing.", "Certain unaffiliated BPT services imports\u2014most notably accounting and  auditing services; computer and data processing services; and research,  development and testing services\u2014have grown rapidly in recent years. For  example, imports of computer and data processing services have grown  steadily from $636 million in 1997 to $1.5 billion in 2000 and declining to  $1.1 billion in 2002 for an overall increase of 66.2 percent between 1997 and  2002. The increase in 2000 may be due in part to the Year 2000 date change  crisis. U.S. firms, in response to a tight supply of computer programmers in  the late 1990s, turned to companies principally located in India to make the  code fixes needed to avert problems with computer systems when the year  2000 arrived. (See fig. 5.)", "Although much attention is currently focused on developing countries that  are increasingly exporting services to the United States, Canada, and the  United Kingdom, nevertheless these three countries remain the leading  exporters of services, both for Total Private Services and the subcategory  unaffiliated BPT services. In 2002, Canada and the United Kingdom  accounted for 43.6 percent of all imports of unaffiliated BPT services to the  United States, and they were also major destinations for U.S. exports of  these services. (See fig. 6.)", "As figure 6 also shows, India is ranked eighth among countries from which  the United States imported unaffiliated BPT services in 2002. Some BPT  services\u2019 subcategories (e.g., data and computer processing services) are  available by country. In some BPT services\u2019 subcategories, imports from  India have increased. In particular, imports of India\u2019s computer and data  processing services rose from $8.0 million in 1997 to $133.0 million in 2000,  but then declined to $76.0 million in 2002, for an overall increase of 850  percent from 1997 to 2002.

In addition to offshoring, other factors affecting employment  trends in the last few years include the economic recession and the  collapse of the dot.com bubble. The Labor data series include the  following:  Mass Layoff Survey (MLS). The MLS is a national survey that collects  information on reasons for long-term job losses with reports published  by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on a quarterly basis. The  survey is a federal-state program which tracks major job cutbacks based  on state unemployment insurance databases. Establishments with over  50 employees that have at least 50 initial unemployment insurance  claims during a 5-week period are contacted by the state agency. If the  separations are for at least 31 days, data are collected from the  employers on the total number of separations as well as the reasons for  separation. The employers are asked to provide the reason for the  layoff, and the state official then picks from a list of more than 25  possible reasons for the layoff action. Prior to 2004, one of these reasons  was \u201coverseas relocation\u201d allowing the MLS to capture limited data on  offshoring activity. In January 2004, to enhance its collection of  offshoring-related data, the BLS began to ask specific questions about  job losses involving domestic and overseas work relocation.

MLS identifies only a portion of total layoffs  because it does not include small establishments or layoffs involving fewer  than 50 employees. For example, in 2003, the survey covered 4.6 percent of  all U.S. establishments and 56.7 percent of all U.S. workers. In addition,  some employers may be unwilling to provide information when  interviewed about reasons for layoffs. For the first quarter of 2004, 7.2  percent of firms with mass layoff events refused to participate in the  survey. Pre-2004 MLS data had additional limitations regarding reasons for  layoffs. According to BLS officials, in surveys prior to 2004, offshoring may  have been involved in some instances when reasons such as \u201cfinancial  difficulty,\u201d \u201cbusiness ownership change,\u201d or \u201creorganization within the  company\u201d were provided by MLS respondents.", "Even with these limitations, MLS data provide some information that is  useful for understanding services offshoring.

It is also important to note that even if  there were no net job losses during a particular time period\u2014meaning that  the number of job losses did not exceed the number of job gains\u2014it is still  possible that some jobs could have been lost as a result of offshoring.", "Most industries associated with services offshoring that saw sharp declines  after 2001 had also experienced unusually strong job growth during the  previous decade. As figure 12 shows, during this expansion, growth in  employment was especially strong in IT-related sectors. For example,  employment in the computer systems and design industry grew at an  average annual rate of 11.1 percent, compared with 1.7 percent in the total  nonfarm employment. This supports the view that at least some of recent  job losses are due to the collapse of the dot.com. bubble in IT-related  sectors.", "Although some analysts have raised concerns that services offshoring has  been affecting higher-skill, higher-paying jobs, the occupational earnings  data show a mixed picture. As shown in table 5, OES data indicate that  average wages of most occupations associated with offshoring are above  the U.S. average wage.

Moreover,  some of the impact of recent offshoring was likely reflected in the baseline  employment level used in the projections. As a result, the 2012  projections, which generally indicate a lower level of employment, a slower  rate of growth for many occupations, and a faster rate of decline for some  occupations than do the 2010 projections, might partially reflect the impact  of offshoring.

For example, Forrester  does not try to estimate any other effects from offshoring, such as potential  expansion of employment in other sectors. In addition, some studies base  their estimates of future employment effects due to offshoring on the  employment level at a given point in time, rather than taking into account  how the size of the labor market or a particular industry may change over  time due to other factors. Also, several of the studies rely on discussions  and interviews with industry representatives, rather than statistically valid  surveys.", "Although the importance of these projected job losses to particular firms  and industries may be considerable, overall they are relatively small in  terms of the U.S. economy. For example, BLS\u2019s Business Employment  Dynamics (BED) series shows that the U.S. economy creates and destroys  millions of jobs each year. In 2002, for example, gross quarterly job gains  and job losses averaged 7.9 million and 8 million, respectively. Even during  the economic expansion period in the late 1990s, job losses ranged  between 7.4 million and 8.4 million per quarter, although job gains were  even larger.", "Some studies have attempted to further identify and, to some extent,  quantify the impacts of offshoring beyond the potential number of jobs lost  in particular occupations. For example, an Institute for International  Economics study argues that data on productivity are likely to be  positively affected in industries that are now able to afford IT services that  are relatively less expensive because of offshoring. The study compares  services offshoring to the increased use of information technology  hardware and the resulting productivity improvements by a range of  industries during the 1990s due to falling prices from cheaper imports.  Similarly, a study by the economic consulting firm Global Insights uses a  macro-economic model to produce data estimates on productivity benefits,  as well as other potential effects on the economy due to offshoring.  Assuming that offshoring leads to lower prices for information technology  services, the study predicts that by 2008 offshoring will lead to lower  inflationary pressures and, therefore, to lower interest rates and borrowing  costs and ultimately a higher gross domestic product of more than $100  billion (an increase of more than 0.1 percent over estimated growth  without offshoring).", "Like other federal statistics discussed above, data on productivity, prices,  and growth would capture these effects, but it may be difficult to  differentiate the effects of offshoring from other economic phenomena  occurring simultaneously. In addition, the magnitude of these effects may  be limited. As discussed in the background section, annual U.S. imports of  services only account for about 3 percent of total U.S. consumption of  services, and offshored services comprise only a subset of total services  imports.", "Other researchers argue that the effects of offshoring may show up in data  on the distribution of earnings among workers. For example, a study by the  Brookings Institution argues that offshoring may impact the  compensation of different types of workers over the longer term, rather  than on the overall level of employment in the United States, as well as  affecting the share of returns that go to profits rather than workers.  Similarly, Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has argued that in a global  economy, international trade generally increases the size of the labor pool  companies can draw upon to produce their products. Although this  increased competition among laborers may not always result in direct job  losses, it can place downward pressure on wages as businesses use the  threat of relocation to affect the bargaining position of workers. Therefore,  workers in occupations that face greater labor market competition from  abroad may experience stagnant or declining wages and other  compensation, relative to other workers. These studies suggest that data  on these types of distributional effects are important to examine, since the  direct impact of offshoring on labor and other economic variables may be  hard to capture or distinguish from other factors that affect the overall  economy."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["Recent growth in offshoring has created an extensive debate about the  extent of this activity, as well as the advantages and disadvantages for U.S.  workers, U.S.-based firms, and for the U.S. economy as a whole.

On the other hand, less is known about the specific extent of  offshoring to date. Federal statistics provide some clues as to the extent of  this activity and show that relative to imports of other services, offshoring  is a small but growing trend in the U.S. economy.

This definition  focuses on a business\u2019s sourcing decision\u2014should it produce the services  internally, source them domestically, or source them from offshore? The  imported services can include a wide range of functions, such as computer  programming, payroll and accounting, and customer call centers. When a  business replaces services it had produced internally (or had sourced from  a domestic supplier) with imported services, those services and the  domestic jobs associated with them are said to have been \u201coffshored.\u201d", "Offshoring, though, has also (though less frequently) been used to describe  the movement of domestic production (and the related jobs) offshore. In  this case, the definition focuses not on imports of services from abroad, but  on U.S. companies investing offshore. The services that companies  produce offshore may be used to supply imports to the U.S. market or to  supply foreign markets. Companies may decide to invest abroad for a  variety of reasons, such as accessing foreign markets, reducing their  production costs, or utilizing foreign labor and expertise.", "In either case, whether focusing on the use of imported services or on  moving services production offshore through foreign investment,  definitions of offshoring frequently define it in terms of the displacement of  U.S. production and employment. U.S. production and employment are  affected when U.S. producers replace services produced domestically with  imported services. Similarly, when U.S. producers move production  operations offshore, U.S. domestic production and employees are affected.  Figure 13 shows the complex range of business activities that results from  the intersection of imports, investment, and displacement of production  and employment. The business activities captured by different definitions  of offshoring may also be seen as subsets of the broader concept of  globalization, which involves increasing interaction and interdependence  among national product and factor markets.", "In the figure, the upper left oval represents imported services, the upper  right oval represents U.S. investment offshore in services production, and  the lower center oval represents U.S. production and employment  displaced for reasons including offshoring.

Region B also represents imported services that directly  replaced domestically produced services. However, the imports in region B  are provided by the U.S. company\u2019s offshore affiliate (either acquired or  started through U.S. direct investment abroad).", "Regions C through F include other business activities that are sometimes  included in broader definitions of offshoring or are difficult to distinguish  from offshoring in U.S. federal government statistics. For example, region  C covers services imports from U.S. companies\u2019 foreign affiliates that did  not directly displace U.S. employment. A company that decides to expand  its operations by producing some services offshore, but does not reduce its  U.S. workforce, would be included in this region. Whether or not this  constitutes offshoring depends on whether the displacement of U.S. jobs is  a factor in the definition of offshoring. Region D is similar to region C,  except that the imported services are supplied by an unaffiliated company  offshore (rather than a U.S. affiliate). Regions E and F are captured in  broad definitions of offshoring that focus on the movement of services  production offshore through investment, but don\u2019t focus on this production  returning to the United States in the form of imports. Region F involves the  case in which the offshore production actually displaces U.S. exports in the  foreign market. That is, the product was previously produced in the United  States and exported, but now it is produced by a U.S. company offshore  and sold offshore.", "The term \u201coffshoring\u201d is sometimes used synonymously with the term  \u201coutsourcing.\u201d However, outsourcing means acquiring services from an  outside (unaffiliated) company, which can be either another domestic  company or an offshore supplier. In contrast, a company can source  offshore services from either an unaffiliated foreign company (offshore  outsourcing) or by investing in a foreign affiliate (offshore in-house  sourcing). In the latter case, the services supplied by the company\u2019s foreign  affiliate would not be considered outsourcing since the company has an  ownership stake in both the U.S. and foreign operations.

In the following  June revision, more complete survey results are incorporated.  However,  the detailed types of services for transactions with both unaffiliated and  affiliated foreigners, as well as country data, are not released until October  of each year.

Under regulations implementing the International Investment  and Trade in Services Survey Act, U.S. persons and intermediaries are  required to furnish reports that are necessary to carry out BEA surveys and  studies provided for by the Act. Reporting annual transactions with  unaffiliated foreigners is required for transactions of over $1 million in any  one kind of service; the same size transaction is used for the benchmark  survey.  Respondents whose transactions fall below this level must report  the total level of transactions in all services. For transactions with affiliated  foreigners, the limitations are expressed in terms of the size of the affiliate.   Quarterly and annual reporting are required only for affiliates whose total  assets, sales, or net income exceed $30 million.  Although the services  surveys are mandatory, the mailing list BEA uses is constructed from  publicly available information and not from a comprehensive business  register such as those used by BLS and the Census Bureau for their  surveys.  Consequently it is likely that BEA\u2019s coverage of small or new firms  is limited. Finally, for transactions between affiliated firms, there are  questions about the reliability of the prices used to value these intrafirm  transfers.", "A standard method for measuring data reliability is to compare initial  estimates with subsequent revised estimates.

BEA recommends  that data on U.S. parents should not be added to U.S. affiliates to produce  U.S. totals. Certain data items relevant to offshoring, such as trade in  selected services, are collected only in benchmark years and do not cover  all types of services. In addition, in the benchmark survey, data on sales of  goods and services by country of destination are not collected for minority- owned affiliates and small majority-owned affiliates.", "With regard to timeliness and frequency, BEA data on MNC operations are  not available quarterly, and annual data become available with a 2-year lag.  For example, when this report was completed, the latest year for which we  had annual survey-based detail was 2001. These estimates are subject to  revision when the results of benchmark surveys are incorporated. The  most recent benchmark data on U.S. MNCs and their foreign affiliates are  for 1999.

Results of the 2002 benchmark survey are scheduled to be released  later this year.", "In 2004, BEA initiated an effort to improve the timeliness of these data. In  April 2004, BEA released summary estimates for 2002 of employment,  sales, and capital expenditures by U.S. MNCs and their foreign affiliates,  and by U.S. affiliates of foreign MNCs. The 2002 estimates to be released  later in 2004 will be based on more complete source data and include  country and industry detail.", "As noted above, the reliability of the BEA data on MNCs relates primarily to  the exemption levels of both the annual and benchmark surveys, which, in  turn, relate to efforts to restrict respondent burden. There are also several  other reliability issues with the MNC data collected by BEA that could  impact the data related to offshoring. The exemption levels for the  reporting of affiliates in the annual surveys are based on the affiliates\u2019 total  assets, sales, or net income. For majority-owned affiliates, detailed  reporting is required if either of these is greater than $100 million; less  detailed reporting is required for majority-owned affiliates with between  $30 million and $100 million. For minority-owned affiliates, reporting is  required if any of the three items is greater than $30 million. In the  benchmark survey, the exemption limit for the short form for majority or  minority-owned affiliates is $7 million of total assets, sales, or net income.  This also means that smaller affiliates are covered only once every 5 years,  so that the trends in the annual data would be misstated to the extent that  the trends for smaller affiliates differ from the larger ones. For example, if  there were rapid increases in smaller affiliates relating to an increase in  offshoring, the annual trends would understate the growth of employment  in foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs.", "Other reliability issues relate to the universe frame used by BEA to ensure  complete reporting. Although the MNC surveys are mandatory regardless  of whether a firm receives a form, the mailing list used by BEA is  constructed from publicly available information and not from  comprehensive business registers such as those used by BLS and the  Census Bureau for their own surveys. Consequently, it is possible that  BEA\u2019s coverage of small and new firms is limited. In addition, the data  reported to BEA are based largely on financial accounting records, and in  recent years many of these earlier records have been restated. BEA has not  reported that it has been obtaining revised reports from these firms.
