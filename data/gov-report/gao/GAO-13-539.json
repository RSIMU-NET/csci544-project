One exception allows companies in 23 \"qualifying countries\" to use foreign produced titanium when manufacturing aircraft components for DOD. There is concern that U.S. manufacturers are losing market share to qualifying country manufacturers that are able to use foreign produced titanium.", "The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 mandated that GAO assess the ability of U.S. aircraft component manufacturers to compete for DOD contracts. In this report, GAO assessed (1) available data on titanium prices, (2) available data on U.S. and foreign manufacturers' market share of DOD aircraft component contracts, and (3) the factors that affect the ability of U.S. aircraft component manufacturers to compete for DOD contracts. GAO reviewed Census foreign trade data, the best proxy for titanium prices; federal procurement data; and relevant industry studies; and interviewed a broad range of government and industry officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Census data show that U.S. and foreign produced titanium prices varied from 2003 through 2012 depending on the product. For example, in 2012, the export price (the proxy for the U.S. price) for titanium bar--used to make engine blades--was higher than the import price (the proxy for the foreign price), while the export price for titanium sheet--used to make wing components--was less than the import price. Industry officials noted that these differences may be due to varying operating costs and titanium production capabilities in different countries and to titanium producers' negotiated agreements with prime contractors or aircraft component manufacturers.", "U.S. aircraft component manufacturers receive the majority of Department of Defense (DOD) business, whether through direct purchases by the department or through purchases made by its prime contractors. Based on obligation of procurement money, 98 percent of DOD's purchases of aircraft components went to U.S. manufacturers from fiscal years 2008 to 2012. The remainder went to foreign manufacturers, primarily from qualifying countries. DOD prime contractors reported that over the past 10 years they have bought 70 to 100 percent of DOD titanium aircraft components from U.S. manufacturers.", "Industry officials identified management of titanium sourcing and industry consolidation, rather than titanium price, as factors affecting competition between aircraft component manufacturers for DOD business. Prime contractors generally manage titanium sourcing decisions for their DOD component manufacturers through long term agreements and an approval process that often directs competing manufacturers to the same titanium source, thereby potentially reducing pricing advantages available to aircraft component manufacturers in qualifying countries. Many officials from aircraft component manufacturers also identified industry consolidation of the titanium producers and component manufacturers as a factor that could affect their access to titanium for DOD contracts, although they have not yet seen any adverse impacts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

In an airframe,  titanium may be used in bulkheads, tail sections, landing gears, wing  supports, and fasteners. In engines, titanium may be used in blades,  rotating discs, rings, and casings.

Additionally,  DOD prime contractors can also require their component manufacturers  to purchase titanium from producers that they have approved. Prime  contractors\u2019 use of these methods to manage titanium sourcing may  reduce potential pricing advantages from the titanium sourcing flexibilities  that are available to manufacturers in qualifying countries. In addition,  many officials from aircraft component manufacturers identified industry  consolidation as a factor that could affect their ability to compete.  However, they did not identify competition for DOD contracts from  manufacturers in qualifying countries with potential pricing advantages  from titanium sourcing flexibilities as a major factor.", "According to industry officials, DOD aircraft and engine prime contractors  leverage their buying power by arranging long term agreements with  titanium producers to ensure titanium availability and pre-negotiated  prices. These arrangements usually specify titanium product, price,  quantity, and delivery schedule. In turn, prime contractors can then direct  their titanium aircraft component manufacturers in the United States or in  qualifying countries to purchase titanium under these agreements. For  example, with rotating components which are strictly controlled, the prime  contractors require component manufacturers to use the titanium from the  agreement to ensure quality. As such, potential price differences between  U.S. produced and foreign produced titanium would not impact the ability  of U.S. component manufacturers to compete with manufacturers in  qualifying countries if all manufacturers buy titanium from the same  agreement. For example, the prime contractor for the F-35 Lightning II  has negotiated a long term agreement with a U.S. titanium producer to  supply titanium at a pre-negotiated price for the airframe of the F-35  Lightning II. Given this, industry and government officials told us that  aircraft component manufacturers working for the prime contractor on the  F-35 Lightning II airframe buy titanium from the U.S. producer at the  prime contractor\u2019s pre-negotiated price.", "Industry officials also told us that DOD aircraft and engine prime  contractors often direct DOD aircraft component manufacturers to specific  titanium producers that they have approved. These officials noted that as  a part of the approval process prime contractors typically require titanium  producers to undergo a certification process that can be costly and take  over a year to ensure titanium quality. Prime contractors then direct their  aircraft component manufacturers to use titanium only from an approved  producer regardless of whether the aircraft component manufacturer is  located in the United States or a qualifying country. For example, officials  from one prime contractor told us that their company has only approved  U.S. titanium producers for DOD aircraft components and therefore they  are certain all titanium for their components are sourced from the United  States, even if the component manufacturer is located in a qualifying  country. Additionally, officials told us that in some cases prime contractors  require titanium to be produced by specific processes for DOD products.  For example, one prime contractor told us that it requires its titanium to be  produced by cold hearth melting for any components that rotate on its  DOD aircraft. According to this prime contractor, currently only two U.S.  titanium producers can meet this requirement. Consequently, aircraft  component manufacturers in the United States and qualifying countries  producing DOD rotating components for this prime contractor must use  titanium from one of these U.S. producers to meet the prime contractor\u2019s  requirement.", "Lastly, many of the officials from DOD titanium aircraft component  manufacturers that we spoke with identified consolidation between the  titanium production and aircraft component manufacturing industries as  affecting their ability to compete more than competition from  manufacturers in qualifying countries that may have titanium pricing  advantages. According to these officials, before consolidation, companies  generally performed one step in the processes of producing titanium,  manufacturing titanium aircraft components, or assembling a final product  for DOD. Thus, component manufacturers had relatively equal access to  titanium producers. In recent years, two of the three major U.S. titanium  producers have consolidated with aircraft component manufacturers.  These consolidations enable one company to perform multiple steps such  as producing titanium and manufacturing aircraft components. Officials  from manufacturers that have not consolidated told us that they are  concerned about their access to titanium from producers that have  consolidated with competing aircraft component manufacturers. However,  they have not yet seen the impact of industry consolidation on their  companies. Moreover, one official from a non-consolidated titanium  aircraft component company told us that prime contractors\u2019 sourcing  decisions would most likely continue to guarantee access to titanium for  his company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, Commerce, Interior, and Labor  for their review and comment.
