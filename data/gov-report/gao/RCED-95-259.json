Often the construction of cleanup remedies will also require subsequent operations and maintenance (O&M) activities to ensure that the remedy continues to protect human health and the environment. The costs of O&M are borne by the federal government, states, and responsible parties. When the federal government pays for the cleanup, EPA\u2019s regulations require that the states pay for most of the O&M activities. If groundwater treatment is necessary at these sites, the federal government pays 90 percent of the O&M costs for the first 10 years of such treatment and the states pay the remaining costs.At sites where no groundwater treatment is needed, EPA turns the responsibility for O&M over to the state after ensuring that the remedy is working properly. The federal government also pays for O&M activities at federal facilities that have sites on their property on the National Priorities List (NPL). When the responsible parties clean up a site, they also pay the costs of O&M activities.", "EPA monitors conditions and O&M activities at all these sites to determine if the sites\u2019 O&M plan is being followed. At those sites that currently can be used only in a limited way because waste remains in the soil or groundwater, EPA\u2019s site project managers are also required to conduct a formal review of conditions at least every 5 years\u2014known as a \u201c5-year review.\u201d", "When Superfund was reauthorized in 1986, it called for EPA to prefer treating the waste in the highly contaminated areas of a site over containing such waste because treatment was considered to be a permanent remedy. For example, in areas where soil is highly contaminated, EPA is to prefer treating the soil (by, for example, solidifying it to immobilize contaminants or applying a vacuum system to remove contaminants) instead of containing the soil (by, for example, installing a waterproof cover over it). Nevertheless, EPA sometimes selects containment for less-contaminated areas or for waste that cannot be treated successfully or cost-effectively\u2014for example, large volumes of landfill waste.

This figure reflects (1) the substantial increase in completed cleanups requiring O&M that EPA projects by the end of the century and (2) the fact that O&M is typically expected to last at least 30 years. We expect that federal costs will become relatively level over the next few decades because EPA has to pay for O&M only at the sites where groundwater is being treated, and only for 10 years.

When developing estimates of O&M costs, EPA generally assumes that O&M activities will be required for 30 years. However, EPA recently surveyed its regional project managers and found that about 20 percent of cleanups will require O&M for more than 30 years. For example, the sites where waste is contained require O&M activities\u2014to inspect and repair the cover\u2014indefinitely. Furthermore, because these containment remedies have been in place for less than 10 years, the long-term repair costs are not yet known. Groundwater treatment generally continues until the cleanup standards are met, but EPA recently concluded that many groundwater treatment systems are not as efficient as was originally hoped. As a result, more than 30 years may be required to reach cleanup goals, primarily because of contaminants in groundwater that are heavier than water and thus very difficult to extract. EPA estimates that these contaminants may be present at about 60 percent of the sites where the groundwater is contaminated.", "O&M for groundwater treatment constitutes the majority of the costs that the federal government, states, and responsible parties face. We estimate that the O&M costs for cleanups that only treat groundwater represent about 47 percent of the anticipated costs. Furthermore, we estimate that the O&M costs for cleanups that combine treating groundwater with containing waste represent about 36 percent of all O&M costs. For cleanup remedies in which surface waste is contained but groundwater is not treated, the O&M costs constitute about 12 percent of the costs that the federal government, states, and responsible parties will face. Figure 3 illustrates the share of the O&M costs each party will be expected to pay.", "Changes in EPA\u2019s policy or in the Superfund law, particularly in the guidelines for selecting cleanup remedies, could alter future O&M costs for the federal government, states, and responsible parties. For example, in recent discussions about reauthorizing the Superfund legislation, it has been suggested that the current preference for treating rather than containing surface waste might be changed to a preference for containing waste. Such a change would most likely lead to increased O&M costs because O&M activities would be required at a higher percentage of sites than is currently the case.

At these sites, the plan was not being followed; at some sites, conditions had deteriorated after the cleanup was completed.

To use the estimates reported in present-value figures in its analysis, EPA annualized the estimates using a 10-percent discount rate in order to calculate the total O&M costs over the duration of the cleanup. Unless the cleanup plan specified otherwise, EPA assumed the O&M activities would continue for 30 years. EPA also assumed a 5-year lag between the time the cleanup plan was signed and the start of the O&M activities, unless actual data were available. To allow for comparison, EPA converted all dollar figures to 1994 dollars, using a uniform 4-percent annual rate of inflation.", "To estimate the states\u2019 share of future O&M costs, EPA categorized the cleanup plans as either non-groundwater or groundwater cleanups. For EPA-funded cleanups not including groundwater contamination, EPA assumed that the states pay 100 percent of the O&M costs over the entire cleanup period.

We also checked whether cleanup plans were properly categorized as involving groundwater contamination or not. We did not find any significant discrepancies. Because we were concerned about whether the estimates in the cleanup plans were a good indicator of actual O&M costs, we compared the estimates for the 17 sites for which we performed case studies with the actual O&M costs incurred. Some costs were higher or lower than the estimates, but we did not detect any bias in one direction or the other that would affect the use of these estimates to forecast future costs.

However, most EPA managers had originally estimated these values using a 5-percent discount rate, as prescribed by EPA guidance issued in October 1988, although some managers used other rates. EPA\u2019s use of a 10-percent discount rate to annualize these values thus resulted in an overstatement of the original estimates of O&M costs in the cleanup plans.

To estimate these latter costs, we took the following steps, using 650 cleanup plans signed during FY 1988 through 1991 and their estimated O&M costs for the first 10 years:", "First, we estimated the groundwater treatment portion of O&M costs for cleanups addressing both groundwater contamination and surface waste. We estimated this portion to be 75 percent. We arrived at this figure by dividing the average O&M cost for the 220 cleanup plans that address only groundwater contamination by the sum of this average and the average O&M cost for the 168 cleanup plans that involved only containment of surface waste.", "Second, we estimated the ratio of the groundwater treatment portion of O&M costs to the total O&M costs for all 360 cleanup plans involving groundwater treatment, whether alone or in combination with surface waste containment. We determined this ratio to be 89 percent. As described above, for cleanup plans involving both groundwater treatment and surface waste containment, we assumed that 75 percent of the O&M costs are due to the groundwater treatment. For plans addressing only groundwater contamination, we assumed that 100 percent of the O&M costs are due to groundwater treatment.", "Finally, we estimated the federal portion of O&M costs for cleanup plans involving groundwater treatment. By statute, the federal government pays 90 percent of the total O&M costs during the first 10 years of such cleanups. Therefore, we multiplied this 90 percent by 89 percent, our estimate of the share of O&M costs represented by groundwater treatment, as described above. This calculation resulted in our assumption that the federal portion of O&M costs for EPA-funded cleanups is 80 percent for the first 10 years of cleanups involving groundwater treatment. This differs from EPA\u2019s assumption that the federal portion is 50 percent because EPA did not go through such steps to more specifically estimate groundwater-related O&M costs.", "Table II.1 shows where GAO\u2019s and EPA\u2019s assumptions differ on the portion of O&M costs that will be paid by the federal and state governments.", "80% (GAO)", "20% (GAO)", "50% (EPA)", "50% (EPA)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating States\u2019 Costs", "paragraphs": ["We assumed that the states will pay 100 percent of the O&M costs for cleanups addressing surface waste that were originally funded by EPA.

Both we, through our review of 17 case studies and our analyses of 43 5-year reviews, and EPA\u2019s Inspector General have identified cases in which covers were not maintained and groundwater sampling was not performed as required in the O&M plans. The following cases highlight these instances.", "In our discussions with officials in EPA\u2019s Region IV, we identified a significant problem in monitoring O&M activities at the A.L. Taylor site (Valley of the Drums), located in Bullitt County, Kentucky. The state is now responsible for monitoring the waterproof cover used to contain chemical waste. However, local land-use controls to prevent activities that could potentially damage the cover have not been implemented. EPA and the state have had difficulty implementing land-use controls because the site is privately owned. Implementing land-use controls could have been critical at this site because the landowner was using the site as a junkyard for cars, potentially damaging the cover. After discussions with the state, however, the landowner agreed to remove the cars. Such a situation stresses the importance of continuous monitoring. Without it, EPA may not be aware of similar problems that may be occurring at other sites.", "EPA\u2019s Inspector General, during a site visit, identified a significant problem in monitoring O&M activities at the Heleva Landfill site in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. A pond adjacent to the landfill receives much of the site\u2019s surface water runoff. The pond overflowed onto the waterproof cover, damaging it. In addition, the project manager responsible for monitoring the site was unaware of the requirement to sample surface water, such as the pond, even though the cleanup plan required doing so at least once every 3 months. In fact, no sampling had been performed since the waterproof cover was installed in 1990. Animals had also damaged the cover by burrowing holes in it.", "In our analysis of reports on EPA\u2019s 5-year reviews, we identified instances in which EPA had developed recommendations to address problems with maintaining covers. For example, at the Mowbray Engineering site in Greenville, Alabama, EPA recommended that the responsible party mow the cover regularly to prevent grass from growing too high. In addition, EPA recommended that the responsible party prevent trees from growing on top of the cover because the tree roots can potentially damage the cover. EPA also recommended that the fence surrounding the site be cleared of kudzu, a vine-like vegetation, so that the fence can be readily inspected.", "We also identified some sites in which EPA developed recommendations to address problems with sampling the groundwater. In EPA\u2019s 5-year review of the Middletown Road Dump site in Annapolis, Maryland, EPA recommended that further groundwater sampling be conducted. Although EPA collected groundwater samples during its review, it could not conclude whether the groundwater was still a health threat. Therefore, additional sampling was recommended. In another example, for the Triangle Chemical Company Superfund site in Bridge City, Texas, EPA recommended that the state conduct groundwater sampling more frequently because contamination levels are still above acceptable levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Philip Farah, Economist Fran Featherston, Senior Social Science Analyst Mary D.
