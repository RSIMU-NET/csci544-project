Both organizations cancelled numerous activities as a result of the raids  and the initiation of the trial. IRI and NDI cancelled election observation,  voter education activities, and political party development trainings,  among others. In addition, NDI closed civil society resource centers in  Egypt and stopped plans to establish a media center for training political  parties and candidates in Egypt.

NGOs receiving foreign funding in  Egypt reported that they had faced challenges in implementing their  activities well before the 2011 revolution and 2012 trial. For example,  some Egyptian NGOs reported experiencing delays in getting approval  from the Ministry of Social Solidarity to receive foreign funding since at  least 2009. In addition, some U.S.-based NGOs reported facing delays in  the registration process prior to 2011. One U.S-based NGO applied for  registration in 2005, but did not receive it until 2010, according to an  official from that organization. However, after the revolution and raids on  NGOs\u2019 offices in 2011, some U.S.-funded NGOs were able to  successfully implement their democracy and governance projects. For  example, one U.S.-based NGO, which had obtained registration, was  able to implement a project on election administration, electoral  processes, and citizen participation after the revolution and raids. After  the raids on a number of NGOs\u2019 offices in December 2011, NGO officials  reported that some groups were initially reluctant to accept U.S.  government funding, to include U.S. government branding on their  materials, and to participate in U.S.-funded projects.", "The trial exacerbated an already challenging environment for Egyptian  civil society organizations. According to USAID reviews of its democracy  and governance assistance in 2011 and 2012, negative press reports in  the Egyptian media about civil society organizations affected the ability of  civil society organizations to operate. Such organizations were portrayed  by the Egyptian media as spies because they were receiving foreign  funding, according to NGO officials with whom we spoke in Egypt. USAID  grantees reported facing delays in getting Egyptian government approval  for their activities several months before and during the time period of the  trial. A 2012 report by the USAID Inspector General found that in March  2012, 12 of the 24 NGOs to which USAID had awarded grants after the  2011 revolution\u2014with activities worth $28.5 million\u2014were not on track to  achieve their goals. According to the Inspector General\u2019s report, although  the program began in April 2011, at least 7 of the 16 Egyptian  organizations had not received Egyptian government approval to receive  foreign funding by March 2012, with 1 organization\u2019s approval denied and  other organizations\u2019 activities delayed up to 11 months after USAID had  awarded their grants. According to USAID officials, USAID eventually  terminated three of its grants because the organizations implementing the  grants determined that they were not able to meet their program  objectives, which may have stemmed in part from delays or a lack of  approval to receive foreign funding. State/MEPI officials noted that some  of the NGOs that they funded in 2011 withdrew from their grants for  similar reasons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Amount of Funding and Number of Grants Awarded for Democracy and Governance Projects in Egypt Decreased after the NGO Trial", "paragraphs": ["Since the beginning of the NGO trial in 2012, the number and total dollar  value of grants awarded for democracy and governance activities in  Egypt has decreased. U.S. officials noted that the NGO trial and the  hostile environment it created for democracy and governance assistance  contributed to this decrease. In addition, they noted that other factors also  contributed to the significant decrease in democracy and governance  funding awarded in fiscal years after 2011. For example, due to changing  circumstances in Egypt, USAID did not submit a notification to Congress  of its intent to obligate fiscal year 2012 funds for democracy and  governance assistance to Egypt until February 2014 and did not submit a  notification to Congress of its intent to obligate fiscal year 2013 funds for  democracy and governance assistance to Egypt until May 2014.  According to our review of USAID and State data, between fiscal year  2009 and March 31, 2014, USAID has awarded about $108 million and  State has awarded about $32 million for democracy and governance  assistance to Egypt. With the use of $65 million in prior year ESF funding  in 2011, State and USAID significantly increased the number of  democracy and governance activities that they funded in Egypt. For  example, USAID almost tripled the number of grants it awarded for  democracy and governance from 10 grants in fiscal year 2010 to 27  grants in fiscal year 2011. In addition, MEPI awarded 53 grants for  democracy and governance in Egypt in fiscal year 2011, compared with  24 grants in fiscal year 2010. However, as shown in figures 2 and 3  below, the amount of funding and number of grants awarded for  democracy and governance assistance to Egypt have decreased  significantly since fiscal year 2011. For example, the amount of funding  that USAID awarded declined by nearly 60 percent from fiscal year 2011  to fiscal year 2012, going from about $52 million to about $21 million. It  declined further to about $4 million in fiscal year 2013.

The U.S.  government cannot ensure that there will be no unintended or adverse  consequences in providing democracy and governance assistance, but it  can take steps to identify and manage potential risks. In planning its  significant expansion of democracy and governance assistance in Egypt  after the 2011 revolution, the U.S. government identified potential risks,  given the Egyptian government\u2019s past objections to the direct funding of  NGOs to promote democracy dating back to 2005.
