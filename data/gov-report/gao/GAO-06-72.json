The health benefit cost provision had minimal impact on DOD's fiscal year 2005 competitive sourcing program. Of the 54 public-private competitions we reviewed, the health benefit provision was applicable in only 12 sourcing decisions. In 7 of these 12 competitions, DOD collected health benefit cost data from private sector offerors and found that most of their health benefit costs exceeded 5.5 percent of direct labor costs. This is largely due to the requirements of the Service Contract Act--which mandates minimum wages and fringe benefits (which could include health insurance) for employees on government service contracts.

DOD decided to use the Circular A-76 standard health  benefits cost factor as the benchmark for ensuring that the costs of health  benefits provided by private offerors are sufficient to comply with the  legislation.  In November 2004, DOD communicated this approach as the  preferred process throughout the department, but gave discretion to the  competitive sourcing program offices of the DOD components to use  alternate processes, as long as they consulted with DOD\u2019s competitive  sourcing office.", "Under DOD\u2019s process, contracting officials are to follow a multistep  approach to implement the health benefit cost comparability provision.  First, for competitions conducted subsequent to the issuance of DOD\u2019s  guidance, contracting officials should obtain data from the private offeror  regarding the company\u2019s costs for contributions to employee health  insurance (i.e., benefits) as well as its proposed direct labor costs for the  performance of the competed commercial activity. Second, the contracting  officials calculate the private offeror\u2019s costs of employee health benefits as  a percentage of direct labor costs. Finally, contracting officials make any  necessary adjustments to their calculation of the private offeror\u2019s  proposed costs using the following criteria:  If the health benefit cost percentage is lower than 5.5 percent, then the  private offeror\u2019s proposed cost is adjusted upward by the amount  necessary to make the contribution equal 5.5 percent.", "If the percentage contribution is equal to or greater than 5.5 percent, no  adjustment is necessary.", "Hypothetical examples of this process are shown in table 2.", "According to DOD officials, any health benefit cost adjustment made to  the private offeror\u2019s proposed costs is for evaluation and cost comparison  purposes only. For work currently performed within the agency, if  contracting officials determine that the private offeror has a higher priced  proposal than the agency\u2019s cost estimate, either before or after any  adjustments for health benefit contributions, DOD will retain the work  within the agency. If a private offeror selected for award under the  solicitation\u2019s evaluation criteria has a lower cost proposal after any  adjustment for health benefit contributions\u2014and contractor performance  would save DOD at least $10 million or 10 percent of the agency team\u2019s  personnel-related costs\u2014the offeror will be awarded a contract at its  original proposed amount. Section 8014 does not compel DOD officials to  reject a private offeror\u2019s proposal based solely on the cost or extent of the  company\u2019s health benefit coverage. Nor does it require the private offeror  to match the DOD\u2019s health benefit costs, since according to DOD officials  this would in effect have to be subsidized by DOD through higher awarded  costs.", "DOD officials told us that using the 5.5 percent Circular A-76 cost factor to  implement the health benefit cost legislation accomplishes several  objectives. First, the approach is consistent with the requirement of the  statute that private sector offerors not receive a competitive advantage by  offering to pay less for health benefits than what the government pays.  Second, DOD officials believe the approach is fair because it ensures that  proposals from both the public and private sectors have an equal health  benefit cost component of at least 5.5 percent. Third, the approach is  consistent with the standard adjustment agency sources already make to  account for health benefit costs when preparing agency cost estimates.  Fourth, DOD officials said that the process reduces the chances of human  error and miscalculations inherent in alternative approaches that might  attempt to compare the quality of public and private health benefits. DOD  officials commented that it would be difficult to do a true \u201capples-to- apples\u201d comparison of federal and private sector health benefit plan costs  because of the wide variation among federal civilian and private sector  plan benefits and employee participation.

These early implementation efforts were generally  consistent with the preferred process that DOD later communicated in  November 2004. For example, Navy and Marine Corps contracting officials  told us they issued amendments to ongoing solicitations in which they  requested information from private offerors to implement the health  benefit provision.

DLA\u2019s process, which it continues to use, differs from DOD\u2019s and is based  on using the monthly premium contributions DOD is required to make  under the FEHBP towards civilian employees\u2019 health insurance as the  benchmark for comparing private offerors\u2019 health benefit coverage and  costs. DLA\u2019s process requires detailed data collection and the use of a  complex benefit and cost comparison method. Specifically, for a private  offeror to demonstrate that it meets DLA\u2019s health benefit cost  comparability benchmark, the company first must provide data showing  that  its health insurance plan allows employees to enroll either self-alone or  self-and-family, and the amount the company contributes towards the plan\u2019s premium cost is at  least the lower of the following two benchmarks: (1) the monthly  maximum amount of DOD\u2019s premium contribution for self-alone and self- and-family coverage under FEHBP\u2014$298.23 and $646.17, respectively, or  (2) 75 percent of the cost of the company plan\u2019s monthly premium, which  is the same cap set for any government contributions under the FEHBP.", "Next, DLA\u2019s process requires that the contracting officer calculate the  offeror\u2019s health benefit costs for self-alone and self-and-family coverage,  and compare those costs with the agency\u2019s health benefit cost benchmarks  under FEHBP, and make any cost adjustments based on the following  criteria:  If the private offeror\u2019s health benefit plan cost equals or exceeds the lesser  of DLA\u2019s two premium contribution benchmarks, no upward adjustment  is made to its cost proposal.", "If the private offeror\u2019s health plan cost does not meet one of DLA\u2019s two  premium contribution benchmarks, a \u201chealth benefit cost factor\u201d is added  to the private offeror\u2019s proposal cost to make up the shortfall.", "As with DOD\u2019s process, such adjustments, if necessary, are made by DLA  only for the purpose of determining compliance with the health benefit  cost provision. If the private offeror still has the lower costs after such  adjustment and completion of the cost comparison\u2014and meets the  minimum $10 million or 10 percent savings margin required for contractor  conversion\u2014the private offeror may be awarded a contract at its original  proposal amount.", "In explaining the rationale for this process, DLA officials told us that their  interpretation of section 8014 focused on determining that private offerors  not receive a competitive advantage when they contribute less towards the  premium share than the amount that is paid by DOD for civilian  employees\u2019 health benefits under FEHBP. DLA consulted in advance with  DOD\u2019s competitive sourcing office, which concurred with DLA\u2019s proposed  process for implementation. DOD\u2019s competitive sourcing officials told us  that they consider DLA\u2019s process to be more complicated to administer  than the preferred process of using the 5.5 percent health benefit cost  benchmark. Nevertheless, they told us that DLA\u2019s process is consistent  with DOD\u2019s current guidance which allows the use of an alternative  process to implement the requirement for a health benefit cost  comparison, as long as components consult in advance with DOD.", "Either of the processes used by DOD or DLA provides a reasonable  approach for ensuring that private offerors do not receive a competitive  advantage for less costly health benefits. Use of two different processes,  however, results in health benefit costs being treated inconsistently within  DOD and could even result in different competitive sourcing outcomes.", "For example, in one of the competitions we reviewed, the company\u2019s  contribution for health benefits totaled about 15 percent of its total direct  labor costs.

Under DLA\u2019s process, however, the contracting  officer found that the private offeror\u2019s share of the health insurance  premium fell short of DLA\u2019s benchmark for self-and-family coverage. As a  result, the contracting officer added about $280,000 to the private offeror\u2019s  cost proposal to make up for the shortfall. Ultimately, because the agency  cost estimate was lower, regardless of the health care addition, this  adjustment did not change the competitive sourcing decision.

Specifically, under the concept, the former government employees could  temporarily keep their participation in federal health insurance and  retirement benefit programs while transitioning from federal government  to private sector employment status.

According to one analysis of this topic, the benefits of a transitional  benefit corporation include    Economic development and savings:  The government would realize  savings more quickly than through the A-76 competition process.  For  example, the estimated time period to develop a transitional benefit  corporation is 6 months, with savings realized shortly thereafter.  The  current A-76 process may be much longer and therefore would not provide  savings as quickly.  Also, savings to the government would also result from  no longer needing to maintain underutilized assets and personnel.", "Surge capability/readiness:  The government could contract with the  transitional benefit corporation in order to expand its workforce rapidly  and draw on the former employees during times of increased government  workload.  Because the transitional benefit corporation is a private  organization, it would be able to hire staff outside the constraints of  traditional government hiring, which can slow the hiring process. \u201cSoft landing\u201d for former government employees:  Government employees  who would become part of the transitional benefit corporation would be  guaranteed their job and allowed to retain their government benefits, such  as pension and health insurance, for a certain time period.", "According to one analyst, for the transitional benefit corporation concept  to be a viable alternative to A-76 and for the government to realize its  potential benefits, three conditions must exist.  First, displaced federal  employees must have the appropriate skills to compete in private sector.   Second, private sector competitors must be present within the same  business area.  Third, the agency proposing the creation of a transitional  benefit corporation must have adequate knowledge about the current  market conditions and whether or not workload would be sufficient for  the new organization to be viable and maintain revenue.", "DOD competitive sourcing officials told us that they do not consider the  concept as a viable alternative to competing commercial activities under  the A-76 competitive sourcing process. DOD officials commented that the  A-76 process is more appropriate because it emphasizes a competitive  process to select a service provider, while the transitional benefit  corporation concept would use a sole-source approach that preserves  specific jobs and benefits for affected employees.
