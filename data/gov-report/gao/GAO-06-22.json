However, institutions vary in how they evaluate and apply a student's transferable credits. Many officials from postsecondary institutions with regional accreditation told GAO that they would not accept credits earned from nationally accredited institutions. To streamline the transfer process, most institutions have transfer agreements with other institutions that generally provide for the acceptance of credits from the other institution without further evaluation. In some instances, institutions review student credits--not rejected for other reasons, such as accreditation--to determine comparability to their academic offerings. State legislation, statewide initiatives, and the accreditation standards that accrediting agencies set help facilitate the transfer of academic credits from one postsecondary institution to another. Among other things, states support the establishment of statewide transfer agreements, common core curricula, and common course numbering systems. Accrediting agencies facilitate the transfer process through the standards they set. The accrediting agencies that GAO reviewed generally adhere to the principle that institutions should not accept or deny transfer credit exclusively on the basis of a sending institution's type of accreditation. A student's inability to transfer credit may result in longer enrollment, more tuition payments, and additional federal financial aid, but current data do not allow GAO to quantify its effects on the students or the federal government. Data are not available on the number of credits that do not transfer, making it difficult to assess the actual costs associated with nontransferable credits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Because thousands of students transfer each year from one postsecondary  institution to another, the credit transfer process, to the extent that it  delays students\u2019 progress, can affect the affordability of postsecondary  education and the time it takes students to graduate.

Annually,  the federal government invests billions of dollars\u2014$21 billion in 2004\u2014in  student financial aid under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended  (HEA). Because of the federal government\u2019s large investment in student  financial aid, it is in the best interest of taxpayers that transfer students do  not unnecessarily repeat coursework, since such repetition could result in  additional financial aid awards.", "Postsecondary institutions, state governments, and accrediting agencies  all play critical roles in the transfer process. As part of the transfer  process, receiving institutions must decide whether the credits of  incoming students are equivalent to those of their own course offerings.  States can influence the transfer process through legislation and  regulation, and accrediting agencies provide general guidelines regarding  the transfer of credit. Congress requires postsecondary institutions to be  accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of  Education (Education) before its students can become eligible for federal  financial aid.", "In recent years, the ability of students to transfer credits has taken on  added importance because of increasing numbers of transfer students and  the changing nature of the types of institutions they attend. In general,  Education recognizes two main types of accrediting agencies\u2014regional  and national. Regional accrediting agencies review institutions in a region  of the United States that includes at least three states that are reasonably  close to one another. National accrediting agencies review programs or  specialized institutions, such as acupuncture schools or private business  schools, on a national basis. In recent years, some nationally accredited  institutions have broadened their curricula to bring their course offerings  into line with those of traditional 4-year academic institutions. Yet  students from these types of institutions have complained that they have  been denied transfer credits on the basis of accreditation.", "As Congress considers the reauthorization of HEA, it has requested  information on the processes and requirements that postsecondary  institutions have in place to assess requests to transfer academic credits.  You asked us to provide information on the credit transfer process,  including how and when decisions are made to accept or reject credits for  transfer. Specifically in this report, we examined (1) how postsecondary  education institutions decide which credits to accept for transfer, (2) how  states and accrediting agencies facilitate the credit transfer process, and  (3) the implications for students and the federal government of students\u2019  inability to transfer credits.", "To answer these questions, we reviewed transfer of credit policies from a  nationally representative random sample of 2-year public and 4-year public  and private institutions. In addition, we conducted site visits in California,  Florida, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York, where we interviewed  officials from public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit  postsecondary institutions that were nationally and regionally accredited.  In order to get a broad perspective on the challenges that students face  when transferring credit, we selected states with large transfer student  populations and varying levels of involvement in the credit transfer  process. We also interviewed officials from state education agencies  regarding institutional transfer policies and state initiatives to facilitate  credit transfer. We also interviewed officials from accrediting agencies and  national experts on credit transfer. Further, we reviewed state legislation  and accrediting agencies\u2019 standards concerning transfer of credits. Finally,  we examined Education\u2019s databases on postsecondary institutions. We  reviewed documentation about the various methodologies used to collect  the data in the databases and conducted interviews to establish the  reliability of the data.

Education\u2019s  National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) found that 40 percent of  students who entered college in the 1995-1996 academic year attended at  least two institutions in the following six years. Many students enroll in  community colleges with a plan for eventually transferring to a 4-year  baccalaureate program. As a result, 4-year institutions face pressure to  award transfer credit for coursework taken at another institution.", "Data show that students transfer in numerous directions. Traditional  transfer is typically from a 2-year institution to a 4-year institution.", "However, students also transfer from 4-year institutions to 2-year  institutions, known as reverse transfer, as well as laterally between similar  institutions (e.g., 2-year to 2-year or 4-year to 4-year). As shown in figure 1,  traditional transfer accounts for at least one-third of first transfer activity.", "When students want to transfer their earned academic credits from one  institution to another, they must submit a transcript showing their  coursework and earned grades to the receiving institution. The receiving  institution may then evaluate the transcript and assess the educational  quality of the student\u2019s learning experience, compare the level and content  of the learning experience with those of the learning experience offered by  the receiving institution, and determine the applicability of the student\u2019s  coursework to the degree or programs offered at the receiving institution.  To help streamline the evaluation process, sending and receiving  institutions enter into voluntary transfer agreements, which contain  criteria for credits to transfer.", "Today, many students who begin their studies at private, for-profit  institutions transfer to public or private nonprofit 4-year institutions. To  meet this demand, many private, for-profit institutions have revamped  their curricula, transforming what had chiefly been vocational training  aimed at job placement to a core educational curriculum that prepares  students to pursue associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, and even graduate degrees.", "The Department of Education administers federal postsecondary  education programs, including the Title IV federal financial aid programs  under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. To be eligible for  federal financial aid, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an  accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Accrediting  agencies are private educational associations of regional or national scope  that develop evaluation standards and conduct site visits to evaluate  postsecondary institutions. To become recognized, an accrediting agency  must submit a written application to Education that lays out its standards  for accrediting institutions as well as its procedures for ensuring that  institutions follow those standards. Education requires accrediting  agencies to set standards that instruct institutions to have the resources  and policies in place to provide a quality education. Education applies the  same requirements to both regional and national accrediting agencies.  Education has recognized eight regional accrediting agencies that  generally accredit academic degree granting institutions in their specific  region of the country, and about 50 national accrediting agencies that  accredit various kinds of specialized postsecondary institutions, such as  technological or religious institutions, and programs such as nursing and  engineering.", "The most current national data on students show that in September 2003,  an estimated 15.2 million students were enrolled in postsecondary  institutions; 77 percent of these students were enrolled in public  institutions, 17 percent in private nonprofit institutions, and 6 percent  enrolled in private for-profit institutions. Additionally, about 6,900 degree-  and non-degree-granting postsecondary education institutions had  students that were receiving federal financial aid.

Education uses a formula  to determine the amount of a student\u2019s financial need and his or her  expected family contribution toward tuition, taking into account a number  of factors including the student\u2019s or family\u2019s resources and the costs of  attending an institution. In their financial aid packages, students may  receive federal grants or loans, with the neediest students receiving about  $4,000 per year in a Pell grant and up to $4,000 in loans under the Perkins  loan program.

Institutions may also assess the equivalency of  coursework taken at other institutions, either through establishing transfer  agreements covering a number of courses or on a course-by-course basis.

We found that about 84 percent of postsecondary institutions  had policies to consider the accreditation of the sending institution when  assessing transfer credits. About 63 percent of these institutions specified  that accreditation from any regional accrediting agency was acceptable,  and about 14 percent specified that they accepted national accreditation.  Institutions indicating that they accepted regional accreditation told us  that they also provide students with other options for getting their credits  transferred, such as passing a competency examination before their  credits would be granted. Many also said that they would allow any  student to appeal a decision, and an appeal would result in a more  thorough review of the student\u2019s transcript.", "Several officials from postsecondary institutions with regional  accreditation told us that as a rule, they did not accept credits earned at  institutions with national accreditation. For example, an official at one  institution told us that the institution did not accept credits from  nationally accredited institutions because the coursework was technical  and not academic. Similarly, an official at a regionally accredited  institution told us that the institution could not accept credits from  nationally accredited institutions unless the accrediting standards of the  sending institution paralleled their own standards. One reason given by  regional accrediting agency official for the incomparability of credits  earned at nationally accredited institutions was that these institutions  follow less stringent standards regarding such factors as faculty  qualifications and library resources. However, our review of the standards  from the regional accrediting agencies found that no regional accrediting  agency explicitly stated in its written policy that credits from nationally  accredited institutions should be denied.", "We found that about 11 percent of institutions have policies that explicitly  state that they will accept both regionally and nationally accredited  credits. For example, one institution\u2019s credit transfer policy states that it  will accept credits from \u201cuniversities and colleges with accreditations by  one of the regional accrediting associations,\u2026 community and technical  colleges with accreditation by one of the regional accrediting  associations,\u2026 and technical colleges, business colleges and other schools  lacking regional accreditation but having accreditation by another agency  recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation .\u201d  Officials from a regionally accredited institution told us that they would  accept credits regardless of accreditation and would review all credits the  same way. However, this process was more time-consuming than relying  solely on accreditation. To save time, some institutions had developed  databases to track previously approved courses in order to remove the  need to reevaluate them.", "Officials at a nationally accredited institution told us that their students  often have difficulty transferring credits and that they are taking actions to  assist their prospective transfer students. They told us that regionally  accredited institutions did not always accept courses taken at the  nationally accredited institution. They advised students to assume that  credits would not transfer to regionally accredited institutions. Two  nationally accredited institutions we visited have responded to the credit  transfer difficulties by attaining, or seeking to attain, regional  accreditation in order to improve their students\u2019 ability to transfer credits.  One of the three nationally accredited institutions we visited\u2014the  institution with dual national-regional accreditation\u2014reported having no  problems with transferring its students to 4-year institutions. In lieu of  seeking dual accreditation, another nationally accredited institution we  visited is reaching out to regionally accredited institutions to develop  transfer agreements to facilitate the transfer process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutions Said That Transfer Agreements, though Time-Consuming, Do Facilitate Transfers", "paragraphs": ["While many institutions use accreditation as a factor to assess transfer  credits, about 69 percent of postsecondary institutions have entered into  voluntary transfer agreements with other institutions. Typically,  institutions we visited establish transfer agreements with institutions that  send large numbers of transfer students. For example, Columbia College  in Missouri\u2014a college with campuses in 11 states\u2014has transfer  agreements with 18 community colleges throughout the country. In these  agreements, receiving institutions review a number of courses from  sending institutions and agree to accept comparable credits from that  institution. For example, the State University of New York system has a  transfer agreement among all of its institutions specifying that all 4 year  universities will accept associate degrees from community colleges within  its system, thus guaranteeing a baccalaureate degree with the completion  of 60 additional credits. Agreements can also cover individual courses,  such as mathematics and science courses that are required prerequisites  for upper-level courses.", "Institution officials told us that although maintaining transfer agreements  requires considerable commitment, these agreements are useful because  they make the transfer process more transparent and allow it to operate  more smoothly. The agreements require receiving institutions to review  the course content of each partner institution to determine its  comparability and applicability to meeting the degree program  requirements. Maintaining these agreements requires regular ongoing  communication between participating institutions to keep apprised of all  new course offerings or any changes to current courses or degree  requirements. According to officials from several of the schools we visited,  the process of establishing the agreements and keeping them current  requires considerable commitment because institutions frequently revise  their courses and degree requirements. For example, it took one private  institution in New Jersey a full year to review courses for every  community college with which it had established new transfer agreements.  At another institution we visited, the official responsible for credit  evaluation told us that the time required for maintaining transfer  agreements had led the institution to reduce the number of its transfer  agreements by about 25 percent. While transfer agreements can be time- consuming, they help make the transfer process more transparent. For  example, in New Jersey, many 4-year institutions have established transfer  agreements with community colleges in the state. Community college  students may also access a Web page listing courses at their institution  that will transfer to participating 4-year institutions in New Jersey,  allowing students to know which credits will transfer before they apply to  a new institution. One official told us that the transfer agreements, once  established, allow the credit transfer process to operate smoothly between  the partnering institutions, because it becomes a matter of checking a list  to determine which credits to accept or deny.", "Officials offered a variety of reasons for pursuing transfer agreements. In  some instances, transfer agreements were mandated in state law or  facilitated by state agencies, but these types of agreements were usually  between public institutions only. In other instances, institutions sought to  establish transfer agreements out of convenience because of the  significant number of students that moved between their institutions. In  addition to states and institutions, another organization we visited is also  involved in facilitating the establishment of transfer agreements. To  improve access to baccalaureate programs for certain populations of  minority students, the National Articulation and Transfer Network has  facilitated transfer agreements between community colleges and minority- serving institutions across the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutions Review the Comparability of Coursework but Vary in How They Administer This Process", "paragraphs": ["Some institutions review students\u2019 transcripts to determine the  comparability of the students\u2019 coursework.

Institutions may ask for a course description or a class syllabus to  support their assessment. To expedite this review, some institutions  maintain a historical list of transfer courses that they have accepted in the  past. While not always a guarantee of transferability, listed courses have a  greater likelihood of acceptance than unlisted courses.", "At the institutions we visited, two groups of reviewing officials are  generally responsible for determining which courses to accept for transfer:  (1) an admissions or other administrative officer, who determines which  courses meet general requirements, and (2) academic department faculty  members, who determine which courses meet degree requirements within  their departments. When reviewing officials consider the student\u2019s official  transcript, they may review transfer agreements and historical lists of  accepted courses, request the syllabus or a list of books used in the  course, or discuss the course with a representative from the sending  institution or use an Internet service, such as the one maintained by the  American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, to  obtain a syllabus and description of the course, among other things. This  process is shown in figure 4.", "Some 4-year institutions, citing time constraints and a significant backlog,  have taken steps to limit the number of courses they review. Some  institutions have established criteria for transferable courses, such as  determining the minimum grade or course level for which credits will be  accepted. Several 4-year institutions told us that they did not accept for  transfer any remedial (developmental) courses, technical courses, or  upper-level courses taken at a 2-year institution. Because of the backlog  created by the number of transcripts to review, not all institutions succeed  in providing students with an official report of transfer credits accepted  before classes begin. Officials at one institution told us that they provide  the report within 1 year of the student\u2019s matriculation and encourage  students to take upper-level general education courses in the interim until  the report is received."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some States and Accrediting Agencies Facilitate the Credit Transfer Process", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate the transfer of academic credits, states enact a variety of  legislation and implement statewide initiatives covering primarily public  postsecondary institutions, and accrediting agencies set accreditation  standards.

Some states have established a common course numbering system  for public institutions within the state and created statewide committees  to oversee the transfer of credit process within the state. In other states,  state law requires university systems to initiate and form transfer  agreements with institutions within the system to enhance the  transferability of credits. Some states have also launched statewide  initiatives to encourage transfer between 2-year and 4-year public  institutions, including offering guarantees that credit will transfer. For  their part, accrediting agencies facilitate the transfer process through the  standards they set for affiliated institutions. Accrediting agencies that we  reviewed have set standards for accreditation that require institutions to  make their credit transfer policy publicly available. The six regional  accrediting agencies that we reviewed generally encourage their member  institutions not to accept or deny transfer credit exclusively on the basis of  the accreditation of the sending institution.

In general,  most of the legislation focuses on facilitating the transfer of credit for  students transferring from community colleges to 4-year public  institutions.", "Some states require or encourage the establishment of statewide transfer  agreements. For example, a Massachusetts statute empowers its board of  higher education to develop and implement a statewide transfer  agreement to facilitate the transfer of students without the loss of  academic credit or standing from one public institution to another.  Arizona law requires institutions to cooperate in operating a statewide  transfer network to facilitate the transfer of community college students to  Arizona public universities without a loss of credit toward a baccalaureate  degree. An Indiana statute requires the state\u2019s Commission for Higher  Education to develop statewide transfer of credit agreements for courses  that are most frequently taken by undergraduates. Colorado\u2019s statewide  transfer policy guarantees that as many as 37 credits of approved general  education courses taken at a Colorado public college or university will  transfer among all 2-year and 4-year institutions in the state.", "Some states require or encourage the establishment of common core  curricula. A California statute directed the governing boards of the  University of California, the California State University, and the California  community colleges to jointly develop and adopt a common core  curriculum in general education for the purpose of transfer. These efforts  led to California\u2019s general education transfer curriculum, which identifies  courses that community college students may complete to satisfy general  education requirements at campuses of both the University of California  and California State University systems. An Arkansas statute requires the  Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board to consult with colleges  and universities to establish a minimum core of courses that applies  toward the general education core curriculum requirements and is fully  transferable between state institutions.", "Some states require or encourage the establishment of a common course  numbering system. Florida has developed a statewide course numbering  system that provides a database of equivalent postsecondary courses at  public vocational technical centers, community colleges, universities, and  participating nonpublic institutions. More than 100 institutions in Texas  participate in the state\u2019s voluntary course numbering program, which  provides a shared, uniform set of course designations for students and  their advisers to use in determining both course equivalency and degree  applicability of transfer credits on a statewide basis.", "Some state statutes identify the types of courses or blocks of courses that  are transferable. For example, Missouri officials told us that they interpret  their state law as requiring all institutions to accept associate degrees from  any source as evidence that general education courses have been  completed. Additionally, to facilitate student transfer among Missouri  institutions and to increase institutions\u2019 accountability for student  performance in general education, the Coordinating Board for Higher  Education designed a 42-semester-hour block of general education.  Similarly, a Texas statute states that if a student successfully completes a  field-of-study curriculum developed by the state\u2019s board of higher  education, that block of courses may be transferred and must be  substituted for the receiving institution\u2019s lower division requirements for  the comparable degree program, and the student must receive full  academic credit. Likewise a Kentucky statute mandates that all lower  division academic courses offered by community colleges be transferable  for academic credit to any and all 4-year public colleges and universities in  the state.", "Some state higher education agencies make information on transfer  agreements and course equivalency guides available to the public. For  example, some states, such as California, Maryland, and Florida, have  placed course equivalencies online for easy access and reference.  California maintains an online student transfer system called ASSIST that  serves as the official repository of transfer agreements for all public  postsecondary institutions in California and facilitates transfer from a  California community college to a University of California or California  State University campus. Maryland\u2019s interactive online transfer  information source called ARTSYS allows students to find course  equivalencies between institutions, evaluate their transcripts, search for  majors, and explore recommended transfer programs. In addition, it  provides faculty access to update courses and provide course evaluations.  The Florida Academic Counseling and Tracking for Students (FACTS)  system offers a comprehensive range of transfer services, including a  transfer student bill of rights, links to statewide transfer agreements, and  an interactive transfer evaluation tool. A Pennsylvania statute supports  the implementation of a Web-based application that makes all transfer  agreements among higher education institutions available on the Internet.  Similarly, Virginia requires its state council of higher education to  publicize all general education courses offered at public 2-year  institutions, designating the courses accepted for transfer credit at 4-year  public and private postsecondary institutions in Virginia.

These agencies\u2019 accrediting standards  generally require receiving institutions to consider if courses are  equivalent with their own curricula and standards. In 2000, CHEA issued  an updated statement that offered four additional criteria that accrediting  agencies and institutions should consider when making decisions about  transfer of credit and academic quality. Specifically, these criteria  emphasized the need for institutions and accrediting agencies to  (1) ensure that transfer decisions are not solely based on the  source of accreditation of a sending program or institution,  (2) reaffirm that the considerations that inform transfer decisions  are applied consistently in the context of changing student  attendance patterns and emerging new providers of higher  education,  (3) ensure that students and the public are fully and accurately  informed about their respective transfer policies and practices, and  (4) be flexible and open in considering alternative approaches to  managing transfer when these approaches will benefit students.", "The accrediting standards and transfer policies of the 6 regional and 10  national accrediting agencies that we reviewed generally reflect the  original criteria included in the 1978 joint statement.

For example, a 1996 study of Arizona\u2019s public  university transfer practices found that community college transfer  students may be required to take additional courses in order to complete  their degrees because academic departments do not always accept  community college courses as prerequisites. The study found that the  accumulation of excess college credit hours could lead to additional years  in school, added taxpayer expense such as financial aid awards, or a  failure to complete a degree. Officials at selected nationally accredited  institutions also told us that denials based on accreditation can result in  students taking additional coursework in order to graduate. For example,  one nationally accredited institution told us that one of its recent  graduates had been required to repeat 2 years of coursework at a  regionally accredited institution before he could be admitted to a graduate  program.

For example, a student who changes majors may need  to take additional courses in order to graduate. We could not determine  the extent to which transfer students differ from nontransfer students in  these areas. Nonetheless, students taking additional credits as a result of  being unable to transfer credits will likely have to pay additional tuition.  Based on national averages, these tuition payments could range from  about $150 per credit hour for students attending public institutions to  about $520 for those attending private schools.

Also, all  regional accrediting agencies subscribe to the principle that credits should  not be accepted or denied on the basis of the type of accreditation, but not  all of them have set standards requiring their member institutions to do so.  When such standards have been set, it takes accrediting agencies years to  review their member institutions\u2019 policies to confirm their compliance.", "To preserve their institutional reputations and maintain quality,  postsecondary institutions want their graduates to meet certain academic  standards. The federal government sets the same standards for regional  and national accrediting agencies to ensure that postsecondary  institutions provide a quality education. At the same time, it is in the  federal government\u2019s interest to ensure that students receiving assistance  through federal aid programs, who have earned credits at an approved  accredited institution, do not have to repeat coursework when transferring  to another institution meeting the same standards. However, some  institutions continue to deny credits from institutions with national  accreditation without reviewing student coursework despite the fact that  these institutions are accredited by federally recognized national  accrediting bodies. Consequently, qualified students could be denied  credit for comparable coursework, leading them to incur further  educational costs that they may need to offset with additional federal  financial aid."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure consistent consideration of students\u2019 previous  coursework, Congress should consider further amending the Higher  Education Act of 1965 to require postsecondary institutions eligible for  Title IV funding to not deny transfer credits on the basis of the type of  accreditation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.
