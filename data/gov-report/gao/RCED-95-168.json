Negotiations are currently under way to try to secure a new U.S.-EURATOM agreement before the present agreement expires at the end of 1995. According to a State Department official, if a new agreement is not concluded prior to the expiration date, significant nuclear commerce between the two parties must be suspended. According to a Department of Energy (DOE) official, the existing U.S.-EURATOM agreement prohibits the EURATOM countries from using U.S.-origin nuclear materials or equipment for nuclear weapons or for other military purposes, and it requires that EURATOM safeguards or controls be applied to U.S.-origin materials in a EURATOM country. These safeguards are augmented by full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards in the EURATOM states that do not have nuclear weapons. The EURATOM nations are required to obtain U.S. consent before transferring U.S.-origin nuclear materials or equipment to a third party outside of the European Union.

The absence of a U.S.-EURATOM agreement would prohibit Japan from transferring this U.S.-origin spent fuel for reprocessing in any EURATOM country.", "Furthermore, these industry representatives point out that part of nuclear commerce includes relationships with the customers and the guarantee of reliable supply and services to them. A break in any of these ties, such as a failure to renew the U.S.-EURATOM agreement, would weaken the U.S. nuclear industry substantially, because the industry needs both its domestic and foreign markets. U.S. nuclear industry representatives stated that the nuclear industry is a market industry that can exist only in a global environment.", "According to USEC officials, if the U.S.-EURATOM agreement for cooperation expires, USEC\u2019s future enrichment services would be seriously affected. Specifically, existing contracts with EURATOM, worth approximately $160 million, could be terminated. Other contracts, valued at approximately $470 million, would be in jeopardy. Another $1.8 billion in potential new business from EURATOM and Japan might be lost. According to a nuclear industry representative, the U.S. share of the European nuclear industry market currently is about $100 million and may reach $300 million annually after the year 2000. In addition, Japan currently is the largest single foreign purchaser from U.S. suppliers of nuclear power systems equipment, materials, and services. In the next 5 years, according to industry officials, anticipated U.S. participation in construction, equipment, start-up services, spare parts, and fuel for 10 nuclear power plants in Japan is expected to amount to about $500 million to $800 million annually throughout the plants\u2019 lives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["During May 1995, we provided drafts of this report to officials in NRC and the Departments of Commerce, Energy, and State to obtain their comments on the facts presented in this report.

In particular, NRC officials stated that they were puzzled by the reported plutonium sales to some of the listed countries, especially Denmark, Greece, and Portugal. According to the NRC officials, these countries have very small nuclear research programs and no nuclear power programs; thus, they doubt that these countries have in fact imported plutonium from the United States. In addition, NRC stated that NRC\u2019s export licensing data base shows no licenses for exports to Greece or Portugal, one small (0.005 kg) plutonium export case for Denmark, and only three plutonium export cases for Spain. However, NRC noted that U.S.-supplied nuclear materials to any country within EURATOM can be freely transferred within EURATOM without prior notification to, or approval by, the United States. Thus, according to NRC, it is possible, although not considered likely, that U.S.-supplied plutonium has gone to the countries in question and has been reported to the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Trade Data Bank system without appearing in NRC\u2019s export licensing records.
