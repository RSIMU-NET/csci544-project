Total estimated acquisition costs have increased $46 billion and development extended 2 1/2 more years, compared to the approved program baseline approved in 2007. Aircraft unit costs will likely exceed the thresholds established by the statutory provision referred to as Nunn McCurdy and may require DOD to recertify the need for the JSF to Congress. The program is at risk for not delivering aircraft quantities and capabilities on time. Dates for achieving initial operational capabilities may have to be extended or some requirements deferred to future upgrades. DOD leadership is taking some positive steps that should reduce risk and provide more realistic cost and schedule estimates. Officials increased time and funding for system development, added four aircraft to the flight test program, and reduced near-term procurement quantities. If effectively implemented, these actions should improve future program outcomes. Currently, however, manufacturing JSF test aircraft continues to take more time, money, and effort than budgeted, hampering the development flight test program. Slowed by late aircraft deliveries and low productivity, the flight test program only completed 10 percent of the sorties planned during 2009. Although restructuring actions should help, there is still substantial overlap of development, test, and production activities while DOD continues to invest in large quantities of production aircraft before variant designs are proven and performance verified. Under the current plan, DOD may procure as many as 307 aircraft at a total estimated cost of $58.2 billion before development flight testing is completed. Our updated analysis on engine costs shows that, without competition, an estimated $62.5 billion will be needed over the remainder of the F135 primary engine effort to cover costs for completing system development, procuring 2,443 engines, production support, and sustainment. Additional investment of between $4.5 billion to $5.7 billion may be required should the department continue competition. Under certain assumptions, the additional costs of continuing the F136 alternate engine program could be recouped if competition were to generate approximately 10.1 to 12.6 percent savings over the life of the program. Air Force data on the first 4 years of competition for engines on the F-16 aircraft projected they would recoup at least that much. Actual savings will ultimately depend on factors such as the number of aircraft actually purchased, the ratio of engines awarded to each contractor, and when the competition begins.

An independent manufacturing review  team determined that the planned production ramp rate was unachievable  absent significant improvements.

At that time, DOD determined that the risks of a single point  failure in a sole source environment were very low and did not justify the  extra costs to maintain a second source. Each year since then, Congress  has subsequently recommended funding for alternate engine development.  We have previously testified on our assessment that, based on past  defense competitions (including a fighter engine competition started in the  1980s between these same manufacturers) and making certain  assumptions about relative quantities purchased from each, competition  could reasonably be expected to yield enough savings across the JSF life  cycle to offset the remaining investments required to sustain a second  source. Prior studies also indicate a number of nonfinancial benefits from  competition, including better performance, increased reliability, and  improved contractor responsiveness.", "As noted in our prior testimonies, the acquisition strategy for the JSF  engine must weigh expected costs against potential rewards\u2014both  quantifiable and non quantifiable. As a result, we have updated our prior  studies conducted in 2007, and later updated in 2008, to assess whether  changes in the JSF program have impacted the costs and benefits of the  sole-source and competitive scenarios for acquisition and sustainment of  the JSF engine. We updated our analysis to include (1) new estimates for  Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) and additional  sunk costs, (2) a slower production ramp as a result of the recent program  restructure, (3) increased engine unit recurring costs, and (4) updated  production support costs. Based on schedule delays with the program, we  moved the starting point of the procurement competition to fiscal year  2015, a 3-year slip from our past analysis.

As such, we include a net present value  calculation (time value of money) in the analysis that, once applied,  provides for a better estimate of program rate of return. Our analysis  indicates that recoupment of those initial investment costs would occur at  somewhere between 10.1 and 12.6 percent, depending on the number of  engines awarded to each contractor. A competitive scenario, where one  contractor receives 70 percent of the annual procurement and the other  receives 30 percent, reaches the breakeven point at 10.1 percent savings. A  competitive scenario where both contactors receive 50 percent of the  procurement reaches this point at 12.6 percent savings.", "The government\u2019s ability to recoup the additional investments required to  support competition depends largely on (1) the number of aircraft  procured, (2) the ratio that each contractor wins out of that total, and   (3) the savings rate that competitive pressures drive. Another key variable  is when the competition actually begins. In our analysis described above,  we assume competition begins with the fiscal year 2015 buy which would  be after the JSF system development flight test program is currently  scheduled to be completed and would be the last low rate initial  production order. We also ran an alternative scenario where competition  did not begin until 2017, or 2 years later. Such a delay would increase the  level of savings needed to recoup the additional investments. This was  primarily due to the fact that savings from the competition began later in  the life cycle and fewer engines from the total 2,443 procurement would be  available for competition. Assuming competition starts in 2017,  recoupment of the additional investment would occur at 11.3 to 14.1  percent savings depending on whether competitive buys are split either   70/30 or 50/50 between contractors. This range compares to the 10.1 to  12.6 percent range if the competition began in 2015.", "Prior experience suggests it may be reasonable to expect savings of at  least that much from a JSF engine competition. While we did not do an in- depth analysis of the competition, the \u201cGreat Engine War\u201d, may provide a  good example of the potential savings achievable. The competition was  between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric to supply military engines  for the F-16 and other fighter aircraft programs. At that time, all engines  for the F-14 and F-15 aircraft were being produced on a sole-source basis  by Pratt & Whitney, which was criticized for increased procurement and  maintenance costs, along with a general lack of responsiveness to  government concerns about those programs. Beginning in 1983, the Air  Force initiated a competition that resulted in significant cost savings in the  program. For example, in the first 4 years of the competition, when  comparing actual costs to the program\u2019s baseline estimate, results  included    Nearly 30 percent cumulative savings for acquisition costs,    Roughly 16 percent cumulative savings for operations and support costs,    Total savings of about 21 percent in overall life cycle costs.", "It is difficult to estimate the costs that would have been incurred if there  never were a competition. However, prior to the competition, there was an  upward trend in the expected unit costs of the F-16 primary engine.

DOD and others have  performed studies and have widespread concurrence as to these other  benefits, including better engine performance, increased reliability, and  improved contractor responsiveness. In fact, in 1998 and 2002, DOD  program management advisory groups assessed the JSF alternate engine  program and found the potential for significant benefits in these and other  areas. While the benefits highlighted may be more difficult to quantify,  they were strongly considered in earlier recommendations to continue the  alternate engine program.

Though current data  indicate that it is unlikely that engine problems would lead to fleet wide  groundings in modern aircraft, having two engine sources for the single- engine JSF further reduces this risk as it is less likely that such a problem  would occur to both engine types at the same time. Because the JSF is  expected to be the primary fighter aircraft in the U.S. inventory, and Pratt  & Whitney is also the sole-source provider of F119 engines for the F-22A  aircraft, DOD is faced with the potential scenario where most of the fleet  could be dependent on similar engine cores, produced by the same  contractor in a sole-source environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "JSF Engine Costs and Flight Test Progress Have Not Met Expectations", "paragraphs": ["Both the F135 and F136 have experienced cost growth and delays.

This includes  an $800 million contract cost overrun in 2008. Engine development cost  increases primarily resulted from higher costs for labor and materials,  supplier problems, and the rework needed to correct deficiencies with an  engine blade during redesign. Engine redesigns and test problems caused  slips in engine deliveries, according to program officials. Officials note that  these late engine deliveries have not yet critically affected the delivery of  test aircraft because airframe production lagged even further behind.  However, the prime contractor has been forced to perform out-of-station  engine installations and other workarounds as a result of engine issues. As  of January 2010, 17 of 18 F135 development flight test engines have been  delivered, seven of which have flown.

Similarly, the unit cost for  the STOVL engine (including lift fan and related parts) rose from $27.6  million, to $33.4 million, a 21 percent increase. JSF program officials cite  several reasons for the higher than budgeted unit costs, including  configuration changes and quantity reductions.

Through fiscal year 2010, the  government has invested about $2.9 billion in developing the second  engine and DOD cost analysts estimate that about $1.6 billion more would  be needed to complete F136 development in 2016. F136 contractor  officials told us that funding stability, engine affordability, and testing  issues are key concerns for the program to go forward. According to the  F136 contractor, it believes system development could be completed  earlier by 2014, with less funding. While the F136 engine has not yet been  flown, it has experienced delays.

The Department  has recently taken some positive steps that, if effectively implemented,  should improve outcomes and provide more realistic, executable program.  However, the program will still be challenged to meet cost and schedule  targets. To date, the Department does not have a full, comprehensive cost  estimate for completing the program. Credible costs and schedules  estimates are critical because they allow DOD management to make sound  trade-off decisions against competing demands and allow Congress to  perform oversight and hold DOD accountable. Because the JSF is  expected to eventually make up most of the tactical aircraft fleet, the  services should have a high degree of confidence in their ability to meet  their initial operational capability requirements and to acquire JSFs in  quantity so that DOD can plan its overall tactical aircraft force structure  strategy. However, the Department has not yet defined reasonable  expectations for achieving initial operational capabilities for each of the  services given the recent restructuring. While the Department has lowered  cost risk by reducing near term procurement quantities, there is still  substantial overlap of development, test, and production activities now  stretching into 2016.

In our March 2010  JSF report, we recommended that DOD (1) make a new, comprehensive  and independent assessment of the costs and schedule to complete the  program, including military construction, other JSF-related expenses, and  life cycle costs; and (2) reassess warfighter requirements and, if necessary,  defer some capabilities to future increments. The department concurred  with both recommendations. We also included a matter for congressional  consideration regarding development of a system maturity matrix as a tool  for measuring progress and evaluating annual budget requests.", "A decision whether to continue the alternate engine program will likely  have long term implications for the JSF program, industrial base, and fleet  readiness. Expected costs must be weighed against potential benefits,  both quantifiable and unquantifiable. Last year, Congress enacted  legislation to help improve weapons acquisition outcomes. The legislation,  referred to as the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009,  included a provision requiring DOD to ensure that the acquisition strategy  for each major defense acquisition program includes measures to ensure  competition, or the option of competition, throughout the life of the  program. The long-term impact on the industrial base is likely to be high  given the size of the JSF program, international participation, and the  expected supplier base. Depending on the assumptions made, a  competitive environment could yield enough financial savings over the life  of the program to offset the immediate cost of investing in competition.  Specifically, key assumptions include the number of aircraft purchased,  the ratio of engines each contractor wins, and savings competitive  pressures drive. The timing of when a competition occurs will also have a  direct bearing on the amount of savings that is needed to recoup the  additional costs of competition. Competition could also provide many  intangible benefits that do not result in immediate financial savings but  could result in reduced costs or other positive outcomes over time.
