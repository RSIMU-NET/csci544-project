Most respondents agreed that enthusiasm for CFPB's mission is high and that immediate supervisors respect and value differences among individuals. However, GAO's survey found heightened concerns related to fair treatment, trust that employees can raise concerns without fear of reprisal, confidence in complaint processes, and other matters. For survey items on these issues, more than 25 percent of respondents bureau-wide had unfavorable views, and dissatisfaction was above 35 percent in some CFPB offices and demographic groups. For example, about one-third of respondents disagreed with the statement that success at CFPB is based more on merit than on personal connections or favoritism. Disagreement was 40 percent or more for a few offices that focus on examining institutions and among black respondents.", "As part of ongoing improvement efforts and in response to challenges it identified in late 2013 and early 2014, CFPB has worked to strengthen personnel management practices and enhance its diversity and inclusion efforts. In part to address weaknesses in personnel practices that may have contributed to perceptions of unfair treatment, CFPB has expanded management training, developed new guidance on personnel practices, and developed a new performance management system. CFPB has made progress in adopting leading diversity management practices identified in prior GAO work, such as finalizing a diversity strategic plan, creating employee diversity groups, and expanding diversity training. In addition, CFPB launched a new initiative to strengthen its organizational culture that includes obtaining employee input on ideas for improving CFPB's culture and addressing employee concerns. Finally, CFPB has strengthened its employee complaint processes by providing new training and guidance and creating feedback mechanisms to help evaluate progress in some areas.", "CFPB has taken steps to measure and communicate progress on these efforts, such as through its process for analyzing feedback from employee surveys.

The act consolidated many of  the consumer financial protection authorities previously shared by seven  federal agencies into one. It also provided CFPB additional authorities  related to supervising and enforcing federal consumer financial laws;  handling consumer complaints; promoting financial education; and  monitoring financial markets for risks to consumers. CFPB began  operations on July 21, 2011, and its first director was appointed on  January 4, 2012, and confirmed by the United States Senate on July 16,  2013.", "In December 2013, CFPB identified disparities in employees\u2019  performance ratings for fiscal year 2013 by race, age, and office location.  In January 2014, CFPB management shared these findings with the  CFPB employee union, and in March and May 2014, it shared reports  summarizing ratings distributions and plans to address disparities with all  employees. In March 2014, a press article reported on these ratings  disparities and other alleged personnel matters. The House Financial  Services Committee began an investigation into these matters and from  April 2014 through June 2015 its Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations held a series of hearings that included testimony by five  CFPB employees about allegations of discrimination and retaliation.  Seven other CFPB employees provided the committee with anonymous  written statements about their allegations of unfair treatment by CFPB  managers. On the basis of personal accounts these and other CFPB  employees shared with Congress, members of Congress raised  questions about the level of trust between CFPB\u2019s management and  employees and the health of CFPB\u2019s organizational culture.", "You asked us to review personnel management and the organizational  culture at CFPB. In this report, we examine (1) CFPB\u2019s early efforts as a  new agency to establish personnel practices and organizational culture  and challenges it encountered in promoting a diverse, inclusive, and fair  workplace; (2) employees\u2019 views on personnel management and  organizational culture at CFPB; and (3) CFPB\u2019s efforts to strengthen its  personnel management practices and organizational culture.", "To describe CFPB\u2019s early efforts as a new agency to establish personnel  practices and an organizational culture, we reviewed CFPB reports and  documents, and testimony and public statements by CFPB officials. We  obtained and analyzed CFPB workforce data for fiscal years 2011 to 2015  to describe the growth in CFPB\u2019s workforce. We also reviewed data and  documentation related to CFPB\u2019s initial efforts to identify and address  specific personnel challenges. For example, we reviewed a 2013 report  by a management consulting firm on CFPB\u2019s diversity and inclusion  efforts and CFPB\u2019s internal analysis of disparities in performance ratings  by race and other factors. In addition, to describe trends in the number  and basis of employee complaints, we obtained and analyzed CFPB data  for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 on Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)  complaints and grievances. To describe employee perspectives on  challenges CFPB faced as a new agency, we reviewed the report by  CFPB\u2019s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) on listening  sessions it held with employees from April through June 2014. We also  interviewed current and former CFPB officials who were employed at  CFPB in its first 2 years.", "We obtained CFPB employees\u2019 views on personnel management and  organizational culture through interviews with current and former  employees and two web-based surveys. To identify key issues and  concerns related to CFPB\u2019s personnel management practices and  organizational culture and to inform survey development, we provided  opportunities for all CFPB employees to meet or communicate with us  individually in a confidential manner. We set up a GAO toll-free phone  number and e-mail address for CFPB employees to use to arrange a  meeting with our team or provide information. From August 2014 through  May 2015, we held one-on-one interviews with 120 nonsupervisory and  supervisory staff. We implemented two web-based surveys of all 1,389  nonexecutive employees and 57 executive employees as of January 31,  2015. The survey response rates were 62 percent and 63 percent,  respectively. For the nonexecutive survey, we carried out a statistical  nonresponse bias analysis using available administrative data and  determined that we could not assume the nonrespondents were missing  at random. We found that the propensity to respond was statistically  correlated with employee age and the CFPB division an employee  worked in. Furthermore, we observed that responses to questions on the  survey also correlated with employee age. For this reason, the results of  the staff survey are presented as tabulations from a census survey. We  do not make any attempt to extrapolate the findings to the 38 percent of  eligible staff who chose not to complete our survey. Survey results that  this report presents for CFPB employees who responded must not be  taken to be representative of the proportion of the total CFPB population  (or the total population of an office or demographic group) who would  have agreed or disagreed with a survey question. For more information  about the methodology for our surveys, see appendix I. We reviewed  CFPB\u2019s annual employee survey results for fiscal years 2013, 2014, and  2015 to obtain additional perspectives from CFPB staff on the bureau\u2019s  personnel management-related issues. In addition, we reviewed  documents and data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to provide information  about the views of federal government employees on these issues.

We used criteria from  applicable federal regulations, leading practices for diversity and  managing organizational change identified in prior GAO reports, and GAO  standards for internal control. To assess CFPB\u2019s efforts to improve  diversity and inclusion throughout the bureau, we reviewed the results of  external reviews of CFPB\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts conducted by  the Office of the Inspector General of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System and CFPB (Inspector General) and a  management consulting firm. We reviewed CFPB documentation and  interviewed CFPB officials about efforts to strengthen personnel  management and organizational culture, including the status of CFPB\u2019s  implementation of recommendations made by its OMWI and the Inspector  General. To assess CFPB\u2019s efforts to strengthen its processes for  addressing employee complaints, we reviewed policies, procedures, and  guidance related to EEO complaints and grievances. We also interviewed  CFPB officials from the offices responsible for these complaint processes.  For the parts of our work that involved the analysis of computer- processed data, we assessed the reliability of these data and found that  they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Data sets for which we  conducted data reliability assessments include CFPB data on its  workforce demographics and CFPB data on employee complaints. To  assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant documentation  and conducted interviews with CFPB staff to review steps they took to  collect and ensure the reliability of the data.

CFPB employees who were at the  bureau in its first 2 years reported that they felt a strong desire to quickly  and effectively put in place new protections for consumers. CFPB  assumed some existing functions from other government agencies and  began developing new examination, enforcement, and consumer  education capabilities. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act charged CFPB  with examining both large depository institutions and credit unions\u2014which  had previously been subject to federal oversight\u2014and certain  nondepository providers of financial products\u2014which had not\u2014to ensure  that all of these entities comply with federal consumer financial laws. In  addition, the Dodd-Frank Act set forth a number of statutory deadlines for  CFPB related to required rulemakings and reports to Congress.

For example, as CFPB  grew its workforce rapidly (see fig. 5), it had to integrate new employees  coming from very different professional backgrounds. According to data  from a December 2012 CFPB report on its progress in building its human  capital about 60 percent of CFPB\u2019s total workforce after its first year of  operating consisted of employees from other federal government  agencies and about 39 percent of its employees came from the private  sector, nonprofit sector, or other nongovernment employment. A July  2011 CFPB report identified the need for CFPB to integrate employees  coming from many different agencies and other backgrounds into a team  with a cohesive organizational culture and noted that this had been a  point of failure in other mergers of federal agencies. In addition, CFPB  had to develop and strengthen personnel management practices, while  trying to meet mission-related goals and deadlines. CFPB began setting  up its key operational infrastructure, before it formally began operations in  July 2011, and it continued to develop some policies and personnel  management functions after it began operating. In its first few years,  CFPB continued to work towards developing more robust processes for  workforce planning, recruiting, and hiring and to expand and strengthen  its personnel management practices in other areas, such as training and  employee development. CFPB faced competing priorities related to  meeting challenging statutory deadlines and devoting time and resources  to building its organizational culture and providing staff development for  its growing employee population. During this period, CFPB also leveraged  existing operational infrastructure at Treasury to support some personnel  management functions. For example, in fiscal years 2011 and 2012,  CFPB contracted with Treasury to provide EEO complaint processing  services.", "In addition, CFPB took steps from its inception to promote a diverse and  inclusive workforce, but it did not implement important elements of its  current diversity efforts until 2015. CFPB established its OMWI in January  2012, and appointed its first OMWI director on April 30, 2012. In OMWI\u2019s  first year, its efforts included working with the Office of Human Capital to  support diversity in recruiting and hiring and analyzing employee survey  results to identify opportunities to maintain and grow an inclusive  workforce. An Inspector General analysis found that at the end of CFPB\u2019s  first few fiscal years (2011, 2012, and 2013), CFPB\u2019s workforce was more  diverse than a benchmark of external labor market diversity, but the level  of diversity by race and ethnicity was lower at the senior management  level (pay grades 80 and above) compared to lower pay grades during  this period. In 2013, CFPB provided interactive diversity awareness  training to employees, opened its in-house EEO office, and introduced  guidance for managers on using structured interviews to avoid bias in  hiring. As discussed later in this report, however, CFPB did not implement  additional important elements of its current diversity efforts, such as  mandatory diversity training and the creation of employee diversity  groups, until 2015.", "In 2013 and 2014, CFPB identified areas for improvement in its diversity  and inclusion efforts and concerns about disparate outcomes in its  performance management system. In spring 2013, CFPB\u2019s OWMI  contracted with a private consulting firm to conduct an initial baseline  assessment of the state of diversity and inclusion at the bureau in order to  inform its strategic planning process. In fall 2013, the firm reported its  findings that the bureau\u2019s overall workforce was diverse and it  recommended a number of steps the bureau could take to enhance  diversity and inclusion. Among other findings, the consulting firm\u2019s review  identified disparities in employee performance ratings for fiscal year 2012  by race and gender. For example, the firm\u2019s report found that black  employees were more likely than white employees to receive a rating of 3  out of 5, and that white employees were more likely to receive higher  ratings of a 4 or 5 on this rating scale. It also found that female  employees received higher ratings than men. In December 2013, CFPB  completed its own analyses of employee performance ratings for fiscal  year 2013 and also identified disparities by race, age, and location  (between employees located in the field and those located in CFPB\u2019s  headquarters), among other factors, and it did not identify disparities by  gender. CFPB shared the results of these analyses with CFPB\u2019s  employee union in January 2014.", "From November 2013 through early 2014, CFPB also experienced a high  volume of grievance filings and an increase in EEO complaint activity.", "With respect to grievances, in June 2013 CFPB and its employee union  reached an interim agreement to establish a negotiated grievance  process. Under this process, a CFPB employee or union representative  could first file an informal grievance to management and CFPB\u2019s Office of  Human Capital. If the matter was not resolved informally, the employee  could then submit a formal grievance (or a \u201cstep one\u201d grievance to begin  the formal grievance process). By September 30, 2013, CFPB employees  had filed 24 informal grievances under this process. In fiscal year 2014,  CFPB employees filed a total of 125 informal grievances. Quarterly filings  of informal grievances peaked at 80 in the 3 months ended December 31,  2013 (the first quarter of fiscal year 2014). The number of formal  grievance filings also peaked in this quarter at 35. According to CFPB  data, the majority of grievances filed in the period from late 2013 through  mid-2014 were related to dissatisfaction with performance ratings or  written feedback given to employees in October 2013 for fiscal year 2013.  With respect to EEO complaint activity, in the 3 months ended December  31, 2013, the number of CFPB employees contacting its EEO office to  pursue the informal EEO complaint process increased to 15 from 6 the  previous quarter. The number of formal EEO complaints filed increased  from 9 in fiscal year 2013 to 25 in fiscal year 2014.", "In April 2014, following a congressional hearing on allegations of  discrimination and retaliation within CFPB, CFPB\u2019s director e-mailed all  CFPB employees to emphasize his commitment to diversity and inclusion  and to inform them that he had asked the OMWI to lead a series of  listening sessions to seek employees\u2019 views on issues of diversity and  inclusion at CFPB. OMWI invited all CFPB employees to participate in the  listening sessions and provided ways for employees to provide input  confidentially. OMWI conducted 48 listening sessions with more than  300 employees between April and June 2014 and issued a report with its  findings and recommendations in August 2014. The report identified  participant concerns and made recommendations in three areas: (1)  perceptions of unfair treatment in personnel practices and concerns about  diversity and inclusion; (2) complaints about lack of experience and  accountability for managers; and (3) confusion around personnel  processes and structures in the bureau\u2019s hiring, pay-setting, and other  areas. According to CFPB officials, CFPB shared this report with all  employees. In addition to the OMWI-led listening sessions, CFPB took  other immediate steps to address concerns related to diversity, inclusion,  and fairness. For example, in January 2014, CFPB management reached  agreement with the employee union to develop a new performance  management system. In May 2014, CFPB and its employee union agreed  to temporarily replace the old system with a two-tier (or \u201cpass-fail\u201d) rating  system. Also in May 2014, CFPB announced that it would retroactively  compensate all employees (except for senior leaders) who had received  an average performance rating of at least \u201c3\u201d as if they had received the  highest rating of \u201c5\u201d for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. In August 2014,  according to CFPB officials, CFPB\u2019s director approved the expenditure of  funds for these adjustments, and CFPB made remediation payments  exceeding $4 million in the fall of 2014.", "In response to a March 2014 congressional request, the Office of the  Inspector General of the Federal Reserve and CFPB began a review of  diversity and inclusion issues at CFPB. The scope of this review  covered CFPB\u2019s recruiting and hiring practices, performance  management, succession planning, tracking of employee complaints, and  the efforts of the OMWI office. In March 2015, the Inspector General  issued its report, which included recommendations to further strengthen  its diversity and inclusion efforts. Among other recommendations, the  Inspector General recommended making diversity and inclusion training  mandatory, finalizing and implementing a diversity and inclusion strategic  plan, and implementing a formal succession planning process to help  ensure that CFPB has a sufficient and diverse pool of candidates for its  senior management positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employees Reported Positive Aspects about CFPB but Also Concerns about Personnel Management, Fairness, and Trust", "paragraphs": ["CFPB employees who responded to our survey for nonexecutive  employees identified strengths and areas for improvement related to  personnel management and organizational culture at CFPB.

In April 2014, both offices published a document that  formalized a diversity recruiting strategy that had been in place since  fiscal year 2013, according to CFPB officials. CFPB also developed a  recruitment and outreach plan to inform managers of their strategies  to use career expos, student symposiums, and partnerships with local  and national diversity organizations to attract diverse job applicants in  June 2015.

According to its charter, this council is also to serve as a means  through which employees can voice concerns about diversity and  inclusion to management, help in communicating initiatives to other  employees, and measure the results of initiatives. Members of the  council plan to meet with the director twice a year and with the  Executive Advisory Council quarterly. In addition, CFPB officials  reported that they have drafted a policy and guidance for employees  to establish employee resource/affinity groups. In the summer of  2015, OMWI also announced the start of a pilot mentoring program,  focused on employees in two divisions and mentors throughout CFPB  management, and with a stated purpose to help CFPB build a more  diverse, experienced, and inclusive workforce. According to CFPB  officials, CFPB conducted the pilot mentoring program in fall 2015 and  obtained feedback from participants. Based on the feedback received  from mentors and mentees who participated, CFPB plans to make  improvements to the program.", "Training. In accordance with the leading diversity management  practice, CFPB has expanded its offerings of diversity and inclusion  training\u2014and made certain trainings mandatory\u2014to help its  management and staff increase their awareness and understanding of  diversity and inclusion. In 2013, CFPB contracted with a diversity  expert to provide training designed to examine issues of diversity and  inclusion and how they affect people in the workplace for employees  at all levels.  In February 2015, CFPB made this training mandatory.  In 2014, CFPB began offering a 2-day leading diversity and inclusion  workshop specifically for managers and supervisors developed by an  external consultant. This training, developed to address ways to give  appropriate consideration of staff differences in managerial or  supervisory decisions and actions, was made mandatory in July 2015.  In June 2014, CFPB also began requiring managers to take a 2-day  course led by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  Training Institute on equal employment opportunity laws and  managerial responsibilities. CFPB officials said that training on EEO  principles and unconscious bias has been provided to hiring  managers and has helped to reinforce earlier efforts to promote  greater fairness in hiring, such as providing guidance to managers on  using the same set of structured interview questions for all job  candidates.", "Measurement. CFPB has adopted several practices that are  consistent with leading diversity management practices for  measurement. It is a leading practice for organizations to collect  quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effectiveness of their  diversity management efforts. In addition, CFPB\u2019s diversity and  inclusion strategic plan cites the need for performance measures and  for CFPB to communicate its progress and effectiveness on its  diversity and inclusion initiatives. CFPB has developed some agency- wide metrics, division-specific goals, and processes related to  diversity and inclusion. These metrics include the following: Inclusion indices based on the annual employee feedback results.  In 2013, OMWI added an OPM-developed measure\u2014the  Inclusion Quotient\u2014to its analysis of CFPB\u2019s annual employee  survey results to facilitate measurement of CFPB employees\u2019  views on inclusiveness at CFPB. OMWI has begun analyzing  employee responses to these questions in terms of five  categories: fair, open, cooperative, supportive, and empowered.  Using the annual employee survey data results, CFPB has  compared its overall inclusiveness scores to those of other  government agencies, and has started comparing the five scores  across different divisions.", "Division-level diversity and inclusion goals and objectives. CFPB\u2019s  OMWI director reported that OMWI staff have met with division  leaders and provided them suggestions for diversity and inclusion  goals for each division. OMWI also has developed demographic  data on race and gender (including by pay grade) for each division  at CFPB, and these data are incorporated into the division\u2019s  quarterly performance review with senior management. Starting in  fiscal year 2015, CFPB has used its quarterly performance review  meetings to hold discussions among senior leaders about  progress toward achieving division-specific diversity and inclusion  goals. According to CFPB officials, at these quarterly  performance reviews\u2014which include the director of the Office of  Equal Opportunity and Fairness, the Deputy Director, Chief of  Staff, and Chief Strategy Officer\u2014the CFPB Director asks division  leaders questions regarding their diversity and inclusion goals and  about divisional efforts to promote diversity and enhance the  employee experience. They also reported that certain divisions  have specific annual employee survey indices in their division  strategic plans and quarterly performance review metrics.", "Succession Planning. CFPB has taken steps to develop a formal  succession planning process for identifying and developing a diverse  pool of talent for its future. Succession planning is a comprehensive,  ongoing strategic process that provides for forecasting an  organization\u2019s senior leadership needs; identifying and developing  candidates who have the potential to be future leaders; and selecting  individuals from among a diverse pool of qualified candidates to meet  executive resource needs. Succession planning is a leading practice  that allows federal agencies the opportunity to change the diversity of  the executive corps through new appointments. In its March 2015  report, the Inspector General recommended that CFPB develop and  finalize a formal succession planning process and noted that without  such a process, CFPB may not be able to ensure that it will have a  sufficient number of qualified executives or will be able to retain high- performing staff in mission-critical positions. Furthermore, the  Inspector General noted that a succession planning process could  help to ensure diversity in CFPB\u2019s senior management.", "In response to the Inspector General\u2019s recommendation, a CFPB  official noted that CFPB has used a succession management guide it  issued in October 2014 to help shape the design of its succession  planning process. Although this guide outlines a process by which  CFPB leaders are to review senior workforce needs, it is not a formal  plan that identifies those needs and the strategies CFPB plans to use  to achieve its leadership goals. After publishing the guide, CFPB  developed a list of key leadership and technical positions that are  most critical to CFPB\u2019s ongoing success, one of the first steps in the  guide.  In addition to this guide, CFPB officials noted that CFPB has  taken other steps toward developing a formal succession planning  process.  For example, according to CFPB officials, in February 2016,  CFPB developed a 3-year approach (fiscal years 2016 through 2018)  to formalizing its succession management and strategic workforce  planning programs.", "Management Accountability. Our work on leading practices has also  pointed to the importance of having means to hold managers  responsible for diversity by linking their performance assessment to  diversity and inclusion goals. While CFPB has taken some steps to  promote diversity and inclusion within its performance management  system, its current system provides limited means to hold managers  accountable for promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace. CFPB  currently has a temporary pass/fail performance management rating  system, which applies to managers as well as employees. In March  2015, the Inspector General found that CFPB\u2019s performance  management competencies at that time for supervisors and managers  did not adequately measure diversity and inclusion efforts.  Specifically, the Inspector General found that the performance  management competencies in place for senior managers did not  sufficiently connect the managers\u2019 performance assessments with  progress towards CFPB\u2019s diversity and inclusion initiatives. The  Inspector General noted that, as a result, CFPB could miss  opportunities to ensure that supervisors and managers are held  accountable for helping CFPB achieve its diversity and inclusion  initiatives. The Inspector General recommended that CFPB create  specific supervisor and manager performance competencies related  to diversity and inclusion.", "In September 2015, the Inspector General closed this  recommendation based on CFPB\u2019s efforts to enhance individual  manager accountability through the performance management system  in place for fiscal year 2016. In closing this recommendation, the  Inspector General noted that CFPB\u2019s fiscal year 2016 performance  competencies for supervisors and senior managers included  measures related to promoting diversity and inclusion. In developing a  new performance management system, CFPB has incorporated  standards specifically related to diversity and inclusion into their  performance competencies for managers and, as discussed earlier,  these standards will be in effect beginning in fiscal year 2017. CFPB  officials also told us that the quarterly performance reviews (described  previously) are another tool CFPB leadership uses to hold leaders  accountable for making change. In addition, CFPB can use its  disciplinary policy to hold employees accountable for misconduct,  such as engaging in discrimination or harassment.", "In addition, in January 2015, CFPB launched an initiative called  Workforce of the Future to build a stronger organizational culture. This  initiative is intended to define and shape organizational norms, such as  positive employee behaviors, and effective management practices,  including promoting diversity and inclusion throughout the bureau. This  initiative has been aimed at making people\u2014not just the mission\u2014a  priority at CFPB and establishing bureau-wide norms to improve  employees\u2019 experiences. According to CFPB officials, steps taken to  achieve the objectives of the Workforce of the Future initiative include, but  are not limited to, developing and communicating norms to guide  communications between individual employees; conducting a survey to  assess progress made in creating awareness of the norms and modeling  the norms; and holding outreach sessions with employees from across  CFPB to obtain their input on ideas for improving CFPB\u2019s culture and  addressing employee concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Does Not Comprehensively Report on Progress Related to Its Diversity, Inclusion, Fairness, and Culture Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["CFPB\u2019s efforts to address employee concerns about diversity, inclusion,  fairness, and culture together represent a significant change management  initiative. As we have previously reported, significant change  management initiatives can take years to complete and therefore must be  carefully and closely managed and monitored to achieve success.  Specifically, our research on significant change initiatives found that it is  essential to establish and track implementation goals and establish a  timeline to pinpoint performance shortfalls and gaps and suggest  midcourse corrections. Furthermore, providing transparency around  results and processes used to achieve results can help an organization to  build the employee enthusiasm and momentum needed to help ensure  that change management initiatives are successful.", "CFPB has developed implementation goals and timeframes for some of  its initiatives and mechanisms to measure and communicate progress.  However, it does not have a comprehensive reporting mechanism to  communicate its implementation goals and progress across its full range  of initiatives, including those intended to strengthen personnel practices,  diversity and inclusion initiatives, and its organizational culture. CFPB  officials noted that the bureau has not explored options to report on its  progress across these areas in a more comprehensive and integrated  manner and that doing so would require attention to how to leverage  existing mechanisms without creating undue burdens. As discussed,  CFPB has developed some measures related to diversity and inclusion.  CFPB officials told us they also plan to collect and respond to employee  feedback by using CFPB\u2019s existing process for evaluating employee  survey results and through its Workforce of the Future initiative. A  comprehensive reporting mechanism for showing progress would allow  CFPB to (1) better track new and ongoing employee concerns and  organizational plans to address them and (2) report on implementation  goals and progress across its various initiatives and any outcomes to all  employees. A comprehensive approach to reporting on progress across  the various initiatives could help to make employees more aware of the  status and timeframes for the full range of its initiatives, how these  initiatives relate to intended results, and how CFPB is using measures  and employee feedback mechanisms to assess its progress. CFPB\u2019s  actions and initiatives on diversity, inclusion, and fairness have been  wide-ranging. They have included new policies, guidance, and training;  efforts to enhance communication about personnel practices; several  enhancements to diversity and inclusion efforts; and the new Workforce  of the Future initiative to strengthen the organizational culture, among  others. However, without a strategy for comprehensively reporting on its  progress across these initiatives, CFPB may miss opportunities to provide  greater transparency and build the employee commitment needed to  sustain progress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Has Strengthened Its Complaints Processes, but Feedback Mechanisms Do Not Fully Address Employees\u2019 Concerns", "paragraphs": ["CFPB has taken steps to improve its management of employee complaint  processes, such as offering new training to managers and addressing  problems with its tracking of complaints, However, our survey indicated  that as of spring 2015, over half of the respondents who reported  experience with at least one of CFPB\u2019s complaint processes had  concerns that could affect employees\u2019 confidence in using the processes.", "CFPB has three employee complaint processes that provide employees  the opportunity to have their complaints heard and investigated:", "EEO complaints. If a current employee, former employee, or  applicant believes that he or she has been discriminated or retaliated  against on the basis of a protected class or for prior EEO activity, he  or she may file an EEO complaint with the Office of Civil Rights.", "Negotiated grievances. CFPB employees covered by the employee  union\u2019s bargaining unit may file a grievance under CFPB\u2019s negotiated  grievance process, as described in the collective bargaining  agreement. The Office of Human Capital is responsible for managing  this process.", "Administrative grievances. CFPB employees who are outside of the  bargaining unit may file an administrative grievance under CFPB\u2019s  Open Door and Administrative Grievance Policy. Employees can  initiate this process through the Office of Human Capital.", "As discussed earlier, CFPB experienced increases in the filings of EEO  complaints and grievances at a time when its processes for managing  these complaints were relatively new. More recently, in fiscal year 2015,  the total number of formal grievances filed fell to 31 (from 68 in fiscal year  2014) and the total number of formal EEO complaints fell slightly to 22  (from 25 in fiscal year 2014). The total number of informal EEO  complaints (which are prerequisites for formal EEO complaints) declined  from 52 in fiscal year 2014 to 29 for fiscal year 2015, reflecting a 44  percent decrease. CFPB officials told us that one reason grievances  declined is because of a reduction in complaints about ratings because  CFPB has been using a pass-fail system.", "In 2014 and 2015, CFPB took steps to strengthen its management of  employee complaints. In 2014, the Office of Civil Rights developed a  more complete operations manual that provides more detailed guidance  to staff to help better ensure that staff process EEO complaints in  compliance with federal EEO laws, regulations, and CFPB policies. The  April 2015 version of the manual is a working draft that CFPB continues  to update, and officials told us they secured contractor support in fiscal  year 2015 to assist in writing standard operating procedures to  supplement the operations manual and further enhance uniformity and  efficiency. CFPB officials also told us that they have added staff to the  Office of Civil Rights, including an attorney with EEOC appellate  experience and a new administrative position (shared with OMWI) and  have authorized positions for a dispute prevention/resolution expert and a  data analyst shared with OMWI. The Office of Civil Rights also has  obtained detailee support from EEOC\u2019s Office of Federal Operation in  2015 and 2016. In September 2015, the Office of Civil Rights requested  and worked with an organizational consultant available to all CFPB offices  to work with staff members to identify opportunities for improvement in  office operations. The Office of Civil Rights and Office of Human Capital  have also taken steps to improve tracking of EEO complaints and  grievances in response to Inspector General recommendations from a  2015 report. CFPB implemented new standard operating procedures for  reconciling the EEO complaints and grievances data. They also said they  have recently awarded a contract to implement a commercial software  tracking and reporting system that is expected to enhance data quality  and reporting.", "CFPB has taken steps to encourage informal solutions through greater  use of alternative dispute resolution\u2014an alternative approach to filing a  formal grievance or complaint, such as using mediation to resolve a  dispute or employee complaint. As noted in CFPB\u2019s policy, alternative  dispute resolution can provide faster and less contentious results in  workplace disputes, including claims of discrimination and retaliation. In  addition, according to CFPB\u2019s policy, confidentiality in alternative dispute  resolution proceedings must be maintained by the parties, subject to the  limited exceptions imposed by statute or regulation. CFPB policy states  that alternative dispute resolution can only be used if an employee with a  complaint agrees to it. CFPB makes alternative dispute resolution  available through its EEO program as well as through its negotiated and  administrative grievance policies, and on an ad hoc basis to address any  workplace dispute. CFPB has publicized information about alternative  dispute resolution, such as through its wiki on the bureau\u2019s intranet and  newsletters sent to managers and employees. In addition, in 2015, the  Office of Civil Rights created an in-house training module on Alternative  Dispute Resolution to supplement the EEO training managers and  supervisors receive and to provide to nonsupervisory employees.", "While CFPB has made progress in strengthening its management of  complaint processes, employee views collected through our survey and  interviews suggest that many employees with experience with CFPB\u2019s  complaint processes lack confidence and trust in CFPB\u2019s management of  these processes. EEOC officials told us that it is critical that employees  have confidence in the complaint process and agencies should try to  address perceptions, such as beliefs that their complaints will not be  treated appropriately or fairly, which could discourage employees from  using the EEO process. As discussed previously, 33 of the 46 employees  (72 percent) who reported experience with the EEO complaint process  and 55 of 77 employees (71 percent) who reported experience with the  grievance process disagreed that CFPB management made a good faith  effort to resolve complaints informally. As discussed previously, CFPB  has taken steps to encourage and support informal resolution. CFPB  officials also told us that in some cases the remedy the employee is  seeking may require a formal process. For example, if the employee  requests a rating change within 60 days of receiving the rating, the  request may be resolved informally, but if the issue is raised after this  period, the agency may only revise the rating as the result of a complaint  or other formal proceeding that results in a determination or settlement  that the rating must be changed.", "Our survey results also suggested that some employees do not trust the  EEO complaint process or grievance process to respect the confidentiality  of their complaint. For example, of the employees who reported  experience with the EEO complaint process, over half (26 of 47)  responded that they did not have confidence that managers and others  with a need to know about specific complaints did not inappropriately  share information with others without a need to know, and 34 of 78  employees had a similar view of the grievance process. Some employees  (16 of 47) also lacked confidence that CFPB\u2019s Office of Civil Rights  maintained confidentiality of their EEO complaint. CFPB officials  acknowledged that respecting confidentiality is key to maintaining  employees\u2019 trust in these processes, and CFPB\u2019s EEO guidance to  supervisors and managers emphasizes the importance of confidentiality.  CFPB officials told us they were aware of a few instances where  information was inadvertently shared beyond a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis and  that those staff had been counseled on the importance of protecting the  privacy of employees using the EEO process. In October 2015, the Office  of Civil Rights also invited CFPB privacy experts to a staff meeting to  conduct training that emphasized the importance of protecting personally  identifiable information.", "In addition, 23 of the 45 survey respondents who reported experience  with the EEO complaint process disagreed that CFPB\u2019s Office of Civil  Rights is a neutral party in the complaint process and is independent of  CFPB\u2019s Legal division and others in CFPB who may have conflicting or  competing interests. For example, one employee thought that CFPB\u2019s  Legal division, which represents CFPB in EEO complaints, advises the  Office of Civil Rights. CFPB officials told us the Office of Civil Rights  operates independently from the Legal division and has its own legal staff  to conduct legal reviews and research following EEOC guidance for  federal agencies, including, for example, accepting and dismissing formal  complaints for investigation, defining legal claims, and issuing final  agency decisions related to whether or not illegal conduct occurred. The  Office of Civil Rights developed frequently asked questions and added  information to its training modules to explain the office\u2019s neutral role and  its independence from the Legal division and the Office of Human Capital.  The updated training module was included in all new employee  orientation sessions in March 2016.", "CFPB\u2019s policies state that the Office of Civil Rights is responsible for  assessing the EEO program and monitoring trends and the Office of  Human Capital is responsible for monitoring the grievances processes.  The Office of Civil Rights has taken some steps to assess employees\u2019  experiences with the process through feedback surveys. Initially, it  developed a short feedback survey for employees who had attended EEO  training or gone through mediation as part of an alternative dispute  resolution process, but officials told us that most employees declined to  complete the feedback surveys. The Office of Civil Rights has drafted a  new survey specifically soliciting feedback about all stages of the EEO  process, including the counseling and investigation stages in addition to  the use of alternative dispute resolution, and has improved the design of  the survey instrument to include a five-level rating scale instead of yes/no  questions. The draft survey includes questions about (1) whether the  parties involved in alternative dispute resolution acted in good faith, (2)  confidence that confidentiality was maintained during the informal  process, (3) fairness of the counseling and investigative processes, and  (4) the fairness and impartiality of EEO counselors and investigators.  CFPB officials told us they plan to roll out the surveys uniformly in  calendar year 2016. They also noted that the Office of Civil Rights has an  open door policy and receives feedback from participants in the EEO  process through informal mechanisms such as e-mails, phone calls, and  office visits. EEOC officials told us that conducting surveys to obtain  feedback and perceptions about the complaint process is a good practice.", "The new survey has the potential to provide valuable information that  CFPB can use to improve its EEO complaints process, but it will not  capture the views of employees who used either of the two grievance  processes. CFPB\u2019s Office of Human Capital\u2019s monitoring and evaluation  efforts have not incorporated mechanisms to solicit employee feedback  on experience with the negotiated and administrative grievance  processes. Furthermore, although CFPB includes questions in its annual  employee viewpoint survey about tolerance for prohibited personnel  practices and respect for differences among individuals, this mechanism  is not sufficient for assessing whether employees perceive that they can  use the complaint processes without fear of reprisal. Without a broader  assessment of factors that may be contributing to negative perceptions  and experiences with its complaint processes, CFPB may not succeed in  meeting its goal to be supportive of employees\u2019 use of these processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since early 2014, when CFPB shared information with employees about  racial disparities in performance ratings, CFPB has undertaken numerous  efforts to improve personnel management and promote a more diverse,  inclusive, and fair workplace. Many of CFPB\u2019s initiatives have been  implemented only recently, and because changing employee perceptions  and behaviors can take time, it is too soon to know the effectiveness of  CFPB\u2019s efforts in these areas. For example, our spring 2015 survey  results indicate that employees in some parts of the bureau and in some  demographic groups continued to have heightened concerns about unfair  treatment, retaliation for raising issues, accountability, and other matters.", "Negative perceptions about fairness, trust, and accountability can take  years to address, and it will be important for CFPB to provide ongoing  attention to the effectiveness of its efforts to address these perceptions  and related personnel challenges. While CFPB has developed  mechanisms to measure and communicate progress on its diversity,  inclusion, and culture initiatives, it does not comprehensively report on its  implementation goals and progress across the full range of these  initiatives. As we have previously reported, providing transparency around  results and processes used to achieve results can help an organization to  build and sustain the commitment and momentum needed to ensure that  change initiatives are successful. In particular, because CFPB\u2019s initiatives  have been wide ranging, a more comprehensive and integrated approach  to reporting progress could make it easier for CFPB employees to  understand the status and timeframes for various actions, their intended  results, and CFPB\u2019s progress in achieving these results. In addition, as  bureau leadership and priorities can shift over time, a comprehensive  approach could help to ensure sustained commitment to progress and  accountability among CFPB leaders.", "Finally, an important part of ensuring a diverse, inclusive, and fair  workplace is promoting employees\u2019 confidence that they can pursue  resolution of problems through available channels, such as alternative  dispute resolution, the formal EEO process, and the grievance processes.  While CFPB has taken steps to improve its management of complaints\u2014 particularly with respect to EEO complaints\u2014our survey results  highlighted concerns among employees who have had experience with  these complaint processes. CFPB is in the process of developing new  tools to collect employees\u2019 feedback on their experiences with the EEO  process, but has not done something similar for the employee grievance  processes. Taking additional steps to understand and remedy factors that  may reduce employee confidence in its complaint processes, such as  implementing tools to collect more comprehensive employee feedback,  will be an important part of CFPB\u2019s ongoing efforts to promote a more  diverse, inclusive, and fair workplace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to ensure sustained leadership commitment to and accountability  for CFPB\u2019s efforts to promote a diverse, inclusive, and fair workplace, we  recommend that the Director take the following two actions:", "Develop and implement a strategy for comprehensively reporting on  the bureau\u2019s implementation goals and progress on its range of  initiatives related to promoting diversity, inclusion, fairness, and a  stronger organizational culture.", "In coordination with representatives of CFPB\u2019s employee union,  develop tools to collect more comprehensive employee feedback on  the grievance complaint processes to understand and remedy factors  that may reduce employee confidence in these processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We made copies of this draft report and the accompanying e-supplement  (GAO-16-138SP) available to CFPB for its review and comment.

We also provided an excerpt of the  draft report to EEOC for technical comment.  EEOC did not provide any  comments.", "In concurring with our first recommendation to comprehensively report on  its goals and progress on its range of diversity, inclusion, fairness, and  organizational culture initiatives, CFPB cited examples of mechanisms it  currently uses to both track individual initiatives and monitor progress  across its many programs and offices. CFPB noted that consolidating and  augmenting its existing monitoring efforts for these initiatives will provide  a fuller picture of progress and opportunities for efficiency and further  innovation.", "In concurring with our second recommendation on feedback tools for the  grievance complaint process, CFPB noted that our survey results on  CFPB employees\u2019 views of CFPB\u2019s complaint processes reflect  responses from a small group of employees and in some cases the  negative views appear to reflect employee misunderstanding. CFPB  noted that this group was smaller because it represented employees  responding to our survey that had experience with one or more of the  complaint processes.  However, our report did not conclude that these  employees\u2019 views were merely due to misunderstandings.  We do not  know if the concerns were based only on misunderstandings or other  reasons.  Furthermore, as we noted in the report, EEOC told us that  negative perceptions need to be addressed so that employees have  confidence in using a complaint process. CFPB agreed that gathering  feedback on its complaint processes could help detect and correct  employee misunderstandings and identify opportunities for process  enhancements.  With respect to negotiated grievances, CFPB said it  plans to work with its employee union to develop feedback mechanisms  that provide it with useful information while respecting the distinct roles  that CFPB management and the union play in that complaint resolution  process.", "In its written comments, CFPB highlighted some differences between our  survey results and the results of CFPB\u2019s 2015 annual employee survey.   For example, CFPB suggested that some of GAO\u2019s survey results  contrast with the favorable score (66 percent) and lack of statistically  significant differences among demographic groups on CFPB\u2019s Inclusion  Quotient (an index based on 20 questions from CFPB\u2019s survey).  In  addition, CFPB asserted that strong survey results on certain of its own  survey questions related to prohibited personnel practices contrast with  more negative results on different (but related) questions in our survey of  nonexecutive employees.  We note that differences in wording and topics  between the relevant GAO and CFPB survey items limit the usefulness of  such comparisons.  Furthermore, the Inclusion Quotient CFPB refers to  provides an index of 20 separate survey items, about half of which cover  topics that were not covered in our two surveys.  While noting these  differences in the survey results, CFPB said that our survey results  provide additional data on these issues and that it looks forward to  analyzing them further and incorporating insights drawn from them into its  ongoing work.", "On April 12, 2016, CFPB provided via e-mail technical comments on the  draft report that included updated information on various personnel  management efforts, among other comments.

As appropriate, we made edits to the report to reflect  this new information.  Among other examples, we updated the report\u2019s  discussion to reflect CFPB\u2019s April 2016 announcement of agreement  on a new performance management program, the closure of  additional Inspector General recommendations in March 2016, and  additional steps CFPB has taken in response to Inspector General  recommendations related to succession planning and incorporating  diversity and inclusion into performance competencies for supervisors  and managers.

To  describe CFPB\u2019s efforts to grow its workforce and meet statutory and  mission-related goals, we reviewed CFPB\u2019s annual reports to Congress  for fiscal years 2012 through 2014, including reports on the Office of  Human Capital\u2019s efforts to build its workforce and develop its processes  for hiring, training, performance management, and other human capital  functions; the Office of Minority and Women Inclusion\u2019s (OMWI) efforts to  promote diversity and inclusion; and CFPB\u2019s overall progress in delivering  results for consumers. We obtained and analyzed CFPB workforce data  for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 to describe the growth and level of diversity  in CFPB\u2019s workforce. We also reviewed data and documentation related  to CFPB\u2019s initial efforts to identify and address specific personnel  challenges. For example, we reviewed a 2013 report by a management  consulting firm on CFPB\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts and CFPB\u2019s  internal analysis of disparities in performance ratings by race and other  factors for fiscal year 2013. In addition, to describe trends in the number  and basis of employee complaints, we obtained and analyzed CFPB data  for fiscal years 2011 to 2015 on Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)  complaints and grievances. To describe employee perspectives on  challenges CFPB faced as a new agency, we reviewed the report by  CFPB\u2019s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion on listening sessions it  held with employees from April through June 2014. We also interviewed  current and former CFPB officials who were employed at CFPB in its first  2 years.", "We obtained CFPB employees\u2019 views on personnel management and  organizational culture through interviews with current and former  employees and two web-based surveys:  Interviews. To identify key issues and concerns related to CFPB\u2019s  personnel management practices and organizational culture and to inform  survey development, we provided opportunities for all CFPB employees  to meet or communicate with us individually in a confidential manner. We  set up a GAO toll-free phone number and e-mail address for CFPB  employees to use to arrange a meeting with our team or provide  information. From August 2014 through May 2015, we held one-on-one  interviews with 120 nonsupervisory and supervisory staff.", "Surveys. From April through June 2015, we conducted two separate self- administered web-based surveys: one survey of all 1,389 CFPB  employees (nonsupervisors and supervisors below executives) who were  employed as of January 31, 2015, and another survey of 57 senior CFPB  executives. We chose to survey all staff instead of a sample in order to  provide the largest possible number of CFPB employees a chance to  voice their opinions. The nonexecutive survey included questions on (1)  hiring, compensation, and retention; (2) employee opportunities,  development and performance management; (3) employee complaint  processes; (4) leadership, management, and communication; (5) diversity  and inclusion efforts; (6) organizational culture and climate; and (7)  employee demographic information. The separate survey of all CFPB  executives covered the same topic areas, but omitted many questions not  relevant for executives. The full set of questions and results for both  surveys is available as an e-publication supplement to this report,  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Survey Results from Employees  and Executives on Personnel Management and Organizational Culture  (GAO-16-138SP, May 2016). Furthermore, we report results for groups of  respondents by race, ethnicity, gender, and age, but we do not attempt to  extrapolate the findings within each of these groups to the broader group.  Survey respondents self-reported their race and ethnicity. Respondents  were able to select more than one race, so it is possible that some  respondents are represented in more than one race and ethnicity group.  In tables where we summarize results by race and ethnicity, we include  results for the group of respondents who chose not to identify their race or  ethnicity. In addition, in tables in this report and the e-supplement, we  exclude results for groups with fewer than 20 respondents.", "A total of 863 employees responded to our nonexecutive survey for a  response rate of 62 percent. A total of 36 senior executives responded to  our executive survey for a response rate of 63 percent. For the  nonexecutive survey, we carried out a statistical nonresponse bias  analysis using available administrative data and determined that we could  not assume the nonrespondents were missing at random. We found that  the propensity to respond was statistically correlated with employee age  and the CFPB division an employee worked in. Furthermore, we  observed that responses to questions on the survey also correlated with  employee age. For this reason, the results of the staff survey are  presented as tabulations from a census survey. We do not make any  attempt to extrapolate the findings to the 38 percent of eligible staff who  chose not to complete our survey.", "To minimize other types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors, and enhance data quality, we employed recognized survey design  practices in the development of the questionnaires and the collection,  processing, and analysis of the survey data. To develop our survey  questions, we drew on information from the one-on-one interviews, prior  GAO-administered personnel management surveys, and the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s Federal Employment Viewpoint Survey. We  pretested the nonexecutive questionnaire with nine CFPB employees and  the executive questionnaire with three executives. During survey  development, we reviewed the survey to ensure the ordering of survey  sections was appropriate and that questions in each section were clearly  stated and easily comprehended. A GAO survey expert reviewed and  provided feedback on our survey instrument. To reduce nonresponse,  another source of nonsampling error, we undertook an intensive follow-up  effort that included multiple e-mail reminders to encourage CFPB  employees and executives to complete the questionnaire. We minimized  processing errors by having a second independent data analyst conduct  an accuracy check of the computer programs used for data analysis.  Also, having the respondents complete questionnaires online eliminated  errors associated with manual data entry. On the basis of our application  of these practices and follow-up procedures, we determined that the data  were of sufficient quality for our purposes.", "In addition to our own surveys and interviews with CFPB employees, we  reviewed CFPB\u2019s annual employee survey results for fiscal years 2013,  2014, and 2015 to obtain additional perspectives from CFPB staff on the  bureau\u2019s personnel management-related issues. In addition, we reviewed  documents and data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  and the Merit Systems Protection Board to provide information about the  views of federal government employees on these issues. We assessed  the reliability of these survey data by reviewing documentation of the  methodology for these surveys and found these survey data to be reliable  for our purposes.", "To evaluate CFPB\u2019s efforts to develop and strengthen its personnel  management and organizational culture, we reviewed relevant CFPB  reports, policies, procedures, training programs, planning documents, and  external reviews. We used criteria from applicable federal regulations,  leading practices for diversity and managing organizational change  identified in prior GAO reports, and GAO standards for internal control.  We also interviewed CFPB officials from the OMWI, the Office of Human  Capital, the Legal division, and the Strategy Office. To learn more about  CFPB\u2019s personnel management changes, we reviewed CFPB\u2019s hiring,  promotions, and commissioning policies and procedures and  communications and guides CFPB created to enhance career  development. We reviewed training programs developed for managers  and CFPB\u2019s plans for developing its new performance management  system, including a research firm\u2019s report on the identification and  development of new performance competencies. We also reviewed a  consultant\u2019s review of possible factors contributing to disparities in  performance management ratings under its current system.", "To assess CFPB\u2019s efforts to improve diversity and inclusion throughout  the bureau, we reviewed challenges identified in reports by CFPB  summarizing listening sessions with employees, by the Office of the  Inspector General of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System and the CFPB (Inspector General) and by Deloitte, a  management consulting firm. We assessed CFPB\u2019s efforts to implement  recommendations from these reports by reviewing memorandums from  leadership, employee trainings, and internal documents describing new  employee groups as well as recruitment, strategic planning, and  succession planning efforts. In addition, we interviewed CFPB and  Inspector General staff about the status of CFPB\u2019s efforts to implement  recommendations made by the Inspector General. We analyzed CFPB\u2019s  efforts to track progress related to diversity and inclusion through their  internal analysis of annual employee survey results, management\u2019s  quarterly performance reviews from 2014 through mid-2015, and  documents describing the goals and outcomes of employee groups  associated with the Workforce of the Future initiative. We also discussed  the development of CFPB\u2019s new performance management system and  competencies through interviews with CFPB officials. To assess manager  accountability mechanisms, we examined CFPB\u2019s current competency  models, updated guidance for these models, and interviewed relevant  officials. We also reviewed CFPB\u2019s disciplinary policy.", "To assess CFPB\u2019s efforts to strengthen its processes for addressing  employee complaints, we reviewed policies, procedures, and guidance  related to Equal Employment Opportunity complaints and grievances. We  reviewed survey instruments that the Office of Civil Rights uses or plans  to use to obtain feedback from employees using the EEO process. We  also reviewed CFPB\u2019s efforts to improve tracking of EEO complaints and  grievances as recommended by the Inspector General in 2015. We  interviewed officials from the Office of Civil Rights who are responsible for  CFPB\u2019s EEO program and from the Office of Human Capital, which is  responsible for CFPB\u2019s grievance processes. We also interviewed  officials from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  about the EEO complaint process and how agencies can evaluate their  program and address negative employee experiences and perceptions.", "For the parts of our work that involved the analysis of computer- processed data, we assessed the reliability of these data and found that  they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Data sets for which we  conducted data reliability assessments include CFPB data on its  workforce demographics and on employee complaints. To assess the  reliability of these data, we reviewed relevant documentation and  conducted interviews with CFPB staff to review steps they took to collect  and ensure the reliability of the data. In addition, we electronically tested  data fields for missing values, outliers, and obvious errors. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to May 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kay Kuhlman (Assistant  Director), John Fisher (Analyst in Charge), Carl Barden, Bethany Benitez,  Lisa Brown, Heather Chartier, Rudy Chatlos, Thomas C.
