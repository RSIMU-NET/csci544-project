To address these objectives, we analyzed documents and interviewed agency officials to (1)validate and update HHS's self-assessments of key practices in the framework and (2)evaluate HHS's plans for improving its capabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Because of the management attention that has been given to IT investment management, HHS has established over half of the foundational practices needed to manage its IT investments individually and about 30 percent of the key practices needed to effectively manage its portfolio of investments. For example, HHS has implemented many of the practices required to ensure that (1) projects support business needs and meet users' requirements, (2) a well-defined and disciplined process is used to select IT investments, (3) investment information is captured in a repository for decision makers, and (4) IT portfolio selection criteria are developed and maintained. However, critical weaknesses remain in several areas. Specifically, HHS lacks: (1) business representation on its senior IT investment review board of component agencies to carry out its full scope of responsibilities, (2) an established process for the IT investment board to regularly review a defined set of the component agencies' IT investments and maintain visibility of other investments, (3) criteria for assessing portfolio performance or regularly reviewing the performance of the organization's investment portfolio, and (4) processes for conducting post-implementation reviews (PIR) of its IT investments. The department also does not have a structured mechanism in place for ensuring that component agencies define and implement investment management processes that are aligned with those of the department. Until the department fully establishes all foundational and portfolio-level practices and establishes a mechanism to ensure that component agencies define and implement processes that are aligned with those of the department, executives cannot be assured that they are appropriately selecting, managing, and evaluating the mix of investments that will maximize returns to the organization, taking into account the appropriate level of risk. HHS has initiated steps to improve its investment management process; however, these steps do not fully address the weaknesses we identify in this report, nor are they coordinated along with other needed improvement efforts into a plan that (1) is based on an assessment of strengths and weaknesses; (2) specifies measurable goals, objectives, and milestones; (3) specifies needed resources; (4) assigns clear responsibility and accountability for accomplishing tasks; and (5) is approved by senior management. Without such a plan and procedures for implementing it, the department risks being unable to effectively establish mature investment management capabilities.

Approval of  the project prospectus by the HHS ITIRB signifies that the agency agrees  that the need is critical enough to proceed to the next step in which the  business case is developed. During business case development, the  investment manager is required to develop the business case, which  establishes the lifecycle cost, schedule, benefits, and performance  baselines and includes an analysis for each investment to identify  alternatives that may satisfy the needs of the department.

(The Select forms are a collection of forms  with HHS\u2019s portfolio management tool that capture investment data to  justify funding and ensure adequate project planning during the select  phase.) The first step within the annual budget formulation process  requires that all component agencies use the Select forms to report the  project cost estimates that best represent the level of funding required to  meet program or business needs. At this point, the Critical Partners and the  Business Case Quality Review Team score and rank the Select forms using  the department\u2019s portfolio management tool to create a single HHS  portfolio as well as component agency portfolios to provide  recommendations to the component agencies for making final adjustments  to their portfolio ranking.", "Once the component agencies have made the appropriate changes, the  Office of the CIO develops prioritized IT portfolios for HHS as a whole as  well as each component agency to present to the HHS ITIRB.

Specifically, Stage 2 encompasses building a sound investment  management foundation by establishing basic capabilities for selecting new  IT projects. It also involves developing the capability to control projects so  that they finish predictably within established cost and schedule  expectations and the capability to identify potential exposures to risk and  put in place strategies to mitigate that risk. The basic selection processes  established in Stage 2 lays the foundation for more mature selection  capabilities in Stage 3, which represents a major step forward in maturity,  in which the agency moves from project-centric processes to a portfolio  approach, evaluating potential investments by how well they support the  agency\u2019s missions, strategies, and goals.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options. It focuses on  establishing a consistent, well-defined perspective on the IT investment  portfolio and maintaining mature, integrated selection (and reselection),  control, and evaluation processes, which are to be evaluated during PIRs.  This portfolio perspective allows decision makers to consider the  interaction among investments and the contributions to organizational  mission goals and strategies that could be made by alternative portfolio  selections, rather than to focus exclusively on the balance between the  costs and benefits of individual investments.", "Stages 4 and 5 require the use of evaluation techniques to continuously  improve both the investment portfolio and the investment processes in  order to better achieve strategic outcomes. At Stage 4 maturity, an  organization has the capacity to conduct IT succession activities and,  therefore, can plan and implement the deselection of obsolete, high-risk, or  low-value IT investments.

For the four projects we reviewed, we  verified that business needs and specific users and other beneficiaries were  identified and documented in the business case or in the Select forms  within HHS\u2019s portfolio management tool. In addition, end users are  involved in project management throughout the life cycle of the  enterprisewide investments. For example, users of HHS\u2019s Public Key  Infrastructure and Enterprise Architecture initiatives participate in project  management through integrated project teams, which meet approximately  once a month and are comprised of representatives from the component  agencies. Because the department has executed all of the key practices  associated with identifying business needs, it has increased confidence that  its IT projects will meet both business needs and users\u2019 needs.", "Table 5 shows the rating for each key practice required to meet business  needs and summarizes the evidence that supports these ratings.", "Selecting new IT proposals and reselecting ongoing investments require a  well-defined and disciplined process to provide the agency\u2019s investment  boards, business units, and developers with a common understanding of  the process and the cost, benefit, schedule, and risk criteria that will be  used both to select new projects and to reselect ongoing projects for  continued funding.

This does not mean that a departmental board, such as the  ITIRB, should micromanage each project to provide effective oversight;  rather it means that the departmental board should be actively involved in  all IT investments and proposals that are high cost or high risk or have  significant scope and duration and at a minimum, should, have a  mechanism for maintaining visibility of other investments. The board  should also employ early warning systems that enable it to take corrective  actions at the first sign of cost, schedule, and performance slippages.

Although the annual reviews may provide insight into  the status of investments, they are not frequent enough to allow for timely  identification of problems.

HHS maintains a portfolio management tool, which serves as the primary  repository for identifying and collecting information about both  department and component agency IT projects and systems. The  department\u2019s portfolio management tool is easily accessible to decision  makers at both the department and component level and the Office of the  CIO has provided decision makers with various training manuals and  guidance memorandums.

An IT  investment portfolio is an integrated, agencywide collection of investments  that are assessed and managed collectively based on common criteria.  Managing investments as a portfolio is a conscious, continuous, and  proactive approach to allocating limited resources among an organization\u2019s  competing initiatives in light of the relative benefits expected from these  investments. Taking an agencywide perspective enables an organization to  consider its investments comprehensively, so that collectively the  investments optimally address the organization\u2019s missions, strategic goals,  and objectives. Managing IT investments as a portfolio also allows an  organization to determine its priorities and make decisions about which  projects to fund and continue to fund based on analyses of the relative  organizational value and risks of all projects, including projects that are  proposed, under development, and in operation. Although investments may  initially be organized into subordinate portfolios\u2014based on, for example,  business lines or life cycle stages\u2014and managed by subordinate  investment boards; they should ultimately be aggregated into this  enterprise-level portfolio.", "According to the ITIM framework, Stage 3 maturity includes (1) defining  the portfolio criteria, (2) creating the portfolio, (3) evaluating the portfolio,  and (4) conducting postimplementation reviews.

In  addition, the investment board examines the mix of new and ongoing  investments and their respective data and analyses to select investments to  fund. However, many key practices still need to be executed before HHS  can effectively manage its IT investments from a portfolio perspective. For  example, HHS has not addressed any of the key practices related to  evaluating the portfolio or conducting PIRs. Until HHS fully implements the  critical processes associated with managing its investments as a complete  portfolio, it will not have the data it needs to make informed decisions  about competing investments.", "Table 10 summarizes the status of HHS\u2019s critical processes for Stage 3,  showing how many associated key practices it has executed.", "To manage IT investments effectively, an organization needs to establish  rules or \u201cportfolio selection criteria\u201d for determining how to allocate scarce  funding to existing and proposed investments. Thus, developing an IT  investment portfolio requires defining appropriate cost, benefit, schedule,  and risk criteria with which to evaluate individual investments in the  context of all other investments. To ensure that the organization\u2019s strategic  goals, objectives, and mission will be satisfied by its investments, the  criteria should have an enterprisewide perspective. Further, if an  organization\u2019s mission or business needs and strategies change, criteria for  selecting investments should be reexamined and modified as appropriate.  Portfolio selection criteria should be disseminated throughout the  organization to ensure that decisions concerning investments are made in a  consistent manner and that this critical process is institutionalized. To  achieve this result, project management personnel and others should be  aware of the criteria and address the criteria in funding submissions for  projects. Resources required for this critical process typically include the  time and attention of executives involved in the process, adequate funding,  and supporting tools. (The complete list of key practices is provided in  table 11.)", "The department has executed 5 of the 7 key practices for this critical  process. For example, responsibility has been assigned to the HHS Lead  Capital Planner for managing the development and modification of the IT  portfolio selection criteria, and adequate resources have been committed  for portfolio selection activities, including the Critical Partners, portfolio  management tool project manager, and the Office of the CIO staff.

Similarly, for the fiscal year 2007 budget  formulation process, HHS began collecting investment information on the  business case quality, Critical Partner reviews, and cost and schedule  variance to determine a quality score, which is the sum of the business case  quality, Critical Partner reviews, and cost and schedule variance scores,  weighted for relative importance. The HHS ITIRB evaluates and annually  adjusts its portfolio selection criteria within the portfolio management tool.", "Despite these important steps in defining portfolio selection criteria,  weaknesses remain. The department has not developed policies or  procedures for modifying the portfolio selection criteria to reflect changes  to HHS mission, goals, strategies, and priorities. In addition, the HHS ITIRB  began reviewing the IT portfolio selection criteria this year. However, the  process for modifying portfolio selection criteria is not institutionalized  because the process to do so was only used once and there are no  documented policies and procedures to ensure that it will be used again.

First, it does not have policies and procedures that  sufficiently address this critical process. Although the department has  policies and procedures for creating IT portfolio selection criteria, they  lack policies and procedures for using these criteria to analyze, select, and  maintain the investment portfolio. Second, even though the HHS ITIRB has  quarterly reviews to compare project and system performance with  expectations for enterprisewide IT investments, the board is not provided  with information comparing the performance of component agency  investments against expectations. In addition, the board approves or  modifies the performance expectations for the enterprisewide IT  investments it has selected, but does not regularly approve or modify the  performance expectations for component agency IT investments or ensure  that this is done. Moreover, as previously mentioned, investment  information has not been used to fully support control and evaluate  decisions for component agency investments.

To date, HHS has  conducted closeout reviews of two enterprisewide investments following  their implementation; however, while these reports do cover investment  cost expectations, they cannot be considered PIRs because the reports do  not address general conclusions, lessons learned, or schedule deviations.

We disagree with the department  that this arrangement provides an adequate structure for managing the  department\u2019s investments. Because allocating resources among major IT  investments may require fundamental trade-offs among a multitude of  business objectives, portfolio management decisions are essentially  business decisions, and therefore require sufficient business  representation on the board. CIOs and executives responsible for mission- support functions do not constitute sufficient business representation  because, by virtue of their responsibilities, they are not in the best position  to make business decisions.

PIRs are conducted to determine whether cost, benefit, schedule, and risk  expectations that were set for investments were achieved and develop  lessons learned about the investment selection and control processes that  can be used as the basis for management improvements. However, neither  the closeout reviews, nor the reviews of systems in operations and  maintenance, are addressing all these elements. Specifically, as we stated in  our report, the closeout reviews do not address schedule deviations,  determine whether the benefits were achieved, or identify lessons learned.  In addition, the reviews of projects in operations and maintenance do not  capture the benefits realized or identify lessons learned.", "Commenting on departmental-level oversight of component agency  investments, HHS stated that it agrees with our recommendation to  improve its oversight of component agency investments. It stated that it  would use a number of mechanisms to do this, including performing audits  to ensure alignment of component agency\u2019s processes with those of the  department, using earned value management data to identify potential  performance problems with most investments, and directly reviewing  investments determined to be of high priority. We agree with HHS that  these steps would help address some of the weaknesses in project  oversight that we identify in this report.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  date of this report. At that time, we will send copies to other interested  congressional committees, the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  and other interested parties.

We reviewed written policies,  procedures, and guidance and other documentation providing evidence of  executed practices, including HHS\u2019s Capital Planning and Investment  Control Policy and Guidelines, standard operating procedures, portfolio  management tool training manuals, and various instructional  memorandums. We also reviewed the HHS ITIRB meeting materials,  including quarterly status reports, meeting minutes, and records of  decisions. We did not assess progress in establishing the capabilities found  in Stages 4 and 5 because the department acknowledged that it had not  executed any of the key practices in higher maturity stages. In addition, we  conducted interviews with officials from the Office of the CIO, whose main  responsibility is to oversee and ensure that HHS\u2019s IT investment  management process is implemented and followed to determine the level  of oversight and guidance the department is providing to its component  agencies. We also interviewed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid\u2019s  Director for Investment Tracking and Assessment to determine the level of  investment management guidance and oversight that is provided by the  department.", "As part of our analysis, we selected two HHS enterprisewide and two  component agency IT projects as case studies to verify that the critical  processes and key practices were being applied. The projects selected  (1) are recognized as major systems, (2) were in different life cycle phases,  (3) represent a mix of headquarters and component agency investments,  (4) support different functional areas, and (5) required different levels of  funding. The four projects are described below:   HHS Public Key Infrastructure\u2014This project supports digital signatures  and other public key-enabled security services; it is intended to be the  underlying architecture to support secure transmissions of electronic  communication, such as encrypted email, by linking a digital key to a  specific person, and issues and manages digital certificates. The intent  of the project is to provide an identity proofing process that is both fast  and certificate authority neutral. It is an agencywide strategic initiative  that provides security services. The project is a major enterprisewide  investment and is in the operations and maintenance phase. The project  has a planned completion date of July 2011 and is estimated to spend  $7.7 million for fiscal year 2006.", "HHS Enterprise Architecture Initiative\u2014This initiative is to provide the  overall framework for planning and managing the technology-supported  information assets of HHS and give the department the ability to identify  data and process redundancies and inefficiencies in its information  systems. The program\u2019s objectives focus on development of operational  policies and support that enable identification, analysis and ongoing  management of the business, and information and related technology  architectures. It is to provide leadership, direction, and support to HHS\u2019s  component agencies in planning and implementing information systems  to support required business processes. As of fiscal year 2005, the  initiative is a major enterprisewide program investment and is estimated  to spend $15.0 million for fiscal year 2006.", "National Institutes of Health\u2019s Electronic Research Administration\u2014 This initiative is the National Institutes of Health\u2019s infrastructure for  conducting interactive electronic transactions for the receipt, review,  monitoring, and administration of grant awards to biomedical  investigators worldwide. It is to provide the technology capabilities for  the agency to efficiently and effectively perform grants administration  functions. The system is to provide end-to-end support of the grants  administration process, including receipt of applications, review and  selection of grantees, financial and progress reporting, issuance of final  reports and grant dole-out, invention reporting, and interface with  accounting systems. It is a major component agency investment and is  expected to have a useful life of 13 years. The project is estimated to  spend $42.1 million for fiscal year 2006.", "Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Mission Accomplishment and  Regulatory Compliance Services\u2014This program is a comprehensive  redesign and reengineering of core mission-critical systems at the  agency, including the Field Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking  System and the Operation and Administration Support System. The first  of these systems is to support the investigation, tracking of compliance,  and laboratory operations related to domestic operations under the  agency\u2019s purview; the second is to primarily support the review and  decision-making process of products imported into the United States.  Both are legacy systems that execute on client-server platforms; while  currently viable, the current systems cannot address many of the  business needs due to the exponential growth in functionality on a rigid  platform that was not designed to support the extent of change that has  been required. The Mission Accomplishment and Regulatory  Compliance Services is a major component agency investment and is  expected to move to production in September 2007 and have a useful  life of 10 years. The project is estimated to spend $10.2 million for fiscal  year 2006.", "For these projects, we reviewed project management documentation, such  as business cases, status reports, and meeting minutes. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of the CIO for the two component  agency investments and the project managers for the two HHS  enterprisewide projects.", "We compared the evidence collected from our document reviews and  interviews to the key practices in ITIM. We rated the key practices as  \u201cexecuted\u201d on the basis of whether the agency demonstrated (by providing  evidence of performance) that it had met the criteria of the key practice. A  key practice was rated as \u201cnot executed\u201d when we found insufficient  evidence of a practice during the review or when we determined that there  were significant weaknesses in HHS\u2019s execution of the key practice. In  addition, HHS was provided the opportunity to produce evidence for key  practices rated as \u201cnot executed.\u201d", "To address our second objective, we obtained and evaluated documents  showing what management actions had been taken and what initiatives had  been planned by the agency. This documentation included the Policy  Advisory Board charter, draft investment management policies and  procedures, as well as procedures and guidance for control and evaluate  functionalities within HHS\u2019s portfolio management tool.
