Protection and Advocacy agencies (P&A) use investigative and legal activities to advocate on behalf of these individuals. Deinstitutionalization has refocused delivery of care to this population over the last several decades from large public institutions to community settings. Refocusing service delivery resulted from (1) the desire to deliver care in the most integrated setting and to control costs and (2) the outcomes of deinstitutionalization lawsuits brought by P&As and others. Some parents have raised concerns that P&As emphasize these suits over other activities, inadequately inform them of family members' inclusion in the suits, and do not adequately monitor individuals after their transfer to the community. GAO was asked to review the extent to which P&As engage in lawsuits related to deinstitutionalization of these individuals, how P&As communicate with affected parents and guardians in these suits, and the role P&As have played in monitoring the well-being of individuals transferred to the community. GAO compiled a national list of lawsuits related to deinstitutionalization involving P&As and reviewed the suits and related activities in three states--California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Lawsuits related to deinstitutionalization brought on behalf of persons with developmental disabilities are a small part of P&As' overall activities for this population. GAO identified 24 such lawsuits that P&As filed, joined, or intervened in from 1975 through 2002. During the same period, P&As filed or intervened in 6 of these lawsuits in the three states GAO reviewed--California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Three of the 6 were settled as class actions; the other 3 were intended, but not settled, as class actions. One is ongoing, one was dismissed, and one was settled by multiparty agreement. P&As' communications with parents and guardians regarding the lawsuits in the three states were consistent with federal rules. For the three suits settled as class actions, P&As complied with the requirement to provide notice to all class members when a settlement agreement is proposed to the court. Such notice was not required in the other three cases, which were not class actions. Representatives of some parent groups told GAO that parents and guardians were dissatisfied with the extent of P&A communication with them before a settlement was proposed, citing problems such as not receiving notice of a family member's inclusion in the class, which the parent or guardian opposed. P&As in the three states told GAO they did not communicate with every person potentially affected by the six lawsuits before a proposed settlement agreement, although they did communicate with organizations representing some parents and guardians during that time. However, even if P&As had made such notification, under the applicable federal rule of civil procedure, an individual has no explicit right to opt out of the class in this type of case. P&As in the three states assumed various roles in monitoring the health and well-being of individuals transferred to community settings in four of the five resolved lawsuits we reviewed, although state developmental disabilities services agencies have the primary responsibility for ensuring the quality of services provided to these individuals. P&As' roles varied with the circumstances of the lawsuits and the initiatives P&As in the three states undertook using their authority to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities. For example, although the three class action settlement agreements did not specify monitoring roles, the P&As assumed roles, such as reviewing information about the quality of community services that the settlement agreements required the states to develop and reviewing care plans of individuals who had been transferred. Representatives of some parent groups told GAO that parents and guardians have been dissatisfied with the adequacy of the P&As' monitoring role in community placements, while representatives of other parent groups said they generally supported the P&A monitoring role. The Administration for Children and Families said GAO's analysis of the three P&As' involvement in deinstitutionalization lawsuits is thorough and the P&As GAO reviewed said that the report is accurate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress established the Protection and Advocacy system in the states  and territories in 1975 to protect and advocate the rights of individuals  with developmental disabilities, most of whom have mental retardation. In  fiscal year 2002, the 57 Protection and Advocacy agencies (P&A) received  $35 million in federal funding for this purpose. To advocate on behalf of  individuals with developmental disabilities, P&As undertake a range of  administrative, information and referral, investigative, and legal activities.  These activities can include representing individuals with developmental  disabilities in lawsuits. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in moving  individuals with developmental disabilities from institutional care settings  to care settings in the community such as group homes and apartments, a  process that is referred to as deinstitutionalization. Some parents and legal  guardians of individuals involved in these suits have supported P&A  efforts in bringing these suits and implementing the settlements that have  resulted. Other parents and guardians of individuals affected by these  suits, however, have organized to oppose the suits and the implementation  of certain aspects of court-approved settlements because of concerns they  have regarding the care of their family members.", "Deinstitutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities has  changed the way that services are provided for this population over the  last several decades as states have moved their focus of care from large,  public institutions to settings in the community. These large facilities are  usually intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICF/MR)  certified to participate in Medicaid. From 1980 through 2002, the average  daily number of people with developmental disabilities living in large  institutions declined from about 131,000 to about 44,000 as states  downsized or closed such institutions. This change occurred for several  reasons, including a greater emphasis on providing services in the most  integrated setting, states\u2019 desires to control costs, and the outcomes of  certain lawsuits. As a result, individuals in large facilities today are mostly  adults who have lived in institutions for many years because fewer  individuals are being admitted to such facilities and instead are receiving  their care in community settings. Care in large, public institutions for  individuals with developmental disabilities is no longer provided in eight  states and the District of Columbia, and the number of individuals  receiving institutional care has declined in most other states. Many of the  former residents of institutions now receive care in group homes or other  community settings as do many other individuals who were never  residents of institutions. Altogether, more than 420,000 individuals with  developmental disabilities were receiving care in community settings as of  June 30, 2002. The largest source of public funding for these institutional  and community services is Medicaid, the federal-state program that  finances health care coverage for certain low-income and disabled  populations. State developmental disabilities services agencies administer  most of the services provided to this population and have primary  responsibility for monitoring these services in institutions and in  community settings.", "In advocating on behalf of individuals with developmental disabilities in  institutions, P&As and others have filed, joined, or intervened in lawsuits  relating to deinstitutionalization. Some of these lawsuits have been class  action lawsuits on behalf of classes of individuals. Deinstitutionalization  lawsuits brought against large, public institutions have alleged  inappropriate care and treatment, including abuse and neglect of  residents, and breaches of statutory and constitutional rights. Some of  these suits have lasted for years, and the courts\u2019 decisions have sometimes  taken additional years to implement after the cases have been decided.  Some parents opposing these P&A efforts have expressed concerns that  P&As emphasize deinstitutionalization lawsuits over other activities; that  P&As do not adequately communicate with parents and guardians of  individuals potentially affected by these lawsuits, such as notifying them  of the inclusion of their family members in the suits; and that P&As do not  assume adequate monitoring roles for the health and well-being of  individuals moved from institutions to community settings in such suits.", "Because of these concerns, you asked us to review certain P&A activities.  We examined (1) the extent to which P&As engage in litigation related to  deinstitutionalization on behalf of individuals with developmental  disabilities, (2) how P&As have communicated with parents and legal  guardians in deinstitutionalization lawsuits, and (3) the role, if any, that  P&As have played in monitoring the health and well-being of individuals  transferred from institutions to community settings within the context of  these lawsuits.", "To examine the extent to which P&As engage in litigation related to  deinstitutionalization on behalf of individuals with developmental  disabilities, we analyzed several data sources and consulted with national  and state organizations because there is no single, national source of  information on P&A litigation activities. We contacted the Administration  on Developmental Disabilities (ADD), within the Administration for  Children and Families (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), which administers the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and  Bill of Rights Act of 2000 (DD Act); the National Association of Protection  & Advocacy Systems, Inc. (NAPAS), which represents P&As; the National  Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities Services,  which represents state developmental disabilities services agencies; and  representatives of family advocacy organizations including Voice of the  Retarded (VOR) and the Arc of the United States. From these sources, we  compiled a national list of lawsuits related to deinstitutionalization that  P&As filed, joined, or intervened in on behalf of individuals with  developmental disabilities from 1975 through 2002. To examine P&A  activities more closely, we chose three states\u2014California, Maryland, and  Pennsylvania\u2014that national organizations we consulted indicated are  among the states with P&As that are more active in deinstitutionalization  litigation. We examined all six lawsuits regarding deinstitutionalization in  these three states that were in the national list of lawsuits we developed.  To obtain information on P&A communication with parents and guardians  in these three states, we interviewed P&A officials, representatives of state  developmental disabilities services agencies, and representatives of parent  groups. In addition, we reviewed federal and relevant state rules of civil  procedure concerning notification of class members in class action  lawsuits. To obtain information on P&A roles in monitoring the health and  well-being of individuals in the community, we interviewed P&A officials,  analyzed settlement agreements and other documents related to the six  lawsuits, and interviewed representatives of state developmental  disabilities services agencies and parent groups. We did not independently  verify the extent of P&As\u2019 monitoring activities or assess their  effectiveness. We did our work from October 2002 through September  2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. (See app. I for more details on our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Protection and Advocacy system was established in 1975 and was  most recently reauthorized in 2000 for 7 years. P&A activities on behalf of  individuals with developmental disabilities include legal representation;  information and referral services; training and technical assistance in self- advocacy; short-term assistance, mediation and negotiation assistance to  obtain benefits and services such as medical care and housing,  transportation, and education; representation in administrative appeals;  and investigation of reports of abuse and neglect, sexual harassment,  inappropriate seclusion and restraint, and other problems. The 57 P&As  include 46 that are private, nonprofit agencies; the other 11 are state  agencies. P&A staffing typically includes management, investigators,  advocates, attorneys, and administrative staff. The P&A in one state we  reviewed also contracted with another organization to conduct lawsuits on  its behalf.", "ADD provides annual funding to P&As, the amount of which is determined  by a formula that uses several measures, including state population  weighted by relative per capita income in the state and a measure of the  relative need for services by individuals with developmental disabilities. In  fiscal year 2003, ADD funding for P&As was set at $36.3 million, a  $1.3 million increase over fiscal year 2002. Funding amounts to states  ranged from $345,429 to $2,978,192 for fiscal year 2003. For P&As in  California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, these amounts were $2,978,192,  $468,934, and $1,388,495, respectively. P&As also may receive funding  from other sources to serve individuals with developmental disabilities,  including state and private funds. In addition, P&As often serve  populations other than individuals with developmental disabilities and  receive separate funding for that purpose.", "Although state developmental disabilities services agencies are primarily  responsible for arranging for the provision of services and oversight of  quality for services received by individuals with developmental disabilities,  the DD Act authorizes P&As to play an important role in monitoring these  services. The DD Act authorizes P&As to investigate allegations of abuse  and neglect when reported or if there is probable cause to believe that  incidents occurred and to pursue legal, administrative, and other  appropriate remedies or approaches on behalf of individuals with  developmental disabilities. The act grants P&As access to individuals with  developmental disabilities and to their records, including reports prepared  by agencies or staff on injuries or deaths. Under this authority, P&As  typically undertake monitoring efforts to review the adequacy of services  that individuals receive in institutions and in community settings and to  examine state oversight of quality assurance and regulatory compliance  for residential services providers.", "Many individuals with developmental disabilities for whom P&As advocate  are eligible to receive publicly financed residential services through  Medicaid, which is the largest source of funds for services for individuals  with developmental disabilities. State developmental disabilities services  agencies have primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of services  provided to individuals with developmental disabilities, including those  services funded by Medicaid. In 2002, Medicaid financed 77 percent  ($26.8 billion) of the total $34.7 billion in total long-term care spending on  individuals with developmental disabilities. Medicaid spending was about  $10.9 billion for ICF/MR residents including those living in large  institutions; about $12.9 billion for individuals with developmental  disabilities receiving home and community-based services (HCBS) under  Medicaid waivers; and an additional $2.9 billion for other services  provided in community settings, such as personal care.", "Residential choices for individuals with developmental disabilities vary by  state since states choose whether to offer these individuals services in  ICF/MRs, which is an optional rather than a mandatory benefit in  Medicaid, and whether to provide services in community settings through  HCBS waivers. States may apply to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS) for waivers under section 1915(c) of the Social Security  Act to provide HCBS services as an alternative to institutional care in  ICF/MRs and waive certain Medicaid requirements that would otherwise  apply, such as statewideness, which requires that services be available  throughout the state, and comparability, which requires that all services be  available to all eligible individuals. For both the ICF/MR and waiver  programs, protecting the health and welfare of Medicaid-covered  individuals receiving services is a shared federal-state responsibility.  Under the ICF/MR optional benefit program, states annually inspect  institutions to ensure that they meet federal quality standards. Under  Medicaid waivers, states must include assurances to CMS that necessary  safeguards are in place to protect beneficiaries.", "In pursuing legal remedies on behalf of individuals with developmental  disabilities, P&As have represented individuals as well as groups or  classes of individuals in lawsuits. All such lawsuits are subject to rules of  procedure that govern proceedings in the relevant court. Many of these  cases take place in federal court, where the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure (FRCP) apply. FRCP Rule 23 establishes procedural  requirements for class action lawsuits in federal district court, including  the circumstances under which individuals must be notified of their  inclusion in a class prior to class formation, referred to as certification by  the court, and notified of proposed settlements of lawsuits on their behalf.  The requirements vary depending upon whether the suit is for injunctive  relief or monetary damages. Lawsuits for injunctive relief seek a court  order requiring another party to do or refrain from doing a specified act.  For suits seeking injunctive relief, the type of class action suit P&As  generally bring, the rule does not require notification of individuals\u2019  inclusion in a class prior to class formation. The rule does, however,  require notification of class members at the time of proposed settlement.  By contrast, for class action suits seeking monetary relief, the rule requires  that individuals be notified of their inclusion in a class prior to its  formation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lawsuits Related to Deinstitutionalization Are a Small Part of P&A Activities", "paragraphs": ["Nationwide and for the three states reviewed, lawsuits related to  deinstitutionalization on behalf of individuals with developmental  disabilities constitute a small part of overall P&A activities.

P&A officials in California, Maryland,  and Pennsylvania told us that they did not try to communicate with all  individuals, including parents and guardians, potentially affected by the six  lawsuits until a settlement was proposed to the court. However, P&As  were not required to provide such communication. In a discussion with  NAPAS, the national organization representing P&As, an official told us  that for P&As to attempt to contact all such individuals would require  considerable time and expense, which would make providing such notice  extremely difficult. Furthermore, he said that P&As would not generally  wish to provide such notice unless required to do so because this could  provide defendants with information they might use to oppose litigation.", "Nevertheless, P&A officials said that they met or attempted to meet with  organizations representing some parents and guardians of affected  individuals during the lawsuits. The context of the meetings varied with  the circumstances of the six lawsuits. For example, a California P&A  official indicated that, both before and after filing the Coffelt lawsuit in  1990, the P&A met with organizations representing the parents and  guardians of residents of at least three of the institutions affected. In the  other two California lawsuits, Richard S. (1997) and Capitol People First  (2002), a California P&A official indicated that the P&A met with and  represented organizations whose members included the families of  institutional residents, and met with individual family members before and  during the litigation. The P&A did not, however, meet with parent  organizations specifically associated with the institutions. In both of those  lawsuits, the organizations specifically associated with the institutions  were or are involved as parties, thus complicating direct communication  between the P&A and parents and guardians who might belong to these  organizations. A Maryland P&A official told us that, before filing the Hunt  v. Meszaros litigation in 1991, the P&A met with an organization  representing parents and guardians of residents of the affected facility\u2014  the Great Oaks Center. A Pennsylvania P&A official told us that the P&A  met with a parent group representing Embreeville Center residents during  the Nelson v. Snider litigation (1994)\u2014both before filing the lawsuit and  after the court\u2019s certification of a class action. These efforts were  complicated by the fact that this organization had already filed another  lawsuit against the state. A Pennsylvania P&A official said that the P&A  tried unsuccessfully to meet with an organization representing parents and  guardians of Western Center residents prior to filing the Richard C. v.  Snider lawsuit (1989) and that such efforts were complicated by another  lawsuit filed against the P&A by that organization. Representatives of  some parent groups, however, told us that P&A communication  concerning the lawsuits with parents and guardians of affected individuals  was limited.", "Three of the six lawsuits we examined\u2014Nelson v. Snider, Richard. C. v.  Snider, and Coffelt v. California Department of Developmental  Services\u2014were certified by the courts as class actions. The P&As  indicated that they did not attempt to notify all prospective class members  prior to certification of their classes by the court for the reasons discussed  above. P&As told us they maintained regular contact with all named  plaintiffs in the lawsuits. Representatives of some parent groups said that  parents and guardians of individuals affected as unnamed class members  in the lawsuits had insufficient opportunity to express their views about  the inclusion of their adult children in the class and were not notified that  their children might be included until the settlement was proposed to the  court. As a result, some individuals may have been included in class  actions even though they or their parents or guardians opposed their  inclusion. As a matter of law, however, these individuals would have had  limited influence even if they had been able to express their views. In class  action suits seeking injunctive relief, such as the three we examined, the  court focuses on the circumstances of the class as a whole as opposed to  those affecting individual members. In such suits, under the rules  governing such litigation, an individual has no explicit right to opt out of a  class as certified by the court. By contrast, there is an explicit right to opt  out of a class in class action lawsuits that seek monetary compensation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "P&As in the Three States Assumed Various Roles in Monitoring Individuals Transferred to Community Settings", "paragraphs": ["P&As assumed various roles in monitoring the health and well-being of  individuals with developmental disabilities transferred from institutions to  community settings in four of five lawsuits we reviewed in California,  Maryland, and Pennsylvania that had been resolved.

In these three states, P&A roles and  responsibilities varied with the circumstances of the lawsuits and  initiatives P&As undertook as part of their general role to protect and  advocate the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities.

Regarding the other three lawsuits not settled as class  actions, the P&A also undertook a role in monitoring affected individuals  in one of these suits. P&As are not playing a monitoring role in the other  two suits\u2014in one because of the nature of the suit, and in the other  because litigation is ongoing.", "For the three lawsuits settled as class actions\u2014Coffelt (California),  Richard C. (Pennsylvania), and Nelson (Pennsylvania)\u2014the P&As  assumed the role of monitoring some or all class members transferred to  community settings. As a result of the Coffelt settlement in 1994, the  California P&A has undertaken the role of monitoring individuals using  information that the state was required to provide, such as annual reports  about quality of life in community settings, based on consumer and family  surveys. P&A monitoring responsibilities for Coffelt\u2019s 11 named plaintiffs  involved regular communication with these individuals. For Richard C., a  Pennsylvania P&A official told us that the P&A role included hiring an  advocate to monitor services provided to all class members while they  were still living at the Western Center and after their placement in  community settings. This advocate was expected to visit each class  member discharged from the Western Center after 1994 at least once. A  P&A official said that monitoring included face-to-face interaction with  class members living at the Western Center or in the community. The P&A  has ongoing responsibility for monitoring several individuals who were  moved from the Western Center to the Ebensburg Center, another state  facility for individuals with mental retardation. For the Nelson lawsuit  settled in 1994, the P&A undertook the responsibility to follow 50 class  members who did not have involved family members, in addition to  monitoring six named plaintiffs. P&As have assumed a role in monitoring  state development and implementation of quality assurance mechanisms  established by all three settlement agreements to improve services  provided in community settings and evaluate services delivered in the  community. Thus, these agreements have long-lasting implications for  state and P&A monitoring activities because implementation of the  settlement agreements may take years to complete.", "Of the three other lawsuits we reviewed, one was settled, one was  dismissed, and the third is ongoing litigation. In the settled suit, Richard S.  (California), the P&A did not undertake a monitoring role as a result of  this lawsuit. In this suit, the P&A intervention was intended to overturn  California state policy permitting family member or guardian veto of  community placement decisions, an outcome that did not lead to a P&A  role in monitoring individuals affected by this suit. However, California  P&A officials reported that the P&A had the role of monitoring the well- being of all individuals who moved from institutions to the community,  including individuals affected by the Richard S. suit, based on the role  assumed by the P&A in the Coffelt case. In the dismissed suit Hunt  (Maryland), the P&A undertook a certain role to monitor plaintiffs and  other affected individuals. The Hunt lawsuit was dismissed in 1999  following closure of the Great Oaks Center in 1996. However, the P&A and  Arc of Maryland officials reported having a role in assisting families of  individuals who had problems with community placements. Finally,  California\u2019s Capitol People First (filed in 2002) is in the early stages of  litigation and has not yet addressed a P&A monitoring role.", "Parent groups we interviewed had differing views about the role P&As  played in monitoring individuals in the five resolved lawsuits we reviewed.  Representatives of some parent groups were generally dissatisfied with  the adequacy of P&As\u2019 efforts to monitor the health and well-being of  individuals transferred to community settings, while representatives of  other parent groups, who were generally in favor of these lawsuits,  supported P&As\u2019 monitoring approaches. Those parent groups that were  dissatisfied said that in supporting states\u2019 \u201crapid\u201d deinstitutionalization  efforts, P&As disregarded parents\u2019 concerns about service quality  deficiencies in community settings and the needs of individuals with  severe developmental disabilities, who tend to be medically fragile. They  also stated that P&A staff did not adequately monitor individuals who  were moved to community settings. In contrast, representatives of other  parent groups generally supported the P&A role in monitoring community  placements. For example, a representative of one parent group said that  the Maryland P&A collaborated with this group in developing a family  guide to community programs for people affected by the Hunt lawsuit.  Other parent groups said the Pennsylvania P&A was instrumental in  establishing consumer and family satisfaction teams to monitor the quality  of services provided to individuals and families affected by the Nelson  lawsuit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to ACF and to the California, Maryland,  and Pennsylvania P&As for their review.

We analyzed information from  two key studies that provide extensive information on  deinstitutionalization lawsuits, interviewed the authors of these studies,  and examined information on lawsuits provided by the National  Association of Protection & Advocacy Systems, Inc. (NAPAS) and Voice of  the Retarded (VOR). We also interviewed officials from the Administration  on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) in the Administration for Children  and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  NAPAS, the National Association of State Directors of Developmental  Disabilities Services, and the VOR; representatives of several other family  advocacy organizations, including the Arc of the United States; and P&A  officials in the three states. From these sources, we compiled a national  list of 24 deinstitutionalization lawsuits confirmed by NAPAS or state  P&As that P&As filed, joined, or intervened in on behalf of individuals with  developmental disabilities from 1975 through 2002. (See app. II for a list of  all 24 cases identified.) From the national list we identified six lawsuits in  three states\u2014California, Maryland, and Pennsylvania\u2014to study in more  detail. National organizations that we consulted indicated that these states\u2019  P&As are more active in deinstitutionalization litigation. In addition, we  analyzed research on national trends in litigation for institutionalized  individuals with developmental disabilities, consulted individuals  knowledgeable about P&A deinstitutionalization lawsuits, and examined  aggregate and state-specific ADD data from 1999 through 2001 on P&A  litigation services provided to this population.", "To determine how P&As communicated with parents and legal guardians  of individuals with developmental disabilities in deinstitutionalization  lawsuits, we focused on the six lawsuits in California, Maryland, and  Pennsylvania. We reviewed class action notification requirements for  plaintiffs in federal and state courts and analyzed settlement agreements  and other documents related to the six lawsuits. We also discussed the  extent of P&A communication with individuals potentially affected by  class action litigation with P&A officials and parent representatives in  these states.", "Finally, to determine the role P&As play in monitoring individuals who  have been moved from institutions to community settings, we reviewed  the authority P&As have under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance  and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 to protect and advocate the rights of  individuals with developmental disabilities. We interviewed P&A officials  in the three states about their roles and responsibilities and reviewed  applicable deinstitutionalization settlement agreements and related  documentation that they provided. We also interviewed officials from  these states\u2019 developmental disabilities services agencies who have  primary responsibility for ensuring the quality of services provided to  individuals with developmental disabilities. We did not attempt to assess  the effectiveness of P&A and state agencies\u2019 quality monitoring efforts nor  to generalize our study findings to P&As nationwide. We did our work  from October 2002 through September 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: P&A Lawsuits Related to Deinstitutionalization for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities, 1975\u20132002", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Arc of Delaware et al. v.
