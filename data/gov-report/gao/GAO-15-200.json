USAID, State, and DOD officials believe that few of the prime  contractors subcontract 70 percent or more of the total cost of work  performed on the types of contracts subject to Section 802. For example,  State acquisition officials believe that such a high level of subcontracting  is more likely to be found on State\u2019s contracts for construction, which  often use fixed-priced contracts and, therefore, would not be subject to  the requirements of Section 802.", "In lieu of developing new data or reporting requirements to assess  whether its acquisition personnel are properly implementing Section 802,  USAID acquisition officials noted that they will rely on routine, on-site  procurement system and contract reviews to evaluate contracting offices\u2019  compliance with Section 802.

At the  same time, our review of current USAID, State, and DOD procurement  management review instructions and checklists found that they do not  reflect all Section 802 requirements.

Initially, the  focus of these changes had been on requiring prime contractors to notify  contracting officers when they intend to rely largely on subcontractors.  Section 802 changed that paradigm by requiring contracting officers to  consider alternative arrangements, such as directly contracting with  subcontractors and to make a written determination that the accepted  approach is in the best interest of the government, and to document the  basis for such a determination when they receive such a notification.  Neither USAID nor State has provided its contracting officers additional  guidance to help them implement these new requirements. DOD, having  the highest level of obligations for contracts that may be potentially  subject to Section 802 requirements, has not taken any actions and is  waiting for the issuance of a final FAR rule before deciding what, if any,  revisions to its guidance are needed. USAID, State, and DOD intend to  use procurement management reviews to monitor implementation of  Section 802, but have not updated the related review processes and  guidance. Without data on the extent to which agencies make use of  contracts that rely largely on subcontractors, it is essential that agencies  provide guidance to assist their contracting officers in implementing  legislative requirements and develop oversight processes to assess their  agencies\u2019 compliance. DOD\u2019s decision to wait until the FAR is revised  next year rather than proactively initiating actions has increased the risk  that its contracting personnel are not currently acting in compliance with  the law and may also have missed opportunities to establish more  beneficial contracting arrangements. While State and USAID obligate less  for contracts that may be subject to Section 802, their more limited  exposure does not obviate the need to provide guidance or management  oversight.

DOD, by way of  explaining its delay in issuing guidance, noted it was required to adhere to  the regulatory rulemaking process and noted that the final FAR rule to  implement Section 802 is expected to be issued in March 2015. Section  802 provided flexibility for DOD to issue guidance and regulations as may  be necessary to ensure contracting officers take specific actions for  certain solicitations and we continue to believe DOD should do so  expeditiously. State noted that it will issue guidance to assist contracting  officer to assess alternative contracting approaches and document the  determination that the approach selected is in the best interest of the  government. USAID did not believe it was necessary to issue additional  guidance, stating that the FAR has provided specific actions for a  contracting officer to follow to ensure that they identify and adequately  reconsider proposed contracts and that to provide additional guidance  may limit its contracting officers\u2019 discretion. As we noted in the report,  USAID has restated these actions in a policy directive, but it has not  provided contracting officers with guidance on how to perform these new  requirements. Specifically, USAID has not provided examples of how to  conduct an analysis of alternate acquisition approaches or determine the  feasibility of contracting directly with proposed subcontractors, described  what documentation is necessary, or identified where the required  contracting officer\u2019s determination should be recorded. Rather than limit a  contracting officer\u2019s discretion, we believe that more specific guidance will  help contracting officer\u2019s comply with these new requirements, improve  oversight, and align more closely with federal internal control standards.", "DOD and State concurred with our recommendation to revise their  processes and guidance governing management reviews of  procurements to ensure that such reviews assess whether contracting  officers are complying with the provisions of Section 802. DOD indicated  it will provide or revise and update guidance governing management  reviews to ensure that such reviews assess whether contracting officers  are complying with the provisions of Section 802. In addition, once the  final FAR rule is issued, DOD noted it will assess whether it needs to  include supplemental information in its Procedures, Guidance, and  Information to ensure compliance. State noted that it will also revise its  management review guidance to include compliance with Section 802.  USAID did not specifically state whether it concurred with the  recommendation, noting that it will be reviewing random files during  procurement system reviews to see if contracting officers are taking  appropriate steps in instances where an offeror proposes to award  subcontracts for more than 70 percent of the total award. We agree that  such an approach could be an appropriate step when conducting a  procurement management review, but, as noted in the report, USAID has  not revised the processes and guidance governing management reviews  of procurements to do so.
