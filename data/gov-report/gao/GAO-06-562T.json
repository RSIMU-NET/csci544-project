It provides all of the funding for the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) capital accounts, including: (1) the Airport Improvement Program, which provides grants for construction and safety projects at airports; (2) the Facilities and Equipment account, which funds technological improvements to the air traffic control system; and (3) the Research, Engineering, and Development account, which funds continued research on aviation safety, mobility, and environment issues. In addition, at various times during its history, the Trust Fund has funded all or some portion of FAA's operations. To fund these accounts, the Trust Fund is credited with revenues from a variety of excise taxes related to passenger tickets, passenger flight segments, international arrivals/departures, cargo waybills, and aviation fuels. Including interest earned on its balances, the Trust Fund received $10.8 billion in fiscal year 2005. The various taxes that accrue to the Trust Fund are scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 2007. GAO was asked to provide information and analysis about the financial condition and future viability of the Trust Fund."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Trust Fund's uncommitted balance decreased from $7.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 2001 to about $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal year 2005. In 3 of the last 4 fiscal years, the Trust Fund's uncommitted balance has fallen by over $1 billion because revenues were lower than FAA forecasted due to the impact of unanticipated events such as the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. However, the rate of decrease has slowed; during fiscal year 2005, the uncommitted balance decreased by about $500 million. Under FAA's current authorization, appropriations from the Trust Fund are based on forecasted revenues. Thus, if actual revenues approximate forecasted revenues, there should be no substantial change in the uncommitted balance. However, for each fiscal year since 2001, because actual revenues have been less than forecasted, the uncommitted balance has fallen. Based on its revenue forecast and appropriation for fiscal year 2006, FAA forecasts that the Trust Fund's uncommitted balance will fall by the end of 2006 to about $1.7 billion. If the Congress continues to follow the formula from Vision 100--FAA's current authorizing legislation that links appropriations made available from the fund to revenue forecasts--then FAA expects there will be little change in the uncommitted balance for fiscal year 2007. If, instead, the Congress adopts the President's budget for FAA for fiscal year 2007, FAA forecasts that the fund's uncommitted balance by the end of 2007 will rise to about $2.7 billion. This higher forecasted uncommitted balance occurs because the President's budget calls for an appropriation to FAA from the Trust Fund that is about $1 billion lower than the Vision 100 formula. If revenues in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 are below forecasted levels, the Trust Fund's uncommitted balance will be less than forecasted and, in one scenario we analyzed, will reach zero by the end of 2007. This scenario raises concerns because, in the past, the Trust Fund's uncommitted balance was used to offset lower-than-expected Trust Fund revenues and decreased general fund contributions. FAA could help address these concerns by continuing to look for ways to improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, the zero-balance scenario would most likely have implications for the Congress in funding FAA programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss the financial viability of the  Airport and Airway Trust Fund (Trust Fund) and the President\u2019s proposed  2007 budget for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance depends on the  revenues flowing into the fund and the appropriations made available from  the fund for various spending accounts. Policy choices, structural changes  in the aviation industry, and external events have affected revenues  flowing into and out of the fund. For example, the uncommitted balance  has been declining in recent years because Trust Fund revenues for the  last 5 years have been less than FAA\u2019s forecasted levels. Our analysis  includes scenarios in which Trust Fund revenues continue to fall short of  forecasted levels. Under these scenarios, the Trust Fund balance  continues to decline, and in one scenario, the balance reaches zero by the  end of 2007. We believe these scenarios raise concerns because in the past  the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance was used to offset lower-than- expected Trust Fund revenues and decreased general fund contributions.  FAA could help address these concerns by continuing to look for ways to  improve efficiency and reduce costs. However, the zero-balance scenario  would most likely have implications for the Congress in funding FAA  programs.

Some aviation stakeholders have said that there is a reason to be  concerned about the financial condition of the Trust Fund because in  recent years, revenues have not kept pace with funding commitments and  the uncommitted balance has been used to close the gap. Other aviation  stakeholders state that the fund is healthy because revenues are currently  increasing and are expected to continue to increase.", "The focus today is the Trust Fund\u2019s revenues and balances over the past  few years; the projected near-term future of the Trust Fund, considering  the President\u2019s 2007 budget request for FAA; and policy decisions that may  affect longer-term Trust Fund balances.

The amount of revenue flowing into the Trust  Fund has fluctuated from year to year but has generally trended upward,  as shown in figure 2. Some of the fluctuation has resulted from changes in  economic conditions, but some has been due to other factors. For  example, during 1981 and 1982, revenues (including interest) flowing into  the fund averaged about $629 million\u2014the lowest amount in the fund\u2019s  history\u2014because of a lapse in the collection of aviation taxes. In 1999,  revenue flowing into the fund totaled about $11.1 billion, the largest  amount in the fund\u2019s history.", "However, after revenues peaked in 1999, the amount of revenue flowing  into the Trust Fund decreased in each of the next 4 years, reaching a level  of about $9.3 billion in 2003. A number of factors contributed to this  decrease. For example, within the airline industry, the growth of the  Internet as a means to sell and distribute tickets, the growth of low-cost  airlines, and fare reductions by legacy carriers all transformed the  industry and led to lower average fares. These lower fares have resulted in  lower ticket taxes and less revenue going into the Trust Fund. In addition,  in the same time period, a series of largely unforeseen events, including  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, war in Iraq and associated  security concerns, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and  global recessions seriously affected demand for air travel, resulting in a  decrease in airline industry and Trust Fund revenue.", "Since the beginning of 2004, however, Trust Fund revenues have been  increasing. In fact, revenues from tax sources in 2005 were nearly as high  as in 1999, although total revenues were still below peak level because less  interest was earned due to a lower Trust Fund balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expenditures from the Trust Fund Have Also Generally Increased", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the revenue picture, the annual amount of expenditures from  the Trust Fund also has generally increased since the fund\u2019s inception, but  with some fluctuation.

As  noted in the figure, the uncommitted balance has decreased substantially  in recent years. The Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance peaked at over $7  billion in 1991, 1999, and 2001. In contrast, because of lapses in the taxes  that accrue to the fund, at the end of 1982, the uncommitted balance was  about $2.1 billion, and at the end of 1997, it was about $1.4 billion.  Specifically, the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance decreased from $7.3  billion at the end of 2001 to $4.8 billion at the end of 2002 and has  continued to decrease since then, reaching about $1.9 billion at the end of  2005. However, the rate of decrease has slowed; in 2005, the uncommitted  balance decreased by about $500 million, after falling by at least $900  million in each of the previous 3 years.", "The uncommitted balance has fallen in recent years because Trust Fund  revenues have fallen short of forecasted levels by over $1 billion in 3 out of  the last 4 fiscal years. For example, in 2001, the difference between  forecasted revenue and actual revenue coming in to the Trust Fund was  $383 million less than expected. In 2002, the difference jumped to $2.3  billion due to the impact that unanticipated external events such as the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks had on the aviation industry.  Residual effects and other factors such as the war in Iraq and the SARS  outbreak lasted through 2003 and 2004, with each year\u2019s actual revenues  coming in at least $1 billion below forecasted revenues.", "As mentioned above, under Vision 100 and its predecessor, AIR-21,  appropriations made available from the Trust Fund are based on  forecasted revenues. Thus, if actual revenues approximate forecasted  revenues, there should be no substantial change in the uncommitted  balance. However, as shown in figure 5, for each year beginning with 2001,  actual revenues, including interest, have been less than forecasted, so that  in each year since then, the uncommitted balance has fallen."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fund\u2019s Uncommitted Balance Is Projected to Be Positive through 2007 but Depends on Realization of Forecasted Passenger Traffic Levels and Airfares", "paragraphs": ["Based on its revenue forecast and appropriations for 2006, FAA forecasts  that the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance will decrease by the end of  2006 to about $1.7 billion.

If, instead, the Congress adopts the President\u2019s budget request for FAA for  2007, FAA forecasts that the fund\u2019s uncommitted balance by the end of  2007 will rise to about $2.7 billion. This higher forecasted uncommitted  balance occurs because the President\u2019s budget calls for an appropriation  from the Trust Fund that is about $1 billion lower than the Vision 100  formula. In addition, compared with Vision 100, the President\u2019s budget  calls for a reduction in the appropriation to FAA from the general fund of  about $500 million. Thus, in total, compared with Vision 100, the  President\u2019s budget calls for a reduction of about $1.5 billion in FAA\u2019s  appropriation. Figure 6 shows the forecasted year-end uncommitted  balance under both scenarios through 2007.", "While the President\u2019s budget calls for making a smaller appropriation  available from the Trust Fund than under Vision 100, largely due to  reductions in the AIP, it calls for greater reliance on the Trust Fund to  fund FAA\u2019s operations. Vision 100 uses the formula created in AIR-21 to  determine how much funding for FAA operations should come from the  Trust Fund, but the President\u2019s budget proposal does not use this formula.  Under Vision 100, the formula makes the amount of Trust Fund revenue  that will be authorized for FAA operations and RE&D in a given year equal  to projected Trust Fund revenues (as specified in the President\u2019s budget)  minus the authorizations for the capital accounts (AIP and F&E) in that  year. Thus, under Vision 100, the Trust Fund is projected to support $4.6  billion of FAA\u2019s operations, or 57 percent. In contrast, the President\u2019s  budget specifies a set amount of Trust Fund revenue to be used for FAA  operations. Therefore, if Congress enacts the President\u2019s budget request  for FAA, the Trust Fund would provide $5.4 billion for FAA\u2019s operations in  2007, or 65 percent of its total estimated cost for operations.", "Although the Trust Fund is projected to have a surplus at the end of 2007  under each of the expenditure proposals, this projection depends to a  significant extent on achieving forecasted commercial passenger traffic  levels and airfares, as they have the largest impact on the amount of  revenues flowing into the Trust Fund. We recognize that it is difficult to  anticipate future events that may significantly affect the demand for air  travel, particularly since FAA makes a forecast that is contained in the  President\u2019s budget based on information available in the first quarter of  the preceding fiscal year. However, our analysis shows that for each of the  last 5 years, FAA\u2019s projected revenue forecast for the President\u2019s budget  was higher than the actual amount of revenue received, as shown in   figure 5.", "Given the differences in recent years between the forecasted revenue and  actual amount of revenue received, we conducted sensitivity analyses to  estimate what would happen to the Trust Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance if  Trust Fund revenues in 2006 and 2007 fall below the levels that FAA  projected in March 2006. For example, table 2 shows the projected Trust  Fund balances under Vision 100 and the President\u2019s proposal and the  impact if revenues, for whatever reason, are 5 percent or 10 percent less  than currently projected. If revenues are 5 percent lower than projected,  which they were in 2001, the Trust Fund would have a small but positive  uncommitted balance under both expenditure proposals\u2014Vision 100 and  the President\u2019s budget proposal. However, if the revenues were 10 percent  lower than projected, as they were in 2004, the uncommitted balance  would drop below half a billion dollars under the President\u2019s proposal and  would fall to zero by the end of 2007 under Vision 100.", "We believe these scenarios raise concerns because, in the past, the Trust  Fund\u2019s uncommitted balance was used to offset lower-than-expected Trust  Fund revenues and decreased general fund contributions. FAA could help  address these concerns by continuing to look for ways to improve  efficiency and reduce costs. However, the zero-balance scenario would  most likely have implications for Congress in funding FAA programs.", "To keep the Trust Fund from declining, the Congress could use an  alternate basis for authorizing and appropriating money out of the Trust  Fund that does not rely on the revenue forecast in the President\u2019s budget.  One alternative that would still maintain the link between revenues and  spending would be for appropriations from the Trust Fund to be based on  the actual Trust Fund revenues from the most recent year for which data  are available. That would mean, for example, that the Congress would  appropriate for 2007 the Trust Fund revenues received in 2005. Although  that would make it less likely that the Trust Fund balance would decline  further, it could also mean that a smaller appropriation would be made  available for aviation. Whereas Trust Fund revenues in 2005 were about  $10.8 billion, the President\u2019s budget for 2007 forecasts Trust Fund  revenues of about $11.8 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Policy Decisions Will Affect the Trust Fund Balance beyond 2007", "paragraphs": ["Future policy decisions concerning spending for aviation will affect the  Trust Fund balances beyond 2007.

According to FAA, its aviation infrastructure is aging, and  replacing it will cost $32 billion. Even more, Trust Fund revenues would  be needed to pay for those expenses if general fund appropriations for  operations are reduced.

In March 2006, JPDO published its  2005 Progress Report to the Next Generation Air Transportation System  Integrated Plan and reported it is working to identify the longer-term  costs. JPDO conducted a financial analysis of the air traffic management  portions of NGATS, including examining the existing 2025 operational  vision, to understand the hardware and software components that may be  required to implement NGATS. However, because of the high level of  uncertainty in some areas and a significant number of assumptions in  others, JPDO reported more work is required before this analysis can be  useful and credible.

We are reviewing  options to fund FAA, at the request of this subcommittee, and we will  address this issue in detail later this year.", "Although FAA has initiated several of these cost-control measures, these  initiatives alone cannot reduce expenses enough to free up sufficient Trust  Fund revenues to pay for the expenditures that FAA says are necessary to  maintain and modernize the current airspace system, let alone finance  future NGATS initiatives.
