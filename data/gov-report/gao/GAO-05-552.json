These weaknesses exist primarily because agencies have not yet fully implemented strong information security management programs. These weaknesses put federal operations and assets at risk of fraud, misuse, and destruction. In addition, they place financial data at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction, sensitive information at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical operations at risk of disruption. Overall, the government is making progress in its implementation of FISMA. To provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls, FISMA details requirements for federal agencies and their inspectors general (IG), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and OMB. Federal agencies reported that they have been increasingly implementing required information security practices and procedures, although they continue to face major challenges. Further, IGs have conducted required annual evaluations, and NIST has issued required guidance in the areas of risk assessments and recommended information security controls, and has maintained its schedule for issuing remaining guidance required under FISMA. Finally, OMB has given direction to the agencies and reported to Congress as required; however, GAO's analysis of its annual reporting guidance identified opportunities to increase the usefulness of the reports for oversight.

As  detailed in our methodology for performing information security audits,  organizations accomplish this by designing and implementing controls that  are intended to prevent, limit, and detect access to computing resources  (computers, networks, programs, and data), thereby protecting these  resources from unauthorized use, modification, loss, and disclosure.  Access controls can be both electronic and physical. Electronic access  controls include control of user accounts, use of passwords, and  assignment of user rights. Physical security controls are important for  protecting computer facilities and resources from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft. These controls involve restricting physical access to  computer resources, usually by limiting access to the buildings and rooms  in which they are housed. Physical control measures may include guards,  badges, and locks, used alone or in combination.", "Our analysis of IG, agency, and GAO reports has shown that agencies have  not always effectively implemented controls to allow only authorized  individuals to read, alter, or delete data. Twenty-three of 24 major agencies  had access control weaknesses. We identified weaknesses in controls such  as user accounts, passwords, and access rights. For example, users created  passwords that were common words. Using such words as passwords  increases the possibility that an attacker could guess the password and  gain access to the account. Also, agencies did not always deactivate unused  accounts to prevent them from being exploited by malicious users. In  addition, agencies have weaknesses in the controls that prevent  unauthorized access to their networks. For example, at one agency, we  found an excessive number of connections to the Internet. Each such  connection could provide a path for an attacker into the agency\u2019s network.  Agencies often lacked effective physical barriers to access, including  locked doors, visitor screening, and effective use of access cards.  Inadequate access controls diminish the reliability of computerized data  and increase the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, and use.

Failure to implement these controls increases the risk that  unauthorized programs or changes could be, inadvertently or deliberately,  placed into operation.", "Our analysis revealed that 22 of the major agencies had weaknesses in  software change controls. Weaknesses in this area included the failure to  ensure that software was updated correctly and that changes to computer  systems were properly approved.

Proper segregation of duties is achieved by dividing  responsibilities among two or more individuals or organizational groups.  Dividing duties among individuals or groups diminishes the likelihood that  errors and wrongful acts will go undetected because the activities of one  individual or group will serve as a check on the activities of the other.  Without adequate segregation of duties, there is an increased risk that  erroneous or fraudulent transactions can be processed, improper program  changes implemented, and computer resources damaged or destroyed.", "Fourteen agencies had weaknesses regarding segregation of information  technology duties. Agencies did not always segregate duties for system  administration from duties relating to security administration.

Twenty of the 24 major agencies had weaknesses in this area. In our April  2005 report on federal continuity of operations plans, we determined that  agencies had not developed plans that addressed all the necessary  elements. For example, fewer than half the plans reviewed contained  adequate contact information for emergency communications. Few plans  documented the location of all vital records for the agencies, or methods of  updating those records in an emergency. Further, most of the agencies had  not conducted tests, training, or exercises frequently enough to have  assurance that the plan would work in an emergency.

In addition, agencies do  not report the risk level of the systems on which the weaknesses are found.  Valuable information may be provided to oversight bodies by posing  additional questions on the remediation process.", "The annual reporting process also does not include separate reporting on  certain FISMA requirements. For example, in the 2004 guidance, OMB  eliminated separate reporting on risk assessments and security plans.  Because the guidance on the certification and accreditation process  required both risk assessments and security plans, OMB did not require  agencies to answer separate questions in these areas.

Therefore, a negative answer to this  question could mean either that the agency and the IG were not using the  plan, or that one of them was not using the plan. As a result, it may  erroneously appear that agencies were not using the plans as the major  management tool for remediation of identified weaknesses as required by  OMB.", "Another example of differing interpretations was one of the inventory  questions. It asked if the IG and agency agreed on the number of programs,  systems, and contractor operations in the inventory. Since the question  could be interpreted two ways, the meaning of the response was unclear.  For example, if an IG replied in the negative, it could mean that while the  IG agreed with the total numbers in the inventory, it disagreed with how the  agency identified whether the inventory entry was a program, system, or  contractor operations. Alternatively, a negative response could mean that  the IG disagreed with the overall accuracy of the inventory.

We acknowledge OMB\u2019s efforts to help ensure better clarity but believe  more needs to be done. As we noted in our report, several questions  could be subject to differing interpretations. Questions in the areas of  plans of actions and milestones, inventory, configuration management,  and certification and accreditation generated confusion. As a result, the  reported data may contain erroneous information, and its reliability and  consistency may be decreased.  5. The guidance to report FISMA data by risk category was issued on June  13, 2005\u2014after our draft report was provided to OMB for comment.  Reporting by system risk could provide information about whether  agencies are appropriately prioritizing their information security  efforts.", "6.", "In this report, we do not propose solutions to agency information  security weaknesses. Rather, we reported that pervasive weaknesses in  federal agencies\u2019 information security policies and practices place data  at risk. This statement is supported by our prior reports and reports by  the IGs. We noted that, in those prior reports, specific  recommendations were made to the agencies to remedy identified  information security weaknesses. In this report, we recommended that  OMB enhance FISMA reporting guidance to increase the effectiveness  and reliability of annual reporting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Larry Crosland, Season Dietrich, Nancy Glover, Carol Langelier, Suzanne  Lightman, and Stephanie Lee made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Information Security: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Needs to  Sustain Progress.
