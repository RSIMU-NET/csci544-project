Under the original TARP legislation, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) had the authority to purchase or insure $700 billion in troubled assets held by financial institutions. The Secretary of the Treasury extended the authority originally provided under EESA through October 3, 2010. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act)--signed into law on July 21, 2010--set a new spending ceiling for TARP, in effect prohibiting Treasury from incurring any additional obligations for programs that had not been initiated prior to June 25, 2010. A broad range of activities have been initiated under TARP. Specific initiatives have injected capital into key financial institutions; implemented programs to address problems in the securitization markets; provided assistance to the automobile industry and American International Group, Inc. (AIG); and offered incentives for modifying residential mortgages, among other things. As TARP passes the 30-month mark, U.S. financial markets appear to be less volatile than they were in 2008. But questions about a sustained economic recovery continue, and certain areas of the economy still face significant challenges. For example, foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies continue to linger and small businesses still face tight credit conditions. As a result, TARP has been transformed into a program that focuses primarily on preserving homeownership and improving financial conditions for small financial institutions and businesses. While many other programs have ended and begun winding down operations and some participating institutions have repaid part or all of their TARP funds, the prospect of repayment from some other institutions, both large and small, remains uncertain. This statement is primarily based on our January 12, 2011, report and focuses on (1) the status of TARP programs; (2) Treasury's progress in implementing an effective management structure for TARP, including staffing the Office of Financial Stability (OFS), overseeing contractors, and establishing a comprehensive system of internal controls; and (3) trends in key relevant economic indicators."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Some TARP programs--Capital Assistance Program, Asset Guarantee Program, and Targeted Investment Program--have been terminated. Others, like the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), have closed and are winding down operations, and several programs that focus on preserving homeownership and that have provided assistance to auto companies and AIG remain active. (1) CPP, which closed in December 2009, had $30.8 billion outstanding as of March 9, 2011, and had received about $171 billion in full and partial repayments from CPP participants. However, Treasury faces various oversight and management challenges in addressing missed dividend and interest payments and monitoring repayment requests. (2) Funding of TALF loans by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) closed in June 2010, and no TARP funds had been expended as of March 9, 2011, to purchase collateral from FRBNY because no collateral had been surrendered to TALF LLC. TALF will continue to pose potential risks to Treasury until all loans are repaid to FRBNY and the program is terminated. (3) While the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) remains Treasury's primary program to assist homeowners facing foreclosure, the program had a slow start and has not performed as anticipated. Treasury announced several new programs in 2010. As of March 9, 2011, $1.2 billion, none of it recoverable, had been disbursed for TARP housing programs. Our most recent work shows there is more Treasury can do to better ensure the effective implementation of this program. (4) The Automotive Industry Financing Program (AIFP) had an outstanding balance of just more than $44.2 billion as of March 9, 2011. At that time, approximately $29.5 billion had been repaid, but Treasury still owned 33.3 percent equity in General Motors (GM), 9.2 percent in Chrysler, and 73.8 percent in Ally. While the auto companies' financial conditions have shown signs of improvement, their ability to fully repay the AIFP debt and equity investments depends on a variety of factors, which will require Treasury's ongoing oversight. (5) AIG has continued to receive assistance over the last year provided largely rests with the return that Treasury earns when it sells its common stock in AIG. (6) The Public-Private Investment Program (PPIP) continues to be an active program with $15.9 billion disbursed as of March 9, 2011, and $15.2 billion outstanding. Of this investment, Treasury had seen unrealized capital gains of approximately $750 million. Treasury still holds oversight responsibility for the fund managers until the fund no longer holds assets. (7) The Community Development Capital Initiative (CDCI) and the SBA 7(a) Securities Purchase Program are small business programs that account for a small portion of TARP funding. CDCI closed in September 2010, and as of March 9, 2011, Treasury had provided about $570 million to 84 CDFIs, 28 of which had already participated in CPP. SBA 7(a) Securities Purchase Program closed in September 2010, and as of March 9, 2011, Treasury had made 31 purchases of SBA 7(a) securities totaling about $370 million."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Troubled Asset  Relief Program (TARP), which Congress established on October 3, 2008, in  response to the financial crisis that threatened the stability of the U.S.  financial system and the solvency of many financial institutions.

Treasury provided capital to qualifying financial institutions  from October 2008 to December 2009 by purchasing preferred shares or  subordinated debentures. In return for its investment, Treasury received  preferred stock or debentures, which provided for dividend payments (if  declared by the issuer) or interest payments, as well as warrants. As table  1 shows, through March 9, 2011, Treasury had received about $171 billion  in full and partial repayments. However, Treasury continues to face  challenges in managing its remaining investments. For example, a growing  number of CPP participants have missed scheduled dividend or interest  payments. As of February 28, 2011, 189 institutions had not made at least  one scheduled dividend or interest payment by the end of the reporting  month in which the payments were due, for a total of 697 missed  payments. Over the past 2 years, the number of CPP institutions missing  dividend or interest payments by quarter has increased steadily from 8 in  February 2009 to 152 in February 2011, or about 27 percent of existing  CPP participants. Although the number of CPP institutions missing  dividend payments is large and increasing, they represent a small share of  the total dollar amount of original CPP investments. Generally, if an  institution has not paid in full a total of six dividend or interest payments,  Treasury has the right to elect two members to the institution\u2019s board of  directors. As of February 28, 2011, 32 institutions had at least six missed  payments that remained unpaid, and Treasury had not yet exercised its  right to nominate directors for these institutions. However, 31 CPP  institutions that have missed at least five payments have agreed to have  Treasury observers attend meetings of their boards of directors. As more  institutions miss scheduled dividend payments, Treasury faces a  significant challenge of determining the extent to which it will exercise its  right to nominate board members. In August 2010, Treasury began  addressing this challenge by publicly releasing information on its policies  and procedures for nominating board members to these institutions. These  plans include using OFS staff to observe board meetings of institutions  missing at least five dividend or interest payments and using a variety of  considerations\u2014such as an institution\u2019s financial condition and function  of its board of directors\u2014to decide whether to nominate a board member.", "In addition, in order to protect its interests in CPP investments and  promote financial stability, Treasury has conducted a limited, but growing,  number of exchanges and dispositions. Over the last 2 years, Treasury has  restructured the assistance provided to 16 CPP participants by swapping  its preferred stock for other forms of equity securities or selling the  preferred stock to new investors involved in a merger or capital  restructuring with a CPP institution. OFS finalized policies and procedures  governing exchanges and dispositions of TARP securities, including CPP  investments, in October 2009. OFS stated that it would consider various  factors when assessing an institution\u2019s proposal for an asset exchange,  including the impact on the institution\u2019s capital, the possible impact on  Treasury\u2019s position relative to holders of similar securities, the U.S.  government\u2019s overall economic position, and whether any premiums paid  over market prices are reasonable and consistent with similar transactions  in the marketplace.", "Through February 2011, Treasury had received about $171 billion in full  and partial repayments from 146 institutions, including 28 institutions that  exchanged $363 million of their CPP investments for investments under  Treasury\u2019s CDCI program. However, questions about the health of smaller  banks continue, and small institutions participating in CPP may face  challenges in fulfilling the terms needed to exit the program. According to  Treasury data, 75 percent of the total dollar amount of CPP investments in  institutions under $10 billion in assets remains outstanding compared to  only 10 percent for investments in institutions over $10 billion. Our recent  report on CPP identified weaknesses in Treasury\u2019s monitoring of  regulators\u2019 decisions to approve or deny requests to repay CPP  investments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  included provisions modifying the terms of CPP repayments to require that  Treasury allow any institution to repay its CPP investment subject only to  consultation with the appropriate federal bank regulator. Treasury  officials indicated that, as a result of these changes, they had not provided  guidance or criteria to regulators on deciding when to allow institutions to  repay CPP investments and had not collected information on the reasons  for these decisions. However, according to Treasury, it helped facilitate  meetings among the regulators in the spring of 2009 at which they  discussed standards for permitting TARP recipients to repay.", "Bank regulatory officials said they used existing supervisory procedures  that were generally applicable to capital reductions as a basis for  reviewing CPP repurchase requests. In our recent report, we found that  while the decision ultimately lies with the regulators, without collecting  information on or monitoring regulators\u2019 decisions, Treasury had no basis  for determining whether decisions involving similar institutions were  being made consistently and, thus, whether CPP participants were being  treated equitably. Further, absent information on why regulators made  repayment decisions, Treasury cannot provide feedback to regulators.  Accordingly, we recommended that Treasury periodically collect and  review certain information from bank regulators on the analysis and  conclusions supporting their decisions on CPP repayment requests and  provide feedback for the regulators\u2019 consideration on the extent to which  regulators are evaluating similar institutions consistently. In its response,  Treasury stated that it would consider ways to address the objectives of  our recommendations while also noting the constraints presented by the  law and principles of regulatory independence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "About Half of the TALF Loans Have Been Repaid, but Continued Monitoring is Important", "paragraphs": ["TALF provided loans to private investors to purchase asset-backed  securities (ABS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) to  encourage the issuance of new securitizations and provide liquidity for  new consumer and business loans.

TALF made about $71 billion in loans  from March 2009 through June 2010, with most of them secured by credit  card ABS, auto loan ABS, legacy CMBS, and student loan ABS. According  to the Federal Reserve, more than half of these loans have been repaid.  Moreover, Treasury has not had to disburse any TARP funds to cover  losses from unpaid loans.

In return for its  assistance to Chrysler and GM, Treasury received 9.85 percent equity in  the reorganized Chrysler, 60.8 percent equity and $2.1 billion in preferred  stock in the reorganized GM, and $13.8 billion in debt obligations between  the two companies.

One  sign of progress is that vehicle sales increased substantially for both  companies in January and February of 2011 compared to the prior year (23  percent and 49 percent for GM; 23 percent and 13 percent for Chrysler). In  addition, in 2010 both companies released financial statements that,  according to Treasury officials, exceeded Treasury\u2019s projections for  revenues, operating earnings, and cash flows. Also, GM held an IPO in late  2010 and Chrysler expects to hold an IPO in 2011. Nevertheless, while  GM\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s financial conditions have improved, each faces  challenges that could affect their financial future. For example, although  sales are improving, volumes are highly dependent on economic and  market conditions\u2014such as unemployment levels, consumer confidence,  and credit availability\u2014that currently remain fragile. Similarly, high fuel  prices could negatively impact sales of the companies\u2019 most profitable  vehicles such as pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Furthermore, the  companies\u2019 U.S. pension plans are underfunded, and they will face large  future payments to their pension plans to make up this underfunding.", "Ally Financial, a bank holding company, has also shown signs of an  improved financial condition, posting $1.1 billion in profit in 2010, but the  government\u2019s ability to recoup its investment in Ally relies on the health of  the auto industry, as well as the company\u2019s ability to compete with other  credit providers. Ally Financial\u2019s chief executive officer noted that the  recent conversion of $5.5 billion of Treasury\u2019s shares to common equity  should help the company in its efforts to conform its capital structure to  that more typical of a bank holding company. Treasury also reported the  conversion may improve Ally\u2019s ability to raise debt financing. Regardless,  Ally Financial could face increased competition for its business in the  future, including potentially from GM, which acquired Americredit, an  auto finance company. Treasury officials noted they are confident Ally  Financial will hold an IPO and expected that it would likely take Treasury  a year or 2 to sell all of its shares.", "In our ongoing monitoring of AIFP, we have made several  recommendations to help Treasury monitor and assess its investment in  the auto companies, and we are working with Treasury to help ensure  their implementation. We are continuing to monitor the financial  condition of the industry, and are reviewing the current financial condition  and outlook of GM and Chrysler in ongoing work.

Since Treasury  first announced the framework for its Making Home Affordable (MHA)  program over 2 years ago, the number of homeowners facing potential  foreclosure has remained at historically high levels. The Home Affordable  Modification Program (HAMP), the key component under MHA, seeks to  help eligible homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing their monthly  mortgage payments to more affordable levels\u2014specifically to 31 percent  of the homeowner\u2019s income. As of December 31, 2010, there were a total of  143 active MHA servicers.

For example,  in July 2009 we noted that while Treasury required borrowers with high  levels of total debt to agree to obtain counseling before receiving a HAMP  modification, it was not monitoring whether these borrowers, in fact,  received counseling. In addition, we noted that Treasury had yet to  establish a comprehensive system of internal control for HAMP, including  metrics and benchmarks for servicers\u2019 performance. Three out of the six  recommendations we made in July 2009 have yet to be fully implemented  and, as such, remain open.", "In June 2010, we reported on several inconsistencies in the way servicers  treated borrowers under HAMP that could lead to inequitable treatment of  similarly situated borrowers. These inconsistencies involved how servicers  solicited borrowers for the program, how they evaluated borrowers who  were not yet 60-days delinquent on their mortgage payments, and how  they handled borrower complaints. In addition, we noted that while  Treasury had taken some steps to ensure servicer compliance with  program requirements, it had not yet finalized consequences for servicer  noncompliance. We made eight recommendations to improve the  transparency and accountability of HAMP in June 2010. Treasury stated  that it intended to implement some of the recommendations, but little  action has been taken to date.", "In addition to the HAMP first-lien modification program, Treasury has  begun implementing several other TARP-funded programs for struggling  homeowners under the MHA program, including the Second-Lien  Modification Program (2MP), the Principal Reduction Alternatives (PRA)  program for borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than the value  of their homes, and the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA)  program for those who are not successful in HAMP modifications. As  noted in the report we are issuing today, the implementation of 2MP,  HAFA, and PRA has been slow and limited activity has been reported to  date (see table 2). This slow pace is attributed in part to several  implementation challenges. For example, servicers told us that the start of  2MP had been slow due to problems with the database Treasury required  them to use to identify potentially eligible loans. Additionally, borrowers  may not be aware of their potential eligibility for the program. While  Treasury recently revised its guidelines to allow servicers to bypass the  database for certain loans, servicers could do more to alert HAMP first-lien  modification borrowers about the new second-lien program.  Implementation of the foreclosure alternatives program has also been  slow due to program restrictions, such as the requirement that borrowers  be evaluated for a first-lien modification even if they have already  identified a potential buyer for a short sale. Although Treasury has  recently taken action to address some of these concerns, the potential  effects of its changes remain unclear.", "Our most recent work shows there is more Treasury can do to ensure the  effective implementation of these programs, including ensuring that  servicers have sufficient capacity to implement them and that borrowers  are notified about potential eligibility for second-lien modifications. We  also believe it will be important for Treasury to have clear and accurate  information on the dispositions of borrowers who are denied or fall out  from HAMP modifications. Without accurate reporting of borrower  outcomes, Treasury cannot know the actual extent to which borrowers  who are denied, canceled, or redefaulted from HAMP are helped by other  programs or evaluate the need for further action to assist this group of  homeowners.

The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 created a $30  billion bank capital support program encouraging small and midsize banks  to lend to small businesses and contains metrics for measuring increases  in small business lending.

Over the past 2 years, the number of OFS employees has  increased steadily with the number of employees increasing and the  number of detailees decreasing. In addition, Treasury has filled key  leadership positions in OFS, including the position of Chief of the  Homeownership Preservation Office. However, this stability is uncertain  as OFS faces new challenges. For example, the Assistant Secretary of  Financial Stability resigned in September 2010 and this key leadership  position is temporarily filled.", "With more than 200 employees, staffing at OFS remains important. As we  have seen, some programs are still being implemented and others, while  having been closed or terminated, have assets that must be managed,  repaid, and divested. More than half of OFS\u2019s employees, including key  leaders, are term appointments (many with 4-year term limits). OFS has  begun to take steps that will help to retain staff. OFS is also addressing  succession planning for critical senior positions, and in response to our  recommendation in the January 2011 report is finalizing its Human Capital  Strategic Plan.

Treasury has  used two mechanisms for engaging private-sector firms. First, Treasury  has exercised its statutory authority to retain 15 financial agents  (depository and related financial institutions designated to perform  assigned functions on its behalf). Second, Treasury has entered into  contract and blanket purchase agreements under the Federal Acquisition  Regulation for a variety of legal, investment consulting, accounting, and  other services and supplies. According to Treasury\u2019s data, as of September  30, 2010, Treasury had 81 contracts and blanket purchase agreements, up  from 39 from the previous year. In total, Treasury had 96 financial agency  agreements and contractual arrangements with a total potential value of  almost $841 million, as of September 30, 2010.", "When Treasury set up OFS in 2008 and quickly began to implement  numerous TARP initiatives, OFS lacked complete procurement procedures  and internal controls to oversee its growing number of contractors and  financial agents, as well as a comprehensive compliance system to  monitor and fully address vendor-related conflicts of interest. We made a  series of recommendations between December 2008 and June 2009 that  were intended to strengthen Treasury\u2019s management and oversight of its  vendors and improve the transparency of contracted operations. One year  after implementation, OFS had put in place an appropriate infrastructure  to manage and monitor its network of financial agents and contractors, as  well as a system to oversee conflicts of interest that may arise with  financial agents or contractors seeking or performing work under TARP.

OFS\u2019s Office of Internal  Review has a key role in helping to ensure such compliance. Treasury also  relies on financial agents to perform additional oversight responsibilities.  Although Treasury has generally developed an overall system of internal  control for compliance with program requirements, we have identified  areas in which certain controls for specific programs, such as HAMP,  could be improved. In particular, Treasury has not fully implemented our  recommendation to develop a comprehensive system of internal control  for HAMP, including developing benchmarks or goals for specific HAMP  performance measures such as conversion and redefault rates. We will  continue to monitor Treasury\u2019s actions to address identified deficiencies.", "In addition, our 2010 financial audit report concluded that although certain  internal controls could be improved, OFS maintained, in all material  respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of  September 30, 2010. These controls provided reasonable assurance that  misstatements, losses, or noncompliance material in relation to the  financial statements would be prevented or detected and corrected on a  timely basis.

Since the passage of EESA,  indicators generally suggest that credit markets have improved and while  the effectiveness of the TARP programs have varied, some have reportedly  had the desired effects, especially if stabilizing the financial system and  restoring confidence was considered to be the principal goal of the  intervention. However, the strength of the economic recovery remains  uncertain, and the ultimate impact of the interventions on the real  economy remains to be seen.", "While movements in most of these indicators during the second year of  TARP are likely more reflective of other non-TARP market developments,  some metrics we have monitored for programs with later start dates  (PPIP, HAMP, and to a lesser extent TALF) show some improvements. For  example, PPIP indicators show substantial improvement and TALF  indicators continue to improve. However, indicators for MHA continue to  highlight the challenges in the area of residential housing. Finally, our  indicators suggest that credit markets have largely held the gains achieved  since October 2008, despite the unwinding of TARP programs, the early  termination of TARP\u2019s authority, the general exit from other government  interventions, and the turmoil in Europe. Over time, analysis of the exits  from remaining TARP programs will provide a more complete assessment  of the resilience of the financial system.", "Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the  opportunity to discuss these critically important issues and would be  happy to answer any questions that you may have.
