Congress' passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in 1999, NAIC's Producer Licensing Model Act (PLMA) of 2000, and uniform licensing standards (2002) have helped improve reciprocity and uniformity. However, NAIC officials noted that as of March 2009, only 17 states were performing full criminal history checks using fingerprinting, and some states that do such checks have been unwilling to reciprocate with states that do not. In addition, some insurance regulators in our sample noted that regulators do not have a systematic way to access disciplinary records of other financial regulators. Without full checks on applicants, states may less effectively protect consumers. Licensing standards, including how state regulators define lines of insurance, also vary across states, further hindering efforts to create reciprocity in agent licensing. These differences may result in inefficiencies that raise costs for insurers and consumers. State regulators' processes to approve insurance products have become more efficient, but barriers exist to greater reciprocity and uniformity. NAIC and state regulators have improved product approval filings by creating the System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF) in 1998, which, according to some industry participants, has simplified filings and reduced filing errors. However, SERFF does not address differences in regulators' review and approval processes. In addition, an Interstate Compact was created in 2006 to facilitate approval of certain life, annuity, disability income, and long-term care products, which are accepted across participating states. As of March 2009, 34 states participated in the Compact. However, the Compact leaves some decisions on approval up to the individual states, and several key states have not joined because they feel their processes and protections are superior to the Compact's. Moreover, differences in state laws are likely to limit reciprocity in the approval of property/casualty insurance products. To the extent these areas lack reciprocity and uniformity, some industry participants noted that there may be inefficiencies that slow the introduction of new products and raise costs for insurers and consumers. NAIC and the states have taken steps to improve reciprocity and uniformity of market conduct regulation, but variation across states has limited progress. For example, NAIC noted that in 2006 it developed uniform guidance, and in 2008 created core competency standards, which are intended to be part of an accreditation process for market conduct regulation. NAIC noted that the accreditation plan has not been finalized, and the standards do not include adherence to all NAIC market conduct guidance. In addition, NAIC in 2002 developed the Market Conduct Annual Statement (MCAS) to promote uniform data collection and better target exams. However, industry participants have several concerns about the MCAS and NAIC noted that fewer than half of insurance regulators use it for data collection. NAIC has also created a working group to coordinate enforcement actions. While better communication and coordination appears to have resulted, according to some states in our sample, the effect on uniformity of market conduct regulation is uncertain. Lack of uniformity and reciprocity may lead to inefficiencies, higher insurance costs, and uneven consumer protection across states."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A smoothly functioning insurance market that helps businesses and  consumers manage their risks is a vital part of the U.S. economy.  According to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners  (NAIC), at the end of 2008, insurance industry premium volume totaled  approximately $1.6 trillion in the 50 states and in the territories. Though  state insurance regulation involves a number of critical functions,  including oversight of insurers\u2019 financial solvency, some Members of  Congress and industry participants are concerned about limitations to  reciprocity and uniformity, higher insurance costs, regulatory inefficiency,  and uneven consumer protection. Reciprocity is the extent to which state  regulators accept other states\u2019 regulatory actions, such as granting  insurance licenses or approving products for sale in the insurance market,  and do not require insurers to meet additional requirements in order to  conduct insurance business in their state. Uniformity is the extent to  which states have implemented either the same, or substantially similar,  regulatory standards and procedures. Though state insurance regulation  involves a number of critical functions, including oversight of insurers\u2019  financial solvency, many of the questions about the extent of reciprocity  and uniformity of regulation across states have involved the areas of  licensing insurance agents (producer licensing), approving insurance  products, and regulating insurers\u2019 conduct in the insurance market  (market conduct).", "Questions concerning reciprocity and uniformity of state-based insurance  regulation have persisted for a number of years. In 1999, Congress passed  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which encouraged states to enact  uniform laws and regulations for licensing insurers or reciprocity among  states when licensing insurers that operate across state lines. In response  to the act, NAIC developed a model law to streamline and standardize  producer licensing requirements and help states become more reciprocal.  In addition, over the past 10 years we have made a number of  recommendations in reports, listed in related GAO products, designed to  help state regulators implement a consistent set of insurance regulations.  Congress has also periodically considered the extent of insurance  regulatory progress and the role the federal government should play, if  any, in regulating insurance. For example, the National Insurance Act of  2007 would have established a national office of insurance, provided for  optional federal insurance charters, and proposed creation of a  comprehensive system of federal oversight. In 2008, Congress considered  establishing the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers  (NARAB) to ease multistate licensing processes by setting uniform  licensing standards across states. However, neither of these proposals  became law. Additional questions about oversight of the insurance  industry arose in 2008 when one of our nation\u2019s largest insurers, American  International Group, Inc. (AIG), experienced financial difficulties.  Securities lending activities undertaken by AIG\u2019s domestic life insurance  subsidiaries placed pressure on the AIG parent company\u2019s liquidity, and in  November 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York authorized $22.5  billion for a credit facility to purchase residential mortgage-backed  securities from AIG that were part of the securities lending program.", "In considering options to best ensure efficient and effective state-based  regulation of insurance, Congress has had a number of questions about the  success of recent efforts and the challenges that remain. To help  policymakers better address these questions, as requested this report  examines three key areas of the insurance industry: (1) producer licensing,  (2) product approval, and (3) market conduct regulation. In each area we  assess the progress NAIC and state regulators have made to increase  reciprocity and uniformity, the factors that have challenged efforts to  achieve greater reciprocity and uniformity, and the potential impact on the  insurance industry and consumers if greater progress is not made.", "To assess insurance regulatory progress, challenges, and impacts, we  compared insurance regulatory goals set forth in federal legislation, NAIC  model acts and regulatory planning documents, and GAO reports.  Specifically, we reviewed the insurance provisions of GLBA and NAIC\u2019s  Producer Licensing Model Act (PLMA). We assessed regulatory documents  such as NAIC\u2019s 2003 Insurance Regulatory Modernization Action Plan  (Modernization Plan) and producer licensing, product approval, and  market conduct regulation guidelines. We also interviewed insurance  officials from a sample of nine state insurance departments, four  insurance companies, five insurance associations, and three consumer  advocacy organizations regarding reciprocity and uniformity progress and  challenges. We selected these states based on diversity of premium  volume size and geography. To assess regulatory progress and challenges,  we relied on descriptions and other documentation provided by NAIC,  states, insurers and associations, and consumer advocates.", "We conducted this performance audit between February 2008 and April  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

These entities meet periodically to discuss  issues, build consensus on reforms, and vote to adopt new standards,  model laws, and model regulations. These processes are cooperative but  often take months or years to complete because of the number of  participants and diversity of priorities involved. In addition to these  functions, NAIC also developed and implemented a financial accreditation  program in 1990 to periodically review state insurance departments for  baseline financial solvency oversight standards.

The Modernization Plan specifically called for implementation of a single,  uniform license application and full implementation of an electronic  fingerprint system as part of the licensing process. For product approval,  NAIC and state regulators planned to fully implement and use SERFF for  product filings. They also planned to develop an interstate compact to  provide a central point of filing for certain life and annuity products that  would be accepted across states and would feature uniform national  product standards.

Following passage of the act, NAIC and state  regulators worked to develop the PLMA and various NAIC and state  licensing standards. According to NAIC, since GLBA, most states have  passed and implemented the PLMA, which set licensing standards for  states to follow in order to meet reciprocity and uniformity requirements.  However, the small number of states performing full producer background  checks with fingerprinting remains a barrier to greater reciprocity and  uniformity. States that perform the checks may be unwilling to reciprocate  with those that do not for fear of compromising their consumer protection  laws.

Following passage of  the act, NAIC and states elected to pursue the reciprocity option, with  uniformity as a longer-term goal for producer licensing.", "To help states meet GLBA\u2019s reciprocity requirements, NAIC developed  PLMA to help address differences among states in the areas of defining  insurance products and lines, agent licensing standards, and variations in  state licensing applications. The act was intended to streamline and  standardize producer licensing requirements across states and improve the  efficiency of insurance licensing processes. To respond to state  differences in defining types or lines of insurance and general inefficiency  in licensing processes, PLMA sought reciprocity and uniformity by  specifying standard definitions for six major types or lines of insurance for  use across states. The act also provided for reciprocal recognition across  states of continuing education requirements for producers, another area in  which state requirements had previously varied.", "In addition, in 2002 NAIC developed the Uniform Resident Licensing  Standards (URLS) to help states implement the reciprocity requirements  of GLBA and PLMA. The URLS address some items that, according to  NAIC officials, were not included in PLMA, such as definitions for limited  lines of insurance.

NAIC also developed the Uniform Application for Individual  Insurance Producer License, which created a standardized application  form that state regulators could use for insurance licenses. Use of the form  helps ensure that regulators would have a single producer license  application for use across states rather than multiple forms and  documentation for individual states. In reports in 2002 and 2004 on  insurance regulation, we noted that despite efforts made by NAIC and  state regulators to implement GLBA and PLMA and create more uniform  standards and processes, remaining differences among the states may limit  full reciprocity and uniformity. For example, we previously found that  some states are not willing to lower producer licensing standards\u2014such as  eliminating criminal background checks using fingerprint identification\u2014 to allow for uniform or reciprocal licensing, and few states have the ability  to access nationwide criminal history data necessary for full background  checks on applicants.

The plan  essentially incorporated the goals of the PLMA, the URLS, and the  Uniform Application. The plan also specifically sought to promote  producer licensing uniformity and reciprocity by calling for background  checks on insurance license applicants using electronic fingerprinting. Not  only would such checks provide uniform background reviews across  states, but they were intended to help state regulators ensure consistently  high levels of consumer protection. To achieve greater use of criminal  background checks with fingerprinting, the Modernization Plan also called  for efforts by NAIC and state insurance regulators to recognize the  important role of federal and state legislatures to pass legislation that  would provide state insurance regulators the appropriate statutory  authority necessary for conducting such checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAIC and States Have Made Progress on Regulatory Modernization Goals for Producer Licensing", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2009, NAIC has certified 47 states and jurisdictions as  reciprocal based on their adoption and implementation of PLMA, which is  integral to achieving the reciprocity and uniformity envisioned by the  Modernization Plan.

Regulatory history checks by insurance regulators consist of  efforts to determine whether insurance applicants have a history of  consumer complaints or regulatory enforcement actions. Accessing this  history may be difficult because banking, securities, and insurance  regulators maintain regulatory background information in separate  information technology systems. Some insurance regulators noted that no  systematic query function or mechanism exists that would enable  insurance and other regulators to check enforcement and complaint  information in these separate systems in order to review information from  across the three financial services sectors.

In some  states, definitions of insurance lines and the number of insurance lines  vary.

Second, state regulators  and their staffs may have varying levels of resources and expertise and  their own informal ways of conducting reviews that create different  approaches among states. Some states and one insurer in our sample  reported that these differences might work against product approval  reciprocity and uniformity. Specifically, the groups suggested that these  individual state approaches, or \u201cdesk drawer\u201d practices, may be inefficient  because they represent fragmented ways of reviewing the same or very  similar products. Some industry participants reported that the effect of  desk drawer practices increases the time it takes insurers to get their  products approved for sale, raising costs for consumers.

According  to NAIC and the Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission  (IIPRC), NAIC and state regulators created the framework for the  Compact in 2000 and developed a working group for the Compact and an  Interstate Insurance Compact Model Law in 2002. The Compact was  formally created when the first two states, Colorado and Utah, enacted  legislation required at the state level to allow each state to join the  Compact. NAIC noted that the IIPRC, an organization that manages the  operations of the Compact, was established in May 2006, and in December  2006 the IIPRC adopted its first uniform product standards. It operates as  a multistate public entity and serves as a single point for filing, review, and  approval of life insurance, annuity, disability income, and long-term care  insurance products. Once approved by the IIPRC, products may be sold in  all member states. The Compact was developed to make processes for  filing, reviewing, and approving certain insurance products more efficient  and effective, and it aimed to promote uniformity through national product  standards and processes. According to NAIC, as of March 2009, Compact  membership consisted of 34 states and insurance jurisdictions (fig. 3).", "The IIPRC started receiving and reviewing product filings in 2007, and as  of March 2009, NAIC reported that the number of filings made through the  compact was relatively small but growing, with a mix of large and small  states participating.", "While the Compact has provided more centralized and streamlined  processes, several key states have not joined. In particular, key regulatory  states like New York, Florida, and California have not joined. According to  some industry participants, states that have not joined the Compact  generally feel there might be a loss of consumer rights and remedies with  Compact-approved products. In addition, some industry participants noted  that states that have not joined the Compact may feel their current product  approval and consumer protection processes are superior to the  Compact\u2019s processes. Some industry participants, however, say that  without fuller participation by states, full reciprocity and uniformity, even  for the limited number of insurance lines covered by the Compact, will be  difficult to achieve. Some states in our sample have formed their own  alternative for product approval. Officials from the states of California and  Texas noted that several states and jurisdictions, including California,  Florida, Texas, and the District of Columbia, formed the Multi-State  Review Program, which expedites product approval for annuity products  using standards agreed upon by the program\u2019s participants. However, a  system comprised of compacting states, non-compacting states, and states  forming their own approval arrangements has raised some concerns that  multiple product approval systems may work against uniformity.", "Other issues with the Compact may also limit reciprocity and uniformity.  According to some industry participants, some Compact processes allow  states to make their own decisions regarding the nature of the products  being approved. For example, under the Compact, states can decide  whether they will allow fraud exceptions to life insurance policy  incontestability clauses, or provisions in life insurance policies that  generally limit insurers to a period of 2 years to determine whether  policyholders misrepresented their health status and information. These  clauses generally protect insurers against misinformation that might be  provided by policyholders and consumers against insurers that might deny  policyholders coverage despite collecting years of premium payments.  According to some industry participants, uniformity will be difficult to  achieve if states have the ability to make individualized decisions that do  not apply across multiple states.", "Further, two consumer groups expressed concern that the commission  lacks transparency and accountability. First, these groups pointed out that  product filings to the commission are not public, in contrast with some  states that require publicly available insurance product filings. With the  commission, product information does not become public until or unless  products are approved. As a result, consumer groups suggested that they  and others do not have an opportunity to review filings and help ensure  that harmful products do not get approved for market. However, one state  and one insurer offered a number of reasons for not having public filings,  including (1) protection of insurers\u2019 proprietary information, (2) potential  misuse of competitors\u2019 information in marketing or lawsuits, and (3) the  possibility that consumers will not understand the information or might be  misled by it. For example, one insurer noted that product filings can be  complicated and are written for regulatory review rather than to inform  consumers. However, consumer groups suggested that without greater  review of proposed products, it would be difficult for advocates to help  protect consumers and hard for the general public to be informed buyers  of insurance products. Second, consumer groups expressed concerns that  the lack of public filings would make it much harder for consumer groups  and the public to identify how suitable potential new products might be  for consumers before they are approved. These groups noted that the  commission\u2019s standards provide uniformity for filing submission, review,  and approval, but do not address issues of consumer suitability. And third,  consumer groups questioned what recourse the commission offered  consumers in the event that an insurance product harmed the public. The  groups noted that it was unclear whether consumers could sue the  commission the same way they might sue a state if an insurance product  harmed them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full Reciprocity Is Unlikely for Approvals in Property/Casualty Insurance Lines", "paragraphs": ["According to some industry participants, while the Compact has increased  reciprocity of approvals for some life, annuity, and long-term care  insurance products, similar reciprocity is unlikely for property/casualty  insurance products.

In addition, property/casualty products must  conform to a number of relevant state laws, which often differ across  states.

Some states limit certain types of damages, such as pain and suffering,  while others do not.

The outline sought to help minimize  state variations in market conduct examinations. Among other things, the  Outline includes a list of reasons for examinations, such as:    extent of an insurer\u2019s market share,  findings from other state regulators,    a shift in business practices,    past history of noncompliance,  information collected through regulatory surveys,  length of time since the last examination, and    new laws enacted since the last examination.", "According to NAIC officials, states can use the Outline at their discretion  and self-certify with NAIC that they are using it, though NAIC does not  verify states\u2019 reporting. Self-certification allows NAIC to gauge the extent  of compliance with the Outline.", "To promote a set of strong, uniform standards for market oversight, NAIC  also developed guidance in the form of 99 core competency standards,  which it considers to be fundamental capabilities and resources that state  regulators should have in place for strong market conduct oversight. The  body of core competency standards consists of four principle elements.  First, departments of insurance should have the authority to analyze,  examine, or investigate any entity involved with insurance transactions.  Further, departments should have the staff training, resources, and types  of examiners needed for market conduct oversight. Second, departments  should have the ability to conduct market conduct data collection and  analysis and designate appropriate staff leaders responsible for an  effective market analysis program. Third, departments ought to have a  means of moving from market analysis to regulatory action by developing  a spectrum of regulatory tools that are available for use in response to  market conduct examinations, investigations, and consumer complaints.  The fourth principle element of the core competency standards aims to  promote interstate collaboration in regulatory action through participation  in NAIC working groups and databases and information sharing among  regulatory staff designated as contacts on multistate enforcement actions.", "According to NAIC officials, in addition to the Handbook and  Examination Outline, NAIC has been working since 2005 to develop an  accreditation program for market conduct regulation. NAIC developed the  financial accreditation program in 1990 to help ensure uniformity of  financial solvency regulation by the states. Its proposed market regulation  accreditation program seeks to promote a market conduct accreditation  process so that states can objectively monitor and oversee the conduct of  insurers and protect consumers. Specifically, the program outlines six  market conduct accreditation categories, based on the 99 core  competency standards:    data collection and reporting, including use by states of key NAIC  databases such as the Regulatory Information Retrieval System (RIRS),  Complaints Database, Market Analysis Review System (MARS), Market  Conduct Examination Tracking System, Special Activities Database (SAD),  and Market Initiative Tracking System (MITS);    market analysis, which includes having appropriate regulatory staff with  specific responsibility for data analysis and developing a baseline  understanding of insurance markets and issues;    market conduct examinations, including having procedural guidelines and  standards in place to determine when examinations should be called, and  which adhere to the Scheduling, Coordinating, and Communicating  chapter of the Market Regulation Handbook;  interstate collaboration, including contacts designated by commissioners  of insurance for the purpose of interstate communication and  collaborative actions;    oversight of contractors hired by insurance departments that have the  expertise and professional qualifications to perform market conduct and  analysis and examinations; and  treatment of confidential information, meaning that insurance  departments should have the authority to analyze, examine, or investigate  entities involved with the business of insurance, as well as protect  consumers, enforce a continuum of regulatory responses when needed,  and keep records and insurance information confidential.", "According to NAIC, while it encourages states to use its tools and  guidance when developing market conduct oversight programs, use of the  Market Regulation Handbook, including the Examination Outline is not  mandatory and states have discretion regarding the extent to which the  tools are implemented. Some of the state regulators in our sample noted  that they used the Handbook to the extent its provisions were consistent  with their state laws and market conduct priorities. For example, officials  from one state department of insurance told us that they had instructed  market conduct staff to use the Handbook as a foundation to develop its  current revisions to market conduct procedures, but only if the  Handbook\u2019s guidelines did not conflict with the state\u2019s statutes or  regulatory priorities.

In  addition, according to NAIC, the accreditation program\u2019s core competency  standards require state insurance regulators to follow the Scheduling,  Coordinating, and Communicating chapter of the Market Regulation  Handbook with respect to planning market conduct examinations, but not  other key market conduct guidance found in the Handbook. For example,  the market conduct accreditation program\u2019s core competency standards  do not require adherence to guidance such as how to conduct  property/casualty, life and annuity, health, and multi-state examinations.

To  improve data collection, NAIC developed the Market Conduct Annual  Statement (MCAS), which began first as a pilot project in 2002 and became  permanent in 2004. MCAS is a data collection instrument designed to help  state insurance regulators better understand insurers\u2019 conduct in the  marketplace, identify problem areas, and use information to target market  conduct responses and examinations. The information collected includes,  for example, annual data on how long it takes insurance companies to  settle claims and the separate numbers of complaints insurers received  from state departments of insurance and directly from consumers.  Additional examples of MCAS data elements collected on different lines of  insurance can be found in appendix III. According to NAIC, once the data  are collected, state regulators use it to establish baseline measures for  targeting their market conduct efforts and prioritizing companies for  regulatory attention. State regulators may use deviation from the measures  as criteria for following up with an insurer on their conduct or undertaking  an examination.", "According to NAIC officials, as of March 2009, 29 states were collecting  data using MCAS. Other states used their own processes for tracking  market conduct and identifying issues that required regulatory attention.  For example, several state regulators reported using the information  collected through MCAS to perform baseline analysis on insurance  companies writing business in their states, identify insurer conduct that  might require their attention or an examination, or monitor individual  company and industry trends. One state regulator noted that since it had  begun participating in MCAS, its market conduct staff no longer depended  exclusively on premium volume or basic complaint activity to monitor an  insurance company\u2019s market conduct. Further, according to the regulator,  MCAS helps the department to identify potential problems and their  sources, thereby allowing department staff to target their responses rather  than perform a comprehensive review.", "According to NAIC, while MCAS provides NAIC and insurance regulators  with detailed market conduct data, greater uniformity and participation  have been limited by disagreement among insurers and consumer groups  over the types of data that MCAS collects and the extent to which the data  should be made public. According to several insurers and industry  officials, public access to MCAS is problematic because they (1) consider  MCAS data to be proprietary and fear their competitive position might be  compromised if other insurers had access to it, (2) believe MCAS data  could be misunderstood by the general public and used to make poor  insurance decisions, and (3) feel MCAS data could be misused by trial  attorneys to try to initiate class action suits against insurance companies.  However, some consumer groups mentioned that MCAS data would better  serve consumers if it contained more detailed insurer information than the  summary level data currently collected. In their view, more detailed data  would help consumers better compare insurance companies and their  products and would help regulators better protect consumers by using  data to identify and react to market conduct issues. These disagreements  about the data types, uses, and access have slowed consensus and  cooperation on the use of uniform data to improve market conduct and  have limited progress toward strong, uniform oversight.", "While the data access issues had not been resolved as of March 2009, NAIC  officials noted that they will begin aggregating market conduct data in  2009 for eventual use by participating states during their oversight  activities. NAIC also plans to continually refine data collection,  aggregation, and analysis processes, and it plans to work with states and  the insurance industry on existing and future MCAS concerns. In addition,  some industry participants in our sample noted that it was difficult to  achieve greater market conduct uniformity when not all states participate  in standardized improvement efforts like the MCAS. NAIC has suggested  that without greater state participation in this tool, some regulators will  have to rely more on exams, which can be costly and duplicative across  states, than on market analysis to monitor the marketplace and protect  consumers.", "In addition to MCAS, NAIC created Level 1 Analysis in 2005, which is an  automated set of questions regulators can use to help evaluate individual  companies. NAIC then built on Level 1 Analysis by developing Level 2  Analysis that offers regulators additional sources of possible information  on insurers\u2019 market conduct. Further, NAIC developed MARS in 2005,  which stores Level 1 Analysis questions and insurers\u2019 answers. The MARS  database can be accessed by states and helps regulators identify and  respond to market conduct issues by seeing analysis performed by other  states.

Some states in our sample said that through MAWG, several  multistate collaborative actions had been initiated in both market conduct  examinations and settlements.

For regulators, reciprocity and  uniformity can mean standardized processes and standards that can lead  to efficient and effective ways of working with insurers to license agents  and brokers, review and approve products for sale in the marketplace, and  protect consumers from harmful actors and products. Reciprocity for  insurers means faster, more efficient ways of introducing and gaining  approval for new insurance products and assurance that regulatory  processes will be similar across states, potentially helping insurers keep  their overall insurance product costs lower. An insurance system with  greater reciprocity and uniformity may also limit inefficiencies that could  contribute to higher product costs for insurers and consumers and may  provide for more coordinated, even consumer protection across states. To  the extent that reciprocity and uniformity are limited across states,  benefits to regulators, insurers, and consumers may also be limited.", "NAIC has made progress on reciprocity and uniformity in key areas of  producer licensing, product approval, and market conduct, but this  progress has not come quickly and in some cases has been limited.", "Efforts to achieve greater reciprocity in producer licensing began  following passage of GLBA in 1999, and as of March 2009, 47 states had  been certified as reciprocal. However, several key states, including  California, Florida, and New York, were still not considered reciprocal for  non-resident producer license applicants, and it appears that many states  still impose separate or additional requirements on resident producers. In  addition, as of March 2009, only 17 states were conducting criminal  background checks on applicants, resulting in uneven consumer  protections across states. Finally, we recommended in 2000 that NAIC and  state insurance regulators develop mechanisms for routinely obtaining  regulatory data from financial services regulators. Limited progress has  been made in this area, and we continue to believe that the development  of such a system is an important element of effective consumer protection  efforts.", "NAIC furthered efforts to improve reciprocity and uniformity in the  approval of insurance products when it implemented SERFF in 1998, a  system that has automated the process of applying for the approval of  insurance products. As of March 2009, SERFF was used in 52 states and  jurisdictions, and approximately 85 percent of all filings were achieved  through the system. NAIC and the states also advanced product approval  reciprocity and uniformity with the creation of its Modernization Plan in  2003. In addition, NAIC and the states created the Interstate Insurance  Product Regulation Commission, a single product approval entity that  approves products that are recognized among the compacting states.  Nonetheless, it appears that many states are still imposing their own  approval practices and requirements on insurers, which limit both  reciprocity and uniformity. In addition, the compact is limited to 34 states  and jurisdictions and only certain types of insurance products.", "NAIC and the states have also made efforts to improve market conduct  regulation, which were items noted in NAIC\u2019s 2003 Modernization Plan and  addressed in a 2003 GAO report. Our report recommended that NAIC and  states take steps to adopt and implement minimum standards for market  conduct oversight that would include all states. We still believe  improvements are needed to address remaining market conduct regulatory  differences among states. Such actions could include ensuring that all  appropriate guidance\u2014for example, from the Market Regulation  Handbook\u2014be included as part of the accreditation process, and ensuring  that states meet uniform minimum standards in a timely manner. NAIC and  state insurance regulators have completed some improvements, such as  revising market conduct guidance and creating a market conduct working  group that has helped increase uniformity across states. However, other  important efforts, such as the collection and use of standardized market  conduct data and implementation of the core market conduct competency  standards, were still incomplete as of March 2009. As a result, uniformity  across states may be limited, and consumer protections may vary.", "Regulators have faced, and will continue to face, a number of challenges  to increasing reciprocity and uniformity in these areas. For example,  insurance regulatory improvement may require increasing uniformity of  state laws that govern licensing requirements and product approval, which  in turn requires cooperation from state legislatures. NAIC and state  insurance regulators\u2019 work with state legislatures has occurred over a  number of years, and some regulators told us that cooperation had been  difficult to achieve in some areas. In particular, according to NAIC, despite  efforts in many more states, regulators in only 17 states have obtained  statutory authority to conduct full criminal background checks with  fingerprinting. Another challenge is the differing levels of resources and  expertise among state insurance departments, which means that some  states may have the resources and staff for certain efforts, while others  may not. Further, NAIC\u2019s operations generally require consensus among a  large number of regulators, and NAIC seeks to obtain and consider the  input of industry participants and consumer advocates. Obtaining a wide  range of views may create a more thoughtful, balanced regulatory  approach, but working through the different goals and priorities of all of  these entities can result in lengthy processes and long implementation  periods for regulatory improvements. Continued progress in a timely  manner, however, is critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness  of the insurance regulatory system.", "We also recognize that the costs and benefits of further increases in  reciprocity and uniformity must be considered. Regulators, insurers, and  consumers may not benefit if achieving uniformity occurred by simply  lowering standards across states. At the same time, it may not be feasible  to achieve reciprocity and uniformity across states by meeting the highest  standard achieved by any one state. In addition, it is not clear that full  reciprocity in some areas would be realistically achievable. For example,  as we have said, uniformity and reciprocity for the approval of  property/casualty products would require significant changes in state laws,  including a wide body of tort law. States have tailored those laws to best  protect their residents, and since many are not exclusive to insurance,  such large-scale changes may be unlikely.", "As the insurance regulatory system is part of the broader financial  regulatory system, it should support the goals that the federal government  has for the entire financial regulatory system and should be part of  discussions for potential regulatory reforms. In a recent report, we  suggested a number of goals for the U.S. financial regulatory system.  Reciprocity and uniformity within the regulation of insurance could  support at least four of these goals. First, a regulatory system where  changes can be made uniformly across states may be able to more readily  adapt to innovations and changes in the insurance market. Second, greater  reciprocity and uniformity could lead to a more efficient system for  regulators through the reduction of overlapping activities, as well as for  insurers by reducing the number of different requirements they must meet  across states. Third, greater uniformity across states could provide more  consistent protection for consumers purchasing similar products and  services. Fourth, greater uniformity could also provide more consistent  financial oversight for similar institutions, products, and services. In that  report we also noted that, given the difficulties to harmonize insurance  regulation across states, Congress could explore the advantages and  disadvantages of providing a federal charter option for insurance and  creating a federal insurance regulatory entity. The establishment of a  federal insurance charter could help alleviate some of these challenges,  but such an approach could also have unintended consequences for state  regulatory bodies and for insurance firms as well. However, any  consideration of a change to the current insurance regulatory structure,  including a possible federal insurance charter, should involve appropriate  cost-benefit analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In order to improve how state insurance regulators identify insurance  license applicants with criminal backgrounds and protect consumers,  Congress, as it explores the advantages and disadvantages of a change to  the federal role in the regulation of insurance, should explore ways to  ensure that all state insurance regulators can conduct nationwide criminal  background checks as part of their producer licensing and consumer  protection functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to NAIC and State Insurance Regulators", "paragraphs": ["To continue progress achieved through NAIC\u2019s electronic and automated  product filing processes, we also recommend that NAIC and state  regulators work with the insurance industry to further identify differences  in the ways state regulators review and approve filings received through  SERFF, and take any necessary steps, where appropriate, to improve  consistency in their product approval processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NAIC Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NAIC. The Chief Operating Officer  and Chief Legal Officer of NAIC provided written comments, which are  reprinted in appendix II. In commenting on a draft of this report, NAIC\u2019s  Chief Operating Officer and Chief Legal Officer agreed with our  recommendation. NAIC also made some general comments about the  benefits of state-based regulation.", "In the area of producer licensing, NAIC noted that while we acknowledged  that 47 states had been certified as reciprocal, we also described  reciprocity as limited. As we discuss in the report, while NAIC has made  progress in some areas, we continue to view overall progress on  uniformity and reciprocity as limited. NAIC and the states have made  progress with reciprocity, but the certification process does not include a  review of whether states are also complying with the URLS, which added  some standards that were not included in PLMA but which NAIC believed  were important for meaningful uniformity and reciprocity as noted in the  report. For example, the certification process does not require criminal  background checks. Also related to this issue, NAIC noted that one  procedural issue has been a significant impediment, FBI administrative  standards related to fingerprinting. We have added this new information to  the report. NAIC also noted a number of other efforts that they have taken  in the area of producer licensing including the State Producer Licensing  Database.", "In the product approval area, NAIC commented on a variety of issues and  provided some updated data on the Interstate Compact and activities of  Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission (IIPRC), both of  which are discussed in the report. Moreover, they noted that they have  continued to make progress in adopting uniform standards in certain  property lines and that more companies are registering. The letter also  provides NAIC\u2019s views on the flexibility and improvements afforded states  regarding product approval, an issue raised during the course of our work  and discussed in the report. NAIC also discusses the Compact approval  process and transparency. As we noted in the report, consumer groups we  spoke with expressed concern that the product approval process was not  more transparent. NAIC commented about suitability and consumer  protection issues associated with the Compact by noting that state  insurance regulators retain the authority to protect consumers and the  Compact preserves consumers\u2019 rights to pursue legal remedies not  specifically directed to the content of the product.", "Finally, with respect to market conduct regulation, NAIC highlighted its  efforts in this area and noted that it continues to pursue standardized data  collection practices, the development of a Market Regulation  Accreditation Program, and participation by all states in MCAS data  collection by 2010.", "In addition, NAIC provided technical comments on the report, which we  incorporated, as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly release its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date of issue.

To address these questions, in each of the regulatory areas of  producer licensing, product approval, and market conduct regulation, we  have been asked to assess (1) the progress NAIC and state regulators have  made to increase reciprocity and uniformity, (2) the factors that have  challenged efforts to achieve greater reciprocity and uniformity, and (3)  the potential effects on the insurance industry and consumers if greater  progress is not made.", "To assess the progress, challenges, and potential effects on the insurance  industry and consumers related to reciprocity and uniformity in producer  licensing, product approval, and market conduct, we interviewed officials  from state insurance departments, the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC), the National Conference of Insurance Legislators  (NCOIL), primary insurance companies, insurance associations, and  consumer advocacy groups. We met with insurance regulators from nine  states\u2014Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Texas,  Pennsylvania, and Ohio. We selected this sample of states due to the  states\u2019 geographic diversity and respective premium volumes, which  ranged from small to large. The four insurers we met with provided  property and casualty insurance coverage and life and health insurance to  consumers. We also met with several industry associations representing  insurance companies covering property and casualty and life and health  insurance lines across states. The consumer advocacy groups with whom  we met represented both individual state consumers and consumers  nationwide. We also reviewed congressional testimony from  knowledgeable industry participants, several of whom we interviewed for  this study. Further, we examined regulatory documents such as NAIC\u2019s  Insurance Regulatory Modernization Action Plan (Modernization Plan) and  NAIC\u2019s standards and guidelines concerning producer licensing, product  approval, and market conduct regulation. Finally, we reviewed our  previous reports and testimonies and Congressional Research Service  reviews.", "To examine the progress, challenges, and potential effects on the  insurance industry and consumers related to producer licensing  reciprocity and uniformity, we spoke with NAIC officials, NCOIL officials,  state insurance regulators, insurance companies, insurance associations,  and consumer advocacy groups. To obtain information on the producer  licensing goals that NAIC established, we reviewed NAIC\u2019s 2003  Modernization Plan and other NAIC documents. We also reviewed our  previous reports and testimonies that called for improvements to producer  licensing. To document the states that NAIC has certified as reciprocal for  producer licensing, and those states that have statutory authority to  perform criminal background checks with fingerprinting, we relied on  NAIC data.", "To examine progress in making product approval more efficient, the  barriers to further reciprocity and uniformity and the potential effects if  more progress is not made, we spoke with NAIC, NCOIL, states, industry  representatives, and consumer advocacy groups.
