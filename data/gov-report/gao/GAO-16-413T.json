In December 2009, GAO reported that NBIC was not fully equipped to carry out its mission because it lacked key resources\u2014data and personnel\u2014from its partner agencies, which may have been at least partially the result of collaboration challenges it faced. For example, some partners reported that they did not trust NBIC to use their information and resources appropriately, while others were not convinced of the value that working with NBIC provided because NBIC's mission was not clearly articulated. GAO recommended that NBIC develop a strategy for addressing barriers to collaboration and develop accountability mechanisms to monitor these efforts. DHS agreed, and in August 2012, NBIC issued the NBIC Strategic Plan, which is intended to provide NBIC's strategic vision, clarify the center's mission and purpose, and articulate the value that NBIC seeks to provide to its partners, among other things. In September 2015, GAO reported that despite NBIC's efforts to collaborate with interagency partners to create and issue a strategic plan that would clarify its mission and the various efforts to fulfill its three roles\u2014analyzer, coordinator, and innovator\u2014a variety of challenges remained when GAO surveyed NBIC's interagency partners in 2015. Notably, many of these partners continued to express uncertainty about the value NBIC provided. GAO identified options for policy or structural changes that could help NBIC better fulfill its biosurveillance integration mission, such as changes to NBIC's roles.", "Since 2012, GAO has reported that DHS has faced challenges in clearly justifying the need for the BioWatch program and its ability to reliably address that need (to detect attacks). In September 2012, GAO found that DHS approved a next-generation BioWatch acquisition in October 2009 without fully developing knowledge that would help ensure sound investment decision making and pursuit of optimal solutions. GAO recommended that before continuing the acquisition, DHS reevaluate the mission need and possible alternatives based on cost-benefit and risk information. DHS concurred and in April 2014, canceled the acquisition because an alternatives analysis did not confirm an overwhelming benefit to justify the cost. Having canceled the next generation acquisition, DHS continues to rely on the currently deployed BioWatch system for early detection of an aerosolized biological attack. However, in 2015, GAO found that DHS lacks reliable information about the current system's technical capabilities to detect a biological attack, in part because in the 12 years since BioWatch's initial deployment, DHS has not developed technical performance requirements for the system. GAO reported in September 2015 that DHS commissioned tests of the current system's technical performance characteristics, but without performance requirements, DHS cannot interpret the test results and draw conclusions about the system's ability to detect attacks. DHS is considering upgrades to the current system, but GAO recommended that DHS not pursue upgrades until it establishes technical performance requirements to meet a clearly defined operational objective and assesses the system against these performance requirements. DHS concurred and is working to address the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) biosurveillance efforts. Biosurveillance, as  defined by the July 2012 National Strategy for Biosurveillance, is the  ongoing process of gathering, integrating, interpreting, and  communicating essential information related to all-hazards threats or  disease activity affecting human, animal, or plant health, for the purpose  of (1) achieving early detection and warning, (2) contributing to overall  situational awareness of the health aspects of the incident, and (3)  enabling better decision making at all levels.", "Threats of bioterrorism, such as anthrax attacks, and high-profile disease  outbreaks, such as Ebola in West Africa and emerging arboviruses like  chikungunya and zika in the Americas, highlight the continued need for  systems that provide early detection and warning about biological  threats. We have an ongoing body of biosurveillance work spanning  more than a decade in which we have examined specific surveillance  programs and activities carried out by DHS; the Departments of Health  and Human Services; Agriculture; and several other federal departments  and agencies.", "We have also identified broad, cross-cutting issues in leadership,  coordination, and collaboration that arise from working across the  complex interagency, intergovernmental, and intersectoral biosurveillance  enterprise. To address these issues, in 2010 we made recommendations  that the Homeland Security Council direct the National Security Council  staff to identify a focal point to lead the development of a national  biosurveillance strategy that would, among other things, (1) define the  scope and purpose of a national capability; (2) provide goals, objectives  and activities, priorities, milestones, and performance measures; and (3)  assess the costs and benefits and identify resource and investment  needs, including investment priorities. In July 2012, the White House  released the National Strategy for Biosurveillance to describe the U.S.  government\u2019s approach to strengthening biosurveillance, but it did not  fully meet the intent of our prior recommendations, because it did not offer  a mechanism to identify resource and investment needs, including  investment priorities among various biosurveillance efforts.", "In 2014, a Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense was established to  assess gaps and provide recommendations to improve U.S. biodefense.  The panel\u2019s October 2015 final report identified several themes we have  also highlighted in our biosurveillance work, including the lack of a  centralized leader, no comprehensive national strategic plan, and no all- inclusive dedicated budget for biodefense. The panel\u2019s report highlights a  sense of urgency to address the ongoing and persistent biological  threats\u2014both naturally occurring, like Ebola and zika, and from enemies,  like The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (also known as ISIL and  Da\u2019esh) who have advocated for the use of biological weapons.", "While consequences of a biologic event could be catastrophic, we have  also previously reported that because the nation cannot afford to protect  everything against all threats, choices must be made about protection  priorities given the risk and how to best allocate available resources. As  we testified before this committee in 2012, without a national strategy that  provides a framework and tool set to evaluate tradeoffs, it remains difficult  for decision makers\u2014in both the executive and legislative branches\u2014to  help ensure that biosurveillance resource allocation decisions within  single departments and programs contribute to a coherent enterprisewide  approach.", "Nevertheless, challenges we have reported in two of DHS\u2019s specific  biosurveillance efforts\u2014the National Biosurveillance Integration Center  (NBIC) and the BioWatch program\u2014demonstrate the importance of  following departmental policies and employing leading management  practices to help ensure that the mission of each program is clearly and  purposefully defined and that subsequent investments effectively respond  to those missions. NBIC, which was created to integrate data across the  federal government with the aim of enhancing detection and situational  awareness of biological events, has suffered from longstanding issues  related to its clarity of purpose. Likewise, the BioWatch program, which is  designed to detect bioterrorism attacks with specific aerosolized  pathogens, has encountered challenges that stem from not precisely  defining the need its technologies should fill and how the technologies it  pursued (and in some cases developed and deployed) responded to that  need.", "Finally, DHS is currently at a crossroads for decisions regarding not only  NBIC and BioWatch, but also where these efforts fall within DHS\u2019s  broader Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRNE)  programs. In June 2015, DHS provided Congress a report summarizing  its review of the organization, operations, and communications of its  Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear programs and proposed  merging six CBRNE-related organizational components into one unit.  This provides an opportunity for DHS to look strategically at its  biosurveillance efforts.", "This statement describes progress and challenges we have reported in  DHS\u2019s implementation of NBIC and BioWatch and considerations for the  future of these biosurveillance efforts at DHS. Our statement is based on  our prior work issued from December 2009 through October 2015 on  various biosurveillance efforts. The work upon which this testimony is  based was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. To conduct this  prior work, we reviewed relevant presidential directives, laws, regulations,  policies, and strategic plans; surveyed states; and interviewed federal,  state, and industry officials, among others. We also analyzed key  program documents, including test plans, test results, and modeling  studies.

The  QHSR acknowledges that numerous departments and agencies at the  federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels, as well as the private  sector, contribute to the national effort to address biological threats and  hazards. As such, according to the QHSR, DHS aims to focus on those  activities and responsibilities assigned to it through statute or presidential  directive. Among the identified activities and responsibilities is one that is  specific to biosurveillance\u2014biosurveillance integration and detection\u2014 and others that can help to support efficient and effective biosurveillance  action, such as information sharing and analysis, threat and risk  awareness, and technical forensic analysis to support attribution.", "The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007 (9/11 Commission Act) established the National Biosurveillance  Integration Center (NBIC) within DHS. NBIC was specifically tasked with  integrating and analyzing information from human health, animal, plant,  food, and environmental monitoring systems across the federal  government and supporting the interagency biosurveillance community.  As defined in the July 2012 NBIC Strategic Plan, integration involves  combining biosurveillance information from different sources and domains  (e.g., human, animal, and plant health; food and environmental safety and  security; and homeland security) to provide partners and stakeholders  with a synthesized view of the information, and what it could mean.  Primary goals of integration include creating a common picture or  understanding of potential and ongoing biological events and providing  insights that cannot be gleaned in isolation.", "The 9/11 Commission Act outlines certain requirements for NBIC.  Drawing upon these requirements as well as the NBIC Strategic Plan, we  identified three main roles that NBIC, as a federal-level biosurveillance  integrator, must carry out to achieve the duties and outcomes described  by NBIC\u2019s authorizing legislation. Senior NBIC officials agreed that  these three roles\u2014analyzer, coordinator, and innovator\u2014are consistent  with the center\u2019s responsibilities. These roles are not mutually exclusive  and can reinforce one other. For example, NBIC\u2019s efforts as an Innovator  might result in the development of data that could enhance its role as an  Analyzer by providing the center with another dataset to review.  The  biosurveillance integrators\u2019 roles we identified:", "Analyzer: Use technological tools and subject matter expertise to  develop shared situational awareness by creating meaningful new  insights from disparate datasets and information that could not be  gleaned in isolation.", "Coordinator: Bring together multi-disciplinary partners across  interagency organizations to enhance understanding of new or  potential biological events, such as through the collaborative  development of products and services.", "Innovator: Facilitate the development of new tools, technology, and  approaches to address gaps in biosurveillance integration.", "According to Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10):  Biodefense for the 21st Century, a national bioawareness capability  providing early warning, detection, or recognition of a biological weapon  attack is an essential component of biodefense. To contribute to this  national capability, in 2003, DHS created the BioWatch program to  provide early warning, detection, or recognition of a biological attack. The  BioWatch program uses routine laboratory testing designed to detect an  aerosolized biological attack for five specific biological agents considered  high risk for use as biological weapons.", "When DHS was established in 2002, a perceived urgency to deploy  useful\u2014even if immature\u2014technologies in the face of potentially  catastrophic consequences catalyzed the rapid deployment of many  technologies. DHS completed the initial deployment of BioWatch  quickly\u2014within 80 days of the President\u2019s announcement of the BioWatch  program in his 2003 State of the Union Address. In 2005, DHS  expanded BioWatch to an additional 10 jurisdictions, for a total of more  than 30. The expanded deployment\u2014referred to as Generation 2 (Gen- 2)\u2014also included the addition of indoor monitoring capabilities in three  high-threat jurisdictions and provided additional capacity for events of  national significance, such as major sporting events and political  conventions.", "In 2015, we reported that the BioWatch program collaborates with more  than 30 BioWatch jurisdictions throughout the nation to operate  approximately 600 Gen-2 aerosol collectors. These units rely on a  vacuum-based collection system that draws air through a filter. These  filters are manually collected and transported to state and local public  health laboratories for analysis. Using this manual process, a result can  be generated from 12 to 36 hours after an agent is initially captured by  the aerosol collection unit.", "To reduce detection time, DHS began to develop an autonomous  detection capability in 2003 for the BioWatch program\u2014known as  Generation 3 (Gen-3).  Envisioned as a laboratory-in-a-box, the  autonomous detection system would automatically collect air samples,  conduct analysis to detect the presence of biothreat agents every 4 to 6  hours, and communicate the results to public health officials via an  electronic network without manual intervention. By automating the  analysis, DHS anticipated that detection time could be reduced to 6 hours  or less, making the technology more appropriate for monitoring indoor  high-occupancy facilities such as transportation nodes and enabling a  more rapid response to an attack. DHS also anticipated a reduction in  operational costs by eliminating the program\u2019s daily manual sample  retrieval and laboratory analysis. However, as we reported in 2015, the  Gen-3 acquisition was canceled in April 2014, after testing difficulties and  after an analysis of alternatives was interpreted by DHS as showing that  any advantages of an autonomous system over the current manual  system were insufficient to justify the cost of a full technology switch."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Faced Challenges, Some Persistent, In Its Efforts to Carry Out Biosurveillance Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NBIC Has Faced Difficulty Demonstrating Value to Interagency Partners", "paragraphs": ["In December 2009, we reported that NBIC was not fully equipped to carry  out its mission because it lacked key resources\u2014data and personnel\u2014 from its partner agencies, which may have been at least partially the  result of collaboration challenges it faced.

In August 2012, NBIC issued the NBIC Strategic Plan, which is  intended to provide NBIC\u2019s strategic vision, clarify the center\u2019s mission  and purpose, articulate the value that NBIC seeks to provide to its  partners, and lay the groundwork for setting interagency roles,  responsibilities, and procedures. Further, in November 2014, NBIC  completed its first biannual NBIC Federal Stakeholder Survey, which  NBIC uses to assess the usefulness of its products and activities and to  determine what improvements should be made on the basis of those  results. We believe DHS\u2019s actions addressed the recommendations in our  December 2009 report.", "In September 2015, we reported that NBIC had actions and activities  underway to fulfill all three of the roles we identified as essential to its  ability to carry out its mission\u2014analyzer, coordinator, and integrator. For  example, to fulfill its analyzer role NBIC compiled information to create  and circulate a variety of products to support disease outbreak monitoring  on a daily, weekly, or period basis. Similarly, in its coordinator role, NBIC  had put in place a variety of procedures and protocols to convene  partners on a routine basis or in response to specific emerging events.  Finally, in its innovator role NBIC had efforts to conduct gap analyses,  fund pilot projects that aim to develop new biosurveillance tools and  technology (such as examining the use of social media data to identify  health trends), sought new sources of data and information, and made  efforts to enhance its internal IT system.", "Although NBIC had made efforts to collaborate with interagency partners  to create and issue a strategic plan that would clarify its mission and the  various efforts to fulfill its three roles, we reported a variety of challenges  that remained when we surveyed NBIC\u2019s interagency partners for our  2015 report. Notably, many of these partners continued to express  uncertainty about the value NBIC provided. Specifically, 10 of 19 partners  stated that NBIC\u2019s products and activities enhance their agencies\u2019 ability  to carry out their biosurveillance roles and responsibilities to little or no  extent, 4 responded to a moderate extent, and 5 responded that they did  not have a basis to judge. Generally, partners that responded to little or  no extent noted that NBIC products and activities do not, for example,  identify trends and patterns or describe potential impacts of a biological  event. For instance, one official stated that NBIC\u2019s products and activities  do not \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between dissimilar information, provide novel  synthesis of information, or recommend possible courses of action.  Moreover, most of the federal partners with key roles in biosurveillance (8  of 11) stated that NBIC\u2019s products help their agencies identify biological  events to little or no extent, generally because they already obtain such  information directly from other federal partners more quickly.", "We also found in 2015, as in 2009, that a variety of challenges limited the  extent to which federal agencies shared data and personnel with NBIC,  as envisioned by the 9/11 Commission Act. First, data that NBIC could  use to identify and characterize a biological event of national concern  using statistical and analytical tools, as called for in the 9/11 Commission  Act, are limited. Also, apart from searches of global news reports and  other publically available reports generated by National Biosurveillance  Integration System (NBIS) partners, NBIC has been unable to secure  streams of raw data from multiple domains across the biosurveillance  enterprise that would lend themselves to near-time quantitative analysis  that could reveal unusual patterns and trends.", "Moreover, we found that few federal partners (5 of 19) reported that they  share the data they do have with NBIC, citing legal and regulatory  restrictions, among other reasons. Some agencies are reluctant to share  their data with NBIC because they are unsure how the information will be  used. For example, one official explained that the agency does not share  some data with NBIC because sharing such information too broadly might  have substantial implications on agricultural trade or public perception of  safety. Officials from another agency noted that there is sometimes  reticence to share information and data with components of DHS  because, given the department\u2019s roles in law enforcement and national  security, the information might be shared outside of the health security  community in a way that lacks appropriate context and perspective.  Finally, other agencies stated that they are unable to share data for  regulatory or legal reasons, or because appropriately protecting the data  would take too long.", "Similarly, although NBIC would like to obtain liaisons from each of its  federal partners, only 3 of 19 partners provided NBIC with dedicated  liaisons. Officials from one agency with key biosurveillance  responsibilities stated that it is difficult to provide personnel to NBIC on a  full- or part-time basis because of resource constraints. Further, officials  from another agency noted that the lack of clarity about NBIC\u2019s value to  its partners is a barrier to providing the center with detailees.", "We also reported in September 2015 that NBIC faces challenges  prioritizing developmental efforts to identify and address needs for new  biosurveillance tools. For example, partners noted limitations in NBIC\u2019s  ability to address gaps, like limited resources and the difficulty in  prioritizing the center\u2019s innovation efforts because its partners have  diverse needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Structural and Policy Considerations Could Help Focus NBIC\u2019s Efforts", "paragraphs": ["NBIC officials stated that the center is working to improve its products and  its ability to contextualize the information it collects from open sources,  and has sought partner input to do so. For example, beginning in late  June 2015, partly on the basis of feedback the center received from its  November 2014 Federal Stakeholder Survey, NBIC modified its daily  Monitoring List to include an up-front summary that identifies the status of  ongoing biological events as worsening, improving, unchanged, or  undetermined. Further, NBIC officials noted that the center is also  working to better integrate forecasts and projections into its products and  activities by collaborating with others and developing a common  interagency vision for specific federal capabilities and practical next steps  leading to the application of reliable infectious disease forecasting models  in decision-making processes.", "Nevertheless, a persistent challenge NBIC faces is skepticism on the part  of some of the NBIS partners regarding the value of the federal  biosurveillance mission as well as NBIC\u2019s role in that mission. In our 2009  report, most of the NBIS partners we interviewed at that time expressed  uncertainty about the value of participating in the NBIS or confusion about  the purpose of NBIC\u2019s mission. In September 2015, the NBIS partners  and other major stakeholders in the biosurveillance community  acknowledged\u2014and we agreed\u2014that no single problem limits NBIC\u2019s  mission to integrate biosurveillance data. Rather, over the years, several  long-standing problems have combined to inhibit the achievement of this  mission as envisioned in the 9/11 Commission Act. We identified options  in our 2015 report for policy or structural changes that could help better  fulfill the biosurveillance integration mission, which are summarized  below. We identified these options and their benefits and limitations, on  the basis of the roles of a federal-level biosurveillance integrator we  identified in the 9/11 Commission Act, NBIC\u2019s strategic plan, and the  perspectives of the NBIS partners obtained during our structured  interviews. These options are not exhaustive, and some options could be  implemented together or in part."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BioWatch\u2019s Ability to Detect Attacks Uncertain Because It Lacks Performance Requirements that Correspond to a Clearly Defined Mission", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, DHS has focused on acquiring an autonomous detection  system to replace the current BioWatch Gen-2, but has faced challenges  in clearly justifying the BioWatch program\u2019s need and ability to reliably  address that need. In September 2012, we found that DHS approved the  Gen-3 acquisition in October 2009 without fully developing critical  knowledge that would help ensure sound investment decision making,  pursuit of optimal solutions, and reliable performance, cost, and schedule  information. Specifically, we found that DHS did not engage the early  phases of its Acquisition Life-cycle Framework, which is designed to help  ensure that the mission need driving the acquisition warrants investment  of limited resources and that an analysis of alternatives (AoA)  systematically identifies possible alternative solutions that could satisfy  the identified need. BioWatch officials stated that they were aware that  the Mission Needs Statement prepared in October 2009 did not reflect a  systematic effort to justify a capability need, but stated that the  department directed them to proceed because there was already  departmental consensus around the solution. However, we found that the  AoA prepared for the Gen-3 acquisition did not reflect a systematic  decision-making process. As with the Mission Needs Statement, program  officials told us that they were advised that a comprehensive AoA would  not be necessary because there was already departmental consensus  that autonomous detection was the optimal solution. Because the Gen-3  AoA did not evaluate a complete solution set, consider complete  information on cost and benefits, and include a cost-benefit analysis, we  concluded that it did not provide information on which to base trade-off  decisions.", "To help ensure DHS based its acquisition decisions on reliable  performance, cost, and schedule information developed in accordance  with guidance and good practices, in our September 2012 report, we  recommended that before continuing the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS  reevaluate the mission need and possible alternatives based on cost- benefit and risk information. DHS concurred with the recommendation  and in 2012, DHS directed the BioWatch program to complete an updated  AoA. In April 2014, DHS canceled the acquisition of Gen-3 because the  AoA did not confirm an overwhelming benefit to justify the cost of a full  technology switch to Gen-3.", "Having canceled the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS continues to rely on the  Gen-2 system for early detection of an aerosolized biological attack.  However, we found DHS lacks reliable information about BioWatch Gen- 2\u2019s technical capabilities to detect a biological attack, in part, because in  the 12 years since BioWatch\u2019s initial deployment, DHS has not developed  technical performance requirements for Gen-2. We reported in 2015 that  BioWatch has been criticized because it was deployed quickly in 2003 to  address a perceived urgent need, but without sufficient testing, validation,  and evaluation of its technical capabilities. In 2015, we reported that  DHS officials said that the system can detect catastrophic attacks, which  they define as attacks large enough to cause 10,000 casualties. DHS has  commissioned tests of Gen-2\u2019s technical performance characteristics, but  DHS has not developed performance requirements that would enable it to  interpret the test results and draw conclusions about the system\u2019s ability  to detect attacks. According to DHS guidance and standard practice in  testing and evaluation of defense systems, in order to assess Gen-2\u2019s  capability to detect a biological attack, DHS would have to link test results  to its conclusions about the deployed detectors\u2019 ability to detect attacks in  BioWatch operational environments. This would ordinarily be done by  developing and validating technical performance requirements based on  operational objectives, but DHS has not developed such requirements for  Gen-2.", "In the absence of technical performance requirements, DHS officials said  their assertion that the system can detect catastrophic attacks is  supported by modeling and simulation studies. However, we found none  of these studies were designed to incorporate test results from the Gen-2  system and comprehensively assess the system against the stated  operational objective. The modeling and simulation studies were  designed for purposes other than to directly and comprehensively assess  Gen-2\u2019s operational capabilities. For example, one set of modeling and  simulation studies, conducted by Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia)  in collaboration with other national laboratories, did not incorporate  information about the actual locations of Gen-2 collector units, because  they were designed to model hypothetical BioWatch deployments in  which collectors were placed in optimal locations. Sandia also analyzed  ranges of hypothetical system sensitivities rather than incorporating the  test results on the performance characteristics of Gen-2. Therefore, these  studies drew no conclusions about the actual capabilities of the deployed  Gen-2 system. DHS officials also described modeling and simulation  work that used a measure of operational capability that does not directly  support conclusions about the BioWatch objective of detecting attacks  large enough to cause 10,000 casualties.", "Additionally, we found that because none of the modeling and simulation  work was designed to interpret Gen-2 test results and comprehensively  assess the capabilities of the Gen-2 system, none of these studies has  provided a full accounting of statistical and other uncertainties\u2014meaning  decision makers have no means of understanding the precision or  confidence in what is known about system capabilities. Because it is not  possible to test the BioWatch system directly by releasing live biothreat  agents into the air in operational environments, limitations of the tests  described earlier limit the applicability of the results and underscore the  need for a full accounting of statistical and other uncertainties, without  which decision makers lack a full understanding of the Gen-2 system\u2019s  capability to detect attacks of defined types and sizes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Understanding BioWatch\u2019s Current Capabilities Could Help Inform Future Biodetection Investments", "paragraphs": ["At the time DHS canceled the Gen-3 acquisition, it also announced that  S&T will explore development and maturation of an effective and  affordable automated aerosol biodetection capability, or other operational  enhancements, that meet the operational requirements of the BioWatch  system.

However, because DHS  lacks reliable information about Gen-2\u2019s technical capabilities, decision  makers are not assured of having sufficient information to ensure future  investments are actually addressing a capability gap not met by the  current system.  Also, because DHS lacks targets for the current system\u2019s  performance characteristics, including limits of detection, that would  enable conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks of defined  types and sizes with specified probabilities, it cannot ensure it has  complete information to make decisions about upgrades or  enhancements.", "In our September 2015 report, to help ensure that biosurveillance-related  funding is directed to programs that can demonstrate their intended  capabilities, and to help ensure sufficient information is known about the  current Gen-2 system to make informed cost-benefit decisions about  possible upgrades and enhancements to the system, we recommended  that DHS not pursue upgrades or enhancements to the current BioWatch  system until it establishes technical performance requirements necessary  for a biodetection system to meet a clearly defined operational objective  for the BioWatch program; assesses the Gen-2 system against these  performance requirements; and produces a full accounting of statistical  and other uncertainties and limitations in what is known about the  system\u2019s capability to meet its operational objectives.
