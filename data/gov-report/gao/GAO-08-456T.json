TSA has focused its efforts on, among other things, more efficiently allocating, deploying, and managing the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) workforce--formerly known as screeners; strengthening screening procedures; developing and deploying more effective and efficient screening technologies; strengthening domestic air cargo security; and developing a government operated watch-list matching program, known as Secure Flight. Specifically, TSA developed and implemented a Staffing Allocation Model to determine TSO staffing levels at airports that reflect current operating conditions, and proposed and implemented modifications to passenger checkpoint screening procedures based on risk information. However, GAO reported that some assumptions in TSA's Staffing Allocation Model did not accurately reflect airport operating conditions, and that TSA could improve its process for evaluating the effectiveness of proposed procedural changes. In response, TSA developed a plan to review Staffing Allocation Model assumptions and took steps to strengthen its evaluation of proposed procedural changes. TSA has also explored new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to better detect explosives and other threats and has taken steps to strengthen air cargo security, including conducting vulnerability assessments at airports and compliance inspections of air carriers. However, TSA has not developed an inspection plan that included performance goals and measures to determine whether air carriers transporting cargo into the United States were complying with security requirements. In response to GAO's recommendations, TSA has since established a working group to strengthen its compliance activities. Finally, TSA has instilled more discipline and rigor into Secure Flight's systems development, including preparing key documentation and strengthening privacy protections. While these efforts should be commended, GAO has identified several areas that should be addressed to further strengthen aviation security. For example, TSA has made limited progress in developing and deploying checkpoint technologies due to planning and management challenges. Further, TSA continues to face some program management challenges in developing Secure Flight. Specifically, TSA has not (1) developed program cost and schedule estimates consistent with best practices; (2) fully implemented its risk management plan; (3) planned for system end-to-end testing in test plans; and (4) ensured that information security requirements are fully implemented. If these challenges are not addressed effectively, the risk of the program not being completed on schedule and within estimated costs is increased, and the chances of it performing as intended are diminished. DHS and TSA lack performance measures to fully evaluate the effectiveness of current processes for passengers who apply for redress due to inconveniences experienced during the check-in and screening process. Without such measures, DHS and TSA lack a sound basis to monitor the effectiveness of the redress process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss  the security of our nation\u2019s aviation system. The Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) was established in 2001 with the mission to protect  the transportation network while also ensuring the free movement of  people and commerce. Since its inception, TSA has focused much of its  efforts on aviation security, and has developed and implemented a variety  of programs and procedures to secure commercial aviation. To implement  these efforts, TSA funding for aviation security has totaled about $26  billion since fiscal year 2004. Other parties also play a role in securing  commercial aviation, including air carriers that are responsible for  screening air cargo, among other things, and the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T), which is  responsible for the research and development of aviation security  technologies. In carrying out its broader homeland security  responsibilities, DHS faces the daunting challenge of determining how to  allocate its finite resources within the aviation system and across all  sectors to address threats and strengthen security.", "Our testimony today focuses on TSA\u2019s efforts to ensure the security of the  following key areas of the commercial aviation system, which represents  about $4.5 billion of the $6.0 billion President\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget  request for aviation security: 1) screening operations, including  transportation security officer (TSO) and private screener allocations, and  checkpoint screening technologies; 2) air cargo; and 3) and passenger  watch-list matching.  In particular, we will address the numerous efforts  TSA has taken or plans to take to strengthen security in these areas and  the challenges that remain.", "Our comments are based on GAO reports and testimonies issued between  February 2004 and April 2007 addressing the security of the nation\u2019s  aviation system, including selected updates to this work conducted in  February 2008.  Our comments are also based on the results from our  recently completed work assessing the status of TSA\u2019s development of the  Secure Flight program, conducted in response to the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. This statement  will address the following issues raised by the mandate: (1) overall  progress made in strengthening the Secure Flight program, including  privacy protection issues and coordination of international and domestic  watch-list matching functions, (2) development of Secure Flight\u2019s cost and  schedule estimates, (3) efforts made in Secure Flight\u2019s system  development including risk management, end-to-end testing, and  information security, and (4) DHS and TSA\u2019s efforts to evaluate redress.  We conducted this mandated review from August 2007 to January 2008.   For our review, we interviewed officials from the Secure Flight program  and Customs and Border Protection and reviewed relevant laws and  regulations and program management and planning documents. We  conducted these performance audits in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, TSA has operational  responsibility for conducting passenger and checked baggage screening at  most airports, and has regulatory, or oversight, responsibility, for air  carriers who conduct air cargo screening. While TSA took over  responsibility for passenger checkpoint and baggage screening, air carriers  have continued to conduct passenger watch-list matching in accordance  with TSA requirements, which includes the process of matching passenger  information against federal watch-list data before flights depart. TSA is  currently developing a program to take over this responsibility from air  carriers for passengers on domestic flights, and plans to assume from the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the pre-departure name- matching function for passengers on international flights traveling to or  from the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Airline Passenger and Checked Baggage Screening", "paragraphs": ["One of the most significant changes mandated by ATSA was the shift from  the use of private-sector screeners to perform airport screening operations  to the use of federal screeners (now referred to as TSOs). Prior to ATSA,  passenger and checked baggage screening had been performed by private  screening companies under contract to airlines. ATSA established TSA and  required it to create a federal workforce to assume the job of conducting  passenger and checked baggage screening at commercial airports. The  federal screener workforce was put into place, as required, by November  2002.", "Passenger screening is a process by which personnel authorized by TSA  inspect individuals and property to deter and prevent the carriage of any  unauthorized explosive, incendiary, weapon, or other dangerous item into  a sterile area or onboard an aircraft. Passenger screening personnel must  inspect individuals for prohibited items at designated screening locations.  The four passenger screening functions are X-ray screening of property,  walk-through metal detector screening of individuals, hand-wand or pat- down screening of individuals, and physical search of property and trace  detection for explosives. Typically, passengers are only subjected to X-ray  screening of their carry-on items and screening by the walk-through metal  detector. Passengers whose carry-on baggage alarms the X-ray machine,  who alarm the walk-through metal detector, or who are designated as  selectees\u2014that is, passengers selected by the Computer Assisted  Passenger Pre-Screening System (CAPPS) or other TSA-approved  processes to designate passengers for additional screening\u2014are screened  by hand-wand or pat-down and have their carry-on items either screened  for explosives traces or physically searched.", "Checked baggage screening is a process by which authorized security  screening personnel inspect checked baggage to deter, detect, and prevent  the carriage of any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, or weapon  onboard an aircraft. Checked baggage screening is accomplished through  the use of explosive detection systems or explosive trace detection  systems, and through the use of approved alternative means, such as  manual searches and canine teams when the explosive detection or  explosive trace detection systems are unavailable.", "The passenger and checked baggage screening systems are composed of  three elements: the people (TSOs) responsible for conducting the  screening of airline passengers and their carry-on items and checked  baggage, the technology used during the screening process, and the  procedures TSOs are to follow to conduct screening.

Cargo can be shipped in various forms, including large containers  known as unit loading devices that allow many packages to be  consolidated into one container that can be loaded onto an aircraft,  wooden crates, assembled pallets, or individually wrapped/boxed pieces,  known as break bulk cargo.", "Participants in the air cargo shipping process include shippers, such as  individuals and manufacturers; indirect air carriers, also referred to as  freight forwarders or regulated agents; air cargo handling agents, who  process and load cargo onto aircraft on behalf of air carriers; and  passenger and all-cargo carriers that store, load, and transport air cargo.  A  shipper may take its packages to a freight forwarder, or regulated agent,  which consolidates cargo from many shippers and delivers it to air  carriers. A shipper may also send freight by directly packaging and  delivering it to an air carrier\u2019s ticket counter or sorting center where either  the air carrier or a cargo handling agent will sort and load cargo onto the  aircraft. The shipper may also have cargo picked up and delivered by an  all-cargo carrier, or choose to take cargo directly to a carriers\u2019 retail  facility for delivery.", "TSA\u2019s responsibilities for securing air cargo include, among other things,  establishing security rules and regulations governing domestic and foreign  passenger air carriers that transport cargo, domestic and foreign all-cargo  carriers that transport cargo, and domestic indirect air carriers. TSA is  also responsible for overseeing the implementation of air cargo security  requirements by air carriers and indirect air carriers through compliance  inspections, and, in coordination with DHS\u2019s S&T Director, for conducting  research and development of air cargo security technologies. Air carriers  (passenger and all-cargo) are responsible for implementing TSA security  requirements, predominantly through a TSA-approved security program  that describes the security policies, procedures, and systems the air carrier  will implement and maintain in order to comply with TSA security  requirements. Air carriers must also abide by security requirements issued  by TSA through security directives or emergency amendments to air  carrier security programs.", "Air carriers use several methods and technologies to screen domestic and  inbound air cargo. These include manual physical searches and  comparisons between airway bills and cargo contents to ensure that the  contents of the cargo shipment matches the cargo identified in documents  filed by the shipper, as well as using approved technology, such as X-ray  systems, explosive trace detection systems, decompression chambers,  explosive detection systems, and certified explosive detection canine  teams. Under TSA\u2019s security requirements for domestic and inbound air  cargo, passenger air carriers are currently required to randomly screen a  specific percentage of non exempt air cargo pieces listed on each airway  bill. All-cargo carriers are required to screen 100 percent of air cargo that  exceeds a specific weight threshold.  As of October 2006, domestic  indirect air carriers are also required, under certain conditions, to screen a  certain percentage of air cargo prior to its consolidation.  TSA, however,  does not regulate foreign freight forwarders, or individuals or businesses  that have their cargo shipped by air to the United States.

Secure Flight is the program  through which TSA plans to meet this requirement. Following domestic  implementation, TSA, through Secure Flight, plans to assume  responsibility from CBP for watch-list matching of passengers on  international flights bound to and from the United States. Secure Flight\u2019s  mission is to enhance the security of commercial air travel by: eliminating inconsistencies in current air carrier watch-list  reducing the number of individuals who are misidentified as being  on the No Fly or Selectee list,  reducing the risk of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive watch-list  information, and  integrating the redress process so that individuals are less likely to  be improperly or unfairly delayed or prohibited from boarding an  aircraft.", "TSA plans to implement Secure Flight in three releases. During Release  One, which is currently ongoing and is scheduled to be completed in  March 2008, TSA is developing and testing the Secure Flight system.   During Release Two, scheduled to be conducted from April 2008 through  August 2008, TSA plans to begin parallel testing with air carriers during  which both Secure Flight and air carriers will perform watch-list matching.   Finally, during Release Three, TSA is to develop the capability for \u201cairline  cutovers\u201d during which Secure Flight plans to begin conducting all watch- list matching for domestic air passengers.

We reported in February 2004 that staffing shortages  and TSA\u2019s hiring process had hindered the ability of some Federal Security  Directors (FSD)\u2014the ranking TSA authorities responsible for leading and  coordinating security activities at airports\u2014to provide sufficient resources  to staff screening checkpoints and oversee screening operations at their  checkpoints without using additional measures such as overtime. Since  that time, TSA has developed a Staffing Allocation Model to determine  TSO staffing levels at airports. In determining staffing allocations, the  model takes into account the workload demands unique to each airport  based on an estimate of each airport\u2019s peak passenger volume. This input  is then processed against certain TSA assumptions about screening  passengers and checked baggage\u2014including expected processing rates,  required staffing for passenger lanes and baggage equipment based on  standard operating procedures, and historical equipment alarm rates. In  August 2005, TSA determined that the Staffing Allocation Model contained  complete and accurate information on each airport from which to estimate  staffing needs, and the agency used the model to identify TSO allocations  for each airport. At that time, the staffing model identified a total TSO full- time equivalent allocation need of 42,303 TSOs.", "In addition to the staffing levels identified by the model, TSA sets aside  TSO full-time equivalents for needs outside of those considered by the  model in its annual allocation run for airports. For example, during the  course of the year, certain airports may experience significant changes to  their screening operations, such as the arrival of a new airline or opening  of a new terminal. According to TSA officials, the agency established a  reserve of 413 TSO full-time equivalents during fiscal year 2007 that can be  used to augment the existing force, and began fiscal year 2008 with a  reserve of 170 TSO full-time equivalents. TSA plans to continue with its  use of a reserve force during fiscal year 2009 due to the dynamic nature of  airport operations and the need to make staffing adjustments to meet  changing operational requirements. Additionally, in order to handle short- term extraordinary needs at airports, TSA established a National  Deployment Force\u2014formerly known as the National Screening Force\u2014 comprised of TSOs and other TSA security staff who can be sent to  airports to augment local TSO staff during periods of unusually high  passenger volume, such as the Super Bowl. According to TSA, as of  February 13, 2008, there were 451 TSOs in the National Deployment Force.  The TSA fiscal year 2009 budget justification request identifies that TSA  analyzes each request for support from the National Deployment Force  from a cost, benefit, and risk perspective to ensure the optimal use of  resources. The budget justification requests $34.3 million for operational  expenses for the National Deployment Office\u2014the office responsible for,  among other things, deploying the National Deployment Force to those  airports experiencing significant staffing shortfalls.", "FSDs we interviewed during 2006 as part of our review of TSA\u2019s staffing  model generally reported that the model is a more accurate predictor of  staffing needs than TSA\u2019s prior staffing model, which took into account  fewer factors that affect screening operations. However, FSDs identified  that some assumptions used in the fiscal year 2006 staffing model did not  reflect actual operating conditions. For example, FSDs noted that the  staffing model\u2019s assumption of a 20 percent part-time workforce\u2014 measured in terms of full-time equivalents\u2014had been difficult to achieve,  particularly at larger (category X and I) airports, because of, among other  things, economic conditions leading to competition for part-time workers,  remote airport locations coupled with a lack of mass transit, TSO base pay  that had not changed since fiscal year 2002, and part-time workers\u2019 desire  to convert to full-time status. We reported in February 2007 that TSA data  showed that for fiscal years 2005 and 2006, the nation\u2019s category X airports  had a TSO workforce composed of about 9 percent part-time equivalents,  and the part-time TSO attrition rate nationwide remained considerably  higher than the rate for full-time personnel (approximately 46 percent  versus 16 percent for full-time TSOs during fiscal year 2006). According  to TSA\u2019s fiscal year 2009 congressional budget justification, full-time TSO  attrition nationwide decreased to 11.6 percent during 2007, and part-time  attrition decreased to 37.2 percent. FSDs also expressed concern that the  model did not specifically account for the recurrent training requirement  for TSOs of 3 hours per week averaged over a fiscal year quarter. FSDs  further identified that the model for fiscal year 2006 did not account for  TSO\u2019s time away from screening to perform operational support duties,  such as payroll processing, scheduling, distribution and maintenance of  uniforms, data entry, and workman\u2019s compensation processing. To help  ensure that TSOs are effectively utilized, we recommended that TSA  establish a policy for when TSOs can be used to provide operational  support. Consistent with our recommendation, in March 2007, TSA issued  a management directive that provides guidance on assigning TSOs,  through detail or permanent promotion, to duties of another position for a  specified period of time.", "In response to FSDs\u2019 input and the various mechanisms TSA had  implemented to monitor the sufficiency of the model\u2019s allocation outputs,  TSA made changes to some assumptions in the model for fiscal year 2007.  For example, TSA recognized that some airports cannot likely achieve a 20  percent part-time equivalent level and others, most likely smaller airports,  may operate more efficiently with other levels of part-time TSO staff. As a  result, for fiscal year 2007, TSA modified the assumption in its Staffing  Allocation Model to include a variable part-time goal based on each  airport\u2019s historic part-time to full-time TSO ratio. TSA also included an  allowance in the model for fiscal 2007 to provide additional assurance that  TSOs complete required training on detecting improvised explosive  devices, as well as an allowance for operational support duties to account  for the current need for TSOs to perform these duties.  In our February  2007 report on the Staffing Allocation Model, we recommended that TSA  establish a formal, documented plan for reviewing all of the model  assumptions on a periodic basis to ensure that the assumptions result in  TSO staffing allocations that accurately reflect operating conditions that  may change over time.  TSA agreed with our recommendation and, in  December 2007, developed a Staffing Allocation Model Rates and  Assumptions Validation Plan. The plan identifies the process TSA will use  to review and validate the model\u2019s assumptions on a periodic basis.", "Although we did not independently review TSA\u2019s staffing allocation for  fiscal year 2008, the TSA fiscal year 2009 budget justification identified  that the agency has achieved operational and efficiency gains that enabled  them to implement or expand several workforce initiatives involving  TSOs, which are summarized in table 2. For example, TSA reported  making several changes to the fiscal year 2008 Staffing Allocation Model,  such as decreasing the allocation for time paid not worked (annual, sick,  and military leave; compensatory time; and injury time off) from a 14.5  percent to 14 percent based on past performance data. TSA also reported  revising the exit lane staffing based on each checkpoint\u2019s unique operating  hours rather than staffing all exit lanes based on the maximum open hours  for any checkpoint at an airport.", "TSA\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget justification includes $2.7 billion for the  federal TSO workforce represents an increase of about $80 million over  fiscal year 2008.  Of the $80 million increase, about $38 million is for cost  of living adjustments, and about $42 million is for the annualization of the  full-year cost of the Behavior Detection Officer and Aviation Direct Access  Screening Program positions. According to the budget justification, the  $2.7 billion includes funding for compensation and benefits of 45,643 full- time equivalent personnel\u2014approximately 46,909 TSOs and about 1,100  screening managers.

However, we have identified  areas where TSA could improve its evaluation and documentation of  proposed procedures. In April 2007, we reported that TSA officials  considered modifications to its standard operating procedure (SOP) based  on risk information (threat and vulnerability information), daily  experiences of staff working at airports, and complaints and concerns  raised by the traveling public.  In addition to these factors, consistent  with its mission, TSA senior leadership made efforts to balance the impact  that proposed SOP modifications would have on security, efficiency, and  customer service when deciding whether proposed SOP modifications  should be implemented. For example, in August 2006, TSA sought to  increase security by banning liquids and gels from being carried onboard  aircraft in response to the alleged terrorist plot to detonate liquid  explosives onboard multiple aircraft en route from the United Kingdom to  the United States. In September 2006, after obtaining more information  about the alleged terrorist plot\u2014to include information from the United  Kingdom and U.S. intelligence communities, discussions with explosives  experts, and testing of explosives\u2014TSA officials decided to lift the total  ban on liquids and gels to allow passengers to carry small amounts of  liquids and gels onboard aircraft. TSA officials also lifted the total ban  because banning liquids and gels as carry-on items was shown to affect  both efficiency and customer service. In an effort to harmonize its liquid  screening procedures with other countries, in November 2006, TSA revised  its procedures to allow 3.4 fluid ounces of liquids, gels, and aerosols  onboard aircraft.", "We further reported that for more significant SOP modifications, TSA first  tested the proposed modifications at selected airports to help determine  whether the changes would achieve their intended purpose, as well as to  assess its impact on screening operations.  TSA\u2019s efforts to collect  quantitative data through testing proposed procedures prior to deciding  whether to implement or reject them is consistent with our past work that  has shown the importance of data collection and analyses to support  agency decision making. However, we reported that TSA\u2019s data collection  and analyses could be improved to help TSA determine whether proposed  procedures that are operationally tested would achieve their intended  purpose. Specifically, we found that for tests of proposed screening  procedures TSA conducted from April 2005 through December 2005,  including the removal of small scissors and small tools from the prohibited  items list, although TSA collected some data on the efficiency of and  customer response to the procedures at selected airports, the agency  generally did not collect the type of data or conduct the necessary analysis  that would yield information on whether the proposed procedures would  achieve their intended purpose.  We also found that TSA\u2019s documentation  on proposed modifications to screening procedures was not complete. We  recommended that TSA develop sound evaluation methods, when  possible, to assess whether proposed screening changes would achieve  their intended purpose and generate and maintain documentation on  proposed screening changes that are deemed significant. DHS generally  agreed with our recommendations and TSA has taken steps to implement  them. For example, for several proposed SOP changes considered during  the fall of 2007, TSA provided documentation that identified the sources of  the proposed changes and the reasons why the agency decided to accept  or reject the proposed changes. With regard to our recommendation to  develop sound evaluation methods when assessing proposed SOP  modifications, when possible, TSA reported that it is working with subject  matter experts to ensure that the agency\u2019s operational tests related to  proposed changes to screening procedures are well designed and  executed, and produce results that are scientifically valid and reliable.  These actions, when fully implemented, should enable TSA to better  justify its passenger screening procedure modifications to Congress and  the traveling public.", "Once proposed SOP changes have been implemented, it is important that  TSA have a mechanism in place to ensure that TSOs are complying with  established procedures. In our April 2007 report, we identified that TSA  monitors TSO compliance with passenger checkpoint screening SOPs  through its performance accountability and standards system and through  local and national covert testing. According to TSA officials, the  performance accountability and standards system was developed in  response to a 2003 report by us that recommended that TSA establish a  performance management system that makes meaningful distinctions in  employee performance, and in response to input from TSA airport staff  on how to improve passenger and checked baggage screening measures.  This system is used by TSA to assess agency personnel at all levels on  various competencies, including, among other things, technical  proficiency. During fiscal year 2007, the technical proficiency component  of the performance accountability and standards system for TSOs focused  on TSO knowledge of screening procedures; image recognition; proper  screening techniques; and the ability to identify, detect, and locate  prohibited items. In addition to implementing the performance  accountability and standards system, TSA also conducts local and national  covert tests to evaluate, in part, the extent to which TSOs\u2019 noncompliance  with SOPs affects their ability to detect simulated threat items hidden in  accessible property or concealed on a person. In our April 2007 report, we  identified that some TSA airport officials have experienced resource  challenges in implementing these compliance monitoring efforts. TSA  headquarters officials stated that they were taking steps, such as  automating the performance accountability and standards system data  entry functions, to address this challenge. Since then, TSA has also  implemented a new local covert testing program nationwide, known as the  Aviation Screening Assessment Program. This program is intended to  measure TSO performance using realistic and standardized test scenarios  to achieve a national TSO assessment measurement. According to TSA\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 congressional budget justification, this national baseline  measurement will be achieved by conducting a total of 48,000 annual tests.  TSA plans to use the test results to identify vulnerabilities across  screening operations and to provide recommendations for addressing the  vulnerabilities to various stakeholders within TSA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS and TSA Are Pursuing New Checkpoint Technologies to Enhance the Detection of Explosives and Other Threats, but Continue to Face Challenges", "paragraphs": ["We reported in February 2007 that DHS S&T and TSA were exploring  new passenger checkpoint screening technologies to enhance the  detection of explosives and other threats. However, we found that limited  progress had been made in fielding explosives detection technology at  passenger screening checkpoints, in part due to challenges DHS S&T and  TSA faced in coordinating research and development efforts.  TSA  requested $103.2 million in its fiscal year 2009 budget request for  checkpoint technology and checkpoint reconfiguration. Specifically, the  request includes $91.7 million to, among other things, procure and deploy  Advanced Technology Systems to further extend explosives and  prohibited item detection coverage at category X and I checkpoints. The  budget request identifies that equipment purchases may also include the  Whole Body Imager, Bottled Liquids Scanner, Cast and Prosthesis Imager,  shoe scanner systems, technology integration solutions, and additional  units or upgrades to legacy equipment, and other technologies. TSA  further requested $11.5 million to support the optimization and  reconfiguration of additional checkpoint lanes to accommodate  anticipated airport growth and maintain throughput at the busiest airport  checkpoints.", "Of the various emerging checkpoint screening projects funded by TSA and  DHS S&T, the explosive trace portal and the bottled liquids scanning  device have been deployed to airport checkpoints, and a number of  additional projects have initiated procurements or are being researched  and developed. Projects which have initiated procurements include the  cast and prosthesis scanner and advanced technology systems. Projects  currently in research and development include the checkpoint explosives  detection system and the whole body imager. Table 4 provides a  description of passenger checkpoint screening technologies that have  been deployed as well as technologies that have initiated procurements or  are in research and development.  This list of technologies is limited to  those for which TSA could provide documentation.  TSA is planning to  develop and deploy additional technologies.  We are continuing to assess  TSA\u2019s deployment of new checkpoint screening technologies in our  ongoing work and expect to report on the results of this work later this  year.", "Despite TSA\u2019s efforts to develop passenger checkpoint screening  technologies, we reported that limited progress has been made in fielding  explosives detection technology at airport checkpoints. For example, we  reported that TSA had anticipated that the explosives trace portals would  be in operation throughout the country during fiscal year 2007. However,  due to performance and maintenance issues, TSA halted the acquisition  and deployment of the portals in June 2006. As a result, TSA has fielded  less than 25 percent of the 434 portals it projected it would deploy by  fiscal year 2007.  TSA officials are considering what to do with the portals  that were procured and are currently in storage. In addition to the portals,  TSA has fallen behind in its projected acquisition of other emerging  screening technologies. For example, we reported that the acquisition of  91 Whole Body Imagers was previously delayed in part because TSA  needed to develop a means to protect the privacy of passengers screened  by this technology. TSA also reduced the initial number of the cast and  prosthesis scanner units to be procured during fiscal year 2007 due to  unexpected maintenance cost increases.  Furthermore, fiscal year 2008  funding to procure additional cast and prosthesis scanners was shifted to  procure more Whole Body Imagers and Advanced Technology Systems  due to a change in priorities.", "While TSA and DHS have taken steps to coordinate the research,  development, and deployment of checkpoint technologies, we reported in  February 2007 that challenges remained. For example, TSA and DHS S&T  officials stated that they encountered difficulties in coordinating research  and development efforts due to reorganizations within TSA and S&T. A  senior TSA official further stated at the time that, while TSA and the DHS  S&T have executed a memorandum of understanding to establish the  services that the Transportation Security Laboratory is to provide to TSA,  coordination with S&T remained a challenge because the organizations  had not fully implemented the terms of the agreement.  Since our February  2007 testimony, according to TSA and S&T, coordination between them  has improved.", "We also reported that TSA did not have a strategic plan to guide its efforts  to acquire and deploy screening technologies, and that a lack of a strategic  plan or approach could limit TSA\u2019s ability to deploy emerging technologies  at those airport locations deemed at highest risk.

In response, in part, to our  recommendation, TSA implemented an Air Cargo Vulnerability  Assessment program and plans to complete assessments of all Category X  airports by 2009.  In addition, we also reported that TSA had established  requirements for air carriers to randomly screen air cargo, but had  exempted some domestic and inbound cargo from screening.  To address  these exemptions, TSA issued a security directive and emergency  amendment in October 2006 to domestic and foreign air carriers operating  within and from the United States that limited the screening exemptions.   Moreover, based on our recommendation to systematically analyze  compliance inspection results and use the results to target future  inspections, TSA recently reported that the agency has increased the  number of inspectors dedicated to conducting domestic air cargo  compliance inspections, and has begun analyzing the results of these  inspections to prioritize their inspections on those entities that have the  highest rates of noncompliance, as well as newly approved entities that  have yet to be inspected.  With respect to inbound air cargo, we reported  that TSA lacked an inspection plan with performance goals and measures  for its inspection efforts, and recommended that TSA develop such a plan.   In response to our recommendation, TSA officials stated that the agency  formed an International Cargo Working Group to develop inspection  prompts to guide inspectors in their examinations of foreign and U.S. air  cargo operators departing from foreign locations to the United States.   In addition to taking steps to strengthen inspections of air cargo, TSA is  working to enhance air cargo screening technologies.

The ability to generate reliable cost and  schedule estimates is a critical function necessary to support OMB\u2019s  capital programming process. Without adhering to these best practices in  the development of its cost and schedule estimates, TSA is at risk of the  Secure Flight program experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines, and  performance shortfalls.", "Life-cycle cost estimate.  We found that TSA has not fully followed best  practices for developing a reliable and valid life-cycle cost estimate. Using  our Cost Assessment Guide\u2019s 12-step process for creating cost estimates,  we assessed the Secure Flight cost estimate against these best practices.   The Guide outlines a 12-step process, which if followed correctly, should  result in high quality, reliable, and valid cost estimates. DHS\u2019s Cost - Benefit Analysis Guidebook, which TSA program officials stated that TSA  used to develop the life-cycle cost estimate for Secure Flight, contains  most of the best practices outlined in our Guide.  TSA followed some of  these practices in developing its cost estimate, including defining the  purpose of the program and estimate purpose; identifying many program  cost elements, including expenditures for facilities, hardware, and  software; and identifying the numbers of staff, their pay, and associated  travel and training costs, among other elements. However, it is unclear  whether TSA followed other best practices or did not address the  practices in developing its estimate. For example, it is unclear whether the  cost estimate had been updated to reflect the current program because the  detailed support for the estimate was produced between 2004 and 2006,  and does not reflect the current program plan. In addition, the cost  estimate does not capture all key costs. For example, the estimate does  not capture costs beyond 2012 even though the system is expected to be  operational beyond that date. Secure Flight's Acquisition Program  Baseline states that life-cycle costs will run from FY 2002 through FY 2020  and assumes operations of the program through 2020. The cost estimate  documentation also did not provide a step-by-step description of the cost  estimating process, data sources, and methods used to develop the  underlying cost elements consistent with best practices.

TSA officials stated that  the program\u2019s cost figures were updated in 2007 and continue to be  updated as changes warrant.  Officials further stated that their estimates  were prepared in accordance with DHS and OMB guidance and were  reviewed and approved by DHS and OMB.

GAO's  Cost Assessment Guide includes 9 best practices, which if followed  correctly, should result in high quality, reliable, and valid schedule  estimates.  Without a reliable schedule baseline and careful monitoring of  its status, a program may not be able to determine when forecasted  completion dates differ from planned dates. TSA has made progress in  developing a reliable and valid schedule estimate, including capturing key  activities and accounting for the development of program requirements  and testing.  However, TSA officials could not provide evidence that their  scheduling software can produce a critical path (i.e., the longest path of  sequential activities in a schedule) driven by discrete lower level tasks.  Best practices call for the critical path to be generated using scheduling  software. We also found that the schedule is not fully integrated because  several lower level activities were not connected in a logical manner, as  called for by best practices. As a result, the Secure Flight schedule  estimate may not provide a meaningful benchmark from which to gauge  progress, identify and address potential problems, and make informed  decisions. For example, the inability to institute a reliable schedule could  affect TSA\u2019s ability to effectively measure contractor performance in  meeting deliverables. TSA officials stated that their scheduling software  can create a critical path, and that lower level tasks in their schedule were  logically linked together; however, they did not provide evidence that  supported this.", "Since TSA completed a re-baselining of the Secure Flight program, and  began using its current schedule, the program has missed milestones and  experienced schedule slippages. For example, while TSA reports that it  has met most of its March 2007 schedule milestones to date, the August  2007 milestone for developing memoranda of understanding and other  written agreements (e.g. service level agreements) with key Secure Flight  stakeholders (e.g. CBP) was missed and has not yet been met. TSA  officials attributed schedule slippages in part to an extension in the Secure  Flight rulemaking comment period and underestimating the time needed  to complete key activities. In addition, TSA has not conducted a schedule  risk analysis to determine the level of confidence it has in meeting the  system\u2019s completion date, and has not conducted a cost and schedule risk  assessment, consistent with best practices. The cost and schedule risk  assessment recognizes the inter-relationship between schedule and cost  and captures the risk that schedule durations and cost estimates may vary  due to, among other things, limited data, optimistic estimating, technical  challenges, lack of qualified personnel, and too few staff to do the work.  Without these assessments, TSA has less assurance that it is effectively  managing risk associated with Secure Flight\u2019s cost and schedule.

However,  TSA has not yet provided us with evidence that it has implemented all  aspects of the plan, including developing an inventory of risks and related  information to demonstrate that its risk management tool has been  populated and is being used to identify, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor  risk. Federal guidance and related best practices recognize the importance  of proactively managing risks during systems development and  implementation, and advocate a program\u2019s use of a risk management  plan. However, although TSA developed a risk management plan, the  agency only recently, in December 2007, established a risk management  board to manage program risks as called for by the plan.  TSA officials  stated that the risk management board has met three times since  December 2007, and, in January 2008, compiled an updated and  consolidated inventory of all program risks, including ranking and  mitigation strategies.  However, TSA officials have not provided us with  documentation identifying the board\u2019s activities and resulting risk  inventory.  Prior to December 2007, in lieu of a formal risk management  board, program officials stated that each project team addressed risks as  part of biweekly project management meetings. However, we found these  efforts to be limited in that the risks discussed did not include priority  rankings such as probability and impact, and many did not have mitigation  strategies, as required by the program\u2019s risk management plan. In  November 2007, TSA hired a risk management coordinator, a position that  had been vacant since June 2007.  According to program officials, the  coordinator has been tasked with supporting the risk management board  in implementing the risk management plan and has provided related  training for its members. Secure Flight officials stated that although they  have not fully implemented their risk management plan, they believe that  they are effectively managing program risks through the methods  previously discussed, and that over the past few months, have enhanced  their risk management efforts. However, until the risk management plan is  appropriately implemented, there is an increased chance that program  risks will not be proactively mitigated and may result in program cost  overruns, and schedule and performance shortfalls.  We will continue to  assess TSA\u2019s efforts to mange risk as part of our ongoing review of Secure  Flight.", "End-to-end test planning.  Secure Flight does not fully outline plans for  end-to-end testing in its overall test and evaluation plan, or other test  plans. Federal guidance and related best practices recommend end-to-end  testing to verify that the systems that collectively support a program like  Secure Flight will interoperate as intended in an operational environment,  either actual or simulated. We reported in March 2005 on the importance  of Secure Flight end-to-end testing and recommended that TSA perform  such testing. TSA agreed with this recommendation.  However, Secure  Flight\u2019s current test and evaluation master plan only outlines plans for  partner organizational entities (e.g., CBP for integration of international  watch-list functions) to test their respective parts of the system on their  own\u2014rather than a coordinated end-to-end test involving all parties. TSA  developed a preliminary working draft of an end-to-end testing strategy,  called the parallel testing strategy. However, the plan does not contain  provisions for (1) testing that ensures that supporting systems will operate  as intended in an operational environment, (2) definitions and dates for  key milestone activities and parties responsible for completing them, or  (3) the revision of other test plans, such as the test and evaluation master  plan, to reflect the performance of end-to-end tests. Secure Flight officials  stated that they plan to conduct full end-to-end testing of the program,  beginning in the Spring of 2008, and that they will reflect this testing in test  plans that are still under development. While we commend TSA\u2019s plans to  conduct end-to-end testing, the draft of TSA\u2019s test plan that discusses end- to-end testing does not define a scope that extends to all aspects of the  program. Until TSA has well-defined and approved end-to-end test plans  and procedures, it will be challenged in its ability to demonstrate that  Secure Flight will perform in a way that will allow it to achieve intended  program outcomes and results.  We will continue to assess TSA\u2019s testing  strategy, to include end-to-end testing, as part of our ongoing review of the  program.", "Information security. While the Secure Flight program office has  completed important steps to incorporate security into the system\u2019s  development, it has not fully completed other steps to ensure security is  effectively addressed. Federal standards and guidance identify the need to  address information security throughout the life-cycle of information  systems, and specifies a minimum set of security steps needed to  effectively incorporate security into a system during its development. The  Secure Flight program has performed several steps that incorporate  security into the system\u2019s development, including performing a security  risk assessment, identifying and documenting recommended security  control requirements, and testing and evaluating security controls for the  system and incorporating identified weaknesses in remedial action plans.  However, other steps pertaining to ensuring that security requirements are  tested, preparing security documentation, and conducting certification and  accreditation activities were not adequately completed.  For example,  security requirements planned for Release One did not always trace to test  activities for this release. Program officials stated that some security  requirements were deferred until future releases due to delays in funding  for acquiring specific hardware and other requirements require  coordination with the information system security official to verify  whether they were tested as part of security test and evaluation. In  addition, security documentation contained incorrect or incomplete  information.  To illustrate, the systems security plan did not identify all  interconnecting systems that Secure Flight will interface with, such as  those operated by the DHS Watch-List Service, the organization that will  transmit the watch-list to Secure Flight. Program officials stated that  security documentation was outdated or incorrect because there was  insufficient time to update the documentation for changes in the  computing environment and security requirements.", "Furthermore, program officials granted an authorization to operate\u2014one  of three possible accreditation decisions made in the certification and  accreditation process\u2014although the system had 46 known vulnerabilities,  including 11 high-risk and 27 moderate-risk vulnerabilities and the controls  had not yet been implemented. Federal guidance as well as DHS policy  provide for an interim authority to operate accreditation when significant  restrictions or limitations exist and certain deficiencies and corrective  actions need to be addressed within a specified period. Although security  officials identified plans of actions and milestones for addressing the  vulnerabilities within 60 and 90 days for the high and moderate risks,  respectively, given their significance, an interim authorization to operate  would be the more appropriate determination. In addition, hardware  components used to implement controls over user identity and account  management (i.e., authentication, logins and passwords, and user roles  and privileges), as well as the alternate processing site had not yet been  implemented.  Once implemented, the security controls over these  components could have an impact on the information security and,  therefore, may require a re-accreditation. Program officials chose the  authority to operate accreditation because they asserted that the DHS  Chief Information Security Officer does not allow interim authorizations. If  these security activities are not completed, there is an increased risk that  key security controls and requirements may not be fully developed, tested,  implemented or documented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and TSA Lack Performance Measures to Fully Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Redress Process, But Plan Additional Measures under Secure Flight", "paragraphs": ["DHS and TSA have not developed a complete set of performance measures  to assess the effectiveness of the redress process for passengers  inconvenienced as a result of watch-list matching. Measuring  performance allows organizations to track the progress they are making  toward their goals and gives managers critical information on which to  base decisions for improving their programs.  DHS and TSA are developing  additional measures for the redress process that they plan to implement  when Secure Flight becomes operational.", "TSA, supported by the Terrorist Screening Center, provides opportunities  for airline passengers to seek redress in cases where they experienced  inconveniences during the check-in and screening processes due to the  possibility they have been misidentified as being on or wrongly assigned to  the terrorist watch-list. The redress process enables these individuals to  file an inquiry to have erroneous information corrected in DHS systems  that may prevent future delays and inconveniences at the airport. In  February 2007, DHS established the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program  (TRIP) to serve as the central processing point within the department for  redress inquiries. TSA\u2019s Office of Transportation Security Redress (OTSR)  is responsible for reviewing redress inquiries submitted by air passengers  through TRIP.  According to a DHS official, in addition to handling redress  applications, TRIP officials review, attempt to address, and respond to  written complaint letters received from individuals who have gone through  the redress process but are still experiencing screening issues.", "TRIP and OTSR\u2019s redress program goals are to process redress  applications as quickly and as accurately as possible. However, to measure  program performance against these goals, TRIP and OTSR currently track  only one measure for redress related to the timeliness of case completion,  and do not track any performance measures related to program accuracy.   Previous GAO work identified that agencies successful in evaluating  performance had measures that used attributes from GAO\u2019s best  practices. Specifically, our previous work identified that agencies  successful in evaluating performance had measures that demonstrated  results, covered multiple priorities, provided useful information for  decision making, and successfully addressed important and varied aspects  of program performance. TRIP and OTSR officials stated that they do not  plan to develop additional performance measures, such as measures  related to accuracy of the redress process, but rather are awaiting the  implementation of Secure Flight to determine the program\u2019s impact on the  redress process before creating additional measures.  Secure Flight is  intended to reduce the inconveniences experienced by air passengers by  taking over from air carriers the responsibility for prescreening passengers  in order to ensure consistent and effective use of the cleared list, which  should impact the effectiveness of the redress process.", "In addition to TRIP and OTSR\u2019s performance measures for the redress  process, the Secure Flight program office is working with OTSR to  develop redress performance measures for the Secure Flight Program. As  we reported in February 2007, Secure Flight will use the TSA redress  process that is currently available for individuals affected by the air carrier  identity-matching processes. Secure Flight is coordinating with OTSR to  determine how this process will be integrated with other Secure Flight  requirements. Secure Flight and OTSR are jointly developing a set of  performance measures and targets covering multiple priorities for redress  that are to be implemented when Secure Flight becomes operational, and  officials told us that they will follow best practices in the development of  these measures.", "While we commend TSA for developing redress performance measures for  the Secure Flight Program, since the program is not scheduled to be  implemented until January 2009, DHS and OTSR\u2019s current redress process  lacks a complete set of measures with which they can assess performance  and make program improvements. Since measures are often the key  motivators of performance and goal achievement, the program\u2019s overall  success is at risk if all priorities are not addressed and information is not  obtained to make future adjustments and improvements to the program.  By developing and implementing measures that address all program goals  now, to include measures related to program accuracy, DHS and TSA  would have performance data that would allow them to better manage the  redress process in place today, identify and correct any weaknesses, and  help to ensure accountability towards the traveling public that the process  is effective. Moreover, such performance data would provide a baseline  against which to benchmark Secure Flight\u2019s progress and planned  improvements to the redress process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS and TSA have undertaken numerous initiatives to strengthen the  security of the nation\u2019s aviation system, and should be commended for  these efforts. More specifically, TSA developed processes to more  efficiently allocate and deploy the TSO workforce, strengthened screening  procedures, is working to develop and deploy more effective screening  technologies, strengthened the security of air cargo, and improved the  development of a program to prescreen passengers against the terrorist  watch-list.  However, opportunities exist to further strengthen these  efforts, in particular in the areas of risk management and program  planning and monitoring. Our work has shown\u2014in homeland security and  in other areas\u2014that a comprehensive risk management approach can help  inform decision makers in the allocation of finite resources to the areas of  greatest need. We are encouraged that risk management has been a  cornerstone of DHS and TSA policy, and that TSA has implemented risk- based decision making into a number of its efforts. Despite this  commitment, however, TSA will continue to face difficult decisions and  trade-offs\u2014particularly as threats to commercial aviation evolve\u2014 regarding acceptable levels of risk and the need to balance security with  efficiency and customer service. We recognize that doing so will not be  easy. In implementing a risk-based approach, DHS and TSA must also  address the challenges we identified in our work related to program  planning and monitoring. Without rigorous planning and monitoring, and  knowledge of the effectiveness of aviation security programs  implemented, DHS and TSA cannot be sure that they are focusing their  finite resources on the areas of greatest need, and that security programs  implemented are achieving their desired purpose.", "One area in which TSA has made considerable progress is in the  development and implementation of the Secure Flight Program.  Since we  last reported on the program in February 2007, TSA has instilled more  discipline and rigor into the systems development, and has completed key  development and privacy protection activities. Despite this progress,  however, it is important that TSA continue to work to strengthen the  management of the program.  TSA needs to take immediate and strong  actions to keep the program on track and increase the likelihood that it  will successfully implement Secure Flight on time, within budget and  meeting all performance expectations. We found that TSA did not fully  follow best practices for developing Secure Flight\u2019s life-cycle cost and  schedule estimates. The ability to generate reliable cost and schedule  estimates is a critical function necessary to support the Office of  Management and Budget capital programming process. Without adhering  to these best practices in the development of its cost and schedule  estimates, TSA is at risk of the Secure Flight Program experiencing cost  overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. In order to help  inform management\u2019s decisions regarding the program and assist them in  providing effective program oversight, it is also important that TSA fully  implement the provisions in the program\u2019s risk management plan to  include developing an inventory of risks and reporting the status of risks  to management. TSA should also work to plan for complete end-to-end  testing of the system to ensure that all interrelated components operate as  intended, and strengthen key security controls and activities for the  program, including ensuring that security requirements are tested and  implemented, and that security documentation is maintained and updated.   It is also important that TSA ensure that security risks are addressed in  action plans, and that security risks are appropriately monitored so that  the system is protected from unauthorized users and abuse. Finally, with  respect to passenger redress, DHS and TSA should more thoroughly assess  the effectiveness of the current redress process, to include the  development of additional performance measures that assess program  accuracy, a key goal of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To assist TSA in further strengthening the development and  implementation of the Secure Flight program, we recommend that the  Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Assistant Secretary of the  Transportation Security Administration to take the following three actions:", "Fully incorporate best practices into the development of Secure Flight  life-cycle cost and schedule estimates, to include: updating life-cycle cost and schedule estimates; demonstrating that the Secure Flight schedule has the logic in  place to identify the critical path, integrates lower level  activities in a logical manner, and identifies the level of  confidence in meeting the desired end date; and developing and implementing a plan for managing and  mitigating cost and schedule risks, including performing a  schedule risk analysis and a cost and schedule risk assessment.", "Fully implement the provisions in the program\u2019s risk management plan  to include developing an inventory of risks with prioritization and  mitigation strategies, report the status of risks and progress to  management, and maintain documentation of these efforts.", "Finalize and approve Secure Flight\u2019s end-to-end testing strategy, and  incorporate end-to-end testing requirements in other relevant test  plans, to include the test and evaluation master plan.
