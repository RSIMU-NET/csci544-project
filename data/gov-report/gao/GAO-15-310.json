Although registrations and reports  are filed through a single web portal, each chamber subsequently  receives copies of the data and follows different data-cleaning,  processing, and editing procedures before storing the data in either  individual files (in the House) or databases (in the Senate). Currently,  there is no means of reconciling discrepancies between the two  databases caused by the differences in data processing. For example,  Senate staff told us during previous reviews they set aside a greater  proportion of registration and report submissions than the House for  manual review before entering the information into the database. As a  result, the Senate database would be slightly less current than the House  database on any given day pending review and clearance.", "House staff told us during previous reviews that they rely heavily on  automated processing. In addition, while they manually review reports  that do not perfectly match information on file for a given lobbyist or client,  staff members will approve and upload such reports as originally filed by  each lobbyist, even if the reports contain errors or discrepancies (such as  a variant on how a name is spelled). Nevertheless, we do not have  reasons to believe that the content of the Senate and House systems  would vary substantially. For this review, we determined that House  disclosure data were sufficiently reliable for identifying a sample of  quarterly disclosure (LD-2) reports and for assessing whether newly filed  lobbyists also filed required reports. We used the House database for  sampling LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and the  first and second quarters of 2014, as well as for sampling year-end 2013  and mid-year 2014 political contributions (LD-203) reports. We also used  the database for matching quarterly registrations with filed reports. We did  not evaluate the Offices of the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the  House, both of which have key roles in the lobbying disclosure process.  However, we did consult with officials from each office. They provided us  with general background information at our request.", "To assess the extent to which lobbyists could provide evidence of their  compliance with reporting requirements, we examined a stratified random  sample of 100 LD-2 reports from the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and  the first and second quarters of 2014. We excluded reports with no  lobbying activity or with income or expenses of less than $5,000 from our  sampling frame. We drew our sample from 46,599 activity reports filed  for the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and the first and second quarters  of 2014 available in the public House database, as of our final download  date for each quarter.", "Our sample of LD-2 reports was not designed to detect differences over  time. However, we conducted tests of significance for changes from 2010  to 2014 for the generalizable elements of our review and found that  results were generally consistent from year to year and there were few  statistically significant changes after using a Bonferroni adjustment  to  account for multiple comparisons. These changes are identified in the  report. While the results provide some confidence that apparent  fluctuations in our results across years are likely attributable to sampling  error, the inability to detect significant differences may also be related to  the nature of our sample, which was relatively small and was designed  only for cross-sectional analysis.", "A Bonferroni adjustment is a statistical adjustment designed to reduce the chance of  making a type 1 inferential error, that is, concluding that a difference exists when it is  instead an artifact of sampling error. The adjustment raises the threshold for concluding  that any single difference is \u201cstatistically significant\u201d so that overall the chance of making  at least one type-1 error when making multiple comparisons does not exceed a specified  level. population value for 95 percent of the samples that we could have drawn.  The percentage estimates for LD-2 reports have a 95 percent confidence  intervals of within plus or minus 12.1 percentage points or less of the  estimate itself.", "We contacted all the lobbyists and lobbying firms in our sample and,  using a structured web-based survey, asked them to confirm key  elements of the LD-2 and whether they could provide documentation for  key elements in their reports, including  the amount of income reported for lobbying activities;  the amount of expenses reported on lobbying activities;  the names of those lobbyists listed in the report;  the houses of Congress and federal agencies that they lobbied and  the issue codes listed to describe their lobbying activity.", "After reviewing the survey results for completeness, we conducted  interviews with the lobbyists and lobbying firms to review documentation  they reported as having on their online survey for selected elements of  their LD-2 report.", "Prior to each interview, we conducted a search to determine whether  lobbyists properly disclosed their covered position as required by the  LDA. We reviewed the lobbyists\u2019 previous work histories by searching  lobbying firms\u2019 websites, LinkedIn, Leadership Directories, Legistorm, and  Google. Prior to 2008, lobbyists were only required to disclose covered  official positions held within 2 years of registering as a lobbyist for the  client. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007  amended that time frame to require disclosure of positions held 20 years  before the date the lobbyists first lobbied on behalf of the client. Lobbyists  are required to disclose previously held covered official positions either on  the client registration (LD-1) or on an LD-2 report. Consequently, those  who held covered official positions may have disclosed the information on  the LD-1 or a LD-2 report filed prior to the report we examined as part of  our random sample. Therefore, where we found evidence that a lobbyist  previously held a covered official position, and it was not disclosed on the  LD-2 report under review, we conducted an additional review of the  publicly available Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the House database  to determine whether the lobbyist properly disclosed the covered official  position on a prior report or LD-1. Finally, if a lobbyist appeared to hold a  covered position that was not disclosed, we asked for an explanation at  the interview with the lobbying firm to ensure that our research was  accurate.", "In previous reports, we reported the lower bound of a 90 percent  confidence interval to provide a minimum estimate of omitted covered  positions and omitted contributions with a 95 percent confidence level.  We did so to account for the possibility that our searches may have failed  to identify all possible omitted covered positions and contributions. As we  have developed our methodology over time, we are more confident in the  comprehensiveness of our searches for these items. Accordingly, this  report presents the estimated percentages for omitted contributions and  omitted covered positions, rather than the minimum estimates. As a  result, percentage estimates for these items will differ slightly from the  minimum percentage estimates presented in prior reports.", "In addition to examining the content of the LD-2 reports, we confirmed  whether the most recent LD-203 reports had been filed for each firm and  lobbyist listed on the LD-2 reports in our random sample. Although this  review represents a random selection of lobbyists and firms, it is not a  direct probability sample of firms filing LD-2 reports or lobbyists listed on  LD-2 reports. As such, we did not estimate the likelihood that LD-203  reports were appropriately filed for the population of firms or lobbyists  listed on LD-2 reports.", "To determine if the LDA\u2019s requirement for lobbyists to file a report in the  quarter of registration was met for the third and fourth quarters of 2013  and the first and second quarters of 2014, we used data filed with the  Clerk of the House to match newly filed registrations with corresponding  disclosure reports. Using an electronic matching algorithm that includes  strict and loose text matching procedures, we identified matching  disclosure reports for 2,659, or 90 percent, of the 2,950 newly filed  registrations. We began by standardizing client and lobbyist names in  both the report and registration files (including removing punctuation and  standardizing words and abbreviations, such as \u201ccompany\u201d and \u201cCO\u201d).  We then matched reports and registrations using the House identification  number (which is linked to a unique lobbyist-client pair), as well as the  names of the lobbyist and client.", "For reports we could not match by identification number and standardized  name, we also attempted to match reports and registrations by client and  lobbyist name, allowing for variations in the names to accommodate  minor misspellings or typos. For these cases, we used professional  judgment to determine whether cases with typos were sufficiently similar  to consider as matches. We could not readily identify matches in the  report database for the remaining registrations using electronic means.", "To assess the accuracy of the LD-203 reports, we analyzed stratified  random samples of LD-203 reports from the 30,524 total LD-203 reports.  The first sample contains 80 reports of the 9,787 reports with political  contributions and the second contains 80 reports of the 20,737 reports  listing no contributions. Each sample contains 40 reports from the year- end 2013 filing period and 40 reports from the midyear 2014 filing period.  The samples from 2014 allow us to generalize estimates in this report to  either the population of LD-203 reports with contributions or the reports  without contributions to within a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or  minus 9.5 percentage points or less. Although our sample of LD-203  reports was not designed to detect differences over time, we conducted  tests of significance for changes from 2010 to 2014 and found no  statistically significant differences after adjusting for multiple  comparisons.", "While the results provide some confidence that apparent fluctuations in  our results across years are likely attributable to sampling error, the  inability to detect significant differences may also be related to the nature  of our sample, which was relatively small and designed only for cross- sectional analysis. We analyzed the contents of the LD-203 reports and  compared them to contribution data found in the publicly available  Federal Elections Commission\u2019s (FEC) political contribution database. We  consulted with staff at FEC responsible for administering the database.  We determined that the data is sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We compared the FEC-reportable contributions reporting on the LD-203  reports with information in the FEC database. The verification process  required text and pattern matching procedures so we used professional  judgment when assessing whether an individual listed is the same  individual filing an LD-203. For contributions reported in the FEC  database and not on the LD-203 report, we asked the lobbyists or  organizations to explain why the contribution was not listed on the LD-203  report or to provide documentation of those contributions. As with covered  positions on LD-2 disclosure reports, we cannot be certain that our review  identified all cases of FEC-reportable contributions that were  inappropriately omitted from a lobbyist\u2019s LD-203 report. We did not  estimate the percentage of other non-FEC political contributions that were  omitted because they tend to constitute a small minority of all listed  contributions and cannot be verified against an external source.", "To identify challenges to compliance, we used a structured web-based  survey and obtained the views from 93 different lobbying firms included in  our sample on any challenges to compliance. The number of different  lobbying firms total 93 and is less than our sample of 100 reports because  some lobbying firms had more than one LD-2 report included in our  sample. We calculated our responses based on the number of different  lobbying firms that we contacted rather than the number of interviews.  Prior to our calculations, we removed the duplicate lobbying firms based  on the most recent date of their responses. For those cases with the  same response date, the decision rule was to keep the cases with the  smallest assigned case identification number. To obtain their views, we  asked them to rate their ease with complying with the LD-2 disclosure  requirements using a scale, of \u201cvery easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat easy,\u201d \u201csomewhat  difficult,\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d In addition, using the same scale we asked  them to rate the ease of understanding the terms associated with LD-2  reporting requirements.", "To describe the resources and authorities available to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office for the District of Columbia (USAO) and its efforts to improve its  enforcement of the LDA, we interviewed officials from USAO. We  obtained information on the capabilities of the system officials established  to track and report compliance trends and referrals, and other practices  established to focus resources on enforcement of the LDA. USAO  provided us with updated reports from the tracking system on the number  and status of referrals and chronically noncompliant lobbyists and  lobbying firms.", "The mandate does not require us to identify lobbyists who failed to  register and report in accordance with the LDA requirements, or  determine for those lobbyists who did register and report whether all  lobbying activity or contributions were disclosed.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2014 to March 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
