The largest increase in absolute spending across all  allowances during this period, as well as the largest single allowance  expenditure, was for the education allowance ($39.7 million). While the  overall spending for dependent education increased each year, State  officials noted that the spending on this allowance varied by post and year  based on the number of dependent children of overseas employees and  increasing education costs at some posts. The largest decrease in  absolute spending across all allowances during this period was for the  post allowance ($21.1 million).

They explained that, as of  August 22, 2017, a limited number of posts in Canada and Switzerland  relied primarily on the living quarters allowance, as opposed to U.S.  government-provided housing. For the extraordinary quarters  allowance, State officials explained that short-term, unexpected facilities  issues that render a house uninhabitable\u2014such as water damage, mold  remediation, or fire\u2014cause variations in spending.
