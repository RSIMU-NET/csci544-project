It assesses (1) the roles and responsibilities of agency priority goal leaders in managing goal progress and the extent to which they are held accountable for goal achievement; (2) the extent to which goal leaders collaborate with other programs and agencies that contribute to APG achievement; and (3) any challenges and practices identified by goal leaders, and the extent to which they exchange this information with their peers.", "To address all three objectives, GAO examined nearly half (47 of 103) of the APGs for 2012 and 2013, and analyzed relevant documentation. GAO also interviewed the goal leaders and other relevant officials for each of the 47 selected goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agency priority goal leaders GAO interviewed were generally highly-placed within their agencies\u2014for example, several were heads of agencies\u2014and reported a range of responsibilities related to managing agency priority goals (APG), such as laying out goal strategies. A majority of the goal leaders said the goal leader designation had benefits for their APGs, such as greater visibility for the goal. Several also believed that there were benefits to designating the goal leader position in conjunction with other requirements from the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), such as reviewing priority goal progress at least quarterly. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs agencies to appoint deputy goal leaders. Deputy goal leaders manage day-to-day implementation of APGs and provide continuity in the event of goal leader turnover. From the time the APGs were published in February 2012 to the end of fiscal year 2013 (when they were to have been achieved), about 40 percent of the APGs GAO examined had a change in goal leader, while about 30 percent had a change in the deputy position. In addition, although most of the 46 goal leaders GAO interviewed had formal deputy goal leaders in place, 11 (24 percent) did not. Without a designated deputy goal leader, agencies lack a formally designated official to fill a key role in goal implementation. Individual performance plans are one of several mechanisms to provide goal leader and deputy goal leader accountability for APGs. Most goal leaders and all deputy goal leaders had performance plans. These plans covered a range of responsibilities, but generally did not fully reflect their APGs. In fact, many did not refer to the APG. Performance plans that link more directly to APGs could help ensure that officials are evaluated on and held responsible for APG progress and outcomes.", "Goal leaders collaborated with officials from outside their agencies to drive progress on APGs. However, some goal leaders reported that these outside contributors were not included in the quarterly performance reviews. Goal leaders also reported that a variety of different types of programs, such as grant and regulatory programs, contributes to their APGs. However, they reported few mechanisms for sharing information with other agencies related to assessing these programs. Further, for a variety of reasons agencies have focused less attention on identifying the tax expenditures that contribute to their APGs. These findings are consistent with prior recommendations GAO made to OMB regarding GPRAMA implementation. OMB has taken some steps to address the recommendations.", "Goal leaders identified some common challenges and practices in managing APGs, but shared this information to a limited extent. For example, goal leaders commonly cited resource constraints as a challenge, and practices related to measuring goal progress as helpful. One of the roles of the Performance Improvement Council (PIC), a council made up of agency performance improvement officers and chaired by OMB, is to facilitate information exchange. The PIC has shared tools and information with goal leaders; however PIC staff's primary points of contact are agencies' performance improvement officers and their deputies. Overall, goal leaders and their deputies have had little direct interaction with the PIC. More direct outreach from PIC staff could facilitate information sharing among goal leaders and their deputies, and help ensure that they do not miss opportunities to better manage their APGs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OMB work with agencies to (1) ensure that they appoint deputy goal leaders; and (2) more clearly link goal leaders' and deputies' performance plans to APGs, and work with the PIC to further involve goal leaders and deputies in information-sharing related to APGs.

Congress took steps to promote  leadership involvement and accountability in the federal government  when it updated the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA) with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA), which  established certain leadership roles in law and provided the officials in  these roles with responsibilities for various aspects of performance  management. One of the key leadership roles under GPRAMA is the  agency priority goal leader. Individuals in this role are responsible for the  achievement of agency priority goals (APG), which are to reflect  agencies\u2019 highest priorities.

GPRAMA also directs agencies to describe how goals are to be  achieved, including the processes, training, skills and technology, and the  human, capital, information, and other resources and strategies required  to meet them. In addition, they are to identify performance indicators to be  used in measuring progress, among other things. The first round of  APGs was publicly reported in February 2012, and they were to be  completed by the end of fiscal year 2013. New APGs, for 2014 and  2015, were published on Performance.gov in March 2014.

Most (28) of the 46 goal leaders we interviewed  were in career positions and the remainder (18) were political appointees.  This high placement of goal leaders is consistent with OMB guidance,  which states that goal leaders should be officials with the authority to  coordinate across an agency or program.

For example, the Associate Administrator of the Office of Disaster  Assistance at the Small Business Administration (SBA), who is also the  goal leader for the Process Disaster Assistance Applications Efficiently  APG, told us that he and others at SBA started developing strategies and  targets in 2011, prior to the beginning of the fiscal year 2012-2013 agency  priority goal cycle. He said that it was important to consider reasonable  targets as part of setting and implementing the APG. This meant  determining a feasible target for the percentage of disaster assistance  applications the agency would aim to receive electronically as part of goal  setting. SBA reported on Performance.gov that the rate of applications  filed electronically had more than doubled from fiscal year 2011 to 2013,  when 55 percent of applications were filed electronically. In addition, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Fiscal Assistant Secretary, who  was also the goal leader for the agency\u2019s Increase Electronic  Transactions with the Public to Improve Service, Prevent Fraud, and  Reduce Costs APG, said that a significant part of his work involved  providing information to the public through press releases and working  with consumer and community groups to make them aware of the  changes coming with regard to electronic transactions. Treasury officials  provided us with examples of press releases and other public  communications, as well as a list of the Fiscal Assistant Secretary\u2019s  meetings with advocacy groups and other stakeholders related to the  goal.

Goal  leaders and other officials identified one or more benefits that derived  from the designation, frequently saying that it provided greater visibility for  the goal, facilitated coordination, heightened focus on the goal, or  improved access to resources. For example, a deputy goal leader at the  Federal Railroad Administration, part of DOT, said that goal leader and  deputy goal leader designations are valuable in the context of competing  priorities at the department. He said that the designation and related  requirements elevate the goal, provide additional structure, and  communicate the department\u2019s commitment to it.

Education also reported that  under the APG focusing on improved outcomes, 24 states implemented  plans to collect and report disaggregated data on children entering public  school kindergarten as part of a comprehensive assessment system.", "About a third of the goal leaders we interviewed told us that the goal  leader designation did not affect goal achievement. In several cases, goal  leaders noted the difficulty they had differentiating their role as goal  leader from the work they would otherwise be doing as part of their other  roles. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s  (HUD) Acting Assistant Secretary of the Office of Community Planning  and Development, who was one of the goal leaders for the agency\u2019s  Reducing Homelessness APG, told us that the goal leader designation  was more a description of his continuing role leading agency efforts on  homelessness rather than a significant change in responsibility or  position.

Primarily, it is due to the  importance of having a person in place who is close to the work being  done on APGs and who can spend the time needed to implement and  follow up on related tasks. OMB staff said that the agency sees the  deputy goal leader as the person who can perform the important function  of connecting APG leadership and strategy with actual implementation.  OMB also directed agencies to appoint deputy goal leaders because the  position may help provide continuity in the event that the goal leader  leaves the agency, and also provides a point of contact for OMB,  particularly in situations in which the designated goal leader is very highly  placed in the agency. OMB staff told us that OMB does not monitor  whether agencies formally designate deputies or systematically collect  information, including contact information, on them.

They covered a range of responsibilities, but many did not  reference the APG at all, and few of them explicitly held goal leaders  responsible for goal outcomes. Specifically, less than half (12 of 32) of the  plans specified that the official was responsible for the APG, and 1 of the  32 linked goal leaders\u2019 performance standards to goal outcomes.

Some of these were related to  GPRAMA requirements. For example, more than a quarter (14 of 46) of  goal leaders identified practices related to measuring goal progress, such  as assigning responsibility for meeting milestones, as helpful in managing  APGs. GPRAMA states that APGs are to have clearly defined quarterly  milestones and balanced performance measures for assessing goal  progress. Goal leaders emphasized the importance of not only  developing measures but developing ones that are meaningful and  reliable indicators of goal progress. For example, the Chief Operating  Officer at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), who led the  agency\u2019s Ensure High Quality Federal Employees APG, said that she had  worked to make sure the agency used appropriate and consistent  measures to track goal progress. Other commonly-cited practices  include several related to coordination across an agency or program,  which OMB guidance specifies that goal leaders should have the  authority to do. Goal leaders noted effective methods of coordination such  as reaching out to agency field staff, employee unions, and non-federal  entities. Goal leaders also identified practices that stem from the  GPRAMA requirement that agencies review APG progress quarterly. As  noted earlier, goal leaders cited benefits from quarterly performance  review (QPR) meetings, which they said have promoted coordination,  accountability, and attention to goal progress, and have provided  opportunities to get feedback directly from agency leaders.", "Goal leaders reported that they share information on APG challenges and  practices for managing their goals, although information sharing outside  of their agencies is generally limited to officials with whom they are  already working. They reported several examples of sharing information  within their agencies, most frequently through agency meetings, such as  QPRs.

DOL officials stated that our  report implies that DOL\u2019s practice of conducting separate reviews of  safety and health agencies is a barrier to coordination of efforts to  achieve the shared APG. In response, we made changes to the draft  report to include the DOL officials\u2019 views on the purposes of their  separate reviews. Regardless of the formats of agencies\u2019 performance  reviews, however, both OMB guidance and our prior work emphasize  the importance of including relevant contributors to APGs in these  reviews.", "DOL officials stated that they believe our report gives the incorrect  impressions that 1) organizing QPRs by components is a  shortcoming, and 2) the sole purpose of QPRs is to manage APGs.  As we previously explained, we do not take issue with DOL holding  QPRs by component, and agree with DOL officials that this format is  not a shortcoming. We also agree that QPRs may focus on broader  issues than APGs. For both of these issues, what is important is that  QPRs include relevant APG contributors.", "DOL officials commented on our discussion of including external  parties in QPRs. They stated that they have other sufficient ways of  collaborating with outside contributors. They do not believe it would be  beneficial to include stakeholders with very specific concerns in a  detailed policy and operations review of all agency component  performance management issues in these reviews. In response, we  clarified in the report that both OMB guidance and our prior work  emphasized including relevant external goal contributors in these  performance reviews.", "DOL officials stated that they consider figure 1, which lists goal leader  competencies identified by OPM, to be misleading because it implies  that the goal leader position is new. They suggested that we remove  the figure. They referenced our finding that some officials were  already serving in a similar role before becoming goal leaders. While  this is true, the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 established the goal  leader position in law and assigned specific responsibilities to goal  leaders. Figure 1 depicts the goal leader competencies described in  OPM\u2019s January 2012 memorandum for chief human capital officers.  So, we retained this figure in the report.", "DOL officials raised concerns about whether the report includes  sufficient evidence to support our conclusion that additional OMB and  Performance Improvement Council (PIC) outreach to goal leaders and  deputies would improve goal management. As we stated in the report,  while we acknowledged that the PIC has already conducted some  limited outreach to agency goal leaders, we found that goal leaders  and their deputies could benefit from additional information sharing  facilitated by the PIC. OMB staff agreed with our recommendation  related to this finding, so we did not make any changes to the report  to address this concern.", "Finally, DOL officials recommended removing or revising our  recommendation that OMB ensure that agencies have deputy goal  leaders in place because they felt it implies that the designation of a  deputy drives goal achievement. Our recommendation is based on  several factors, including OMB guidance requiring agencies to assign  deputy goal leaders, and OMB staff\u2019s view that deputies perform the  important function of connecting APG leadership and strategy with  implementation, as discussed in our report. Furthermore, OMB staff  agreed with this recommendation, so we did not make any changes to  the report to address this concern.", "The following agencies had no comments on the draft report: Department  of Agriculture, Army Corps of Engineers \u2013 Civil Works, Department of  Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education,  Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, General  Services Administration, Department of Homeland Security, Department  of Housing and Urban Development, Department of the Interior,  Department of Justice, National Science Foundation, Small Business  Administration, Social Security Administration, Department of State,  Department of Transportation, Department of the Treasury, U.S. Agency  for International Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

This report is part of a series of reviews planned  around the requirement. The objectives of this report are to: (1) evaluate  the roles and responsibilities of agency priority goal leaders in managing  goal progress and the extent to which they are held accountable for  achievement of priority goals; (2) review the extent to which priority goal  leaders collaborate with other programs and agencies that contribute to  the achievement of the priority goals; and (3) describe any challenges  and practices identified by priority goal leaders in managing goals, and  evaluate the extent to which they exchange this information with other  priority goal leaders.", "To achieve our objectives, we focused our review on the goal leaders for  a random sample of agency priority goals (APG) for 2012 and 2013.  There were 103 APGs for 2012 and 2013, across 24 agencies. The  number of APGs per agency ranged from two to eight. The sample we  selected included nearly half (47) of these APGs. We chose our sample  to ensure that it included at least one goal from each of the 24 agencies  and approximately half of the total number of APGs per agency. Although  our sample represented a significant portion of APGs and goal leaders,  we did not generalize information to the population of APGs or goal  leaders. Appendix I includes a list of the APGs in our sample and the  associated goal leaders we interviewed.", "To inform our work on all three objectives, we reviewed GPRAMA and  related Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, along with  our prior work on performance management roles, APGs, and  interagency collaboration. We also reviewed information on APGs and  goal leaders published on Performance.gov, a government-wide  performance website. We used information from Performance.gov  throughout the engagement, but all references to data from  Performance.gov in this report are as of May 23, 2014, the date we most  recently downloaded information from the website. To assess the  reliability of APG information available through Performance.gov, we  collected information from agencies and reviewed relevant documentation  and our prior work. We concluded that information from the website was  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of drawing our sample of APGs and  providing contextual information on APGs. We did not evaluate agency  data on goal progress to determine if APG progress they described to us  and on Performance.gov was accurate. But, we did ask agency officials to  verify information on goal progress we report from Performance.gov.", "We conducted semistructured interviews with the goal leaders for 43 of  the 47 APGs in our sample, for a total of 46 goal leaders. The number of  goal leaders does not equal the number of goals because some goals  had more than one leader, while some goal leaders were responsible for  more than one goal in our sample. In most cases where there was more  than one goal leader, we interviewed all goal leaders. The one exception  was for a goal for which the agency had identified two goal leaders, but  noted that one was the primary goal leader. In that case, we only  interviewed that official. The goal leaders for the other four APGs in our  sample had either left their agencies or were about to leave at the time of  our interviews. For these goals, we interviewed other agency officials who  were knowledgeable about the goals, such as deputy goal leaders and  performance management staff. Two of the departing goal leaders  provided us with written responses to our questions. We also interviewed  Performance Improvement Council (PIC) and OMB staff.", "To address our first objective, we obtained and analyzed documentation  from goal leaders related to their roles and responsibilities, such as  records showing how they track and communicate goal progress. We also  obtained individual performance plans from all goal leaders and deputy  goal leaders who had relevant plans\u201432 goal leaders and 35 deputy goal  leaders\u2014and analyzed them to understand how they are used to hold  officials accountable for goal progress. We focused our analysis on how  closely expectations in the plans were aligned to the APG for which the  officials were responsible. Specifically, we evaluated (1) whether the  plans specify that officials are responsible for the APG; (2) whether  performance standards are linked to APG outcomes; (3) if the plans  include broad responsibilities for an office or mission area under which  the APG is likely to fall; and (4) if they hold officials responsible for one or  more activities that could contribute to progress on the APG. To assess  goal leader and deputy goal leader performance plans, we reviewed our  prior work on individual and organizational performance. We also  reviewed our prior work on data-driven performance reviews (also  referred to as quarterly performance reviews) as part of our examination  of accountability mechanisms for goal achievement and goal leaders\u2019  collaboration. We also reviewed Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  guidance and regulations on performance management, although we  recognize that not all of the performance plans we reviewed were within  the coverage of OPM guidance and regulations. To further address this  objective, we also included questions in our interviews with goal leaders  about their roles and responsibilities, deputy goal leader roles and  responsibilities, accountability for goal achievement, and their  assessments of the effects of the goal leader designation. We also  included related questions in our interview with OMB and PIC staff.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and analyzed  documentation from goal leaders related to collaboration, such as  minutes and agenda of meetings during 2012 and 2013 at which APGs  were discussed, and records of agency analysis of different program  types that contribute to APGs, such as grants. To determine how  agencies are identifying and analyzing the contribution of tax  expenditures to their APGs, we identified five APGs in our sample that   For this subset of APGs,  have a close connection to tax expenditures.we included questions during our interviews with goal leaders and their  staff about agencies\u2019 consideration of tax expenditures. We also asked  goal leaders about how they coordinate within and outside of their  agencies, and how they identify and analyze the contributions of different  program types. We asked related questions in our interview with OMB  and PIC staff.", "To address our third objective, we obtained and analyzed examples of  ways in which goal leaders shared information, such as talking points  used at presentations and copies of e-mail between agencies and OMB  and the PIC. We included questions in our interviews with goal leaders  about what they consider to be promising practices and lessons learned  in managing APGs, and the extent to which they and deputy goal leaders  share this type of information within and outside of their agencies. We  also asked OMB and PIC staff about actions the PIC has taken to reach  out to and facilitate information exchange among goal leaders.", "We conducted our work from June 2013 to July 2014 in accordance with  generally accepted government audit standards.
