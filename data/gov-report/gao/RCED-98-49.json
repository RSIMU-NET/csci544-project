For a map showing the locations of some of the Indian reservations on which trust lands are located, see appendix II.", "There are two major ownership categories for land held in trust by the federal government for Native Americans: (1) tribal trust and (2) individual trust. Tribal trust lands are areas set aside and held in trust by the federal government for the use and benefit of tribes. Individual trust lands are areas set aside by tribes or, in some cases, by the federal government that are held in trust by the federal government for the use and benefit of individual Native Americans. Of the approximately 55 million acres of trust lands, about 45 million are tribal trust lands, and 10 million are individual trust lands. All trust lands are subject to federal restrictions against alienation and encumbrance.", "In general, land is privately held without restrictions and can be used as collateral for the repayment of a mortgage loan. However, Native American trust lands generally cannot be transferred to non-Native Americans, which prevents Native Americans from using trust lands as collateral for mortgage loans. Only individual trust lands can be transferred to non-Native Americans and then only with the consent of the Native American landowner and approval by the Secretary of the Interior or an authorized representative. With these approvals, individual Native American trust lands can be used as collateral for mortgage loans.", "Pervasive joblessness and low wages have led to high poverty rates among Native Americans living on reservations. Half of these Native Americans have incomes below the poverty line. Also, the latest information available shows that in 1991, the average unemployment rate on 30 reservations with populations of 3,000 or more was 46 percent, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). BIA estimated that in 1990 only 25 percent of employed Native Americans living on or near reservations earned $7,000 or more annually, compared with 75 percent of the general U.S. population. In addition, housing conditions on Native American trust lands are much worse than those in other areas of the country: 40 percent of Native Americans on trust lands live in overcrowded or physically inadequate housing, compared with 6 percent of the overall U.S. population.", "Federal agencies provide nearly all of the housing\u2014both owner-occupied and rental\u2014developed on Native American trust lands. Four federal agencies\u2014the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), BIA, and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Housing Service (RHS)\u2014provide housing assistance through grants, subsidies, and loan guarantees and insurance. HUD provides the largest amount of assistance. From fiscal year 1986 through fiscal year 1995, HUD provided $4.3 billion (constant 1995 dollars) for housing and community development in tribal areas. Of this amount, HUD provided $3.9 billion to approximately 189 Indian housing authorities to develop and maintain affordable housing and to assist low-income renters. The authorities used those funds to construct over 24,000 single-family homes, to operate and maintain existing housing, and to encourage other development. Over the decade, HUD also provided direct block grants totaling more than $424 million to eligible tribes for community development and mortgage assistance. Appendix III contains a more detailed description of federal programs providing homeownership and rental assistance specifically to Native Americans.", "HUD\u2019s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and VA also operate programs that provide lenders with guarantees and insurance on personal property loans made to Native Americans for manufactured homes. According to the 1990 Census, 14 percent of Native American households on reservations lived in manufactured homes. The corresponding rate for all households in the United States was 7 percent and for Native American households not on reservations, 12 percent. Manufactured homes are primarily purchased with personal property loans, which may be easier to obtain than home purchase loans, especially for those who live in remote areas, have low incomes, or have inadequate credit histories. According to a 1995 Manufactured Housing Institute survey of lenders making manufactured home loans, about 92 percent of the loans were for the homes only, while 8 percent financed both the home and the land.

Officials of three of the eight lenders told us they are large or medium-sized regional lenders, while officials from the other five told us they are small community lenders.", "Home purchase loans of any type made to Native Americans on trust lands, not just conventional home purchase loans, have been few in number. Even when home purchase loans can be nearly fully guaranteed or insured by HUD against loss, lenders have made few loans to Native Americans on trust lands. For example, HUD operates two mortgage guarantee and insurance programs specifically to foster Native American homeownership; but, as of September 30, 1997, lenders had made only 128 loans on trust lands since the inception of these programs in 1983 and 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Barriers Exist to Conventional Home Purchase Lending to Native Americans on Trust Lands", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, many studies and reports have documented the legal, social, and geographical barriers to financing conventional home purchase loans for Native Americans on trust lands.

The most significant barriers are that lenders (1) are uncertain about whether they can foreclose on Native American trust lands to recover their loan funds; (2) have difficulty understanding the implications of the different types of land ownership because of the complex status of Native American trust lands; (3) are unfamiliar with the tribal courts in which litigation is conducted in the event of a foreclosure; and (4) are concerned about the absence of housing ordinances governing foreclosures in tribal communities.", "While some of these barriers also apply to home purchase loans guaranteed or insured by the federal government, lenders are generally not as concerned about their risk on such loans because the federal government protects them against losses.

This uncertainty is created by the inalienable status of trust lands, which can prevent individuals from using the land for loan collateral. For example, in May 1996, the Urban Institute reported that the primary legal obstacle lenders perceived in making mortgage loans to Native Americans on trust lands is the difficulty in recovering outstanding loan amounts in cases of default. Reports by the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Housing in 1992 and the Presidential Commission on Indian Reservation Economies in 1984 also stated that lenders are concerned about loan security and their ability to reclaim assets in cases of foreclosure on trust lands.

On many reservations, the different types of land ownership create a \u201ccheckerboard\u201d pattern of ownership. As discussed previously, there are two major ownership categories for land held in trust by the federal government for Native Americans: tribal trust and individual trust. In addition, reservations can also include privately held lands, which do not have the same restrictions as trust lands. These types of land ownership create jurisdictional problems as each type is subject to different laws\u2014frequently a significant source of uncertainty to private lenders in encumbrancing property.", "Trust lands\u2019 ownership status is further complicated by the differences in the appropriate collateral for mortgages. Generally, lenders secure mortgage loans with ownership interests in real property or leaseholds.The trust lands\u2019 ownership status\u2014tribal or individual\u2014determines whether home buyers can secure loans involving these lands by using ownership interests in the property or leaseholds. Loans involving tribal trust lands can be secured by leasehold interests, but federal law generally prohibits a lender from obtaining an ownership interest in such lands. In an attempt to make it easier for Native Americans to finance homes on tribal trust lands, recent legislation increased the leasehold period from 25 to 50 years. For individual trust lands\u2014lands given to individuals by a tribe or the federal government\u2014lenders may secure the individual\u2019s ownership interest in the property with the Native American landowner\u2019s and BIA\u2019s approval.

The Community Investment Program provides long-term mortgage funds essentially at cost to lenders to facilitate homeownership for households with incomes below 115 percent of the area median. Both programs, which are paid for by the FHLBank System\u2019s earnings, can be used with federal guarantee or insurance programs to support a private lender\u2019s home purchase lending. In addition, a tribal housing corporation, Indian housing authority, or tribally designated housing entity may become a nonmember mortgagee of the particular FHLBank serving the area and become eligible for advances (loans) directly from the FHLBank.

The act contains provisions that allow tribes to leverage grant funds and to extend land lease terms from 25 to 50 years. However, whether tribes can or will use leveraged funds to encourage conventional home purchase lending on trust lands is uncertain, and many tribes\u2019 land lease terms already exceeded 25 years.", "A major objective of NAHASDA, which became effective October 1, 1997, is to promote the development of private capital markets and to allow those markets to operate and grow. To accomplish this objective, NAHASDA authorizes HUD to make block grants to tribes that submit housing plans that comply with the program\u2019s requirements. Tribes that receive block grant funds will be able to leverage some of the funds by creating partnerships with private lenders for the acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of affordable housing. However, NAHASDA does not require tribes to use leveraged grant funds to encourage conventional home purchase lending on trust lands. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for HUD\u2019s Office of Native American Programs told us that while NAHASDA will provide additional housing to Native Americans, it is difficult to predict how tribes will use leveraged funds or whether tribes\u2019 use of such funds could result in expanded conventional home purchase lending on trust lands.", "In addition, NAHASDA amended federal law to allow for a lease term on tribal trust lands of up to 50 years. Previously, many tribes had 25-year leasing authority, which, with BIA\u2019s approval could have been renewed for another 25 years. The Comptroller of the Currency, in its in July 1997 Guide to Mortgage Lending in Indian Country, stated that there were some concerns that the former 25-year limit may have discouraged some financial institutions from extending home purchase loans on trust lands, since many loans carry a 30-year term. But whether this provision will encourage more conventional home purchase lending on Native American trust lands is questionable, according to the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary, because many tribes already had lease terms that either extended well beyond 25 years or were for 25 years with an automatic 25-year extension. The Navajo Tribe, for example, gives its members 65-year leases. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary said that she was not aware of any situation in which a private lender had not made a home purchase loan on Native American trust lands because land lease terms expired after 25 years. She told us that HUD expected to issue regulations implementing NAHASDA in early 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Privately supported opportunities for Native Americans to own homes on trust lands are limited. If private mortgage lenders made more conventional home purchase loans to Native Americans on trust lands, they could help expand homeownership opportunities and reduce the burden on government agencies to design, administer, and finance special homeownership programs for these Americans. However, formidable barriers exist, such as limitations on the use of trust lands as collateral. Nevertheless, homeownership initiatives undertaken by a few private lenders and some public and private organizations demonstrate that there is some potential for overcoming these barriers.", "While these efforts are noteworthy, conventional home purchase loans are unlikely to become a major source of financing for Native Americans on trust lands. Even if the barriers to conventional home purchase lending are eliminated, the economic status of many Native Americans on trust lands may preclude them from qualifying for these loans. The small number of home purchase loans made to Native Americans on trust lands, even when private lenders are protected against most losses by federal mortgage guarantee and insurance programs, illustrates the limited potential for conventional home purchase loans for Native Americans on trust lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided the departments of the Interior and Housing and Urban Development with a draft of this report for their review and comment.

Specifically, Interior stated that the limitations discussed in our report are the concerns of private mortgage lenders and that federal agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Farm Service Agency, routinely make farm and ranch operations loans on trust lands. Interior also commented that the Farm Service Agency also had many concerns about mortgages on trust lands, but it became knowledgeable of the process and now makes numerous loans. Private mortgage lenders need to do the same, Interior stated.", "Our assessment of the barriers to conventional home purchase financing focused on trust lands because of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs\u2019 interest in increasing homeownership opportunities for Native Americans on such lands. About 1.2 million Native Americans, or 60 percent of all Native Americans, live on trust lands or in the surrounding counties. Private mortgage lenders, as they become knowledgeable of the process of making home purchase loans on trust lands, may increase the number of such loans. However, our concern, as pointed out in our report, is whether conventional home purchase loans are likely to become a major source of financing for Native Americans on trust lands. We believe the small number of home purchase loans made to Native Americans on trust lands, even when private lenders are protected against most losses by federal mortgage guarantee and insurance programs, illustrates the limited potential for such conventional home purchase loans. Also, the farm and ranch operations loans made by the Farm Service Agency on trust lands differ in important ways from the loans that are the focus of our report\u2014conventional home purchase loans. The Farm Service Agency\u2019s loans are made or guaranteed by the federal government, which incurs all or most of the loss that may occur if the loans are not repaid. Conventional home purchase loans are made by private lenders without federal assistance, such as federal loan guarantees or insurance. Losses on these loans are absorbed by private lenders or other entities in the mortgage finance market.", "Regarding Interior\u2019s comment that three of the four barriers cited in our report\u2014(1) uncertainty about recovering funds in the event of a foreclosure, (2) unfamiliarity with the tribal court procedures associated with foreclosure, and (3) the absence of tribal housing ordinances\u2014are not related to the trust status of the lands, we believe that it is in fact because of the trust status that these barriers arise. Generally, on privately held lands, lenders are not uncertain about whether they can recover outstanding loan balances if foreclosures occur. For example, if a borrower defaults and a foreclosure results, a lender has the ability to take possession of the collateral that in many cases is the land and the improvements on that land. It should also be noted that our report discusses six barriers to conventional home purchase loans and not four as stated by Interior.", "Interior also provided us with changes that clarified information in the report on the transfer and definition of trust lands, the cost and time required to eliminate the backlog of requests for title documents, and the cost to examine titles by and the number of land ownership interests under the jurisdiction of the Aberdeen Land Titles and Records Office.

Key components of BIA\u2019s responsibilities are maintaining land ownership records and title documents and issuing title status reports to lenders certifying the legal description of tracts of trust lands.

Thus, if the certified title is not accurate and up to date, a business or financial institution that is conducting business with tribes or Native Americans either will not enter into a transaction until the certified title can be obtained or will rely on an out-of-date or inaccurate title to their detriment. In the continental United States, BIA\u2019s five Land Titles and Records Offices (LTRO)\u2014and three smaller Land Service Offices\u2014issue the certified title status reports lenders need before they make home purchase loans on trust lands. Despite a large backlog of requests for title documents, BIA\u2019s certification process for trust lands has not been a deterrent to conventional home purchase lending. When asked about barriers to lending, the four lenders that made 82 of the 91 conventional home purchase loans on trust lands during the 5-year period ending in calendar year 1996 did not identify BIA\u2019s issuance of certified title status reports as a barrier. During our visits to three of the five LTROs, we found that two of them made issuing certified title status reports for mortgages their highest priority. These LTROs\u2014Aberdeen and Portland\u2014processed certified title status report requests for conventional home purchase loans within a few days to a few weeks. The remaining LTRO we visited, Albuquerque, generally prioritized requests for certified title status reports by the dollar value of the transactions.

The Indian Land Consolidation Act, 25 U.S.C. 2201, et seq., as amended, among other things, attempted to reduce the extent of fractionization within a reservation\u2019s boundaries.

Youpee, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the amended section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act was unconstitutional. This 1997 decision will place a significant workload on BIA because the agency must modify probate court orders and title data transactions to implement the Court\u2019s decision. Administrative law judges across the country are issuing probate modification orders that direct BIA to distribute to the heirs at law thousands of real property interests that have been held in abeyance or previously distributed to the tribe involved.

As fractionation increases, processing title status reports becomes more complex and time-consuming. An analysis by the Aberdeen LTRO of a particular land allotment it administers revealed, for instance, that the number of owners had increased from 1 in 1900 to 962 in 1990, while the number of documents affecting its chain-of-title increased from 1 to 306. The Aberdeen manager estimated that with current staff levels it would cost about $4,000 and take about 141 overtime hours to examine the title of this one allotment, starting from the original trust patent.
