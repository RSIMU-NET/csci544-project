These alliances vary from a limited marketing arrangement, such as reciprocal frequent flyer programs, to more complex agreements, such as those involving \u201ccode-sharing\u201d or one partner\u2019s ownership of an equity share in the other partner\u2019s business. The airlines say that these alliances will benefit consumers through expanded route networks and combined frequent flyer programs. Others, however, say that the alliances will decrease competition, ultimately reducing passengers\u2019 choices and increasing fares. Concerned over the potential anticompetitive effects of the alliances, the Department of Transportation is reviewing them, and the Department of Justice filed suit in October 1998 to prevent Northwest from acquiring voting control of Continental. Justice did not, however, request a temporary injunction precluding the transfer of voting control.", "At your request, we have been examining the implications of these alliances. On June 4, 1998, we offered the preliminary results of our analysis in testimony before the Subcommittee on Aviation, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. This report expands on that testimony and offers more information about the implications of the alliances. As agreed with your offices, the report (1) describes the status of each of the alliances, (2) examines, for each alliance, the potential beneficial and harmful effects on consumers, and (3) examines the authority of the departments of Justice and Transportation to review these alliances and the status of their reviews."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Two or more airlines may enter into an alliance to increase their revenues and the number of passengers they carry. Code-sharing is one type of alliance. It can be an important marketing tool for airlines because it allows the code-sharing partners to replicate the \u201cseamless travel\u201d that can be provided by a single airline, known as \u201con-line\u201d service. Airline passengers prefer this type of service because it allows the convenience of single ticketing and check-in, among other things. For a code-sharing flight, each partner sets its own fare for the entire trip, covering both the segment it flies and the one its partner flies.", "In recent years, alliances among airlines have become very common in international aviation because they allow airlines to enter markets that would be (1) too expensive to serve with their own aircraft or (2) restricted under a bilateral aviation agreement with another nation.The Department of Transportation (DOT) reported that there were 74 active alliances between U.S. and foreign carriers as of June 1998. In the simplest case, an international code-sharing alliance links the route network of one airline with the route network of another, forming an end-to-end alliance with little overlap. Figure 1 shows how such an alliance links two airlines, one with an extensive route network in the United States and the other with an extensive route network in Europe and Africa.", "In our previous work, we found that alliances between U.S. and foreign airlines that involved code-sharing in a large number of markets did benefit the alliance partners. The alliance generated large gains for the partners in terms of passengers and revenues, mainly at the expense of other airlines. We also found that although consumers benefited from conveniences such as shorter layovers, the data were insufficient to determine the effects of the alliances on fares in the short term and on competition and fares in the long term.", "Domestically, code-sharing alliances have generally occurred between major U.S. airlines and regional commuter airlines that transport passengers, usually from smaller communities to the cities served by the major carriers. Similar to international alliances, these alliances generally link end-to-end networks without creating a significant overlap in service. For example, United Airlines has a code-sharing agreement with Atlantic Coast Airlines to bring passengers into its hub at Washington Dulles Airport. Additionally, several major U.S. airlines have used code-sharing in a limited number of markets. For example, in 1994, Continental and America West airlines entered into a limited code-sharing agreement, and in 1996, Northwest and Alaska Airlines also entered into a limited code-sharing agreement.", "The federal government has limited authority over proposed airline alliances. In the international sector, the routes that airlines can fly, the frequency of their flights, and the fares they can charge are governed by 72 bilateral agreements between the United States and other countries. Many of these agreements are very restrictive. Since the late 1970s, U.S. policy has been to negotiate agreements that substantially reduce or eliminate bilateral restrictions (\u201copen skies\u201d agreements). In the domestic sector, however, the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 generally eliminated the government\u2019s authority over airline routes, frequencies, and pricing. Under new legislation passed in October 1998, DOT has the authority to impose an initial 30-day waiting period, which it may extend another 150 days for joint ventures involving code-sharing between major airlines. This authority does not limit the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) authority to enforce the antitrust laws. DOT may also investigate whether an alliance is an unfair method of competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of the Alliances: All Three Alliances Have Been Initiated", "paragraphs": ["Since we testified in June 1998, each of the three domestic alliances has begun to implement at least part of its agreement. On November 20, 1998, Northwest and Continental announced that Northwest had completed its acquisition of the equity position in Continental. The two airlines also announced that they had revised their agreement and would implement the marketing aspects of their alliance in December 1998. United and Delta and American and US Airways have begun to implement their alliances, although the United-Delta proposal no longer includes code-sharing. Like the American-US Airways proposal, it is now limited to offering consumers reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge benefits.

According to the airlines, under the new terms of the agreement between them, Northwest will acquire less than a majority of the voting control of Continental, forgo its right to place someone on Continental\u2019s board of directors, and forgo code-sharing with Continental in certain hub-to-hub domestic markets. Continental said that to protect its stockholders, its board has adopted a shareholder rights plan that will become effective if 15 percent or more of its voting stock is acquired by a single investor.", "Nevertheless, the closing of the stock acquisition represented a major step toward implementing the \u201cstrategic global alliance\u201d that the airlines announced in January 1998 to connect their route systems. The two airlines announced that they would accept code-sharing bookings starting December 12, 1998, with code-sharing flights to Japan beginning December 29, 1998, and to other destinations beginning January 7, 1999. The code-sharing plan ultimately will include the airlines\u2019 international code-sharing partners, such as Air China and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.", "Each airline has a separate code-sharing agreement with America Westand may independently pursue other domestic alliances. The alliance will also include the airlines\u2019 regional partners, Northwest Airlink, in which Northwest holds some equity, and Continental Express, which is wholly owned by Continental. As part of the agreement, the airlines will also undertake other cooperative activities, including marketing and coordinating their flight schedules to improve connection times. Airline executives stated that they will not coordinate pricing or capacity, and they submitted their alliance proposal to DOJ under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (Hart-Scott-Rodino Act) as if it were a full merger. Northwest and Continental invited DOJ to review the transaction under its stringent merger guidelines.", "In addition, the airlines established reciprocal frequent flyer programs, allowing members to earn and redeem their miles on either carrier. Beginning December 6, 1998, members of each airline\u2019s frequent flyer programs can earn miles for travel on the other airline\u2019s flights and can begin redeeming miles on February 1, 1999, for travel beginning on March 1, 1999. Both airlines announced several changes to their frequent flyer programs, as well. For example, members will be able to redeem mileage at reduced levels and travel during off-peak times. At other award levels, the airlines will have fewer blackout dates (when frequent flyer awards may not be used). On November 21, 1998, each airline opened its club facilities to members of the other airline\u2019s clubs, thereby expanding the number of airports where members can use clubs.", "Northwest\u2019s principal service areas are the Midwest and Midsouth, while Continental\u2019s are the Northeast and Southwest.

It indicates that the Northwest-Continental alliance would carry large percentages of passengers (i.e., would have relatively large market strength) in the upper Midwest, South, and Northeast. According to the airlines, these were essentially preexisting market shares of Northwest and Continental, respectively, and the market shares in these regions did not increase materially as a result of the alliance.", "Under the alliance, the two airlines combined carry approximately 15 percent of the total domestic passenger market.

On the other hand, industry experts have said that they think competition between alliance partners will decline over time. It is difficult to determine what will happen in the future, but some experts\u2019 concerns are consistent with widely held economic principles and past experience in the airline industry. With code-sharing, the opportunity for harm increases with the number of overlapping markets and the number of passengers flying in these markets. Thus, an end-to-end alliance with few overlapping routes that serves fairly small markets is less likely to threaten competition than an alliance between partners that share a number of heavily traveled markets. In addition, under enhanced frequent flyer programs, it may be more difficult for would-be competitors to enter markets where the alliance partners already have a substantial market share, thus further limiting competition and the potential benefits of deregulation in the airline industry.", "This section examines the potential beneficial and harmful effects on consumers of the arrangement between Northwest and Continental\u2014the only one with plans for equity acquisition and code-sharing as of December 1998 (see app. II for a detailed description of our scope and methodology).

In addition, it will increase the number of flights in a market attributable to a single airline (flight frequencies) and provide better connections so that consumers can reach their destinations sooner. Finally, the alliance will give consumers more frequent flyer award destinations and access to more club facilities. At the same time, however, the alliance creates the possibility of harm for air travelers, especially over the longer term. If competition is reduced, consumers would be harmed. Specifically, should the airlines compete less vigorously or act as one entity if Northwest acquires a majority interest in Continental, then consumers could be harmed through the decrease in competition, especially on routes where both airlines previously competed.

One airline official believes that the new on-line service will divert passengers from other airlines that provide poorer connections and will stimulate new flying by passengers who previously chose not to fly. Because the alliance will convert passenger routings from interline connections to on-line connections, the official also expects the alliance partners to offer lower fares in some markets that previously could be served only on an interline basis.In turn, such lower fares will also stimulate travel on these routes.", "Because this study is limited to domestic airline alliances, we did not analyze the impact of the alliance on Northwest\u2019s and Continental\u2019s international markets. We did, however, analyze its impact on both airlines\u2019 domestic markets and included in our review new markets that would be created through routes with one or two connections. Although the airlines also included new city pairs that would be created through routings that require three connections, we did not include these markets because we believe that the number of passengers who would book flights with so many connections is relatively small.", "Our analysis showed that a code-sharing alliance between Northwest and Continental would serve considerably fewer new airport pairs than the airlines estimated. We found, first, that such an alliance could create on-line single-connection service in 74 markets that served about 400,000 passengers in 1997 (or about 15 per day per route). In 22 of these markets, the Northwest-Continental alliance would produce superior service to that already offered by a competitor. In the other 52 markets, competing airlines\u2019 existing service would be superior or at least equal to that anticipated under the alliance. At the same time, however, we found that the alliance would create no new service in any of these single-connection markets because all 74 were already served either by one of the alliance partners or by a competitor. We also found that a Northwest-Continental alliance could create 71 new double-connection markets. The Northwest-Continental alliance would provide superior service to that offered by competitors in two markets, but other competing airlines already provided superior or equal service in the other 69 markets. Table 1 provides our detailed analysis of the new on-line benefits that consumers could expect from this alliance.", "According to Northwest and Continental officials, the alliance will provide 17,446 new on-line flight opportunities in 10,459 markets that, they say, will create additional routings in existing markets, increasing convenience and choice for their passengers and reducing travel times for an estimated 250,000 passengers. For example, Northwest and Continental say that by routing passengers from Milwaukee to Honolulu through San Francisco instead of Seattle, the alliance will shorten these passengers\u2019 connection times by about 1.5 hours.", "Our limited analysis of flight frequencies suggests that the alliance could result in new, possibly improved, route options. For various technical reasons, we were unable to duplicate the model that Northwest and Continental used to calculate the number of new routing possibilities.

Travelers will not be able to combine miles from both programs to achieve an award. This reciprocal relationship should increase the value of these programs to frequent flyers because more destinations and frequencies will be available. Northwest and Continental do not expect to significantly change how they distribute frequent flyer seats, which may be different on each flight because of various market forces.

Northwest noted that its WorldPerks members will still be able to redeem free travel awards for as few as 20,000 miles within North America and that these awards will be available for travel during 9 months of the year instead of just 10 weeks. Northwest also announced a number of changes to its frequent flyer program, including fewer blackout dates (when frequent flyer awards cannot be used) for WorldPerks travel within North America.

Nevertheless, the alliance could harm consumers if it decreases competition in markets that are already served by both partners, especially in those where the alliance gives the partners a \u201cdominant\u201d market position (i.e., control of more than 50 percent of the market). Such an increase in market dominance is significant, according to industry analysts, who predicted that the partners might not be able to gain much market share overall but might be able to increase revenues\u2014presumably by raising fares\u2014in individual markets where they held a dominant position. The Northwest-Continental alliance could also increase barriers for other airlines that might want to enter particular markets. To examine the potential harm from the alliance, we determined the extent to which each airline\u2019s routes overlapped with those of its alliance partner by analyzing 1997 data on the 5,000 busiest domestic airport-pair origin and destination markets or markets for air travel between two airports. These 5,000 markets accounted for over 90 percent of the total U.S. domestic air traffic in 1997."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Suggest Partners May Not Compete Vigorously, but Airlines Say They Will", "paragraphs": ["The potential for the Northwest-Continental alliance to harm consumers depends on the features of the agreement and on whether it creates an environment that discourages competition between the two partners. Several factors could influence whether the partners cooperate rather than compete as independent entities. These factors include how much ownership one partner has in the other, how revenue from jointly operated flights is shared, whether the airlines\u2019 pricing practices change, and whether the airlines coordinate their schedules, especially if such coordination reduces the total number of flights or available seats in a market. Some of this information is contained in proprietary documents provided by Northwest and Continental to DOJ and DOT. Northwest and Continental declined to let us review these confidential documents, but we discussed various elements of the agreement with airline officials and industry experts.", "All but one of the industry experts whom we interviewed agreed that an investment such as Northwest\u2019s in Continental would be likely to affect the behavior of the airlines over time, encouraging them to cooperate in order to maximize the value of the investment to their stockholders. Some of these industry experts believed that the alliance partners would not vigorously compete with each other, particularly over the long term. If they are correct, then the alliance could have harmful effects on consumers. In contrast, officials from Northwest and Continental insist that while their alliance arrangement is in many ways like a merger, the airlines will continue to operate independently. They said that although Northwest will own the largest percentage of the voting stock in Continental, it will not own a majority of the voting stock and its voting trust agreement with Continental is such that it effectively has no ability to affect or influence the control or management of Continental for the next 10 years.", "Industry experts expressed concern that this alliance could create an environment in which the airlines would compete less vigorously even if there were no change in equity between the alliance partners. One industry expert we spoke with said that in the airline industry, where there are only a few firms and where rivals\u2019 fare and schedule information is widely available, tacit coordination is relatively easy. Some industry experts pointed out, for example, that the two airlines could cooperate on some aspects of their business. As a result, according to this expert, Northwest and Continental might not compete aggressively on fares or schedules, fares could rise, and service levels could eventually decline. In contrast, Continental and Northwest officials said that they will continue to set fares and schedules independently and that competition will not decline because of the alliance. For example, on nonstop routes that both airlines serve, Continental will receive a booking fee that is similar to a travel agent\u2019s fee (an amount equal to Continental\u2019s costs) for ticketing a passenger on a Northwest flight, but none of the revenue, and vice versa. As a result, airline officials say, each airline will have an incentive to book passengers on its own airplanes. When a passenger\u2019s travel involves segments served by both airlines, revenues will be split between the two airlines on the basis of a prorated schedule that is standard in the industry. When announcing the stock acquisition, Northwest and Continental also said that they would not implement code-sharing on the seven hub-to-hub routes that they both serve. For example, for flights from New York City to Detroit, the two would continue to compete directly.", "It is difficult to determine precisely how the alliance will affect competition, but the industry experts\u2019 concerns and the airlines\u2019 past records establish cause for concern. As discussed, there is widespread agreement among these experts that competition will likely decline over time as firms recognize their interdependence and maintain prices above the competitive level. This understanding is consistent with widely held economic principles showing that competition lessens when there are fewer competitors. It is also consistent with a recent DOT paper containing evidence that, when given the chance, airlines do not compete vigorously. According to DOT, prices on routes of less than 750 miles were generally not competitive unless a low-fare carrier, such as Southwest, served the route and kept prices closer to a competitive level. On routes not served by a low-cost carrier, major airlines have recognized their interdependence and kept prices above the competitive level. If the ties between major airlines are strengthened, the airlines will have even more opportunities to recognize their interdependence. If this occurs, competition may suffer and prices may rise."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Northwest-Continental Alliance May Decrease Competition in Certain Markets and Could Potentially Harm Consumers", "paragraphs": ["If the partners in the Northwest-Continental alliance do not vigorously compete over time, the harm to consumers will depend on the number of markets where the partners provide overlapping service (including the number of passengers served), the alliance\u2019s share of these markets, and the effects of the alliance on barriers to entry.", "The Alliance Could Reduce Competition in Shared Markets. We found that a Northwest-Continental alliance could reduce or eliminate competition in 63 of the top 5,000 markets. Nearly 2 million passengers traveled in these markets in 1997. The alliance could effectively eliminate competition in five markets, with about 36 percent of these passengers (723,186 in 1997), by reducing the number of competing airlines from two to one. The largest of these markets is Detroit to Newark, where the alliance partners served 97 percent of the market in 1997\u2014428,574 passengers. In 24 markets, the alliance could reduce the number of competitors from three to two, and it could become the largest carrier in nearly two-thirds of these markets. The markets where the alliance could decrease the number of competitors to three or fewer served approximately 1.6 million passengers in 1997. These are the markets that could suffer the greatest potential harm from the alliance. Figure 5 illustrates the number of markets and passengers with the potential to be harmed under a Northwest-Continental alliance if the partners do not price their fares independently.", "Northwest and Continental have attempted to address DOJ\u2019s concerns about competition. According to Northwest and Continental officials, the airlines have agreed not to implement code-sharing in the local hub-to-hub markets, such as Detroit to Newark, where DOJ identified potentially anticompetitive effects. While refraining from code-sharing is a positive step on the part of the airlines to address these concerns, some industry experts with whom we spoke expressed doubt about how much it would reduce the potential harm to consumers. They explained that because the alliance partners would continue to exchange information on other aspects of their operations, such as scheduling, they may not be able to act as independent competing airlines.", "To a certain extent, the harmful effects of reducing competition in some markets, assuming the alliance partners will not compete, could be mitigated by increasing competition in other markets. In 286 of the top 5,000 markets, each of the two carriers has a limited market share that, if combined, would create a larger, active competitor. These markets served a total of 15.1 million passengers in 1997. However, on average, the effect of creating this potentially stronger competitor is relatively small because some of these markets continue to be dominated by other airlines. For example, in 36 of the 286 markets where the Northwest-Continental alliance\u2019s market share will equal or exceed 10 percent, another single competitor will remain dominant. These 36 markets served 1.2 million passengers in 1997. Thus, although the alliance will create a greater presence in many markets, offering more flights and choices to travelers, the overall improvement in competition will be limited by other dominant competitors.", "The Alliance Could Create Some Additional Dominant Markets. Market share is particularly important in determining the extent to which an alliance may be harmful to consumers. Industry experts generally agree that if an airline can capture significant market share, its revenue share will increase faster than its market share; in other words, an airline can earn a fare premium because, among other reasons, it offers the high level of flight frequencies preferred especially by business travelers. Airlines that achieve a dominant market position can drive out airlines with smaller market shares by making it unprofitable for them to compete. Additionally, a number of studies have shown that markets with fewer competitors, especially those dominated by a single carrier, have higher fares. We reported in 1993, for example, that fares at concentrated airports were about 22 percent higher than fares at less concentrated airports.", "Table 2 shows how many of the top 5,000 busiest airport-pair markets in 1997 were already dominated by either Northwest or Continental, as well as how many will be dominated through the alliance\u2019s creation. Northwest dominated 325 markets and Continental dominated 142 markets. By combining the partners\u2019 market shares, the alliance will gain a majority share in 25 additional markets (an increase of 5 percent). One market, Atlanta-Newark, was relatively large, having served 1.2 million passengers in 1997 (3,205 passengers per day, on average). However, none of the other markets were relatively large; they served an average of 135 passengers per day in 1997. Markets that will be dominated by the new alliance include Atlanta-Newark and Cleveland-Phoenix.", "The Alliance Could Increase Operating and Marketing Barriers to Entry. To the extent that an alliance creates barriers to market entry, it can limit competition. If entry is easy, a single airline cannot charge monopoly prices over the long term because other airlines will enter and provide competition. However, if entry is difficult, then the airline may offer fares above competitive levels. As we have reported in the past, operating barriers such as slot controls and gate constraints (long-term leases for one airline\u2019s exclusive use of a large number of gates) have contributed to higher fares on routes to and from some airports. If the formation of an alliance further concentrated control in one entity at any of these airports, then fares might rise and the prospects of new competition at these airports might be further diminished. Similarly, marketing barriers such as frequent flyer programs and travel agent commission overrides can also inhibit competition, particularly in markets already dominated by a given airline.", "The Northwest-Continental alliance will not appreciably change the level of concentration at slot-controlled and gate-constrained airports. Northwest\u2019s hubs at Minneapolis and Detroit and Continental\u2019s hub at Newark are gate-constrained airports because Northwest and Continental control all or a majority of the leases there. However, these three airports are already heavily concentrated, and the combination of these two carriers will not change that. For example, in 1997, Northwest held 77.8 percent of the market (defined as the total number of enplanements for the year) at Detroit, and Continental held only 1.6 percent.", "We did not evaluate the potential effect on other carriers or consumers of combining the two airlines\u2019 frequent flyer benefits. Earlier this year, however, we reported on how certain marketing practices, such as frequent flyer programs, can act as barriers to entry. The combination of frequent flyer programs under an alliance could present a more formidable barrier to entry for new-entrant airlines and point-to-point carriers lacking extensive networks. Northwest has approximately 20 million members in its WorldPerks frequent flyer program, and Continental has approximately 16 million in its OnePass program.", "Consumer advocates we interviewed expressed some concern that the airlines might increase their frequent flyer award requirements in the future, thereby discounting the value of the frequent flyer benefits. They also noted that because members of both airlines\u2019 frequent flyer programs may redeem miles on both carriers, finding available mileage awards could become far more difficult.", "In addition, a nonaligned airline, consumer groups, and an industry expert stressed the adverse effect on competition that alliances like the one between Northwest and Continental could have through computer reservation systems.

Reciprocal access to both airlines\u2019 airport clubs will follow. Both alliances will provide benefits to members of each airline\u2019s frequent flyer program by offering new destinations to which members can fly.

Because the partners offer greater market presence in different parts of the country (as well as complementary international destinations), according to airline officials, American\u2019s frequent flyers will have access to 105 new award destinations and US Airways\u2019 frequent flyers will be eligible for award travel to 120 new destinations. In addition, American\u2019s frequent flyers will be able to use their miles from either airline to claim awards on certain US Airways Shuttle flights between Washington, D.C.; New York; and Boston. The two airlines have also agreed to allow reciprocal access to all domestic and international club facilities. American\u2019s club members will gain access to US Clubs at 12 additional airports, and US Club members will gain access to 35 American clubs. The agreement between Delta and United is somewhat more limited. Passengers may choose to participate in one or both frequent flyer programs, but miles earned on any given alliance flight may be awarded to only one program. Passengers will not be able to combine miles earned from both programs to obtain an award from one of the alliance partners. Because of the number of locations served uniquely by United and Delta, according to airline officials, United\u2019s frequent flyers will have access to 75 new domestic award destinations and Delta\u2019s frequent flyers will be eligible for award travel to 108 new domestic destinations (assuming the alliances\u2019 frequent flyer program award destinations extend to the airlines\u2019 commuter partners).", "As noted in discussing the Northwest-Continental alliance, we did not evaluate the effect on other carriers or consumers of combining frequent flyer benefits through an alliance, but we have reported that the existence of frequent flyer programs can act as a barrier to entry for new-entrant airlines and point-to-point carriers lacking extensive networks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Reviews of Alliances Are Ongoing", "paragraphs": ["DOJ and DOT have both been examining the alliances.

In addition, according to the complaint, consumers would lose the benefits of new, competitive entry by Continental against Northwest in the future and of potential competition in other markets.", "DOJ did not seek a restraining order to stop all aspects of the alliance from moving forward. While it filed a complaint against the alliance\u2019s investment or stock acquisition agreement, it did not address the code-sharing alliance and frequent flyer agreements. In December 1998, Northwest and Continental proceeded with their alliance under a modified arrangement. For example, they said that they would not introduce code-sharing on flights between each other\u2019s hubs, where both airlines currently compete, and announced that Northwest would acquire less than half of the voting control of Continental\u2019s stock. DOJ responded to the revised agreement between Northwest and Continental by filing an amended complaint on December 18, 1998. DOJ alleged that despite the amended agreement, Northwest could still own more than 50 percent of the fully diluted voting power over Continental. As a result, DOJ alleged that consumers would likely still be harmed in the markets dominated by Northwest and Continental. DOJ has also indicated that it has competitive concerns about certain specific aspects of the alliance between the airlines and that its investigation of these aspects of the alliance continues.

Without detailing its ongoing reviews, it stated that its analyses of the three alliances under the Sherman and Clayton acts\u2019 authorities will follow an approach similar to that found in the Merger Guidelines, which are applied to a traditional merger. Under these guidelines, DOJ uses a five-part analytical process. First, DOJ defines the markets in which the partners operate and determines whether they are actual or potential competitors. DOJ testified before the House Committee on the Judiciary on May 19, 1998, that the greatest threat to competition comes when two of very few airlines that compete in a market enter into a code-sharing agreement in that market. DOJ stated that it is concerned about the effect on competition any time two of very few airlines in a market act jointly. Second, DOJ examines aspects of the agreement that may affect competition\u2014for example, whether the partners\u2019 capacity, scheduling, and pricing decisions will remain independent. Third, DOJ considers the extent to which new competitors are likely to enter the market in response to anticompetitive behavior by the alliance partners. Fourth, DOJ examines the operational efficiencies or other benefits that may be generated by the agreement. Finally, DOJ considers whether one of the partners is likely to exit a market because of financial considerations if the alliance does not occur. After completing these parts, DOJ attempts to balance all of the factors in deciding whether the alliance raises any antitrust concerns. DOJ officials told us that they are under no timetable for their antitrust review of the United-Delta and American-US Airways alliances.", "If DOJ has concerns, it usually attempts, before bringing a suit, to negotiate a consent agreement that will restructure the transaction to remedy the competitive harm.

Because each of the alliances changed somewhat during the assignment, we maintained contact with officials from the airlines involved. We reviewed publicly available documentation that described the structure of each alliance and asked each airline about the involvement of its regional \u201cfeeder\u201d commuter partners, international code-sharing partners, and other domestic code-sharing airlines (in the case of Continental and Northwest). To ensure that we understood the structure of each alliance, we also sought explanations from the partners on how they would share revenue in a variety of situations (for example, when one airline would sell a ticket to a passenger for a trip that was to involve both the main alliance airline and one of its regional partners.)", "To determine the extent of the service benefits associated with the alliances, we examined the airlines\u2019 statements on their routing and connection benefits. To evaluate these statements, we analyzed airline schedule information for May 1998. To obtain these data for this report, we contracted with BACK Associates, Inc., an aviation consulting firm. BACK Associates, Inc., used information on flight schedules submitted by all U.S. airlines to the Official Airline Guide Worldwide and prepared computer programs to produce tables to our specifications. We based these specifications on information submitted by the airlines on the scope of their alliances. We also imposed some limiting assumptions that our discussions with industry experts led us to believe were reasonable. We adopted these to prevent our consulting firm\u2019s computer programming from identifying what would seem to be obviously unreasonable flight patterns (e.g., flights between New York and Chicago that would connect through Los Angeles). These included (1) requiring potential connections between flights to fall between 30 and 150 minutes of one flight\u2019s scheduled arrival at the connecting airport and the next flight\u2019s scheduled departure and (2) limiting the distance that possible flight segments might cover (\u201ccircuity\u201d) to 125 percent of the distance between a flight\u2019s origin and destination, unless the flight connected through one of the airline\u2019s hubs, in which case we allowed up to 150 percent of the distance. Furthermore, with possible new double-connection markets, we limited the number of potential connection points by requiring connections to be made through the airlines\u2019 hubs. Because we were principally interested in the impact of the alliances on the U.S. domestic market, we excluded international destinations (including U.S. territories). We did not review BACK Associates, Inc.\u2019s programming but verified the logic of that programming and discussed with company officials the approach that they used. This analysis provided information on the extent to which the alliances may produce actual new \u201con-line\u201d connections or service opportunities for passengers. Finally, we examined whether competitors provided equivalent, superior, or inferior service to these destinations.To estimate the number of passengers who might benefit from the new on-line service, we then matched the new on-line origins and destinations against the 1997 passenger traffic in these markets. We did not independently assess the airlines\u2019 basis for stating that their improved service options would generate additional traffic. We also did not attempt to quantify the benefits of the reciprocal relationships among frequent flyer programs and clubs that would be established under the alliances.", "To examine the potential harm from the alliances, we determined the extent to which each airline\u2019s routes overlap with those of its alliance partner by analyzing 1997 data on the 5,000 busiest domestic airport-pair origin and destination markets or markets for air travel between two airports. These 5,000 markets accounted for over 90 percent of the total 396 million U.S. domestic passengers in 1997. To obtain these data for this report, we contracted with Data Base Products, Inc., which used information submitted by all U.S. airlines to DOT for 1997 and produced various tables to our specifications. Data Base Products, Inc., used three different data sources from DOT: the Origin and Destination Survey (O&D) based on a 10-percent sample of tickets containing itinerary and pricing information; T-100 on-flight data; and 298C T-1 data, which supplement the T-100 data with data on commuter and small certified air carriers. Data Base Products, Inc., made certain adjustments to these data, such as correcting recognized deficiencies in the air carriers\u2019 O&D data submissions, which have not met DOT\u2019s standard of 95-percent accuracy. For example, Data Base Products, Inc., used the T-100 and the 298C T-1 data to obtain more accurate passenger counts. We did not review the company\u2019s programming but did discuss with company officials the adjustments that they made.", "We examined whether the formation of alliances might reduce competition within a given airport-pair market under various assumptions about how large a market share an alliance would need to be considered an \u201cactive competitor.\u201d In our testimony on June 4, 1998, which reported our preliminary results on the effects of the proposed alliances, we defined a competitor as one that carried at least 5 percent of the enplaned passengers in a particular market. DOT uses 10 percent as a minimum market share. Our conversations with DOT officials, some airline officials, and industry experts convinced us that 10 percent better represented a competitor in the market and also eliminated some potential problems in the quality of the data that are reported to DOT. For all these reasons, we decided to use DOT\u2019s minimum. To provide additional insight into markets where an alliance may exert additional or disproportionate market influence, we then further refined our analysis to focus on those markets where an alliance would have a dominant share\u2014more than 50 percent. Various studies support the finding that airlines holding dominant shares of a market reap disproportionate amounts of the revenue available in that market, because they are able to provide far more frequent service, which is important for time-sensitive, high-yield business travelers. To a limited extent, the harmful effects of having fewer competitors in some markets, assuming the alliance partners would not compete, could be mitigated by an increase in competition in other markets.", "We defined a market as one involving airport pairs, rather than city pairs, because certain groups of passengers\u2014particularly business travelers\u2014who may need to make connections to reach their final destination do not regard various airports as substitutes. For example, many, if not most, business travelers going to and from Chicago, would not regard Midway Airport as an adequate substitute for O\u2019Hare. This market definition is in line with the analysis of international airline alliances that appeared in DOJ\u2019s comments on the proposed code-sharing alliance between American Airlines and British Airways.", "In our analysis of markets that lost or gained a competitor with the formation of an alliance, we determined the significance of this loss or gain by looking at changes in market concentration. To do this, we used an index used by DOJ, the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI), in which higher scores reflect greater increases in market dominance. The HHI is calculated by summing the squares of the individual market shares of all participants. We calculated changes in the HHI in the markets where a competitor was lost and where a competitor was added, as well as the changes in the range of HHIs for these markets. We recognize that the HHI may provide somewhat misleading results when applied to the airline industry but believe that it is nonetheless useful in suggesting the change in the amount of concentration over time.", "To determine the cumulative effect that all three alliances might exert on the U.S. traveling public, we analyzed the routings and traffic simultaneously. This analysis accounted for various offsetting effects that the alliances might produce and explains why the total number of passengers potentially benefiting from or harmed by the three alliances is not simply the sum of those affected by the three individual alliances. For example, the analysis of a single alliance might suggest that if two partners did not continue to charge competitive prices, then a particular airport-pair market might lose a competitor, and that loss, according to 1997 origin and destination information, would affect some number of passengers. However, that same airport-pair market might conceivably benefit from another alliance, whose formation would create a new active competitor. Consequently, the net effect of both alliances might be to produce the same number of competitors in the market, and the total number of passengers affected would be the difference between the two. Because of technical and computing limitations, we were unable to analyze the cumulative benefits that implementing all three alliances\u2019 would have had on flight connections, flight frequencies, and the number of new on-line destinations.", "We interviewed officials from DOT, DOJ, consumer groups, a flight attendants\u2019 union, and each of the six major airlines contemplating domestic alliances.

In particular, 14 small and medium-sized cities, such as Bangor, Maine, and Santa Barbara, California, would gain new service. In total, the airlines said, if a code-sharing alliance were extended as originally planned to the airlines\u2019 commuter partners, Delta would extend its on-line network to 108 new domestic points and United to 75 new domestic points. Thus, multiplying the possible new destinations together, the airlines said that 8,100 domestic city pairs could gain new on-line service as a direct result of a code-sharing alliance. For example, a passenger in Lincoln, Nebraska, could fly on-line to Sarasota, Florida, for the first time on either United or Delta.

In the complaint it filed against Northwest and Continental, DOJ also noted that difficulty in obtaining access to gate facilities impedes new entry. One opportunity that the lesser partner might derive from its immediate access to the dominant partner\u2019s strength at the airport is that its flights might appear more attractive to consumers. For example, under a code-sharing alliance, Texas consumers might find Continental a more desirable airline to fly to Minneapolis, where Northwest enjoys a dominant market share. This is because Continental\u2019s presence in the alliance would allow it to market, and to offer, an increased number of daily flights in these markets under its code on Northwest\u2019s planes. Another opportunity for the lesser partner might be to remove aircraft from airports where its operations are unprofitable and to shift passengers to its partner\u2019s aircraft, thereby strengthening its partner\u2019s position at that airport. For example, if Northwest and Continental each operated flights from Minneapolis to Cleveland, but Continental served that market only with smaller commuter aircraft instead of larger jets, it might choose to put its passengers on Northwest\u2019s jet flights. Concentration at airports other than the 10 cited in table V.1 could also increase, potentially preventing small and new-entrant carriers from gaining market share at heavily concentrated airports.", "We have also reported that airline sales and marketing practices may make competitive entry more difficult for other airlines.

Nevertheless, marketing practices such as frequent flyer programs and special bonuses to travel agents for booking traffic on an incumbent airline may encourage travelers to choose one airline over another on the basis of factors other than the best fares. Such practices may be most important if an airline is already dominant in a given market or markets. Because the alliances could increase dominance by about 10 percent in the top 5,000 markets in 1997, marketing barriers in these metropolitan areas would be likely to become more important. DOJ also noted the effect that such practices had on impeding competition from new entrants in the complaint it filed against Northwest and Continental. Nonetheless, mitigating the effect of these practices without banning them is difficult, and banning them involves a trade-off between their potential anticompetitive effects and the consumer benefits that some of them bring.", "Some nonaligned airlines, consumer groups, and an industry expert stressed the adverse effects on competition that code-sharing alliances could exercise through computer reservation systems.
