The MMA resulted in options for sponsors of employment-based prescription drug benefits, such as a federal subsidy payment--the retiree drug subsidy (RDS)--when sponsors provide benefits meeting certain MMA requirements to Medicare-eligible retirees. The MMA required GAO to conduct two studies on trends in employment-based retiree health coverage and the MMA options available to sponsors. The first study, Retiree Health Benefits: Options for Employment-Based Prescription Drug Benefits under the Medicare Modernization Act (GAO-05-205), was published February 14, 2005. In this second study, GAO determined which MMA prescription drug coverage options sponsors selected, the factors they considered in selecting these options, and the effect these decisions may have on the provision of employment-based health benefits for retirees. GAO identified options that sponsors selected using data from employer benefit surveys and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers Medicare. To obtain sponsors' views about the factors they considered and the effects of their decisions, GAO also interviewed private and public sector sponsors and experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to survey data GAO reviewed, a majority of retiree health benefit sponsors reported that for 2006 they continued to offer prescription drug coverage and accepted the RDS. However, the size of the reported majority differed across the surveys. For example, one survey of private sector sponsors with 1,000 or more employees found that 82 percent of these sponsors accepted the RDS for 2006. Another survey of private and public sponsors found that 51 percent of surveyed sponsors with 500 or more employees accepted the RDS for 2006. Data from CMS showed that more than 3,900 sponsors, representing about 7 million retirees, were approved for the RDS for 2006. According to the surveys GAO reviewed, much smaller percentages of sponsors reported selecting other MMA options for 2006. For 2007, according to one survey, 78 percent of surveyed employers reported that they planned to apply for the RDS for that year. CMS data showed that about 3,600 sponsors were approved for the RDS for 2007. Public and private sponsors GAO interviewed reported considering a variety of factors when selecting MMA prescription drug coverage options, including whether they could offer the same retiree health benefits they offered prior to the MMA and their ability to save on costs. In general, in order to implement most MMA options, sponsors would likely have to change the prescription drug benefits they offer. For example, sponsors that offer their own Medicare Part D plan must generally meet all CMS requirements for Part D plans, such as providing coverage for specific categories of prescription drugs. In contrast, sponsors that select the RDS option can offer the same retiree health benefits they offered prior to the MMA, as long as a sponsor's coverage remains at least actuarially equivalent to the standard Part D benefit. When deciding which, if any, options to pursue, public sponsors were affected by some factors that did not affect private sponsors. In the short term, sponsors' decisions regarding the MMA options appear to have resulted in benefits remaining relatively unchanged, in part because a majority of surveyed sponsors reported that they continued to offer prescription drug benefits and accepted the RDS the first 2 years the RDS was offered. Over the longer term, the effect of sponsors' decisions about the MMA options is unclear. For example, some experts GAO interviewed indicated that the MMA may extend the amount of time that sponsors offer benefits without reducing coverage, while other experts said the availability of the Medicare Part D benefit may make it more likely that sponsors will stop offering prescription drug benefits for retirees. In addition, it is unclear to what extent sponsors will continue to select the same MMA option in the future. To the extent that sponsors that have accepted the RDS select other MMA options, sponsors' provision of retiree health benefits may change. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS and four experts agreed with the report's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Before 2006, Medicare, the federal program that finances health care  benefits for nearly 43 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, did not  generally provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. If Medicare  beneficiaries had such coverage at all, it was typically obtained outside of  the program\u2014for example, through policies with drug coverage that  supplemented Medicare or through Medicaid. In particular, Medicare  beneficiaries who were retired could enroll in health plans with  prescription drug coverage offered through former employers or other  employment-based groups, such as unions. To help Medicare beneficiaries  with increasing prescription drug costs and encourage employment-based  health care coverage, especially for prescription drug coverage for  retirees, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Among its provisions, the MMA  established an outpatient prescription drug benefit, known as Medicare  Part D, beginning January 1, 2006. The MMA also resulted in various  options to encourage retiree health benefit sponsors to offer prescription  drug benefits to retired Medicare beneficiaries.", "Specifically, among the options resulting from the MMA, which in this  report we refer to as MMA options, sponsors can    offer health plans for retirees that provide comprehensive prescription  drug coverage, which retirees can use in lieu of Medicare Part D; sponsors  with plans that offer prescription drug benefits meeting certain MMA  requirements will receive a federal subsidy payment, known as the retiree  drug subsidy (RDS);   offer health plans for retirees that supplement\u2014or \u201cwrap around\u201d\u2014 retirees\u2019 Part D prescription drug benefit;   offer their own Medicare Part D plan;    contract with private plans that provide Medicare Part D benefits; or    pay for some or all of the Part D premiums for their eligible retirees.", "The MMA required that we conduct two studies on trends in employment- based retiree health coverage and the MMA options sponsors selected for  providing employment-based prescription drug coverage for retirees. In  our first study, published in 2005, we reported that the percentage of  employers offering retiree health coverage had declined beginning in the  early 1990s but had leveled off by the early 2000s. We also reported that  many sponsors had not made final decisions about which MMA  prescription drug options they would choose for their Medicare-eligible  retirees, although many sponsors were considering accepting the RDS as  a primary option. In this study, we are reporting on (1) which MMA  prescription drug coverage options sponsors selected, (2) the factors they  considered in selecting these options, and (3) the effect these decisions  may have on sponsors\u2019 provision of employment-based health benefits for  retirees.

The surveys we  reviewed included a survey conducted by Mercer Health & Benefits of  employers\u2014including large employers, defined as those with at least 500  employees\u2014that offered employment-based health benefits. The Mercer  survey, which was based on a random sample of private and public  employers, can be projected nationwide. We also reviewed data from a  survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates  for a nonrandom sample of large private sector employers\u2014those with  1,000 or more employees. We also reviewed one survey of multiemployer  plans and one survey of state and local public sector sponsors conducted  by The Segal Company. The data from the surveys provided us with  information on sponsors\u2019 reported selections for 2006 and their plans  pertaining to the MMA options for 2007. In addition, we obtained and  analyzed data on the number and characteristics of sponsors that were  approved for the RDS for these 2 years. We obtained these data from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that  administers Medicare and that is responsible for implementing and  administering the RDS program.", "To describe both the factors that sponsors considered in selecting the  MMA options and the effect that sponsors\u2019 decisions about the MMA  options may have on the provision of health benefits for retirees, we relied  on the Mercer and Kaiser/Hewitt surveys of private and public sector  employers. We reviewed documents from the literature, including CMS  documents, on the factors that sponsors may consider in selecting the  MMA options. We also interviewed officials from 13 of the 15 private and  public sponsors of retiree health benefits that we reported on in 2005,  including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which administers  the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). We also  interviewed 2 sponsors that chose to offer their own Medicare Part D plan  in 2006 instead of implementing the RDS or another MMA option. We did  not interview these sponsors for our 2005 report. In addition, we  interviewed several experts on sponsors\u2019 decisions regarding the MMA  options, including experts from five firms providing benefit consulting  services primarily for large public and private sector sponsors; six  organizations, including one representing unions, one representing  multiemployer plans, two representing large employers, and two  representing health plans; one professional organization for actuaries; and  other research organizations. In our interviews with sponsor officials and  experts, we asked open-ended questions about the factors sponsors  considered in making decisions about the MMA options for 2006 and  future years, as well as the effect of these decisions on the provision of  health benefits for retirees. Because we asked the officials and experts we  interviewed open-ended questions, the frequency of our interviewees\u2019  responses is not comparable.

For 2004, the most recent data available, the Medicare  Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) found that about one-third of  Medicare-eligible beneficiaries obtained supplemental coverage from a  former employer or union. Employment-based retiree health benefits are  typically offered as a voluntary benefit to retirees, thereby giving sponsors  of these benefits the option of decreasing or eliminating benefits.  However, some sponsors may be prevented from making immediate  changes to coverage because of union contracts, for example. Benefit  surveys have found that the percentage of employers offering retiree  health benefits has decreased, beginning in the early 1990s. For example,  according to a series of surveys conducted by Mercer, the percentage of  employers with 500 or more employees offering health insurance to  Medicare-eligible retirees declined from 44 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in  2006, although this trend had leveled off from 2001 through 2006.

Several types of integration occur  between sponsors and Medicare. For example, some sponsors coordinate  through a carve out approach, in which the sponsor calculates its normal  benefit and then subtracts (or carves out) the Medicare benefit, generally  leaving the retiree with out-of-pocket costs comparable to having the  employment-based plan without Medicare. Another approach used by  sponsors is full coordination of benefits, in which the plan pays the  difference between the total health care charges and the Medicare  reimbursement amount, often providing retirees complete coverage and  protection from out-of-pocket costs.", "The provision of employment-based retiree health benefits may vary  depending on a variety of factors, including whether the sponsor is in the  private or public sector, and by industry type. The 2006 Kaiser Family  Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust (HRET) survey,  for example, showed that 82 percent of state and local government  employers with 200 or more employees offered coverage to retirees,  compared with 35 percent of employers with 200 or more employees  across all employer industries that offered coverage to retirees. Coverage  can also differ between retirees under age 65 and those eligible for  Medicare, although sponsors often cover both groups of retirees. For  example, some sponsors offer retirees under age 65 a preferred provider  organization plan but offer a fee-for-service plan for retirees eligible for  Medicare.

To be in operation for 2006,  prospective PDPs and MA-PD plans had to apply by March 2005 and were  approved in September 2005. At a minimum, these plans were required to  offer the standard Medicare Part D benefit or alternative coverage that  was at least equal in value. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation,  plans approved for 2006 often varied from the standard Part D benefit in  benefit design and covered drugs. For example, although the standard   Part D benefit had a $250 deductible for 2006, Kaiser reported that   58 percent of PDPs and 79 percent of MA-PD plans approved for 2006 had  no deductible requirement.

In addition, according  to the 2005 Mercer survey, the timing of the plan and rate information  available from health plans in the Medicare market was a key factor that  led many employers to seek the RDS or to delay taking any action for 2006.", "When selecting an option for 2007, sponsors we interviewed continued to  have concerns about the extent of the information available about the PDP  and MA-PD plans. For example, one sponsor we interviewed told us that  while there was better information available when it had to make its  decision for 2007 compared with 2006, the sponsor still did not have a full  year\u2019s worth of data on PDPs when it had to make its decision. As the  markets for PDPs and MA-PD plans mature and more detailed information  becomes available, the availability of information on the various MMA  prescription drug coverage options may become less of a factor in future  years. According to one expert we interviewed, when employers are  making their decisions for 2008, there should be a full year of information  on the MMA prescription drug coverage options so that sponsors will be  able to make more fully informed decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Sponsors May Have to Consider Unique Factors", "paragraphs": ["When making decisions about which, if any, MMA option to pursue, public  sponsors may have to consider some factors that private sponsors do not.  For example, some public sponsors may be influenced at the state level to  either offer health insurance or choose a certain MMA option. One public  sponsor we interviewed was directed by the budget committee of its state  legislature to take the RDS in 2007 even though the sponsor\u2014a state  retirement system\u2014had concluded that contracting with a PDP would  allow the sponsor to decrease premiums for the state, contracting  agencies, and some enrollees; decrease prescription drug copayments for  enrollees; or both. As we stated earlier in this report, CMS estimates  indicate that the relative value of savings from the tax-free RDS, as  compared with savings from offering a PDP or MA-PD plan, for example,  would be greater for private, tax-paying sponsors than it would be for  public, non-tax-paying sponsors. In addition, OPM, which administers  FEHBP, opted to continue offering prescription drug coverage to retirees  without taking the RDS or any of the other MMA options. We reported  previously that OPM officials told us OPM did not apply for the RDS for  FEHBP because they said the intent of the RDS was to encourage  sponsors to continue offering prescription drug coverage to enrolled  Medicare beneficiaries, which all FEHBP plans were already doing.

The short-term effect  of sponsors\u2019 decisions appears to have resulted in benefits remaining  relatively unchanged, in part because the majority of sponsors continued  to offer prescription drug benefits and accepted the RDS during the first   2 years this option was offered. In addition, according to the 2005 Mercer  survey, 72 percent of employers with 500 or more employees reported that  the MMA options would have no effect on their ability to provide retiree  health coverage.

Experts we interviewed differed in their  assessments of what the effect is likely to be over the longer term. In  particular, some experts we interviewed indicated that the MMA may  extend the amount of time that sponsors offer benefits without reducing  coverage. Furthermore, one sponsor we interviewed indicated that the  RDS increased the number of years that its retiree health benefits program  would be solvent. On the other hand, other experts said that it was  possible that the availability of the Medicare Part D benefit may make it  more likely that sponsors will stop offering prescription drug benefits for  retirees. Nearly all experts we interviewed told us that it was unlikely that  an employer or other potential sponsor that did not offer retiree  prescription drug coverage prior to the MMA would begin sponsoring  these benefits in response to the new options resulting from the MMA.", "According to experts, employers are not planning to improve or expand  retiree health coverage and do not want the additional financial liability of  providing these benefits.", "Furthermore, it is unclear to what extent sponsors will continue to select  the same MMA option in the future. For example, the 2006 Kaiser/Hewitt  survey reported that of those respondents that accepted the RDS for 2006,  only 54 percent said they were very or somewhat likely to accept the RDS  for 2010. Furthermore, 25 percent said they did not know whether they  would accept the RDS for 2010. Most of the sponsors that we interviewed  that took the RDS for 2006 and planned to take the RDS for 2007 said they  were unsure which option they would be taking for 2008.

These include  the existence of union contracts that may require the provision of certain  health benefits, increasing costs for health care, the degree of industry  competition, and the strength of sponsors\u2019 financial conditions. For  example, in 2005 we reported that sponsors that negotiated retiree health  benefits with unions might not have as much flexibility to change these  benefits prior to negotiations.

Specifically, CMS said that some of the  surveys reported what sponsors said they intended to do or were  considering doing at the time of the survey, and it was possible that a  portion ultimately decided not to pursue those options.

The draft report  stated that, in general, in order to implement most MMA options other  than the RDS, sponsors would likely have to change the prescription drug  benefits they offer. CMS stated that the report did not fully acknowledge  that CMS has used its statutory waiver authority for several MMA options  to afford flexibility in benefit design, and as a result, MMA options may  require minimal (if any) adjustments to premiums, cost-sharing, and other  primary elements of benefit design. The draft report did describe CMS\u2019s  authority to waive or modify Part D requirements added by the MMA that  hinder the design of, offering of, or enrollment in certain employer- or  union-sponsored Part D retiree plans. In response to CMS\u2019s comments, we  have included additional information clarifying that CMS has waived or  modified Part D requirements for multiple MMA options. However, while  CMS has used this waiver authority, our report notes that sponsors may  still need to make changes to benefits\u2014such as changing the drugs  included on their formularies\u2014and, according to sponsors we  interviewed, any changes to benefits can complicate communications with  retirees.", "CMS also agreed with the draft report\u2019s finding that in the short term  sponsors\u2019 decisions regarding MMA options resulted in benefits remaining  relatively unchanged, but over the longer term the effect is unclear.  However, CMS stated that the examples of differing experts\u2019 assessments  of the likely effect over the longer term lacked sufficient context to be  included in the findings. CMS also stated that there was no indication in  the finding of the preponderance of expert opinion in favor of one or the  other point of view. Our report states that the effect over the longer term  is unclear and that experts we interviewed differed in their assessments of  what the effect was likely to be.

In this appendix we  present a range of alternative approaches to providing employment-based  retiree health coverage and options for expanding and improving these  alternative approaches, as described by retiree health benefit sponsors  and experts we interviewed. To obtain this information, we interviewed  officials from 15 private and public sponsors of retiree health benefits and  several experts on areas relating to the provision of employment-based  retiree health coverage, including five benefit consulting firms; six  organizations, including one representing unions, one representing  multiemployer plans, two representing large employers, and two  representing health plans; one professional organization for actuaries; and  other research organizations. The alternative approaches we describe are  not intended to be a comprehensive list but rather represent the  approaches that were mentioned by the sponsors and experts we spoke  with.", "Many of the alternative approaches to providing employment-based retiree  health coverage that were described to us rely on tax advantages that  provide an incentive for a sponsor, an employee, or both to set aside funds  for future health care needs. Some of these tax-advantaged approaches are  made available as part of consumer-directed health plans, which usually  consist of a savings account\u2014such as a health savings account (HSA) or  health reimbursement arrangement (HRA)\u2014and a health plan with a high  deductible. In addition to consumer-directed health plans, there are other  tax-advantaged accounts and trusts that do not require enrollment in a  high-deductible health plan, such as a voluntary employees\u2019 beneficiary  association (VEBA). Some sponsors and experts described a third  category of arrangement, generally without tax advantages, that assists  sponsors in providing retiree health care coverage, such as establishing  savings accounts that provide a sponsor\u2019s match to the employee\u2019s  contribution. Although there is no requirement that retiree health benefit  sponsors prefund their retiree health benefit plans, many of the  approaches sponsors and experts described are prefunded vehicles\u2014 wherein the sponsor directly contributes, rather than earmarks, dedicated  funds to an account or trust. The alternative approaches these sponsors  and experts described are listed in table 2.", "In addition to describing examples of the alternative approaches to  traditional employment-based retiree health coverage, sponsors and  experts we interviewed provided a variety of recommendations for  improving and expanding these approaches. For example, some sponsors  and experts recommended permitting tax-advantaged contributions by  Medicare-eligible retirees to HSAs and allowing stand-alone HSAs that do  not require an accompanying high-deductible health plan. Another expert  also suggested increasing the maximum annual contribution that is  currently allowed for an HSA and expanding the ability of retirees to use  HSA funds to pay for health insurance premiums. One sponsor we  interviewed highlighted the increased portability of an HSA as a factor in  the sponsor\u2019s decision to stop offering an HRA at the end of 2006 and to  begin instead to offer an HSA option for early retirees and active workers.  In addition, according to one expert we interviewed, because sponsors are  not required to make unused HRA balances available to employees when  they change jobs, individuals may have an incentive to spend down  accumulated funds. Several sponsors and other experts also suggested  creating additional tax-advantaged arrangements for retiree health benefit  sponsors. For example, one expert suggested allowing the tax-free transfer  of funds from individual tax-preferred vehicles\u2014such as 401(k) retirement  accounts\u2014and pensions to pay for health care costs, including health care  premiums.", "Overall, a majority of the sponsors we interviewed indicated that sponsors  are willing to use or consider alternative approaches, such as the ones  described above, to assist retirees with their future health care needs  without increasing their costs. Indeed, one sponsor indicated that it would  support anything that would expand its ability to offer and fund retiree  health coverage, such as additional subsidies or favorable tax treatment.  Moreover, one expert indicated that alternative approaches such as HSAs  offer a level of predictability that allows sponsors to sustain their retiree  benefit packages. One reason for this predictability is that contributions by  the sponsor in many of these alternative approaches are limited to a  defined contribution.", "Most alternatives that sponsors and experts described in our interviews  were established (or are currently under consideration) for active  employees to use for current and future expenses rather than for those  who are currently retired. For example, among the alternative approaches  described, few of the sponsors we interviewed indicated that they make  such approaches available to current retirees. Specifically, only one  sponsor we interviewed told us that it makes consumer-directed health  plans available to current retirees. Seven sponsors told us that their  current use (or consideration) of consumer-directed health plans is  targeted to active employees for current and future health care costs. Two  experts we interviewed, however, noted flaws with using consumer- directed health plans as adequate savings mechanisms for retiree health  care costs because this approach assumes that active employees will not  need the account funds for current health care expenses.

One survey is an annual survey of employer health benefits,  including private and public sector employers, conducted since the early  1990s through 2006, and one is a private sector survey on retiree health  benefits conducted in 2006. We obtained and analyzed data provided by  CMS on the number and characteristics of sponsors that were approved  for the retiree drug subsidy (RDS) for plans ending in 2006 and 2007. To  describe the factors that sponsors considered in selecting the MMA  options and the effect their decisions about the options may have on the  provision of benefits for retirees, we relied on two of the employer benefit  surveys and reviewed documents from the literature on the factors that  sponsors may consider in selecting the MMA options. We also interviewed  private and public sponsors and experts on sponsors\u2019 decisions regarding  the MMA options and employment-based retiree health benefits, including  benefit consultants and officials at health plans, groups representing large  employers, and other organizations.", "To update information on employment-based retiree health coverage since  our 2005 report, we reviewed data from employer benefit surveys and data  from three large federal surveys that contained information either on  Medicare beneficiaries or on the percentage of public sector employers  that offer retiree health benefits. We also obtained this information in our  interviews with sponsors and experts. We focused on trends particularly  affecting Medicare-eligible retirees, but in some cases when information  specific to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries was not available, we reported  on trends affecting all retirees, including those who were under age 65 and  those who were eligible for Medicare.
