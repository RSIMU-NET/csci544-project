It also requires DOD to annually report to the congressional defense committees on these actions and for GAO to review each annual report. In response, GAO performed its annual review of DOD\u0092s actions to comply with the act and related federal guidance.

Under this approach, responsibility and  accountability for business architectures and systems investment  management are assigned to different levels in the organization. For  example, the DCMO is responsible for developing the corporate BEA (i.e.,  the thin layer of DOD-wide policies, capabilities, standards, and rules)  and the associated enterprise transition plan. Each component is  responsible for defining a component-level architecture and transition  plan associated with its own tiers of responsibility and for doing so in a  manner that is aligned with (i.e., does not violate) the corporate BEA.  Similarly, program managers are responsible for developing program- level architectures and plans and for ensuring alignment with the  architectures and transition plans above them. This concept is to allow for  autonomy while also ensuring linkages and alignment from the program  level through the component level to the corporate level.", "Consistent with the tiered accountability approach, the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2008 required the Secretaries of the military departments to  designate the department Under Secretaries as Chief Management  Officers with primary responsibility for business operations.

According to DOD, the BEA is being  developed using an incremental approach, where each new release  addresses business mission area gaps or weaknesses based on priorities  identified by the department. The department considers its current  approach to developing the BEA both a \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cbottom-up\u201d  approach. Specifically, it focuses on developing content to support  investment management and strategic decision making and oversight  (\u201ctop-down\u201d) while also responding to department needs associated with  supporting system implementation, system integration, and software  development (\u201cbottom-up\u201d).", "The department\u2019s most recent BEA version (version 9.0), released in  March 2012, focuses on documenting information associated with its 15  end-to-end business process areas.

In particular, the department\u2019s most  recent Strategic Management Plan has identified the Hire-to-Retire and  Procure-to-Pay business process areas as its priorities. According to the  department, the process of documenting the needed architecture  information also includes working to refine and streamline each of the  associated end-to-end business processes.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s approach to developing its BEA involves the  development of a federated enterprise architecture. Such an approach  treats the architecture as a family of coherent but distinct member  architectures that conform to an overarching architectural view and rule  set. This approach recognizes that each member of the federation has  unique goals and needs, as well as common roles and responsibilities  with the levels above and below it. Under a federated approach, member  architectures are substantially autonomous, although they also inherit  certain rules, policies, procedures, and services from higher-level  architectures. As such, a federated architecture gives autonomy to an  organization\u2019s components while ensuring enterprisewide linkages and  alignment where appropriate.

In April 2011, DOD  provided additional guidance that calls for the use of ontologies for  federating the BEA and asserting systems compliance. In addition, DOD  guidance states that, because of the interrelationship among models and  across architecture efforts, it is useful to define an overarching taxonomy  with common definitions for key terms and concepts in the development  of the architecture.

In March 2012, DOD released BEA version 9.0, which  continues to address the act\u2019s requirements. For example, version 9.0 organizes BEA content around its end-to-end business processes and  adds additional content associated with these processes. For  example, version 9.0 added the \u201cAccept Purchase Request\u201d  subprocess and placed this subprocess in the context of its Procure- to-Pay end-to-end business process.

Specifically, as part of the  Procure-to-Pay end-to-end business process, enterprise standards for  Procurement Data and Purchase Request Data were added. In  addition, for the Hire-to-Retire end-to-end business process, DOD  updated the Common Human Resources Information Standards,  which is a standard for representing common human resources  management data concepts and requirements within the defense  business environment. As a result, stakeholders can accelerate   coordination and implementation of the high priority end-to-end  business processes and related statutory requirements. uses a standardized business process modeling approach to  represent BEA process models. For example, the BEA uses the  business process modeling notation standard to create a graphical  representation of the \u201cAccept Goods and Services\u201d business process.

Specifically, this approach calls for the use of non- proprietary, open standards and protocols to develop DOD architectures  to allow users to, among other things, locate and analyze needed  architecture information across the department. Among other things,  DOD\u2019s approach calls for the corporate BEA, each end-to-end business  process area (e.g., Procure-to-Pay), and each DOD organization (e.g.,  Army) to establish a common vocabulary and for the programs and  initiatives associated with these areas to use this vocabulary when  developing their respective system and architecture products.", "However, in 2011, we reported that each of the military departments had  taken steps to develop architectural content, but that none had   well-defined architectures to guide and constrain its business  transformation initiatives.

Specifically, DON reported that it has  not made any significant changes to its BEA content. Army reported that it  has adopted the end-to-end processes as the basis of the Army BEA, and  Air Force reported that it has added additional architecture business  process content and mapped some of this content to the end-to-end  processes.

Further, version 9.0 does not include a systematic  mechanism for evaluating and adding new taxonomy terms and rules  for addressing ambiguous terms and descriptions. This is important  since federation relies heavily on the use of taxonomy to provide the  structure to link and align enterprise architectures across the business  mission area, thus enabling architecture federation. Without an  overarching taxonomy, there is an increased risk of not finding the  most relevant content, thereby making the BEA less useful for making  informed decisions regarding portfolio management and  implementation of business systems solutions.", "DOD has begun to define corporate BEA ontologies and is developing  ontologies in the human resources management area and for the U.S.  Transportation Command. However, BEA 9.0 does not include  ontologies for all business mission domains and organizations.  According to DOD officials, each domain and organization will develop  its own ontology. This is important since ontologies promote a  comprehensive understanding of data and their relationships.

We did not determine whether the DOD  Enterprise Transition Plan addressed the requirements specified in the  act, because an updated plan was not released during the time we were  conducting our audit work.", "See, for example, GAO-09-586 and GAO-11-684.", "To determine whether DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 IT budget submission was  prepared in accordance with the criteria set forth in the act, we reviewed  and analyzed the Report on Defense Business System Modernization  Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 332, dated  March 2012, and compared it with the specific requirements in the act.  We also compared information contained in the department\u2019s system that  is used to prepare its budget submission (SNAP-IT) with information in  the department\u2019s authoritative business systems inventory (DITPR) to  determine if DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget request included all business  systems and assessed the extent to which DOD has made progress in  addressing our related recommendation. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  budget submission to determine the extent to which it addresses 10  U.S.C. \u00a7 2222, as amended by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012. We also  analyzed selected business system information contained in DITPR, such  as system life cycle start and end dates, to validate the reliability of the  information. We also interviewed officials from the office of DOD\u2019s Chief  Information Officer (CIO) to discuss the accuracy and  comprehensiveness of information contained in the SNAP-IT system, the  discrepancies in the information contained in the DITPR and SNAP-IT  systems, and efforts under way or planned to address these  discrepancies.", "To assess the establishment of DOD enterprise and component  investment management structures and processes, we followed up on  related weaknesses that our previous reports in response to the act have  identified as not being fully implemented. Specifically, we interviewed the  office of the DCMO and military department officials and reviewed written  responses and related documentation on steps completed, under way, or  planned to address these weaknesses. We also met with cognizant  officials on steps taken to address new investment management  requirements of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012. Further, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s most recent BEA compliance guidance to determine the extent to  which it addressed our related open recommendations. Finally, we  reviewed business process reengineering documentation provided to  support assertions that modernization programs had undergone business  process reengineering assessments.", "To determine whether the department was certifying and approving  business system investments with annual obligations exceeding $1  million, we reviewed and analyzed all Defense Business Systems  Management Committee certification approval memoranda. We also  reviewed IRB certification memoranda issued prior to the Defense  Business Systems Management Committee\u2019s final approval decisions for  fiscal year 2011. We contacted officials from the office of the DCMO and  investment review boards to discuss any discrepancies. In addition, we  discussed with officials from the office of the DCMO its plans for updating  the investment review process consistent with requirements of the NDAA  for Fiscal Year 2012 and obtained related documentation. To assess the  office of the DCMO\u2019s progress toward filling staff positions, we compared  the number of authorized positions with the staff on board as of late April  2012; reviewed and analyzed related staffing documentation; and  interviewed office of the DCMO officials about staffing.", "We did not independently validate the reliability of the cost and budget  figures provided by DOD because the specific amounts were not relevant  to our findings. We conducted this performance audit at DOD offices in  Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia, from September 2011 to June 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Neelaxi Lakhmani and Mark  Bird, Assistant Directors; Debra Conner; Rebecca Eyler; Michael Holland;  Anh Le; Donald Sebers; and Jennifer Stavros-Turner made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
