RHS's national, state, and local offices share responsibility for monitoring the rental assistance program, with the local offices performing the primary review every 3 years. The national office outlines the monitoring activities for the rental assistance program in its Rural Development Instructions and provides other guidance, such as administrative notices and unnumbered letters. We found that state and local offices follow this guidance inconsistently and sometimes consider it unclear. National office staff are planning a number of initiatives to increase monitoring of the rental assistance program, but a number of key management positions in the national office are unfilled, which could limit the effectiveness of program monitoring. RHS's internal controls do not provide adequate oversight of rental assistance funds because RHS guidance is inadequate and tenants' incomes are not adequately verified. First, insufficient guidance on the transfer process limits RHS's ability to move unused rental assistance to properties that have tenants with the greatest unmet need. Second, the triennial supervisory review does not provide reasonable assurance that tenants income and assets, and ultimately rental assistance payments, are adequately verified.

With a fiscal year 2004 budget of almost $600 million, the program is RHS\u2019s  largest line-item appropriation. Given its size, internal controls are a  significant factor in administering the program in order to distribute  resources effectively and reduce the possibilities for fraud, waste, and  abuse. Because the program already has a waiting list of 80,000 eligible  tenants and over 1.3 million low-income renters not receiving housing  subsidies reside throughout rural America, effectively distributing  resources is important in extending assistance to as many needy tenants as  possible.", "We recently reported on the activity level of rental assistance contracts and  the accuracy of RHS\u2019s budget estimates for the Section 521 rental  assistance program. To further assist you in your oversight of the program,  you also asked us to assess (1) how RHS distributes rental assistance funds  to properties and tenants, (2) how RHS monitors the use of rental  assistance funds, and (3) whether RHS has sufficient internal controls in  place to ensure that these funds are being effectively administered and  used.", "To respond to these objectives, we collected written information from RHS  and talked with its representatives about the processes for distributing  rental assistance and the means of monitoring those processes. We  reviewed RHS\u2019s guidance for the program and internal control standards  that apply to the processes. We also conducted a nationwide survey of all  RHS state and local offices with rental assistance responsibilities. Finally,  we visited RHS state and local offices and property owners or managers in  five states to obtain documentation related to specific aspects of the rental  assistance distribution process and to observe how RHS staff implement  the internal controls that RHS has established to oversee the program.  Details of our scope and methodology appear in appendix I, and  appendixes II and III contain state office responses to a number of survey  items. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the results can be  viewed at www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-04-978SP.", "We conducted our work from September 2003 through June 2004 in a  number of locations, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Mississippi,  New York, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington, D.C., in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Section 521 rental assistance program, started in 1978, is administered  by RHS\u2019s Multifamily Housing Portfolio Management Division. The  program provides rental assistance for tenants living in units created  through RHS\u2019s Multifamily Direct Rural Rental Housing Loans and  Multifamily Housing Farm Labor Loans programs. These programs provide  loans subsidized with interest rates as low as 1 percent to help build rental  housing for rural residents and farm workers. Under the rental assistance  program, eligible tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their income  toward the rent, and RHS pays the balance to the property owner.", "RHS allocates rental assistance subsidies through 5-year contracts with  property owners; 20-year contracts were also issued to units in newly  constructed properties from 1978 through 1982. In fiscal year 2004,  contracts were issued for a term of 4 years. The contracts specify that  owners will receive payments on behalf of tenants in a designated number  of units at the property. Contracts may be renewed as many times as funds  are made available, and additional rental assistance units may be allocated  if funds become available.", "Property owners are required to follow RHS guidance in managing their  properties. Each month, they must document how many units designated  for rental assistance are occupied. If a unit is empty and rental assistance is  not being used, the property owner is required to assign another eligible  tenant. If no eligible tenants are waiting for the unit, the property owner  can work with RHS to transfer the rental assistance to another property.", "As shown in figure 1, RHS\u2019s national, state, and local offices share  administrative duties for the rental assistance program.", "The national office develops and implements regulations for the rental  assistance program and other RHS programs (Rural Development  Instructions). The current Rural Development (RD) Instruction for the  rental assistance program has been in effect since the 1980s and was last  revised in 1993. Other subparts of the RD Instructions also outline  processes for monitoring RHS programs, including the rental assistance  program. A proposed rule designed to streamline and consolidate the RD  Instructions governing the multifamily grant, loan, and rental assistance  programs was published in the Federal Register in June 2003. The  proposed rule is intended to modify tenant recertification rules, relieve the  burden on property owners of recovering unauthorized rental assistance  from tenants, and reduce the amount of time RHS must wait before  transferring unused rental assistance.", "The national office also distributes administrative notices and unnumbered  letters on an as-needed basis. Administrative notices clarify for state and  local offices activities outlined in RD Instructions. For example, the  national office plans to clarify the tenant income verification process and  provide further guidance on monitoring unused rental assistance for  transfer through forthcoming administrative notices. Unnumbered letters,  which address specific issues and are less formal than administrative  notices, relay important information to state and local offices, but they do  not pertain to policies and procedures. For example, an unnumbered letter  released in December 2003 included data aggregated at the national office  broken down by state and by rental assistance distribution goals, such as  percentage of supervisory reviews completed, unit vacancies, and unused  rental assistance.", "The national office also estimates program budgets; allocates funds; and  tracks nationwide program statistics. State and local offices work directly  with property owners, property management companies, and tenants to  monitor the program. State and local offices are responsible for conducting  financial, management, and physical reviews of the properties; executing  rental assistance contracts with property owners; approving rent increases;  and processing rental assistance payments. State and local office staff also  collect and maintain property and tenant data for their areas.", "Support for the program is also provided through two offices in St. Louis,  Missouri. The Rural Housing Service Branch of the Information Resources  Management Office maintains the database systems used to manage  program data. The Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer uses the  program data to generate and maintain the general ledger and financial  statements for the program. RHS uses two key database systems to manage  their multifamily housing programs, including the rental assistance  program. The Automated Multi-Housing Accounting System (AMAS) stores  data on rental assistance contract obligations, rental assistance payments  to property owners, and transfers of rental assistance. The Multi-Family  Housing Information System (MFIS) tracks property and tenant  information that determine the monthly request for rental assistance.", "As mandated by the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982, the  Comptroller General issues standards for internal control in the federal  government. These standards provide the overall framework for  establishing and maintaining internal control and for identifying and  addressing major performance and management challenges and areas at  greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. According to  these standards, internal control comprises the plans, methods, and  procedures used to meet missions, goals, and objectives. It is the first line  of defense in safeguarding assets, and preventing and detecting fraud and  errors. Internal control, which is synonymous with management control,  helps government program managers achieve desired results through  effective stewardship of public resources. No matter how well designed  and operated, internal control cannot provide absolute assurance that all  agency objectives will be met, and thus, once in place, internal control  provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance of meeting agency objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RHS Distributes Rental Assistance Funds through Contracts and Sets Per-Unit Payments Based on Tenants\u2019 Verified Income Levels", "paragraphs": ["RHS\u2019s national office provides rental assistance funds to property owners  through a variety of contracts.

Construction contracts, which support  new units in recently constructed properties, account for only 1 percent.  The remaining 3 percent cover servicing and preservation contracts.  Property owners who take out loans to rehabilitate properties and then  raise rents to cover the servicing costs associated with the loan, for  example, are eligible for servicing contracts that provide additional rental  assistance to help tenants cope with the rent increase. Preservation  contracts are offered as an incentive to property owners who are  considering leaving the program and provide subsidies for additional units  on the property.", "According to the authorizing statute, unused rental assistance is to be  transferred to properties where the assistance is needed. Transfers can  occur when state and local offices identify unused rental assistance at a  property or when a property owner requests such a transfer. For example, a  property owner may want to transfer unused rental assistance from a  property that has no eligible potential tenants to one that has many. During  fiscal year 2003 unused rental assistance on approximately 6,800 units, or  about 3 percent of all rental assistance units\u2014with a total value of $67  million\u2014were transferred through about 2,000 transactions. An RHS  national office official noted that a portion of these units were rental  assistance transfers accompanying a property transfer, during which an  eligible property owner assumes another property owner\u2019s loan.", "Property owners may initiate the transfer of unused rental assistance from  their properties at any time. If the property owner has not used the rental  assistance on one or more of the covered units for any consecutive 12- month period, RHS may transfer the unused rental assistance, as long as at  least one unit at the property remains covered. In either case, before the  transfer can occur, RHS must verify that the rental assistance has been  properly marketed by the owner and is not needed at the current property.  Property owners may appeal decisions to transfer rental assistance from  their properties by contacting USDA\u2019s National Appeals Division, an  independent office within USDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RHS Makes Payments on the Basis of Information Provided by Tenants and Verified by Property Owners", "paragraphs": ["As figure 2 shows, a number of steps take place between the time rental  assistance contracts are made or transferred and the time property owners  receive payments.

Property owners certify tenants initially and then  every year, or when a tenant\u2019s income rises by $40 or more per month ($480  per year) or decreases by $20 or more per month ($240 per year). In these  cases, the income must be verified again. According to RD Instructions, the  property owner must obtain verification of the tenant\u2019s stated income, in  writing, from the tenant\u2019s employer. If the owner is not able to immediately  obtain written verification, the tenant\u2019s income may be temporarily verified  by examining income checks or check stubs. Income listed from other  sources, such as Social Security or public assistance, must be verified in  writing by those sources. Although tenant certifications and income  verifications help ensure accurate payments to property owners, errors can  occur when tenants do not accurately report all sources of income or when  property owners do not adequately verify them.", "Calculating the amount of rental assistance and submitting the information  to RHS is the second key step. Project worksheets document the rent and  income levels of tenants for whom the property owner can request rental  assistance and calculate the amount of rental assistance due. Property  owners submit the project worksheets by mail to state or local offices,  where, according to RHS guidance, staff are to compare the worksheet  information with information from MFIS.

In  another centralized state, an official stated that their centralized payment  center had helped to cut costs and increase satisfaction, because property  owners had one place to call when questions or payment issues arose.

Of those, 56 percent said they did so during the  triennial supervisory review. Likewise, all of the local offices we visited  during our site visits stated that information provided for tenant  certifications was verified during or in preparation for triennial supervisory  reviews. And approximately 83 percent of survey respondents reported  that triennial supervisory reviews provided them with the information  necessary to effectively monitor properties in their portfolios to a great or  very great extent.", "However, we found that the triennial supervisory review was not a  sufficient means of detecting problems such as misreported income,  verification errors, and unauthorized rental assistance payments. GAO\u2019s  standards state that internal control should generally be designed to assure  that ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations, is  performed continually, and is ingrained in the agency\u2019s operations. RHS\u2019s  triennial supervisory reviews did not meet this standard because they are  conducted infrequently using a sample size that may be too small to  provide reasonable assurance that all tenant certifications are reviewed at  least once or more than once every several years. RD Instructions require a  sample of at least six tenant household files from a property with more  than six units, and all tenant household files for properties with six units or  fewer. With a sample size this small, however, tenants could move from a  unit they had rented before the local office has a chance to sample their  household file during a supervisory review.", "Local offices in the states we visited said that they interpreted RD  Instructions as requiring a 20- or 25-percent sample of tenant household  files. However, we found that staffing and time limitations did not allow  staff to conduct the reviews this way. For example, an official in one local  office stated that her office reviewed six tenant household files for every  property, even if 20 percent of the property comprised a greater number of  units. Furthermore, about 20 percent of survey respondents reported not  having sufficient staff to conduct reviews, and about 27 percent reported  not having sufficient time to conduct the reviews according to the RD  Instructions. A local office official in another state we visited said that staff  reviewed either six tenant household files or 10 percent of the total-  whichever was greater. Even if the local offices consistently used a 20  percent or 25 percent sample of tenant household files, however, as figure 6  shows a rental assistance unit could go without review for 12 to 15 years.", "RHS\u2019s national office does not have a basis for determining whether  sampling a minimum of six tenant household files per property is sufficient  to provide reasonable assurance that errors in tenant and payment  information are adequately detected. In order to design a cost efficient  sampling strategy that can provide reasonable assurance with respect to  tenant income and rental assistance payments, RHS needs information on  the overall error rates. One way to determine an overall error rate is to  conduct a national statistically valid random sample of tenant household  files. Information gathered from this sample would provide RHS with a  better idea of the level of erroneous income tenants were reporting and  enable RHS to estimate the level of improper rental assistance payments  that are being made throughout the program. In addition, it would provide  RHS officials with valuable information on how to structure future  supervisory reviews in a more efficient and effective manner.", "In a June 2003 report assessing controls over the tenant certification  process and accuracy of rental subsidies conducted by the USDA Office of  Inspector General, the audit team found that in Florida, tenant  certifications for an estimated 20.8 percent of the 14,705 units contained  errors that resulted in households receiving an estimated $4.7 million in  improper rental subsidies. This finding emphasizes the importance of  being able to detect errors in tenant information in a timely manner.", "In March 2004, RHS began a review of properties to determine an overall  error rate for rental assistance payments to comply with the Improper  Payments Information Act. RHS officials selected a sample of 539 assisted  units in 321 RHS properties, and the national office expects to report their  findings by the end of September 2004. Until RHS determines an overall  error rate using a statistically valid sample, RHS will not be able to  determine an appropriate sampling strategy for use with supervisory  reviews to estimate error rates and compliance with internal controls.", "GAO\u2019s internal control standards also state that agencies should evaluate  their monitoring activities, and the evaluations should depend on the  assessment of risks and the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures.  RHS officials in the states we visited said that they found errors or  questionable tenant documentation during triennial supervisory reviews.  For example, RHS officials in one state said that they would follow up with  the property owner if they found errors in the data that are being verified.  The official added that property owners might be given a 15- or 30-day  period to correct any deficiencies. An RHS official in another state said that  RHS staff sometimes found questionable supporting documents during  triennial supervisory reviews. The official explained that the staff note the  problem in the triennial supervisory review report and request that the  property owner obtain the correct documentation. These examples suggest  that, if properly designed and implemented, the triennial supervisory  review can be valuable in detecting tenant and payment errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Controls Used by RHS to Verify Tenant and Payment Information Have Had Limited Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["RHS staff use alternate controls, such as MFIS database checks and wage  matching, to verify tenant and payment information. According to RHS  officials, the MFIS system has internal checks that help RHS officials avoid  and catch errors. When tenant certifications are submitted electronically  through the Industry Interface, MFIS automatically rejects those that are  problematic. For example, a tenant certification would be rejected if it  showed that the tenant might already reside at another property\u2014that is, if  the tenant\u2019s Social Security number already existed within the system.", "Also, MFIS allows RHS officials to reject tenant certifications for certain  reasons and thus flag them for review. For example, as we have seen  tenants must recertify their eligibility for rental assistance if their income  increases by $40 a month ($480 a year) or decreases by $20 a month ($240 a  year). MFIS allows each office to compare incoming tenant certifications to  the prior batch of tenant certifications. RHS staff in each office can then  establish a threshold in MFIS to reject tenant certifications that show a  change in income of more than an established amount, for example, 20  percent, and hold them for further review.", "Although RD Instructions determine income changes in terms of dollar  amounts, the MFIS database check has been implemented to use  percentages to set the threshold for rejecting tenant certifications.  However, setting the threshold in terms of dollar amounts would be  consistent with the RD Instruction that describes how to determine  changes in income. For example, if a tenant reported zero income on an  initial certification, any subsequent increase in income would be more than  20 percent, thereby triggering a rejection, although the dollar increase  could be less than $40. Likewise, if a tenant\u2019s reported income increased  from $30 to $40 per month, for example, the MFIS system would also reject  this certification because the percentage increase is greater than 20  percent. However, a $10 increase in income is not enough to warrant  recertification. But if a tenant\u2019s reported income increased from $300 to  $345 per month, MFIS would accept this certification because the  percentage increase in income is less than 20 percent, although the dollar  increase is more than $40.", "An RHS official in the national office stated that the MFIS database check  could be designed to use dollar amounts instead of percentages to establish  the threshold. In either case, however, the national office does not  currently have an established percentage benchmark in MFIS for all offices  to use, and RHS local offices are not setting the thresholds consistently. In  one local office we visited, RHS staff established their threshold to reject  tenant certifications that change by 20 percent. However, in another state  we visited, local office staff set MFIS to reject changes in income of 25  percent or more. Setting the threshold higher than an established  benchmark would make this control less effective at detecting changes in  income. Setting a threshold lower than an established benchmark would  make this control more effective but would result in a higher number of  pending certifications that would likely require more staff resources.", "Although the RHS national office has established the MFIS database check  as a control, we identified and were told of errors on tenant certifications.  For example, in one state we identified a tenant certification that listed two  dependents as living in a unit receiving rental assistance. However, the  dependents were not listed in MFIS. RHS local office officials stated that, in  such a situation, the two dependents would not change the amount of rent  owed by the tenant or the amount of rental assistance due to the property  owner. But because rental assistance payments are based on household  size, among other things, the presence or absence of dependents could  influence rental assistance payments. For example, if a tenant got married  an additional person would be living in the unit and would possibly have an  additional source of income. If a tenant gave birth, the tenant would receive  an income deduction for the newborn, decreasing the amount of income  used in determining the amount of the rental assistance payment.", "Further, RHS officials in four of the states we visited stated that, following  RHS guidance, they verified the accuracy of rental assistance payments by  comparing property owners\u2019 project worksheets with project worksheets  generated using MFIS. According to an RHS official, any errors on the  property owners\u2019 project worksheets should be detected during the  comparison with the MFIS-generated project worksheet. But since the  MFIS project worksheet is generated with the same information from  tenant certifications that property owners used to generate their project  worksheets, RHS is essentially comparing duplicate data from the same  source (see fig. 7).", "According to GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, such a check is not sufficient. Internal control calls for  comparisons and assessments using different sets of data so that  relationships can be analyzed and appropriate actions taken. In order for  RHS to have a meaningful reconciliation, MFIS data would need to be  compared with a different data source to identify differences in reported  tenant and payment information.", "An RHS official in the national office believed that this internal control  standard is not applicable to this situation. The official stated that  discrepancies between the MFIS-generated project worksheet and the  property owner\u2019s project worksheet often arise because the property  owner may not send complete information. For example, if a property  owner did not submit a form indicating that a tenant had vacated a unit, or  if the owner did not perform a calculation correctly, a discrepancy would  occur that RHS would look into. We agree that this system can catch errors  of inconsistency. But a property owner could consistently be submitting  complete, but inaccurate, information reported by the tenant. In such  cases, RHS would not be able to detect errors or improper rental assistance  payments by comparing the two project worksheets. RHS would need to  consult another source of information, such as data on earned income that  could be used for wage matching, to verify that information reported by the  tenant and submitted by the property owner is accurate. Wage matching  would allow staff to verify tenant\u2019s reported income using wage  information collected by the state.", "RHS was told by the USDA Office of the Inspector General over 5 years ago  to continue their efforts to ensure that RHS state and local offices utilize  wage matching to detect misreported tenant income. In a February 1999  report, the Inspector General\u2019s audit team evaluated methods RHS and  property owners used to ensure that tenants\u2019 incomes were properly  reported on tenant certifications. The audit team found that 47 percent of  tenant certifications in six states (29,238 out of 62,815) were incorrect due  to inaccurately reported income, income changes, and property managers  that did not properly verify income reported by tenants. Further, the audit  team found that about 93 percent of the income errors involved tenants  that had reported earned income. The Inspector General recommended  that RHS be more aggressive in expanding its wage-matching efforts.", "Some RHS state offices are granted access to wage-matching data through  agreements between the offices and wage collection agencies, such as state  labor departments. These agreements follow state laws. Our survey results  showed that 64 percent of RHS state offices (28 of 44 RHS state offices that  responded) had access to state employment information to conduct wage  matching (see fig. 8.)", "However, some RHS officials believe that state-based wage matching has  limitations. For example, officials in one state we visited noted that their  office did not place much emphasis on wage matching because their area  bordered other states and many individuals worked across state lines.  Without access to wage-matching data in the bordering states, RHS staff  were not able to adequately certify reported income. Further, officials  noted that state wage data were often outdated and did not capture all  sources of income.", "RHS is attempting to acquire access to the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 National Directory of New Hires by contacting the U. S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to discuss the  language originally proposed by HUD for the authority to use the  directory. The National Directory of New Hires, which includes  centralized sources of state wage, unemployment insurance, and new hires  data for all 50 states, would provide nationwide data for wage matching.  Access to this directory would likely help solve the problem of verifying  income for tenants who work across state lines.

Additionally, the  infrequency of the triennial supervisory reviews using a sampling  methodology that may be insufficient cannot reasonably ensure that  tenants\u2019 income and assets, and ultimately rental assistance payments, are  adequately verified. RHS does not have a basis for determining what  constitutes a sufficient sample size for the triennial supervisory reviews  without establishing an overall error rate for rental assistance payments.  These shortcomings increase the risk that RHS will provide rental  assistance to tenants that may not be eligible.", "RHS currently uses alternate methods of income verification, including  MFIS database checks that, if properly designed and implemented, could  provide reasonable assurance that errors in tenant and payment  information are detected in a timely manner.

Concerning our recommendation that RHS improve sampling  methods to ensure that a sufficient number of tenant files are selected for  supervisory reviews, the Acting Undersecretary responded that USDA  would instead revamp the supervisory review process to improve its  effectiveness and consistency. We agree that the supervisory review  process should be revised to improve its effectiveness and consistency and  are encouraged that USDA is taking steps to accomplish this. However, to  make this process an effective control to ensure that the rental assistance  payments are correct, or that incorrect payments are discovered in the  normal course of business, USDA must also improve its sampling  methodology as we described in the report. In particular, RHS must  determine an overall error rate using a statistically valid sample to  determine how many tenant household files are sufficient to detect errors.  Unless this methodology is improved in conjunction with the supervisory  review process, USDA will continue to lack any assurance as to the  propriety of the rental assistance payments that are not reviewed. The  Acting Undersecretary agreed with our recommendation that RHS improve  its methods for verifying tenant information, including using alternate  income verification methods. He stated that USDA would institute broader  use of alternate income verification methods, such as improved access to  wage matching and new hires data, but noted that USDA needed to be able  to share this data with third parties, particularly the property owners.
