Instead, MDA relies on models, some of which produce data with limited credibility. According to Department of Defense and MDA policy, models used to operationally assess weapons systems must be accredited to ensure they reflect the real-world system. In addition, using unaccredited models increases the risk that test results could be distorted, and leaves decision makers without key information on how the system will perform. While MDA has taken steps to improve its models, it has used many models in system operational ground tests that were not certified for that use (see figure).

These flexibilities allow MDA to diverge from DOD\u2019s traditional acquisition  life cycle and defer the application of acquisition policies and laws  designed to facilitate oversight and accountability until a mature capability  is ready to be handed over to a military service for production and  operation. Some of the laws and policies include such things as: obtaining the approval of a higher-level acquisition executive before  making changes to an approved baseline,  reporting certain increases in unit cost measured from the original or  current baseline, obtaining an independent life-cycle cost estimate prior to beginning  system development and/or production and deployment, and  regularly providing detailed program status information to Congress,  including specific costs, in Selected Acquisition Reports.", "In response to concerns related to MDA\u2019s flexibilities, Congress and DOD  have taken a number of actions. For example, Congress enacted  legislation in 2008 requiring MDA to establish cost, schedule, and  performance baselines\u2014starting points against which to measure  progress\u2014for each element that has entered the equivalent of system  development or is being produced or acquired for operational fielding.

During this process, MDA  communicates the capabilities and limitations of its delivery, and provides  evidence supporting these assertions. Representatives from the receiving  military service or combatant command then have the ability to assess  this evidence and decide whether to accept the new capability. Because  the military services conduct minimal missile defense testing of their own,  this process is one of the only ways to convey vital performance  information. The accuracy of this information is especially important as it  informs training materials, doctrine, and deployment decisions.", "Typically, MDA makes capability deliveries through approved changes to  its Operational Capacity Baseline (OCB).

Subsequently, the combatant commands assess  these element capabilities to determine whether to accept them. This  process is used for the vast majority of deliveries, including relatively  minor ones such as software patches and updates.", "In recent years, MDA has declared major capabilities ready for delivery  through a process that culminates in the issuance of a Technical  Capability Declaration (TCD).

Undefinitized contract actions are generally used  when negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible in sufficient  time to meet the government\u2019s requirements and the government\u2019s  interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment so  that contract performance can begin immediately. Under the DFARS,  undefinitized contract actions must include a specific \u201cnot-to-exceed\u201d  price.

Once the government has received a qualifying proposal from the  contractor, however, the government can extend the undefinitized period  another 180 days. Similarly, the government may obligate up to 75  percent of the not-to-exceed price, if the contractor submits the qualifying  proposal before 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price has been  obligated.

MDA and the  Army have been directed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense to develop  a memorandum of agreement that would guide the transfer of the THAAD  and AN/TPY-2 programs to the Army, and the National Defense  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 requires the Secretary of Defense to  transfer the acquisition authority of all missile defense programs that have  received full-rate production authority, which includes THAAD, to the  military departments not later than the date the President\u2019s fiscal year  2021 budget is submitted. The Army, however, has identified a $10.1  billion requirements gap, and the Secretary of the Army issued a memo  that he would non-concur with the transfer of the THAAD program in its  current state.

MDA officials told us that they will rely  on the current GMD software version, which lacks some key  improvements, until this upgrade is delivered. Additionally, MDA  significantly reduced the content of its BMDS cyberdefense capability  planned for Increment 4. MDA documentation originally planned to deliver  this capability with 10 elements and, prior to testing, the BMDS OTA  declared four elements to be priorities. Of these four, MDA has conducted  the assessment for only three.

This  information is critical for allowing warfighters to make informed decisions  about whether to accept the capability, how to prepare for its deployment,  and how to plan for its use. Typically this process occurs through the  Operational Capacity Baseline (OCB) change process, which is  structured around the delivery of new capabilities to individual elements.  Alternately, as noted above, when MDA declares a key integrated,  BMDS-level capability ready for delivery, it does so through a process  which culminates in the issuance of a Technical Capability Declaration  (TCD). The TCD is a memorandum signed by the Director, MDA and is  usually reserved for significant new capabilities such as:  those mandated by the President; or delivery of integrated BMDS-level capabilities that require more than  one element to function.", "This last category of capabilities is especially important as, according  MDA\u2019s charter, the BMDS is intended to be an integrated and  interoperable system. Integration is important in order to counter the  larger-scale and more complex attacks that are likely to occur during a  conflict. We have reported since 2014 that MDA has taken steps to  improve the management and reporting of integrated capabilities, and to  increase the level of BMDS integration. While MDA has recently made  some progress in the area of integrated capabilities, the majority of  MDA\u2019s capability deliveries continue to be made at the element level.  Until recently, MDA has done little to document the requirements and  process for issuing a TCD, resulting in an inconsistent and, at times, ad- hoc process.", "We found inconsistencies in MDA\u2019s decisions regarding which integrated,  BMDS-level capabilities MDA would deliver through a TCD, and which it  would not. For example, since 2015, the agency planned to deliver 14  integrated, BMDS-level capabilities, but delivered only 7 through the TCD  process. According to MDA\u2019s prior capability delivery documents, several  of these excluded capabilities were intended to be part of the formal TCD  delivery during the planning stage, but were dropped at some later point.  According to MDA officials, those deliveries were made when all their  constituent elements were delivered via the OCB process.", "MDA officials acknowledged that distinctions between requirements for  element-level deliveries and BMDS-level capabilities were not readily  apparent in their policy and took steps in fiscal year 2017 to do so. MDA  issued a memorandum on Technical Capability Declaration Planning and  Definitions in June 2017 to help distinguish element-level OCB deliveries  and deliveries of integrated BMDS capabilities that would occur via TCD.  This document established several definitions and requirements such as  assigning responsibilities, establishing lines of authority, and defining  some requirements that are not found in the other guidance document  that MDA uses to govern TCD. The June 2017 memorandum also  identified which capabilities through 2023 that MDA will deliver via a TCD,  and identified some ways to add a new capability to the list of those  receiving a TCD.", "While MDA\u2019s new policy represents a substantial improvement in the  management of the TCD process, it does not address several important  problems with the TCD process. Specifically, although MDA has identified  capabilities that it plans to deliver using a TCD, it does not identify any  criteria or reasoning that guided this determination. It also does not  explain the criteria MDA will apply to future capabilities under  consideration for a TCD, leaving open the possibility of the same  inconsistent application MDA has used in the past. Moreover, the  capabilities it identified for a TCD are only a subset of all planned  integrated, BMDS-level capabilities. Consequently, only some integrated  capabilities are currently planned to be delivered to the warfighter with  comprehensive information about their performance and limitations at the  BMDS level. Unless MDA requires that all integrated capabilities are  delivered via the TCD process, as the BMDS becomes more integrated,  military services and other decision makers will have reduced insight into  the capabilities and limitations of the BMDS as a whole.", "MDA\u2019s June 2017 policy also establishes some processes governing the  requirements for, and development of, test plans in support of a TCD, but  it does not address some of the most problematic aspects of this process  to date. Specifically, the new policy requires convening an Assessment  Requirements Review board to develop a baseline for a planned TCD,  determine what capabilities will be included, and identify what test plans  will be necessary to generate the \u201cbody of evidence\u201d that MDA will  provide in support of the TCD\u2019s assertions regarding capabilities and  limitations.", "However, we found that Assessment Requirements Reviews can be held  shortly before the planned delivery date\u2014which affords no opportunity to  build the test plan around the requirements identified in the review. MDA  held Assessment Requirement Reviews in preparation for two of the  previous three TCDs. The timing of these reviews in relation to the date of  the TCD\u2019s issuance suggests that they had little influence on MDA\u2019s  actual test plans. MDA officials stated that an Assessment Requirement  Review is ideally held 18 months to 2 years prior to the issuance of the  related TCD. However, we found that, for recently issued TCDs, the  reviews were held much closer to the beginning of testing and the  planned TCD delivery. For example, for the TCD issued in December  2017 that delivered 44 ground-based interceptors, MDA held this review  less than 8 weeks in advance. Figure 4 depicts the timeline of the  Assessment Requirements Review as compared to the start of testing for  the TCD and the TCD delivery date.", "Because these reviews identify requirements that must be tested, the  Assessment Requirements Review would ideally inform MDA\u2019s test plans  so that each component of the integrated capability could be adequately  tested by the planned delivery date. But because the policy does not give  exact requirements, process, and key milestones necessary to issue a  TCD, MDA is able to hold an Assessment Requirements Review that  merely acknowledges the results of tests already completed.", "These practices are consistent with our prior findings on MDA, which  identified a lack of a management framework for delivering integrated  capabilities, and showed that the lack of this framework resulted in  concurrency, fragmentation of development activities, and delays for  some originally planned capabilities. According to DOD\u2019s guidance on  acquisition and testing, a program\u2019s test and evaluation strategy should  begin with a review of requirements so that management can devise a  test and evaluation strategy that generates the knowledge necessary to  inform the acquisition and operational decisions of a program. Holding the  Assessment Requirement Review so close to the planned delivery date  affords no opportunity to build the test plan around the requirements  identified in the review, and instead only ratifies the results of a test plan  that was not necessarily developed with these requirements in mind."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "MDA\u2019s Use of Undefinitized Contract Actions Poses Cost and Schedule Risks to the Government", "paragraphs": ["Undefinitized contract actions are authorized when the negotiation of a  definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the  government\u2019s requirements and government interests demand that the  contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract performance  can begin immediately, and are subject to certain limitations.

GAO has reported that  while this type of contract action may be necessary under certain  circumstances, it is considered risky in part because the government may  incur unnecessary costs if requirements change before the contract is  definitized.

Since 2013, MDA has entered into 11 undefinitized contract  actions as shown in table 4.", "MDA\u2019s use of undefinitized contract actions has fluctuated between one  and five instances per year. The combined not-to-exceed price of all such  contract actions entered into each year has increased, however, from  $2.5 million in fiscal year 2013 to $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2017 as shown  in figure 5. The average time to definitize these contract actions has  steadily increased as well, from 78 days in fiscal year 2013, to over 600  days in fiscal year 2016 (see figure 6). Two undefinitized contracts were  awarded in fiscal year 2017 and both exceeded 180 days without  definitization.", "The value of MDA\u2019s undefinitized contract actions entered into in a given  year, as measured by their combined not-to-exceed prices, has risen  significantly. The length of the undefinitized period has also risen on  average. Together, these figures show that MDA may be initiating  contractor work with incomplete knowledge of the requirements or costs  involved.", "With regard to the increasing duration of the undefinitized period, MDA  contracting officials told us that when they do not achieve definitization  within 180 days, it is often because the contractor\u2019s proposal is not  adequately supported by a sound estimate, and negotiation past 180  days is necessary to achieve a fair and reasonable price. They added  that the task of making this determination is made more complicated by  the highly developmental nature of the work that MDA often conducts. For  example, the 2015 undefinitized contract action for Aegis BMD SM-3  Block IIA test interceptors remained undefinitized for 629 days. According  to MDA officials, this delay was due in part to the difficulty of accurately  estimating costs on a highly developmental project.", "MDA officials reported having to develop a substantial knowledge base  and consult closely with other DOD entities that would have insight into  the costs of similar projects, after the undefinitized contract action was  entered into. Using an undefinitized contract action in this case, however,  was not without risk to the government. MDA made major financial  commitments to a program before it fully understood the requirements or  the costs.", "To mitigate the risks related to these contract actions, MDA\u2019s Instruction  requires all undefinitized contract actions to be supported by a  determination and findings that articulates the requirement to begin  performance prior to a negotiated agreement, the not-to-exceed price and  the definitization schedule. The DFARS and MDA instruction require all  undefinitized contract actions to be approved by the Director, MDA. MDA  officials told us that they interpret the MDA Instruction to require that the  Director, MDA, sign determination and findings documents in support of  undefinitized contract actions. In addition, MDA contracting officials stated  that to further mitigate the risks related to undefinitized contract actions,  they, as a matter of practice, strive to obligate only the minimum amount  of funding necessary to achieve definitization. Officials indicated that  doing so limits the cost risk for the government, and forces programs to  think carefully about what work needs to be done prior to definitization  and its likely costs.", "While the Director, MDA is required to sign the determination and findings  document, in one instance, this document specifically authorized the  program to amend the requirements and not-to-exceed price without  further formal approval from the Director, MDA. This specific undefinitized  contract action was the largest MDA has entered into since fiscal year  2013. MDA entered into the undefinitized contract action in May 2017,  authorizing the design, development, and initial production of the GMD  program\u2019s Redesigned Kill Vehicle (RKV), with a not-to-exceed price of  $1.088 billion.", "This undefinitized contract action will allow MDA to continue with the RKV  program despite significant cost, schedule, and performance risks, some  of which the determination and findings document for the RKV  undefinitized contract action acknowledged. When MDA released its  acquisition strategy for the RKV in 2015, it predicted the phase covered  by this contract action would cost approximately $800 million, covering  initial testing and production of up to eight RKVs for initial fielding.  Officials stated that the current contract action, with a not-to-exceed price  of $1.088 billion, is for only four interceptors, although since it is  undefinitized, that is subject to change. If the RKV program definitizes this  contract action according to its schedule in May 2018, after 12 months,  this will result in the definitization of the contract action with less than a  year remaining before the program\u2019s critical design review. In other  words, the government will have agreed on contract terms, including  costs, after much of the design work and related costs have been  incurred. As of February 2018, MDA reports obligating $324 million, or 30  percent of the not-to-exceed price, to this undefinitized contract action.  This is in excess of the $244 million planned for the undefinitized period  at the time of award.", "As part of MDA\u2019s annual BMDS Accountability Report, MDA reports on its  planned performance and schedule for the coming fiscal year across  several baselines, one of which is dedicated to contracting performance.  MDA provides these baselines in response to statutory requirements. By  establishing these baselines and then reporting any deviations in cost,  schedule, or performance as a program proceeds, the BMDS  Accountability Report provides information for oversight by identifying  areas of program risk and their causes to decision makers. Baselines also  help ensure that the full financial commitment is considered before  embarking on major development efforts.", "These reports contain some information on undefinitized contracts.

Model-based testing  also informs the warfighter\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures to  maximize BMDS effectiveness such as how many interceptors they will  fire at a threat; and the capability gap analysis, the basis for warfighter  requests for new capabilities. Recognizing the importance of models and  simulations, MDA has taken steps to improve its ability to provide realistic  modeled representations of the integrated BMDS necessary to assess  operational performance. For instance:  In 2009, MDA adjusted its test baseline, known as the Integrated  Master Test Plan, and refocused its testing on collecting data needed  for model development and accreditation.", "In 2016, MDA developed an update to a framework that is used to  integrate the modeled representations of BMDS elements for  assessments, and in 2017 continued an effort to develop digital end- to-end models and simulations to increase modeling capabilities and  to expand the scope of BMDS assessments in the future.", "In 2017, MDA increased its collaboration with BMDS OTA to prioritize  modeling needs and to address them.", "Despite these steps, MDA continues to deliver assets and capabilities  using models that have not been accredited. In April 2016 and May 2017,  we found that MDA had delivered EPAA Phase 2 capabilities in  December 2015 using models that have not been accredited to support  the delivery. MDA continued this practice by delivering two sets of  BMDS-level capabilities since 2015, relying on operational tests  conducted with models that were not accredited for use in such an  assessment. The next delivery, expected at the end of the second quarter  of fiscal year 2018, has also been tested using mostly unaccredited  models.", "Relying on models that are not accredited for operational assessment  increases the risk that modeling errors are not discovered, and a single  undetected modeling error can distort the assessment results for the  entire BMDS. DOD\u2019s acquisition instruction requires that models and  simulations used in operational assessments be verified, validated, and  accredited. Although, as noted above, MDA is generally exempt from  DOD acquisition policies, its own modeling and simulation policy requires  that models and simulations used in operational assessments be verified,  validated, and accredited for that use. Moreover, experts at DOD, MDA,  and other institutions we interviewed agree that models should be  verified, validated, and accredited to ensure that decisions based on  models are informed by the correct data, and that the limitations of that  data are understood. Additionally, according to DOD officials, defense  acquisition programs that follow DOD acquisition regulations verify,  validate, and accredit their models before operational assessments.", "However, our analysis indicates that the accreditation of many MDA  models for operational assessment is, in most cases, not completed in  time to support testing. In fact, many of them are not complete even after  a capability has been delivered. Additionally, BMDS OTA officials said  that models that are not accredited before delivery are not generally  accredited later on. Figure 7 shows the percentage of accredited models  that were used in the operational assessment of each BMDS capability  delivery in 2015 through 2017.", "BMDS models are not accredited for operational assessment in large part  for three reasons: (1) MDA does not provide sufficient evidence to the  BMDS OTA for accreditation, (2) some models do not accurately  represent BMDS performance in the real world, and (3) the threat model  used to stimulate the test cannot be traced to the original intelligence  community assessment. These challenges affect assessments across the  entire BMDS engagement, from detection and processing of the threat to  the intercept. While modeling uncertainty in any one of these areas  affects uncertainty for the BMDS as a whole, factored together this  uncertainty is magnified.", "Lack of Data: In some cases, MDA did not provide the BMDS OTA data  needed to accredit the models used in operational ground testing, even  though it is a signatory to the BMDS OTA\u2019s accreditation plan. This plan  identifies the data needed to achieve accreditation and directs that these  data should be provided at least 60 days prior to official operational  ground testing. MDA officials noted that the BMDS OTA recently  changed its data requirements for accreditation and that they were unable  to meet the new requirements in time to inform the capability deliveries  shown above. However, we have found that MDA has encountered  similar challenges since 2009. In fact, according to BMDS OTA officials,  MDA has never completely provided the needed data on time and often  missed numerous subsequent deadlines. In many cases, MDA failed to  deliver the required data even after it tested and delivered its capabilities,  and in some instances the data MDA provided did not meet the BMDS  OTA\u2019s requirements. As we have previously reported, disruptions to  MDA\u2019s testing program\u2014such as flight test failures and delays\u2014reduce  the amount of real-world data that is available to accredit models. We  also found that MDA proceeded with model-based ground tests and  capability deliveries without leveraging the knowledge it planned to obtain  from these tests. For example, in 2016 and 2017, we found that MDA  delivered the European Phased Adaptive Approach Phase 2, even  though key models, such as the model for Aegis Ashore, were  unaccredited. Additionally, in other instances, MDA lacks technical data and other model information that is needed for accreditation, especially  for models representing older systems.", "In 2017, as noted above, MDA and the BMDS OTA increased their  collaboration to improve model accreditation status and, in 2017, co- developed a list of prioritized modeling deficiencies. Additionally, MDA is  making progress in gathering and providing model data for operational  assessment accreditation. MDA officials reported that based on this  increasing collaboration, they expect that more models will be accredited  in 2018. It is unlikely, however, that all models will achieve accreditation  prior to the upcoming December 2018 delivery of the European Phased  Adaptive Approach Phase 3.", "Modeling Deficiencies: Another reason that some models are not  accredited for operational use is that certain models contain deficiencies,  such as optimistic representations of BMDS performance and simplistic  representations of BMDS environments. In these cases, while MDA  initially supplied BMDS OTA with the relevant data, the model\u2019s  performance failed to meet the criteria for accreditation. Subsequently,  MDA did not provide supporting rationale to explain these failures, or to  explain how the modeling issues skewed the overall performance results.  For example, in 2016, the BMDS OTA compared modeled sensor  tracking data used in recent ground tests to real-world sensor tracking  data and found that the models representing some radars performed  better than the real-world radar. These modeling deficiencies can affect  other BMDS elements that rely on sensor data and can artificially inflate  BMDS performance. In one case, Aegis BMD\u2019s launch-on-remote  capabilities were over-estimated. As a result, the BMDS OTA could not  accredit the models, and thus verify that ground test results that support  Aegis\u2019s launch-on-remote capability and other tested capabilities are  credible and reliable. MDA is working to address this issue and it is too  early to assess progress.", "Additionally, some models used in operational assessments are overly  simplistic. For example, modeled representations of the battle scene in  moments after intercept do not display the resulting complex scene that is  caused by the large quantity of missile and interceptor debris. This  deficiency limits insight into how the BMDS will perform during realistic  ballistic missile attacks that could require follow-on interceptors to be  launched, and how the BMDS will determine that the incoming threats  have been destroyed. According to BMDS OTA and MDA officials, MDA\u2019s  efforts to develop digital models can help in this area, by providing more  processing power and great scalability for engagement complexity;  however, the capability is not expected to be mature until 2021 or later.", "Threat Models Cannot Be Traced Back to Underlying Threat  Assessments: The value of ground test-generated data is dependent on  the quality of the threat model that stimulates the test. However, the  BMDS OTA has never been able to accredit threat models before  operational testing, and in some cases, after testing. As is the case with  other models, in some cases, the BMDS OTA does not receive data  needed to accredit the models from MDA in a timely manner. Additionally,  the BMDS OTA cannot trace the threat model used in ground testing to  the threat model that MDA developed based on the intelligence  community\u2019s threat assessment. For example, according to BMDS OTA  officials, during a past ground test event, a model representing a BMDS  element rejected the intended threat model and instead ran its own  internal threat model. As a result, the test did not reflect real world  conditions where the entire BMDS would be exposed to the same threat  stimulus.", "BMDS OTA officials said that MDA\u2019s ground test architecture is not  designed to generate the data needed to confirm that all elements are  reacting to the same model during ground testing, meaning that  unbeknownst to testers, other BMDS elements could also reject the  approved threat model during testing. These deficiencies introduce  ambiguity into the test results including the extent to which the BMDS  operated as an integrated system of systems against a common threat  set.

While the  BMDS OTA has recently begun to brief some combatant commands on  how modeling limitations impact the warfighters\u2019 understanding of  delivered capabilities, these briefings are not readily available to other  stakeholders and decision makers, such as cognizant congressional  committees or others in DOD and the executive branch. In its report  accompanying a bill for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2017, the House Armed Services Committee requested that MDA  brief the House and Senate Armed Services Committees on the  accreditation status of models used in testing indicating that  congressional decision makers benefit from such information.

Even though  these systems will no longer be under MDA management, they will still be  part of the BMDS and, like the Space-based Infrared System and Patriot,  will require model updates to reflect changes to the tactical systems.  However, as noted above, there are currently no agreements between  MDA and the services to fund these modeling requirements, increasing  the risk that model upgrades will not be implemented, thus preventing  their verification, validation and accreditation for operational testing. If  MDA and the services do not agree to the technical and funding  requirements for models of elements used in BMDS testing but operated  by the services before the elements are transferred, disagreements will  likely continue to impede the verification, validation, and accreditation of  those models, decreasing confidence in test results and understanding of  how the real-world BMDS will operate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["MDA continues to make mixed progress in delivering assets and  integrated capabilities.

According  to program officials, Lockheed Martin halted interceptor delivery but  continued interceptor production. The connector was redesigned and  incorporated into 20 interceptors, which again failed testing before being  deployed. After a second redesign the connector passed testing and  interceptor delivery resumed in April 2017. As of December 2017, there  were 16 interceptors that had been produced but not yet fitted with the  redesigned connector. Program officials report that the delay should  result in about 2 months of delivery delays of the last interceptor lot  currently under contract.", "According to program officials, to prevent similar problems from occurring  again, the government revised the Parts Materials and Processes Control  plan to provide improved guidance and clarity related to parts selection  and change control; added additional criteria to annual audits to enhance  review of supplier parts management, materials, and processes; and  tightened controls on suppliers to report any significant changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA and Army are at an Impasse Regarding Transfer of THAAD Program to the Army", "paragraphs": ["Appendix X: Terminal High Altitude Area  Defense (THAAD)", "THAAD, that would be the Army) not later than the date the President\u2019s  fiscal year 2021 budget is submitted.

MDA is willing to transfer to the Army  the THAAD program of record as is.

The Department of Defense (DOD) did not agree with our  recommendation. However, as evidenced by the discrepancy between  the Army\u2019s and MDA\u2019s requirements for the THAAD and AN/TPY-2  program, the difference between MDA\u2019s requirements and those of the  warfighter will continue to present substantial problems to DOD in  executing the missile defense mission, and we continue to believe that  our recommendation should be implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, LaTonya Miller, Assistant  Director; Matthew Ambrose; Kristine Hassinger; Helena Johnson; Joe  Kirschbaum; Wiktor Niewiadomski; Steven Stern; Brian Tittle; Hai V.
