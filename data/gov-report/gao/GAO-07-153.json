To donate cars directly to YouthBuild USA, GSA would need new statutory authority to deviate from the existing process for disposing of surplus federal property. If it were given this authority, GSA would likely first seek appropriations to recover the loss in sales revenue from the donations but would also consider increasing its leasing rates for compact sedans. However, GSA would also require new legislative authority to increase its rates for this purpose because the current statute governing its Fleet program does not allow it to pass on these costs to the agencies that lease vehicles from it. The seven studies GAO reviewed consistently found that owning a car or having access to one increases the likelihood that low-income individuals (such as rural Youthbuild participants) find a job. One reason for this is that a car allows a person to search for a job over a wider geographic area. Differences between the populations in these studies and rural Youthbuild participants did not allow GAO to use this research to identify the degree to which participants in YouthBuild USA's proposed program would benefit from having a car. Six studies of low income car ownership programs and the experiences of those operating the programs indicated that participants got and retained jobs, earned higher wages, and spent more time with their families as a result of owning a car. However, it is difficult to project the results of these studies to rural Youthbuild participants because of limitations in the methodologies of the studies, differences between individuals served by the programs and YouthBuild USA, and differences in the designs of the existing programs and the YouthBuild USA proposal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who live in high poverty areas can face  significant obstacles to finding employment and receiving job training,  including low levels of academic achievement, limited work experience,  and a scarcity of jobs in their communities. In rural communities, these  youth may face the additional challenge of a lack of transportation to get to  available job opportunities because of scarce public transportation and,  according to job training and other social service providers, having a car is  often a necessity for obtaining and keeping a good job. To address this  challenge, YouthBuild USA, a national nonprofit organization working to  increase the number of youth transitioning out of poverty, has proposed  providing donated vehicles to selected low-income youth in rural  communities to travel to job training sites and to work. YouthBuild USA\u2019s  proposed Rural Initiative Low Income Car Ownership (LICO) program  hinges on receiving donations of used cars from the federal government\u2019s  General Services Administration (GSA).", "GSA purchases new vehicles and then leases them to federal agencies  through its Fleet program. Each year, GSA sells at auction approximately  40,000 of these vehicles, most of which are 3 to 4 years old. The proceeds  from these auctions help fund purchases of new vehicles for the Fleet  program. Under its proposed LICO program, YouthBuild USA is seeking  donations of 1 to 5 percent of the vehicles GSA auctions off annually, which  it would then provide to participants in selected rural Youthbuild programs.  Because GSA\u2019s Fleet program is currently self-sustaining and YouthBuild  USA does not yet have experience operating a LICO program, you asked us  to report on the implications of YouthBuild USA\u2019s proposal. Specifically,  this report (1) assesses the effect of donating 1 to 5 percent of selected GSA  used cars on GSA\u2019s fleet vehicle sales operations, (2) describes what  studies have shown with respect to the benefits that car ownership or  access may hold for low-income individuals, and (3) describes what studies  of selected LICO programs and experiences of these programs have shown  with respect to the benefits of participant car ownership.", "To assess the effect on GSA\u2019s fleet vehicle sales operations from donating  vehicles, we focused our analysis on GSA compact sedans to determine the  average opportunity cost\u2014the reduction in revenue for each compact  sedan GSA would donate\u2014and the total reduction in sales revenue GSA  would face by donating 1 to 5 percent of its used compact sedans (112 to  559 cars) to YouthBuild USA\u2019s proposed Rural Initiative LICO program. To  describe the results studies have shown with respect to benefits of car  access (that is, owning a car or having access to one), we identified and  reviewed academic studies that had been subject to a peer review and  spoke with experts. To describe what some LICO programs have shown  with respect to the benefits of participant car ownership, we identified six  LICO programs that had been the subjects of external reviews of their  programs\u2019 outcomes. We also met with officials from these LICO programs  to learn about how their programs operated and how they reported  outcomes. Appendix I provides additional details on our objectives, scope,  and methodology.

GSA then leases these vehicles to 75 participating federal agencies in the  United States, Europe, and Puerto Rico. As part of its leasing arrangement  with these agencies, GSA provides maintenance, repairs, fuel, and  management of accident claims and gets reimbursed for these costs by the  participating agencies. As part of a regular replacement schedule, GSA  sells older vehicles in its fleet.  The agency uses a nationwide network of  commercial auction firms to dispose of and sell about 35,000 to 40,000 of its  used vehicles annually. Federal agencies may dispose of property, such as  GSA\u2019s vehicles, only in the manner authorized by statute. Specifically, GSA  auctions vehicles from the Fleet program under the \u201cexchange/sale\u201d  authority contained in the Federal Property and Administrative Services  Act (Federal Property Act). Under this authority, an executive agency may  acquire personal property by exchanging or selling similar items and  applying the exchange allowance or proceeds of sale, in whole or in part payment, for the property acquired. GSA uses the sales proceeds from  these auctions to help purchase new vehicles. Figure 1 illustrates GSA\u2019s  process for leasing and subsequently auctioning vehicles.", "Welfare reform experts contend that transportation is an important  element in assisting former welfare recipients with finding employment.    However, they also contend that public transportation is not always  convenient or accessible and, for some families receiving assistance,  driving is the best option. To address this issue, several communities  started LICO programs as highly individualized initiatives designed to meet  local transportation needs. In 2002, the National Economic Development  and Law Center documented at least 60 LICO programs across the country  serving welfare recipients and the working poor by helping with the high  costs associated with car ownership, including maintenance, repairs, and  insurance. Typically, these programs rely on older cars received through  donations from individuals. They employ a number of strategies that  include making affordable and reliable used vehicles directly available to  customers or providing low-cost loans to enable individuals to buy  vehicles. Today, there are over 160 documented programs across the  country serving the car ownership needs of low-income individuals.", "YouthBuild USA, which to date has not operated its own LICO program, has  proposed a Rural Initiative LICO program that would rely on 3- to 4-year-old  vehicles donated by GSA to provide affordable and reliable transportation  for rural youth. YouthBuild USA is a national nonprofit organization that  provides staff training and technical assistance to the nationwide network  of almost 200 local Youthbuild programs. The local programs serve youth  between the ages of 16 and 24 and focus primarily on providing training in  the building trades. YouthBuild USA is proposing to obtain donated  vehicles directly from GSA Fleet and provide these vehicles to eligible  youth so that they can continue in the job training program or have reliable  transportation to work sites or college after they have graduated from the  program. Under the proposal, YouthBuild USA will identify eligible rural  Youthbuild programs and youth at these sites who would benefit from a  donated vehicle. The program would have several requirements for  participants, including possession of a valid driver\u2019s license, eligibility for  insurance, good attendance in the Youthbuild program, and successful  completion of a 6-week car ownership course.  According to program  officials, YouthBuild USA would hold the title of the car for 3 years, during  which the participant would have to demonstrate a good track record for  preventative maintenance in order to fully own the vehicle. Rural  Youthbuild sites participating in the program would have to demonstrate  financial stability and the capacity to administer and provide project  oversight on the local level.

From fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2006  (as of August 2006), GSA, on average, auctioned 11,171 compact sedans  each year, with a mean sales price of $5,511. GSA officials indicated that  they base their decision to sell their used cars on a combination of factors  intended to maximize their revenues. For example, they look at the  expected sales proceeds of the vehicle based on its age and mileage to  determine at what point they will get the maximum value for selling their  used cars. They currently use the following age and mileage guidelines for  selling their used cars:     3 years old and 36,000 or more miles, or   4 years old and any miles, or   any age and 60,000 or more miles.", "In addition, GSA tracks the resale market to determine the high and low  points of the market to help decide when to sell and what types of vehicles  to sell. Finally, they look at events that could affect the used car market.  For example, Hurricane Katrina increased the demand for used vehicles in  parts of the country that were not affected by the hurricane.", "If GSA donated to YouthBuild USA 1 percent of the compact sedans it  normally sells at auctions, this would be about 112 cars with a total  reduction in estimated sales revenues of about $600,000. If GSA donated 5  percent of the compact sedans it normally auctions, this would be about  559 cars with a total reduction in estimated sales revenues of about $3  million.

Currently, to support its  Fleet operations, GSA relies on the proceeds of its auction of used vehicles  and the income it receives from the rates it charges agencies that lease  vehicles from it. According to GSA officials, in setting its leasing rates, it is  allowed to include an increment to these rates to cover inflation on its  current inventory of vehicles, as well as to cover the estimated replacement  cost of these vehicles to meet the demand of agencies that lease from the  Fleet program. This increment is known as replacement cost pricing.

GSA Fleet does  not participate in this process. Specifically, under the process for disposing  of surplus federal property, federal agencies must determine if any property  under their control is excess, or no longer needed, within the agency. If this  is the case, they must then report this to GSA, which first determines if any  other federal agency needs the property. If no other agency needs it, GSA  declares the property to be \u201csurplus\u201d and can dispose of it in a number of  ways, such as by selling it or destroying it. GSA also has authority to donate  this property but may not do so directly to specific private organizations,  such as YouthBuild USA. Instead, it must donate the property through state  agencies, which, in turn, donate it to public agencies or certain nonprofit  educational or public health institutions or organizations.", "According to GSA officials, if they were given the statutory authority  explicitly allowing them to donate vehicles from their Fleet program to  YouthBuild USA, they would likely first seek appropriations to the General  Supply Fund to make up for the reductions in revenues associated with  donating the vehicles. In addition, they would consider increasing the  rates they charge federal agencies to lease vehicles, in order to recover this  reduction in revenues. However, GSA currently lacks authority to pass on  the costs of donations to its client agencies. Specifically, the Federal  Property Act specifies how GSA is to set prices to recover the costs of  operating the fleet. The pricing formula (through which GSA sets its leasing  rates) specifies that prices should cover the costs of operating the fleet and  may include an increment for the cost of replacing fleet vehicles and  related equipment.  Because the costs associated with donations of fleet  vehicles would not be costs of operating or replacing the fleet and related  equipment, statutory authority would be needed in order to increase the  rates GSA charges its client agencies to recover the costs of donating cars  to YouthBuild USA.", "GSA officials indicated there are different ways they might consider raising  leasing rates if given authority to do so but also expressed concerns about  the effect such an increase might ultimately have on the viability of the  Fleet program. For example, GSA could raise its rates only for those  agencies that lease compact sedans; this would result in a 1 percent  increase in order to recover the reduction of $600,000 in sales revenue. To  recover the reductions from donating 5 percent of its compact sedans ($3  million in sales revenue), GSA might raise its leasing rates by about 5  percent. Another option GSA could pursue would be to raise its rates  across all agencies that lease vehicles from it, regardless of car type. In this  case, all agencies that lease vehicles from GSA Fleet (not just those leasing  compact sedans) would subsidize the vehicle donations.", "GSA officials indicated that if the agency raised its rates too high, this could  affect the economic viability of the Fleet program. Nothing requires federal  agencies to lease vehicles from GSA; they can lease from private  companies if they choose to do so. GSA officials told us that the agency is  currently less expensive than the private sector in terms of leasing rates.  GSA officials indicated that, while raising the rate GSA charges to lease  vehicles in order to recover the reduced sales revenue from donating 1 to 5  percent of its compact sedans to YouthBuild USA would probably not  cause the federal agencies to stop leasing from GSA, the officials are more  concerned that donating vehicles would inspire other nonprofit  organizations to seek donations from GSA Fleet. According to GSA  officials, they have received such requests in the past. If GSA were required  to donate a greater percentage of its Fleet vehicles to nonprofit  organizations, then GSA\u2019s leasing rates could eventually become higher  than its competitors in the private sector and eventually drive GSA out of  the leasing business.", "Another option GSA officials cited does not require a legislative change.  Specifically, GSA officials indicated that it could decrease the amount of  funds it uses to buy new cars each year. Because GSA would have less sales  revenue due to donating some of the cars it normally would sell, GSA  would have less funds to buy new cars. According to GSA officials, to  compensate for the purchase of fewer new cars, GSA would keep its cars in  the Fleet program longer than the current 3- to 5-year time period.  Furthermore, because these cars would be older than GSA\u2019s current fleet,  they would require more maintenance, which would result in higher  maintenance costs. Due to the prospective nature of a donation program,  GSA officials indicated that they did not have sufficient information to give  a precise estimate of the increased maintenance costs GSA would incur.

Two other studies, focusing on car ownership, estimated  increases of 5 to 11 hours per week in the number of hours those they  studied worked.", "The literature gives several explanations for these results. For example, a  car likely allows a person to search for a job over a wider geographic area,  expanding the number of employment opportunities and the chances he or  she will find a job.

Research has shown that older, more educated individuals are more likely  to find employment (with or without a car) than younger and less educated  individuals.", "In addition, four of the studies we reviewed were based on data from  mainly urban populations, while two others used national data without  controlling for urban/rural locations. Controlling for differences such as  urban and rural populations would be necessary to extrapolate from these  studies for the Youthbuild population because of various differences  between the two groups. For example, we have reported in the past that  rural residents generally have fewer public transportation options and live  in less densely populated areas than urban residents, making them more  dependent on car access or ownership. Consequently, the effect of car  access in rural areas may be more difficult to discern and different than in  urban areas because rural residents have fewer transportation options  from which to choose. Also, rural unemployment rates are higher on  average than urban areas; as a result, the effect of increasing car access on  new employment may be substantially different than in urban areas.

Four of these six programs require participants to obtain a low- interest loan to purchase a car, while YouthBuild USA proposes donating  cars to participants.

One of these two programs may also assist the  participants in obtaining a loan, and the other requires the participants to  make payments for the purchase of the car. In order to qualify for the loans,  the programs require participants to have adequate income to support car  payments and meet creditworthiness standards. Once they obtain the car,  participants must make the loan payments for the term of the loan.  Because of these requirements, as well as participants\u2019 greater reliance on  their own resources, officials of these LICO programs told us that they  believe that their participants have greater incentives toward ensuring that  they realize the benefits of car ownership than do individuals who receive a  donated vehicle.

Officials of  these LICO programs stated that, before allowing participants to obtain a  loan, it was important for them to understand how to budget their money  and deal with credit responsibly. They indicated that the financial literacy  training and subsequent counseling was an essential component of their  programs and tied to the success of participants fulfilling their obligations  on their loans, as well as getting or keeping their jobs.", "Furthermore, most of the LICO programs implemented various  arrangements for costs of repairs as part of their programs. For example,  two programs developed plans to enable participants to cover the costs of  minor repairs by establishing accounts to which participants make small  monthly deposits, which they later may use for repair costs. Also, one of  these programs required participants to contribute a one-time fee of $250 to  a pool that could later be used to cover the costs of major repairs above  $700. Additionally, an official of one LICO program told us that it addressed  the issue of budgeting for repair costs by securing favorable rates in  advance at specific auto shops and requiring participants to go to these  specific vendors for repairs.", "Finally, similar to the studies we reviewed related to car access in general,  the differences between the populations served by these LICO programs  and those YouthBuild USA proposes to serve also might limit the extent to  which the outcomes of these LICO programs could be applied to  YouthBuild USA\u2019s proposal. Our reviews of the participants\u2019 profiles of the  LICO programs studied found that more than half of the participants were  single women in their mid-20s to 30s, with children, and with some  education beyond high school. In contrast, participants in YouthBuild USA\u2019s  LICO program would primarily be men between the ages of 16 and 24 who  would have not completed high school upon entering the Youthbuild  program.

Additionally, GSA stated a concern that creating a donation program to  YouthBuild USA could lead other organizations to seek donated vehicles as  well.", "GSA also stated that the report does not clearly address the question as to  why YouthBuild USA should receive donated GSA vehicles over other  worthy charitable organizations. In our review, we focused on the effect of  donating 1 to 5 percent of selected GSA cars on GSA\u2019s fleet vehicle sales  operations and the potential benefits to rural Youthbuild participants from  such donations.

We focused our analysis on GSA compact sedans sales because this  is the type of vehicle YouthBuild USA officials told us that they would  primarily need for their proposed Rural Initiative LICO program. We used  GSA\u2019s data from fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to calculate the average  opportunity cost\u2014the reduction in revenue for each compact sedan GSA  would donate\u2014and the total reduction in sales revenue GSA would face by  donating 1 to 5 percent of its compact sedans. To determine how much  GSA might increase the rate it charges federal agencies that lease compact  sedans from it (in order to recover the reduction in sales revenues from  donating 1 to 5 percent of its compact sedans), we obtained data from GSA  on the number of compact sedans it currently leases and revenues it  receives from leasing these vehicles. This data allowed us to calculate the  amount (percentages) GSA would need to increase the rate it charges  federal agencies to make up the reduction in sales revenues from donating  1 to 5 percent of its compact sedans. We obtained written descriptions on  GSA\u2019s computer systems and procedures for ensuring that the agency has  verified Fleet transactions. In addition, the agency provided us with a  written description of how GSA Fleet handles any discrepancies found in  the data in its system. Based on this information, we determined that the  data that GSA provided to us were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report. In addition, we obtained information on the options the agency  might pursue to make up for the reduction in revenues from interviews  with GSA officials. To determine the legal issues that would be involved in  a car donation program, we reviewed the legislation that establishes GSA\u2019s  authority to operate the Fleet program and for it to set prices to recover its  program costs. We also reviewed the legislation that established the  General Supply Fund and the purposes for which the fund can be used and  discussed these and related legal issues with officials from GSA\u2019s General  Counsel.", "To describe what studies have shown with respect to the benefits that car  ownership or access may hold for low-income individuals, we conducted a  literature search of relevant studies, reviewed a list of studies from the Web  site of the National Economic Development and Law Center (NEDLC), and  interviewed two individuals who had conducted research on this issue.  Based on these efforts, we identified a large body of research on car access  and employment. We limited our review to seven studies that used more  sophisticated economic models that distinguished between car access and  several other factors that could affect the likelihood that an individual  found a job, such as education, age, and gender. Our review of these seven  studies included an analysis of study methodologies, the individuals that  were studied, study results with respect to car access and employment, and  study limitations. In order to address the issue of the extent to which the  results of these studies could be applied to YouthBuild USA\u2019s proposed  LICO program, we compared the individuals reviewed in these studies with  rural Youthbuild participants. For a more detailed summary of our review  of these seven studies, see appendix II.", "To determine what studies of selected LICO programs have shown with  respect to the benefits of participants\u2019 car ownership, we spoke with  experts in the field of LICO programs about the nature and extent of  existing studies of LICO programs. These experts identified several LICO  programs that had been subject to an independent evaluation of their  outcomes. Additionally, to identify other LICO programs that had been  subject to an independent evaluation and were located in rural areas, we  reviewed about 140 LICO programs listed on the NEDLC Internet Web site  and contacted those LICO programs on the NEDLC listing that appeared to  be located in rural and mixed rural-urban areas. From our discussions with  the experts and contacts with the LICO programs, we identified and  selected the following six LICO programs that had been subject to an  independent evaluation:    Good Wheels, Augusta, Maine  Good News Garage, Burlington, Vermont  West CAP JumpStart, Glenwood City, Wisconsin  New Leaf Services, Inc., Decatur, Georgia   Ways to Work, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin  Working Wheels, Seattle, Washington Three of these programs were located in rural areas, two in urban areas,  and one in a mixed rural-urban area. Four of the six LICO programs were  loan programs, one was a car-donation and car-sales program, and the  other was a car sales program. We obtained and analyzed copies of the  studies for the six LICO programs in order to identify the reported  outcomes and potential limitations with these studies. Where possible, we  reviewed information from the LICO program Web sites to obtain  information on how these programs operate, what types of individuals they  serve, and how many cars they provide to their participants. We also  interviewed LICO program officials about their studies to gain a better  understanding of the reported outcomes and limitations with the studies.  During these interviews, we also obtained more background information  about the LICO programs\u2019 designs, populations served, and challenges the  officials faced in running these LICO programs.
