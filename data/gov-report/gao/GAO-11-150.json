NGEN capabilities, such as secure transport of voice and data, data storage, and e-mail, are to be incrementally acquired through multiple providers. As planned, the first increment is expected to provide comparable NMCI capabilities, additional information assurance, and greater DON network control, at a cost of about $50 billion through fiscal year 2025. Given the size, importance, and complexity of NGEN, GAO was asked to determine whether DON has sufficiently analyzed alternative acquisition approaches and has a reliable schedule for executing the program, and whether program acquisition decisions have been performance- and risk-based. To do this, GAO reviewed the NGEN analysis of alternatives, integrated master schedule, and key milestone decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DON did not sufficiently analyze alternative acquisition approaches for NGEN because the alternatives analysis contained key weaknesses, and none of the alternatives assessed match the current acquisition approach. Specifically, the cost estimates for the respective alternatives were not reliable because they were not substantially accurate, and they were neither comprehensive nor credible. Further, the operational effectiveness analysis, the other key aspect of an analysis of alternatives, did not establish and analyze sufficient measures for assessing each alternative's ability to achieve program goals and deliver program capabilities. Moreover, the acquisition approach that DON is actually pursuing was not one of the alternatives assessed in the analysis, and it is riskier and potentially costlier than the alternatives analyzed because it includes a higher number of contractual relationships. According to program officials, the analysis reflects the most that could be done in the time that was available to complete it, and they do not view the alternative selected as materially different from the assessed alternatives, even though it is about $4.7 billion more costly. DON does not have a reliable schedule for executing NGEN. Only two of the four subschedules that GAO reviewed, each of which help form the master schedule, adequately satisfied any of the nine practices that are associated with developing and maintaining a reliable schedule. These weaknesses have contributed to delays in key program milestones. During the course of GAO's review, DON stated that action was taken to address some, but not all, of these weaknesses. According to program officials, schedule estimating was constrained by staffing limitations. NGEN acquisition decisions were not always performance- and risk-based. In particular, the program was approved in the face of known performance shortfalls and risks. For example, the program was approved at a key acquisition review despite the lack of defined requirements, which was recognized as a risk that would impact the completion of other key documents, such as the test plan. This risk was later realized as a critical issue. According to program officials, the decisions to proceed were based on their view that they had sufficiently mitigated known risks and issues. Collectively, these weaknesses mean that DON does not have a sufficient basis for knowing that it is pursuing the best approach for acquiring NGEN capabilities and the program's cost and schedule performance is unlikely to track to estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that DOD limit further investment in NGEN until it conducts an interim review to reconsider the selected acquisition approach and addresses issues discussed in this report.

As such, cost  estimates should be reliable in order to provide the basis for informed  investment decision making, realistic budget formulation, meaningful  progress measurement, and accountability for results. Our research has  identified four characteristics of a high-quality, reliable cost estimate: well- documented, comprehensive, accurate, and credible.", "The NGEN AOA assessed four alternatives. All alternatives were  assumed to deliver the same NMCI capabilities and the technolog alternatives was assumed to be substantially the same. The primary  differences among the alternatives were how NGEN was to be acquired,  managed, and operated. Table 6 below provides a description of each  alternative.", "The four alternatives\u2019 estimated costs for increment 1 from fiscal year 2011  to fiscal year 2015 ranged from $10.25 billion (alternative 1) to $10.84  billion (alternatives 2 and 3V). However, the estimates were not reliable  because they substantially met only one of the characteristics of reliable  cost estimates. Specifically,    The AOA cost estimates were substantially well-documented. To be well- documented, the cost estimates should state the purpose of the estimate;  provide program background, including a system description; provide a  schedule for developing the estimates; specify the scope of the estimate  (in terms of time and what is and is not included); disclose key ground  rules and assumptions, data sources, calculations performed and their  results, the estimating methodology and rationale, and the results of a risk  analysis; and provide a conclusion about whether the cost estimate is  reasonable. Moreover, this information should be captured in such a way  that the data used to derive the estimate can be traced to their sources.  Finally, the cost estimates should be reviewed and accepted by  management.", "Although the AOA did not sufficiently document the schedule, scope, and  results of the risk analysis, it defined the purpose of the estimate; provided  program background (e.g., system description); and disclosed ground  rules and assumptions, data sources, calculations performed and their  results, and the estimating methodology. Also, the data used to derive the  estimates were captured in such a way that they could largely be traced to  their sources, and the final AOA was reviewed and accepted by DON and  OSD oversight entities.", "The AOA cost estimates were not comprehensive. To be comprehensive,  the cost estimates should include all government and contractor costs  over the program\u2019s full life cycle, from program inception through design,  development, deployment, and operation and maintenance to retirement.  They should also provide sufficient detail and reflect all cost-influencing  ground rules and assumptions.", "However, the cost estimates were not full life cycle costs. Instead, they  only included government and contractor costs for a 5-year period from  fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2015, covering 2 years of continued NMCI  services with the current provider, 2 years of transition to the new  provider(s), and 1 year of NGEN operation and maintenance. DON and  OSD CAPE officials attributed this to the assumption that NGEN  increment 1 contracts would have a 5-year period of performance and that  future NGEN increments might be introduced after that period.", "Further, while the estimates were based on a cost element structure that  was decomposed to a sufficient level of detail, and the documentation  largely identified ground rules and assumptions, the cost estimates did not  reflect all assumptions identified in the AOA, such as schedule and  performance risks associated with (1) implementing IT processes, (2)  expanding the government workforce, and (3) formulating the NGEN  contracts. These were significant cost-influencing risks and thus should  have been incorporated into the estimates.", "The AOA cost estimates were not substantially accurate. To be accurate,  the cost estimates should not be overly conservative or optimistic and  should be, among other things, based on an assessment of the most likely  costs, and adjusted properly for inflation. In addition, steps should be  taken to minimize mathematical mistakes and to ground the estimate in  documented assumptions that can be verified by supporting data and a  historical record of actual cost and schedule experiences on comparable  programs.", "To DON\u2019s credit, the cost estimates were developed based on NMCI  historical cost data, were adjusted properly for inflation, contained few  mathematical mistakes, and were largely grounded in documented  assumptions. However, the supporting data for key assumptions were not  verified. For example, all estimates assumed that transition activity costs  would amount to about 18 percent of the estimated cost of NGEN in its  first year of operation, and alternative 3\u2019s estimate assumed that total cost  would be reduced by 10 percent due to increased competition from its  multicontract approach. However, the supporting data used by Deloitte  Consulting for these assumptions were not provided to DON or the  independent government review team for verification because the data  were proprietary to the contractor. Further, NMCI historical data were  only available at an aggregate level, so the team had to rely on subject- matter experts and other sources to estimate costs at a finer level of detail.", "The AOA cost estimates were not credible. To be credible, the cost  estimates should discuss any limitations in the analysis due to uncertainty  or biases surrounding the data and assumptions. Major assumptions  should be varied and other outcomes computed to determine how  sensitive the estimate is to changes in the assumptions. Risk and  uncertainty inherent in the estimate should be assessed and disclosed.  Further, the estimate should be properly verified by, for example,  comparing the results with an independent cost assessment.", "While the AOA identified limitations in the cost analysis, such as the use of  NMCI data that did not reflect prices of other service providers, and  evaluated the impact on costs of using different transition timeline  scenarios, it did not include a sensitivity analysis of the key cost driver  (i.e., the number of personnel needed to manage NGEN), despite concerns  that the Navy\u2019s estimates of these numbers were not stabilized at the time  of the AOA. In addition, while each cost estimate included a cost risk  analysis based on the quality of data used, there were discrepancies in  how the analysis was conducted and reported. For example, the cost for  local area network facilities was estimated based on the contractor\u2019s  experience, which was considered by the cost team to be a less credible  data source, but it was scored higher on their risk scale, indicating that the  data source was more credible. Also, schedule and performance risks  were not quantified and reflected in the estimates, which is significant  because a qualitative assessment of schedule and performance risks  among alternatives revealed increased risk in implementing a segmented  approach. If such risks had been quantified and reflected in the estimates,  the results would have shown higher costs associated with alternatives 3  and 3V. Nevertheless, the AOA concluded that there was no significant  cost difference among the alternatives.", "In addition, the cost estimates were not validated by the independent team  responsible for reviewing the cost analysis. Specifically, independent  review team officials told us that they participated in a line-by-line review  of the cost model where they raised comments and questions to the cost  team. However, about 69 percent of the team\u2019s comments were not fully  addressed and included notable concerns, such as the questionable use of  certain industry-based assumptions that may not be comparable to a  program as large as NGEN or to the government environment.  Independent review team officials attributed the comments not being  closed to the fact that the team did not have authority over the cost model  to ensure that its comments were addressed. Further, these officials told  us that they were not asked to review the final version of the cost model,  which was the version that first introduced alternative 3V, and their review  of the final version of the AOA report occurred after the DON CIO had  submitted it to OSD CAPE for final approval.", "According to officials responsible for developing the AOA, the weaknesses  in the AOA cost estimates largely exist because there was not enough time  to conduct a more thorough analysis. Specifically, they told us that the  AOA schedule was constrained because the program wanted to get  requests for proposals for NGEN contracts out by a predetermined date.  This position was also supported by various management meeting minutes  and other artifacts that we reviewed. However, DOD and DON officials  disagreed with this position and told us that the time allotted to conduct  the AOA did not negatively impact its quality or scope. A time-constrained  approach is not consistent with DOD guidance, which states that the scope  of an alternatives analysis should be proportionate to the amount of  resources affected by the decision, with more significant programs  receiving more analytical attention. The combination of the AOA  weaknesses we identified, and the fact that NGEN has a preliminary  program life cycle cost estimate of about $50 billion for increment 1 and is  intended to provide the foundation for DON\u2019s future networking  environment, suggest the need for considerable analytical attention to  alternative approaches.", "Without reliable cost estimates for each alternative, decision makers did  not have a sound basis for making an informed decision on an NGEN  solution. Most notably, since the estimates did not reflect increased risks  associated with the segmented approach, the differences in the  alternatives\u2019 costs were understated, and the amount of risk and costs  accepted by proceeding with a segmented approach were not fully  understood."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AOA Did Not Sufficiently Assess Operational Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["In addition to including reliable cost estimates, an AOA should assess how  well each alternative satisfies required capabilities or goals. According to  DOD guidance, such an analysis should (1) identify the operational  capabilities and goals to be achieved with the system solution, (2)  establish quantitative or qualitative measures for evaluating the  operational effectiveness of each alternative, and (3) assess the ability of  each alternative to achieve these measures.", "While the AOA identified program capabilities and goals, it did not  sufficiently assess the alternatives\u2019 operational effectiveness, making it  unclear how well the alternatives would actually satisfy NGEN capabilities  and goals. Specifically,    The AOA identified capabilities and goals that the system solution should  achieve. Among other things, these included addressing NMCI capability  limitations identified based on 8 years of operational experience, as well  as capabilities needed to support DOD and DON networking strategies for  DOD\u2019s Global Information Grid Network Operations and DON\u2019s future  Naval Networking Environment. (See table 8 for these capabilities and  goals.)", "The AOA did not establish quantitative or qualitative measures for  assessing the alternatives\u2019 ability to achieve the identified NGEN  capabilities and goals, as shown in table 8. For example, one of the  capabilities was visibility into root causes for major network outages,  which the AOA merely concluded that alternatives 2, 3V, and 3 were  equally effective in addressing, even though no quantitative or qualitative  measures of the alternatives\u2019 respective ability to provide visibility into  root causes were defined. Further, the AOA did not discuss the  methodology for assessing the alternatives. Rather, it simply states that it  was a qualitative assessment.", "While the AOA did not establish measures for assessing the alternatives\u2019  ability to achieve NGEN capabilities and goals, it did establish several  quantitative measures to differentiate among the alternatives\u2019 respective  approaches to acquiring, managing, and delivering NMCI capabilities.  However, these measures alone do not provide insight into how they  would influence the operational effectiveness of each alternative because  they were not linked to NGEN capabilities and goals, and they did not  provide sufficient insight for selecting a preferred alternative. For  example, while the AOA recognized that an increase in the number of  contractual relationships would result in more complexity and risk in  implementing the alternative, it did not include measures for quantifying  how much more risk is introduced as the number of contractual  relationships increases. (See table 7 for the measures that were provided  in the AOA.)", "In addition, the AOA included a separate assessment of the likelihood of  each alternative to successfully implement IT best practices for end-to-end  IT service delivery (i.e., IT Service Management framework). To DON\u2019s  credit, the approach used to measure the alternatives in this assessment  was more structured and better documented. Specifically, the AOA team  conducted table-top exercises with subject-matter experts representing  each of the communities that will contribute to the acquisition, operation,  and oversight of NGEN, and it worked through scenarios, such as  everyday operations and responding to a computer network incident, to  determine the extent to which each alternative could employ IT best  practices to address a given scenario. The team captured comments made  by participants and used them to infer rankings that resulted in numerical  scores for each alternative.", "The AOA did not assess the alternatives\u2019 ability to address capabilities and  goals using defined measures of operational effectiveness because, as  stated previously, no measures were established. Instead, it compared the  alternatives based on qualitative determinations of whether the capability  or goal was either met or partially met. (See table 8 for the results of  DON\u2019s assessment.)", "As with the cost estimates, officials responsible for developing the AOA  told us that the operational effectiveness analysis was subject to time  constraints so that requests for proposals could be issued on time.  Although DOD and DON officials told us that the time allotted to conduct  the AOA did not negatively impact its quality or scope, our review suggests  otherwise. Further, the time-constrained approach is not consistent with  DOD guidance, which states that the scope of an alternatives analysis  should be proportionate to the resources affected by the decision, with  more significant programs receiving more analytical attention.", "Without a more thorough effectiveness analysis, decision makers did not  have a sound basis for making an informed decision on the best NGEN  alternative to pursue. Instead, DON has selected a segmented approach on  the basis that it would provide increased flexibility in meeting NGEN  capabilities and goals with no additional cost, even though the degree of  increased flexibility among the alternatives remains unclear."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Acquisition Approach Was Not Addressed in the AOA and Is Riskier and Costlier Than Other Approaches in the Analysis", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD guidance, an AOA should examine viable solutions  with the goal of identifying the most promising option, thereby informing  acquisition decision making. However, the segmented approach currently  being pursued by DON was not one of the alternatives assessed in the  AOA. Specifically, the current approach has more contracts, a different  segmentation scheme, and a different transition timeline than the analyzed  alternatives. Further, the impact of these differences in terms of how they  compare to the original alternatives was not assessed.", "The approach that is being pursued by the program office includes a  higher number of contracts than those analyzed in the AOA. Given that the  AOA highlighted greater schedule and performance risks as the number of  contracts and contractual relationships in the approach increase, the  relative schedule and performance risks for the current approach are  likely greater than those for alternative 3, and therefore are likely to result  in greater costs. In support of this likelihood, DON\u2019s November 2009 risk- adjusted preliminary program life cycle cost estimate for the current  approach for fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015 shows that the  current approach will cost at least an estimated $4.7 billion more than any  of the alternatives in the AOA.

However, we have yet to receive any analysis to support their  positions, and the current approach is estimated to cost about $4.7 billion  more.

As such, the schedule not only provides a road map  for systematic program execution but also provides the means by which to  gauge progress, identify and address potential problems, and promote  accountability. Without a reliable schedule, it is likely that established  program milestones will slip. In the case of NGEN, such delays are already  being experienced.", "Our work has identified nine best practices associated with developing  and maintaining a reliable schedule. These are (1) capturing all activities,  (2) sequencing all activities, (3) assigning resources to all activities, (4)  establishing the duration of all activities, (5) integrating schedule activities  horizontally and vertically, (6) establishing the critical path for all  activities, (7) identifying reasonable \u201cfloat\u201d between activities, (8)  conducting a schedule risk analysis, and (9) updating the schedule using  logic and durations.

The results of our analysis of the four subschedules are  summarized in table 11.", "Capturing all activities. All four subschedules partially met this practice.  Specifically, the majority of the activities contained in these subschedules  could be mapped back to the program\u2019s NGEN work breakdown structure.  However, this structure is defined at a high level and is not expected to be  further decomposed into planned work products and deliverables until the  program enters the deployment phase when NGEN contracts are awarded.  Until this structure is sufficiently defined, it cannot be determined whether  the program schedules capture all work needed to accomplish program  objectives. For example, we identified risk mitigation activities for 10  active risks that should have been, but were not, captured as scheduled  work.", "During our review, program officials told us that they had since taken  steps to ensure that all risk mitigation activities are added to the schedule.  However, until NGEN work is sufficiently defined, the program does not  have complete assurance that the activities currently captured in the  various schedules support NGEN increment 1.", "Sequencing all activities. One subschedule substantially met this practice  while the other three minimally met it. The subschedule that substantially  met this practice had less than 1 percent of activities missing a  predecessor or successor dependency. Of the remaining three  subschedules, two did not identify predecessor or successor activities for  over half of the activities in their schedules. This is of concern because if  an activity that has no logical successor slips, the schedule will not reflect  the effect of these slips on the critical path, float, or scheduled start dates  of \u201cdownstream\u201d (i.e., later) activities. Additionally, one subschedule had  \u201cconstraints\u201d placed on about 73 percent of its activities, meaning that  these activities cannot begin earlier even if upstream work is completed  ahead of schedule. According to program officials, they are working to  reduce the number of constraints in the schedule. However, until activities  are properly sequenced, these issues reduce the credibility of the dates  calculated by the scheduling tool.", "Assigning resources to all activities. Program officials told us that they  do not assign resources to any of the program schedules. They stated that  the effort necessary to assign resources within the schedules would be  significant and that they did not have the staff available to do this.  However, without proper allocation of resources in the schedule, the  program office cannot accurately forecast the likelihood that activities will  be completed by their projected end dates, and the risk that key  milestones will slip increases.", "Establishing the duration of all activities. Two subschedules met this  practice while two only minimally met it. The two subschedules that met  this practice had established activities with reasonable durations\u2014the  majority of which were under 30 days. The remaining two did not establish  reasonable durations for their activities. For example, the majority of the  activities that were in progress for the Transition Integrated Product Team  subschedule had durations ranging from 50 days to 1000 days. When such  long durations are assigned to work activities, it is likely that the activity is  not defined to the necessary level to identify all the work that must be  performed.", "Integrating schedule activities vertically and horizontally.

The subschedule that substantially met the practice is  horizontally aligned, meaning activities are logically sequenced, and  vertically aligned, meaning that detailed activities roll up into larger  summary tasks. The other three subschedules are also vertically aligned;  however, they are unable to demonstrate horizontal integration because,  as previously discussed, activities were not all logically sequenced.", "The integration issues identified on these subschedules also impact the  NGEN master schedule. Because of the high number of missing  dependencies, the number of in-progress activities with durations  exceeding 30 days, and the high number of constraints, the master  schedule is likely not fully horizontally integrated.  Further, one of the subschedules is not vertically aligned with the master  schedule because none of the key work activities in the subschedule were  included in the master schedule. In addition, the master schedule was not  integrated with the approved NGEN acquisition strategy. Program officials  told us they did not revise the dates in the master schedule until after the  continuity of services contract was awarded (July 2010), and that the dates  in the acquisition strategy reflected the current information. By using a  source other than the program office\u2019s working schedule, oversight  officials\u2019 expectations about when milestones will be met may not be  realistic.", "Establishing the critical path for all activities. None of the four  subschedules fully met this practice. Specifically, the scheduling tool was  unable to generate a valid critical path for the subschedules due to the  extent of issues associated with the sequencing of activities, integration of  activities, and identification of reasonable float (discussed below).  Program officials stated that they do not manage a critical path generated  by the scheduling tool. Instead, these officials stated that they track  activities associated with the deployment phase decision (Milestone C),  which they have designated as being critically important to them.  However, such practice does not allow the program to have immediate  insight into the full sequence of activities (both critical and noncritical)  that, if delayed, would impact the planned completion date of Milestone C,  as well as a projected completion date should one of these activities be  delayed.", "Identifying reasonable float between activities. Two subschedules  partially met this practice, while the remaining two minimally met it. Each  of these subschedules identified float; however, the amount of excessive  float varied. Both the Contract Technical Representative Workforce  Reconstitution and IT Service Management Process Development  subschedules partially met this practice because only 25 percent and 41  percent of their work activities had float of 100 days or greater,  respectively. The two remaining subschedules minimally met this practice  because over 60 percent of their activities contained float of 100 days or  greater.", "Excessive float values are indicative of schedule logic that is flawed,  broken, or absent. As such, these float values are of limited value to  mitigate risk by reallocating resources from tasks that can safely slip to  tasks that must be completed on time.", "Conducting a schedule risk analysis. The program has not performed a  schedule risk analysis. Instead, according to program officials, schedule  risks are considered during risk management board meetings and program  health assessments. However, without this analysis, it is not possible to  determine a level of confidence in meeting program milestones. A  schedule risk analysis will calculate schedule reserve, which can be set  aside for those activities identified as high-risk. Without this reserve, the  program faces the risk of delays if they were to occur on critical path  activities.", "Updating the schedule using logic and durations. All four subschedules  partially met this practice. According to program officials, status updates  are performed on the subschedules once a week. However, despite status  updates, date anomalies exist. For example, the Contract Technical  Representative Workforce Reconstitution subschedule included five  activities with an actual start date in the future. Furthermore, the  subschedules\u2019 inability to produce a valid critical path indicates that the  sequencing of activities is not appropriate, thus impairing the scheduling  tool\u2019s ability to generate realistic start and end dates.", "According to program officials, they were aware of some of these schedule  weaknesses based on a May 2010 assessment of the schedule performed  by a support contractor. Among other things, the contractor\u2019s assessment  found that the schedule did not provide for stakeholder review of most of  the major acquisition documents or steps to mitigate known risks, and that  it lacked a valid critical path due to network logic issues and activity  constraints. Officials told us that they plan to address these issues.", "In addition, program officials stated that they hold monthly program  management reviews to discuss schedule quality issues, as well as risks or  issues that might affect the schedule. However, these reviews are not  addressing key schedule issues. Specifically, the NGEN schedule  management plan calls for the schedule to be resource-loaded from a  centralized resource pool approved by the program manager, activities  beginning within 90 days to have durations of no more than 20 days, and  activities for mitigating approved program risks to be added to the  schedule. However, our analysis of the schedule showed that  resources are not assigned within the schedule,   activities that are to begin within 90 days have durations that exceed 20    activities for mitigating 10 approved program risks were not included.", "Collectively, the weaknesses in implementing the nine key practices for  the program\u2019s integrated master schedule increase the risk of schedule  slippages and related cost overruns and make meaningful measurement  and oversight of program status and progress, as well as accountability for  results, difficult to achieve. Moreover, they undermine the schedule\u2019s  ability to produce credible dates for planned NGEN milestones and events.  In the case of increment 1, this risk has already been realized. Specifically,  the NGEN master schedule was rebaselined in August 2010, resulting in  delays in a number of key dates, including a 5-month delay of the  Milestone C decision. See table 12 for a summary of key event and  milestone delays.", "While officials stated that they have addressed some of the weaknesses  identified above in the August 2010 rebaselined integrated master  schedule, they conceded that this schedule does not assign resources to  work activities, and the scheduling tool is unable to generate a valid  critical path. Because these key scheduling practices are not being  performed, the schedule is still not reliable.", "Without a fully integrated and reliably derived schedule for the entire  NGEN program, the program office cannot identify when and how it will  proceed through Milestone C and ultimately transition from NMCI to  NGEN, and it cannot adequately manage and measure its progress in  executing the work needed to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NGEN Acquisition Decisions Were Not Always Performance- and Risk-Based", "paragraphs": ["Successful execution of system acquisition programs depends in part on  effective executive-level governance, to include having organizational  executives review these programs at key milestones in their life cycles and  make informed performance- and risk-based decisions as to how they  should proceed. DON policy recognizes the importance of such milestone  reviews. According to this policy, acquisition programs must proceed  through a series of gate reviews (as discussed above), during which  program performance is assessed and satisfactory program health must be  demonstrated prior to moving forward.", "Currently, program performance and health at each gate are assessed  using the Naval Probability of Program Success assessment methodology,  which was established in September 2008. This assessment addresses four  aspects of a program: (1) requirements, (2) resources, (3)  planning/execution, and (4) external influencers. Associated with each  aspect are two or more metrics, each of which is scored based on  underlying criteria that are unique to each gate. (See table 13 for a  description of each metric.) At a given gate review, the criteria are rated in  terms of green, yellow, or red. Further, the metrics can be designated as  critical, meaning that any significant issues that are associated with these  metrics must be resolved before the gate can be exited.", "As noted earlier, a Gate 1 review was not held because the gate-review  process was not established when the program began. In lieu of a Gate 1  review, according to the NGEN Acquisition Strategy, the Chief of Naval  Operations Executive Board met to confirm NGEN requirements during  the winter of 2007/2008 and these meetings were \u201cnominally\u201d a Gate 1  review. Subsequent to the establishment of the DON gate process, an  NGEN Gate 2 review\u2014intended to focus on an analysis of alternatives\u2014 was waived in early 2008 because the department planned to continue the  use of existing NMCI technology, and NGEN entered the DON review  process at Gate 3 in April 2008. OSD later identified the program as a pre- MAIS acquisition, resulting in the direction to conduct an analysis of  acquisition alternative approaches. As such, DON held a Gate 2 review in  April 2009, one year after the Gate 3 review. Since then, DON held a Gate 4  review in November 2009, as well as a Gate 5 review in October 2010. As  discussed below, the extent to which each of the gate reviews was  performance- and risk-based varied.", "Gate 3 review. At the time of this review, which was in April 2008, the  Probability of Program Success assessment methodology was not yet in  place. Therefore, program review documentation focused on, for example,  program activities that had been completed, were under way, and were  planned. However, these activities were not presented relative to any  benchmark or goal, and thus program performance was not apparent in  the documentation. Further, while program documentation shows that  risks were disclosed, such as funding shortfalls for fiscal years 2008 and  2009, as well as workforce and training challenges, the scope and nature of  the information presented did not extend to the level that the assessment  methodology provides. For example, the information presented did not  address the realism and achievability of the program master schedule and  the confidence level associated with the current cost estimate, including  the difference between the program office and independent cost estimates,  which are both relevant criteria under the assessment methodology for the  gate. Notwithstanding these gaps in information that would have limited  informed program decision making, the program was approved to  proceed.", "Gate 2 review. At the time of this review, which was in April 2009, the  Probability of Program Success assessment methodology was in place.  However, it was not used to inform program decision making. Instead, the  review focused on the AOA, next steps, and the overall program timeline.  While briefing documentation shows that cost estimates for the  alternatives exceeded planned funding, the documentation did not  disclose the range of AOA and integrated master schedule weaknesses  discussed earlier in this report, and the risks associated with these  limitations. This is significant because the Gate 2 assessment criteria focus  on, among other things, whether the AOA cost estimates and master  program schedule are reliable and whether program execution is on  schedule. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the program was approved  to proceed.", "Gate 4 review. For this review, DON used its Probability of Program  Success methodology and assessed the health of the program against each  of the 17 metrics, including 3 that DON designated as potentially  critical\u2014parameter status, budget and planning, and acquisition  management. According to the program health assessment used at this  gate, 8 of the 17 metrics were rated as red, meaning that the program had  identified significant issues that would inhibit delivery of capability within  approved cost and schedule constraints and that mitigation strategies had  not been identified. Moreover, the 8 metrics rated as red included 3 that  were designated as critical, meaning that these issues needed to be  resolved before exiting the gate. Specifically, the parameter status metric  was rated as red because NGEN requirements that increment 1 is to meet  had not yet been defined; the budget and planning metric was rated as red  because the program was not fully funded; and the acquisition  management metric was rated as red because the USD (AT&L) had yet to  authorize the milestone at which the program would enter the Defense  Acquisition System. (See fig. 4 for the assessment results for all 17  metrics.) Moreover, the gate briefing document highlighted a number of  risks facing the program. For example, it faced the risk that key program  documentation, such as the System Engineering Plan and the Test and  Evaluation Master Plan, would not be completed until NGEN requirements  were defined. Further, it faced the risk that insufficient funding would  impact the program office\u2019s ability to acquire NMCI assets. Nevertheless,  the program was approved to proceed.", "Gate 5 review. For this review, which was conducted in October 2010,  DON again used its Probability of Program Success methodology and  assessed program performance and risk against all 18 metrics, including 9  that DON designated as potentially critical. Three metrics were rated as  red; 1, test and evaluation, was deemed critical. According to the  assessment, the test and evaluation metric was rated as red because the  Test and Evaluation Master Plan was not complete; the budget and  planning metric was rated as red because of significant NGEN funding  reductions; and the manning metric was rated as red because of  inadequate program office contracting, engineering and logistics  personnel. Further, according to the assessment, the Test and Evaluation  Master Plan was not complete because the requirements were not defined.  As discussed above, the program recognized, at Gate 4, the risk that a  delay in defining NGEN requirements would impact the completion of this  plan. (See fig. 5 for the assessment results for all 18 metrics.) According to  the gate briefing document, these red ratings introduced a number of risks,  such as the risk that the program would not be able to execute its current  acquisition approach and meet program milestones.", "In addition, even though the assessment rated the acquisition management  metric as green, this rating is not consistent with our findings in this report  about the NGEN integrated master schedule. Specifically, the rationale for  the green rating was that the August 2010 rebaselined schedule was  viewed as realistic and achievable by key stakeholders. However, as stated  earlier, program officials conceded that the schedule does not assign  resources, and the scheduling tool is unable to generate a valid critical  path, which are key scheduling practices; thus the August 2010 schedule  was not reliable. The approval of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy  (Research, Development and Acquisition) for NGEN to proceed beyond  Gate 5 was made conditional on the program satisfactorily completing  action items focused on releasing the request for proposals for the  Transport Services contract (scheduled for January 2011) and resolving its  funding shortfall.", "As shown above, DON has demonstrated a pattern of approving NGEN at  key acquisition review gates in the face of both limited disclosure of the  program\u2019s health and risks and known program risks and shortfalls in  performance. According to DON officials, the decisions to pass the gates  and proceed were based on their view that they had sufficiently mitigated  known risks and issues. By not fully ensuring that NGEN gate decisions  sufficiently reflected program challenges, DON has increased the  likelihood that the NGEN acquisition alternative that it is pursuing is not  the most cost-effective course of action, and that the program will cost  more and take longer to complete than planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the enormous size, complexity, and mission importance of NGEN, it  is vital that DON and DOD assure decision makers, including the  congressional defense committees, that the approach to acquiring needed  capabilities is the most cost-effective and that its execution is guided by a  well-defined schedule and informed milestone decision making. To date,  this has not occurred to the degree that it should. Most notably, while  DON produced substantially well-documented cost estimates, the NGEN  acquisition approach currently being followed is not grounded in a reliable  analysis of alternative approaches, and the selected approach was not  even assessed and is about $4.7 billion costlier and introduces more risk  than the alternatives that were assessed. Further, the program\u2019s execution  to date has not been based on the kind of reliably derived integrated  master schedule that is essential to program success. While the program  office is aware of some of the schedule weaknesses and intends to address  them, additional work is needed to ensure that the schedule can produce  credible dates for planned NGEN milestones and events. Exacerbating this  is an equally troubling pattern of missed milestones and delays in key  program documentation, as well as gate review decisions that have  allowed the program to proceed in the face of significant performance  shortfalls and risks.", "While NGEN is scheduled for an OSD-level milestone review in August  2011, the above schedule limitations make it likely that this review date  will slip. It is thus imperative, given the scope and nature of the program\u2019s  problems, that swift and immediate action be taken to ensure that the  most cost-effective acquisition approach is pursued and that a reliable  schedule and performance- and risk-based decision making are employed.

In addition, the review should consider existing  performance shortfalls and known risks, including those discussed in this  report.", "To facilitate implementation of the acquisition approach resulting from the  above review, we further recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Secretary of the Navy to take the following two actions:    ensure that the NGEN integrated master schedule substantially reflects the  key schedule estimating practices discussed in this report, and    ensure that future NGEN gate reviews and decisions fully reflect the state  of the program\u2019s performance and its exposure to risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, signed by the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3, Space and Spectrum), and reprinted in  appendix II, DOD stated that it concurred with one of our four  recommendations, did not concur with one recommendation, and partially  concurred with two.

Specifically, the department  stated that it intended to leverage the next OSD-chaired NGEN  Overarching Integrated Product Team meeting in February 2011 for the  review and that following this meeting, the USD(AT&L) will conduct a  Milestone Decision Authority review of the current NGEN approach, along  with risks. According to the department, this approach balances the  review processes already in place, resource constraints, and the need for  an additional milestone review. Further, the department said it had  concluded that DON\u2019s AOA was sufficient and that the analysis had been  approved by CAPE. DOD added that it will complete an economic  analysis\u2014a post AOA-activity\u2014for the August 2011 Milestone C review,  which will include a follow-on independent cost estimate and an updated  determination of the most cost-effective solution.", "While these are important steps, DOD\u2019s planned actions do not appear to  fully address our recommendation. Specifically, the department did not  indicate any intent to reevaluate whether the current solution is indeed the  most advantageous approach, despite the weaknesses contained in the  AOA identified in this report and the fact that the current approach was  not included in its analysis. According to the September 2010 draft NGEN  economic analysis development plan, only the status quo and the current  approach are to be analyzed, not the other three alternatives that were  included in the AOA. Without a meaningful analysis of alternatives, DOD  will be unable to determine the most cost-effective solution in its two  upcoming key reviews.", "The department did not concur with our recommendation that it limit  further investment in NGEN until a decision has been made on how best to  proceed based on an interim review that considers all viable alternative  acquisition approaches and this decision has been reported to the  Secretary of Defense and to congressional defense committees. The  department stated that DON\u2019s NGEN acquisition strategy and program  management have been approved by the milestone decision authority, and  that adequate oversight is in place to ensure regulatory and statutory  compliance. Further, the department said that the limitation on NGEN  investments will impact future DON business operations and, ultimately,  Naval warfighting capabilities. The department added that it will make  adjustments to NGEN investments if it determines they are required;  however, it also said it must continue to execute the investments within  the time frame of the continuity of services contract.", "While oversight is in place for the NGEN program, it is not effective.  Specifically, as discussed in this report, DON\u2019s past reviews have resulted  in decisions that were not always performance- and risk-based. Given that  DON is continuing to proceed in the face of the problems we are reporting,  it is even more important that adequate oversight be provided by the  Secretary and congressional defense committees.", "Moreover, we maintain that limiting further investment in NGEN, thereby  delaying the Milestone C event and its associated activities, is the most  prudent action at this time. By not evaluating all viable acquisition  approaches before proceeding with further investment in NGEN, the  department cannot be assured that it is pursuing the most cost-effective  approach. Further, by selecting an approach that, as discussed in this  report, carries greater relative schedule and performance risks than other  alternatives and is being executed against an unreliable program schedule,  the department increases the risk that its approach will lead to future cost  overruns, requiring it to expend additional resources that could otherwise  be used to provide other warfighting capabilities. Furthermore, even if the  department proceeds along its current course, the issues we have  identified with the program\u2019s schedule, along with the delays already  experienced, raise concerns that it will be unable to complete the  transition as planned within the time frames of the current continuity of  services contract.", "The department partially concurred with our recommendation that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy to ensure that the  NGEN integrated master schedule substantially reflects the key schedule  estimating practices discussed in this report. DOD stated that the  integrated master schedule was developed in accordance with industry  best practices. However, as discussed in this report, none of the  subschedules that we analyzed reflected all the practices that our work  has identified as necessary to develop and maintain a reliable schedule.
