However, projected fee reductions for 2006-2012 have raised new concerns about the SGR system. Policymakers are considering whether to eliminate spending targets or modify them. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) required that GAO study SGR and potential alternatives to the system.

If growth in the number of services provided to each beneficiary--referred to as volume--and in the average complexity and costliness of services--referred to as intensity--is high enough to cause spending to exceed the SGR target, fee updates are set lower than inflation in the cost of operating a medical practice. A wide enough gap between spending and the target results in fee reductions. Physician groups are dissatisfied with SGR as a system to update physician fees. For example, they question the fairness of including rapidly growing spending for physician-administered drugs in the SGR system's definition of physician services expenditures. The groups also contend that the allowance for growth in volume and intensity is too low and lacks the flexibility to allow for factors outside physicians' control. Fee updates under the SGR system have varied widely within an allowed range largely because of annual fluctuations in the growth of the volume and intensity of services that physicians provide to beneficiaries. Certain system design features, such as the use of cumulative spending targets and the need to estimate data, also reduce the stability and predictability of updates. However, MMA's revision of the allowance for growth in volume and intensity of services from an annual change to a 10-year moving average will help to make future updates more stable and predictable. Possible alternatives to the SGR system cluster around the two broad approaches under consideration: (1) end the use of spending targets and separate fee updates from explicit efforts to moderate spending growth or (2) retain spending targets but modify the current SGR system to address perceived shortcomings. CMS projects that either of the two approaches will result in higher aggregate spending, thereby increasing the difficulty of addressing Medicare's long-run financial challenges. The first approach emphasizes stable fee updates, while the second approach automatically adjusts fee updates if spending growth deviates from a predetermined target. While seeking to pay physicians appropriately, it is important to consider how modifications or alterations to the SGR system would affect the long-term sustainability and affordability of the Medicare program. In this context, the choice between the two approaches may hinge on whether primary consideration should be given to stable fee increases or to the need for fiscal discipline within the Medicare program. CMS agreed with the concluding observations in the draft report. Groups representing physicians commented that overall, the draft report offered a good analysis of problems with the SGR system, but did not fully reflect their concerns. We modified the draft as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Physicians and others raised concerns about the current system Medicare  uses to determine annual changes to physician fees when those fees were  reduced by 5.4 percent in 2002.

Subsequent administrative and legislative actions modified or  overrode the SGR system, resulting in fee increases for 2003, 2004, and  2005. Absent additional action, however, fees are expected to fall by  approximately 5 percent each year beginning in 2006 and continuing  through 2012 as the SGR system attempts to offset previous excess  spending and align actual spending with the system\u2019s spending targets.  According to physician groups, such a decline in fees would likely  discourage many physicians from treating Medicare beneficiaries. As a  result of these concerns, policymakers are interested in considering the  appropriateness of current spending targets and the SGR system as a  method for determining physician fee updates. Essentially, they are  considering whether to eliminate spending targets or retain them, while  making modifications to the system.", "Although the current focus of concern is largely on the potential for  declining physician fees, the historic challenge for Medicare has been to  find ways to moderate the rapid growth in spending for physician services  under the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI)\u2014or Part B\u2014 program. In the 1980s, attempts to moderate spending by limiting  physician fees without addressing aggregate expenditures for physician  services were unsuccessful because increases in the number of services  physicians provided per beneficiary\u2014known as volume\u2014and the average  complexity and costliness of those services\u2014known as intensity\u2014 continued to drive up spending. As a result, in the Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1989, the Congress required the establishment of a  national Medicare physician fee schedule and a system for annually  updating fees that included spending targets. The fee schedule and  spending targets first affected physician fees in 1992. The SGR system,  Medicare\u2019s current system for updating physician fees, was established in  the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and was implemented in 1998.  Both the SGR and its predecessor system provided for cumulative fee  updates that generally exceeded cumulative increases in physicians\u2019 cost  of providing services. Since the establishment of the national fee schedule  and spending targets, the growth in spending for Medicare physician  services has slowed substantially. Nonetheless, recent increases in  physician expenditures due to volume and intensity growth are a reminder  that the historic challenge of moderating spending growth has not  disappeared.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) required us to study certain adjustments to physician fees,  including the SGR system and alternatives to the system. As discussed  with the committees of jurisdiction, this report examines (1) how the SGR  system is designed to control spending for physician services, (2) what  concerns have been raised about the SGR system and its components,   (3) what affects the stability and predictability of physician fee updates  under the SGR system, and (4) what alternatives to the current SGR  system exist.", "In addressing these objectives, we analyzed Medicare expenditure data  from the Medicare Trustees\u2019 1998 and 2004 annual reports. We also  reviewed laws and regulations pertaining to the SGR system and its  predecessor spending target system and interviewed officials at the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible  for administering Medicare; the Congressional Budget Office (CBO); the  Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC); and organizations  representing physicians, including the American Medical Association, the  Medical Group Management Association, the Alliance for Specialty  Medicine, and the American College of Physicians. On the basis of these  document reviews and interviews, we identified potential alternatives to  the SGR system. We requested illustrative simulations of fee updates and  total spending under these alternatives from the CMS Office of the Actuary  (OACT). Total spending includes expenditures from all sources\u2014that is,  government outlays and beneficiary spending, including monthly Part B  premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance payments. Because the  simulation estimates produced by CMS OACT include total spending from  all sources, the estimated spending changes will differ from CBO\u2019s cost  estimates for the same alternatives. CBO, which is responsible for  estimating how legislated changes would affect federal spending, does not  include beneficiary spending when it estimates the cost of SGR  alternatives. CMS OACT and CBO estimates may also differ as the result of  differences in the underlying assumptions used by the two agencies. Our  analyses apply only to spending affected by the SGR system\u2014that is,  physician spending in the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) program. We  assessed the reliability of the Medicare expenditure data and data used for  the simulations under alternatives to the SGR system by interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data and who are responsible for  producing the projections for the SGR system. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our study.

Consequently, policymakers have deemed it both  reasonable and desirable to question the appropriateness of current and  projected physician services spending and to explicitly consider the  affordability of such spending when setting physician fees.

Figure 1 shows growth in  Medicare spending per beneficiary for physician services during the three  periods. In the first period, 1980 through 1991, Medicare\u2019s payment rates  for physician services were based on historical charges for these services,  and limits were placed on fees and fee updates but not on aggregate  spending. In the 1992 through 1997 period, physician services were paid  under a national fee schedule, and the first spending target system\u2014called  the Medicare volume performance standard (MVPS)\u2014set an allowable  growth rate for aggregate spending that was used to adjust physician fees.  From 1998 on, services continue to be paid under a fee schedule and the  SGR system replaced the MVPS system and uses a different method to set  an acceptable growth rate for aggregate spending.", "In the 1980s, Medicare paid physicians on the basis of \u201creasonable charge,\u201d  defined as the lowest of the physician\u2019s actual charge, the customary  charge (the amount the physician usually charged for the service), or the  prevailing charge (based on comparable physicians\u2019 customary charges).  Under this system, payment inconsistencies existed among physicians by  services, specialties, and locations. The system also had an inflationary  bias, as a rise in customary charges could increase prevailing charges over  time. During this decade, expenditures for physician services grew  rapidly: from 1980 through 1991, Medicare spending per beneficiary for  physician services grew at an average annual rate of 11.6 percent.  Although the Congress froze fees or limited fee increases in the 1980s,  spending continued to rise because there were no limits on growth in the  volume and intensity of services physicians provided to beneficiaries.", "Recognizing that the expenditure growth of the 1980s was not sustainable,  the Congress reformed the way Medicare paid for physician services in the  traditional FFS program by requiring the establishment of a national fee  schedule for physician services and a system for controlling aggregate  physician service spending, MVPS. The establishment of a fee schedule in  1992 was an attempt to break the link between physicians\u2019 charges and  Medicare payments. The fee schedule was designed to pay for services  based on the relative resources used by physicians to provide different  types of care and to address the inflationary bias of the charge-based  system. The adoption of a spending target system was an attempt to  control spending growth attributable to increases in the volume and  intensity of physician services.", "Under MVPS, a performance standard for a given year was set, indicating a  growth rate for expenditures that should not be exceeded. The extent to  which actual expenditure growth fell above or below the performance  standard helped to determine the update to physician fees 2 years later.  For example, in 1993, CMS compared actual spending in 1992 with the  performance standard for 1992; the difference largely determined the  update to physician fees in 1994. The performance standard was based on  changes in four factors: the number of FFS Medicare beneficiaries,  practice cost inflation, the historical growth in volume and intensity, and  laws and regulations that could affect spending for physician services.", "From 1992 through 1997\u2014the period that MVPS was used to set fee  updates\u2014annual spending growth for physician services was far lower  than in the preceding decade. The decline in spending growth during this  period was the result, in large part, of slower volume and intensity growth.  For example, from 1985 through 1991, spending per beneficiary grew at an  average annual rate of 10.8 percent; during that period, volume and  intensity of service use per beneficiary rose an average 7 percent annually.  From 1992 through 1997, the growth in spending per beneficiary fell to 4.4  percent; during that period, average annual growth in volume and intensity  of service use per beneficiary fell to 1 percent.

However, from 2000 through 2003, volume and intensity  growth rose at an average annual rate of about 5 percent. Over the 1998\u2013 2003 SGR system period, the average growth in volume and intensity of  services per Medicare beneficiary was higher than the average for the  1992\u20131997 MVPS period\u2014but substantially below that experienced before  spending targets were introduced.

Conversely, if volume and intensity grows more slowly, the SGR system  permits physicians to benefit from fee increases that exceed the increased  cost of providing services. To reduce the effect of yearly business cycles  on physician fees, MMA required that economic growth be measured as  the 10-year moving average change in real GDP per capita for each year  beginning in 2003.

Because SGR-covered  Part B drug expenditures have grown more rapidly than other physician  service expenditures, drug expenditures as a proportion of allowable  spending under the targets have grown from 8.7 percent in 2002 to an  estimated 12.3 percent in 2004. Such rapid growth in drug expenditures  increases the likelihood that actual spending will exceed SGR system  targets.

If reality proves  different from these estimates, then the estimates are revised to  incorporate more complete data, thereby contributing to the year to year  fluctuation in fee updates.

If actual  spending is underestimated, the 2005 update will be set higher than it  would have been set without the estimation error. This underestimate will  be corrected, because in setting a fee update, the SGR system requires  CMS to revise the spending estimates and the sustainable growth rates for  the 2 preceding years.

In a year in which fees are reduced, physicians  in regions that could be characterized as low spending would receive the  same fee reduction as physicians in higher-spending regions. We agree that  the SGR system does not distinguish between physicians whose  discretionary practice patterns result in higher Medicare spending and  those physicians whose practice patterns do not.

For example, AMA contended that Medicare\u2019s new  preventive benefits and government-sponsored health campaigns create a  government-induced demand among beneficiaries for services that, in  turn, could increase volume and intensity of service use. To date, studies  have not been conducted on whether new benefits and federal health  campaigns have directly affected Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 use of physician  services. Our report notes, however, that the SGR system\u2019s allowance for  volume and intensity growth, unlike that of the MVPS system, is inflexible  and would not take such factors into account. ACP noted that increased  spending on physician services may be appropriate, as it may result in  other program savings, such as reduced spending for hospital care.  Whether such savings have been or can be achieved would require  research outside this study\u2019s scope.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services and interested congressional committees.

(See fig. 26.) The PAF  takes into account the difference between actual and target expenditures.  If spending has equaled the targets, the PAF is equal to 1 and the update  will equal the percentage change in MEI. If spending has been below the  targets, the PAF is greater than 1, thus increasing the update. If spending  has been above the targets, the PAF is less than 1, thus reducing the  update. The PAF is a blend of the relative difference between target and  actual spending in the current year, accounting for 75 percent, and the  relative cumulative difference in expenditures from April 1996 through the  current year, accounting for 33 percent. The weights were developed by  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) Office of the Actuary  (OACT) and included in statute to minimize the volatility of both fee  updates and the time required to align actual spending with the targets.  Applying these weights causes the difference between cumulative actual  expenditures and cumulative target expenditures to be adjusted over  several years rather than during a single year. As a result, the fee update is  less volatile than would be the case if the full adjustment were made in   1 year. The PAF is subject to statutory limits and may not cause the fee  update to be set at more than 3 percent above MEI or 7 percent below  MEI. These limits may further increase the time necessary to align  spending with targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Corrections to Prior Estimates Caused the SGR System\u2019s Cumulative Targets to Produce Negative Updates", "paragraphs": ["Since the introduction of the fee schedule in 1992 through 2001, physicians  generally experienced real increases in their fee updates\u2014that is, fee  updates increased more than the increase in the cost of providing  physician services, as measured by MEI. Specifically, during that period,  fee updates increased by 39.7 percent, whereas MEI increased by   25.9 percent. In 2002, however, the sustainable growth rate (SGR) system  reduced fees by 4.8 percent, despite an estimated 2.6 percent increase in  the costs of providing physician services. (See fig. 27.)", "In 2002, corrections to prior estimation errors caused the SGR system\u2019s  cumulative targets to begin producing negative updates. The SGR system  reduced fees in 2002 because estimated spending for physician services\u2014 cumulative since 1996\u2014exceeded the target by about $8.9 billion, or   13 percent of projected 2002 spending. In part, the fee reduction occurred  because CMS revised upward its estimates of previous years\u2019 actual  spending. Specifically, CMS found that its previous estimates had omitted  a portion of actual spending for 1998, 1999, and 2000. In addition, in 2002  CMS lowered the 2 previous years\u2019 spending targets based on revised gross  domestic product (GDP) data from the Department of Commerce. Based  on the new higher spending estimates and lower targets, CMS determined  that fees had been too high in 2000 and 2001. In setting the 2002 physician  fees, the SGR system reduced fees to recoup previous excess spending.  The update would have been about negative 9 percent if the SGR system  had not limited its decrease to 7 percent below MEI. Because the previous  overpayments were not fully recouped in 2002, and because of volume and  intensity increases, by 2003, physicians were facing several more years of  fee reductions to bring cumulative Medicare spending on physician  services in line with cumulative targets.", "Despite its recognition of errors, CMS had determined that its authority to  revise previous spending targets was limited. In 2002, CMS noted that the  1998 and 1999 spending targets had been based on estimated growth rates  for beneficiary FFS enrollment and real GDP per capita; actual experience  had shown these growth rates to be too low. If the estimates could have  been revised, the targets for those and subsequent years would have been  increased. However, at the time that CMS acknowledged these errors, the  agency concluded that it was not allowed to revise these estimates.  Without such revisions, the cumulative spending targets remained lower  than if errors had not been made.", "In late 2002, the estimate of the sustainable growth rate called for a  negative 4.4 percent fee update in 2003. With the passage of the  Consolidated Appropriations Resolution of 2003, CMS determined that it  was authorized to correct the 1998 and 1999 spending targets. Because  SGR system targets are cumulative measures, these corrections resulted in  an average 1.4 percent increase in physician fees for services for 2003.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) averted additional fee reductions projected for 2004 and 2005  by specifying an update to physician fees of no less than 1.5 percent for  those 2 years. The MMA increases replaced SGR system fee reductions of  4.5 percent in 2004 and an estimated 3.6 percent in 2005. The fee increases  will result in additional aggregate spending. Because MMA did not make  corresponding revisions to the SGR system\u2019s spending targets, its fee  increases will require the SGR system to offset the additional spending by  reducing fees beginning in 2006. In addition, recent growth in spending  due to volume and intensity, which has been larger than SGR system  targets allow, will further compound the excess spending that needs to be  recouped."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office, the audit, evaluation and  investigative arm of Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its  constitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performance and  accountability of the federal government for the American people.
