Although state and local funds account for more than 90 percent of national education expenditures, Title I has been an important source of funding for many poor school districts and schools since 1965. In the 1999-2000 school year, Title I funds were targeted on the basis of numbers and percentages of poor children, but the complex allocation process resulted in differences in actual funding per poor child. When the numbers of children from low-income families shift among states, Title I allocations adjust, but not completely, and a state whose share of the nation's poor children changed from year to year would not necessarily see a corresponding change in its Title I allocation amount. The following two factors account for this: lack of current poverty data and various hold-harmless provisions. GAO found no monetary, statutory, or regulatory incentives for states to target their own funds to children from low-income families. Several policy options could increase Title I funds allocated to states and school districts with high numbers and percentages of poor children. These options include changing the appropriations hold-harmless provisions, funding the targeted grant, using an alternative cost factor, and raising the basic grant eligibility threshold."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Title I is the largest federal program supporting elementary and secondary  education and with annual expenditures of about $8 billion, accounts for  about 3 percent of total education expenditures nationally. While state  and local funds account for over 90 percent of national education  expenditures, Title I is an important source of funding for many high- poverty districts and schools. Created in 1965 as part of the War on  Poverty, Title I is designed to help educate disadvantaged children\u2014those  with low academic achievement attending schools serving high-poverty  areas.", "The amount of funds schools receive is the result of a multistep process  that combines formula calculations and state and district decisions. States  receive funding for their districts from the U.S. Department of Education  (Education), which calculates how much states\u2019 school districts are  entitled to based on their numbers of children from low-income families  (poor children) as measured by Census Bureau data and their state\u2019s per- pupil education expenditures (a proxy intended to reflect cost differences  among states in providing education). When states receive Title I funds,  they make adjustments to the calculated district-level amounts in order to  set aside funds for state administration and account for differences  between their actual school districts, including charter schools, and the  districts appearing in Education\u2019s database. Once districts receive funds  from their states, they have some flexibility in how they allocate funds to  individual schools, but generally must target schools with higher  percentages of poor children. Not all school districts receive Title I funds  because they might not have a minimum number and/or percentage of  poor children to meet eligibility thresholds.", "In the past several years, the Congress has been concerned about the  achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more  advantaged peers and how to improve the performance of children from  low-income families. Some studies have indicated that schools with higher  numbers and percentages of poor children may have higher costs  associated with raising student performance. The Congress has had a  dilemma of wanting to improve the performance of poor children through  increased targeting of poor children while simultaneously protecting  districts whose share of these children has declined from losing a  significant amount of funds. To increase targeting, in 1994 the Congress  added a new formula to the Title I program, which would have provided  more funds to districts with higher numbers and percentages of children  from low-income families, but until fiscal year 2003, no funds were  appropriated for this formula. To protect districts from a significant loss of  funds when their numbers of poor children decline, the Congress has  implemented several \u201chold-harmless\u201d provisions. The issues of targeting  and hold-harmless provisions were much debated in Congress\u2019 recent  efforts to reauthorize the Title I program.", "In light of these issues, the Congress mandated GAO to study Title I  allocations, specifically (1) the extent to which Title I funds are allocated  to states, school districts, and schools with the greatest numbers and  percentages of school-age poor children; (2) the extent to which  allocations of such funds adjust to shifts in the numbers of poor children;  (3) the extent to which the allocation of Title I funds encourages the  targeting of state funds to school-age poor children; and (4) what options  might improve targeting of funds, especially to states and school districts  with higher numbers and percentages of poor children, to more effectively  serve those children.", "In doing our work, we performed extensive analysis of data collected from  a number of federal, state, and local sources. We obtained data on Title I  formula allocations for school years 1999-2000, 2000-01, and 2001-02 from  Education and obtained the actual allocations received by school districts  in the 1999-2000 school year from state officials. We interviewed every  state Title I director, surveyed a nationally representative sample of school  district administrators, and interviewed representatives of relevant federal  agencies and national organizations. We conducted our work from  December 2000 through December 2001 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

The law does not stipulate  exactly how Title I funds are to be spent. Instead, Title I is an example of  flexible funding that local and state educational agencies may use as they  deem best.", "Title I funds are directed toward states and school districts with greater  numbers and percentages of poor children regardless of the level of  funding they receive from state and local sources. Although the amounts  that states and localities spend on education vary due to differing resource  bases and funding priorities, Title I funds are not intended to compensate  for this variation.", "Federal Allocation Process\n The U.S. Department of Education each year determines the distribution  of Title I funds according to the mandates of the law. The authorizing  legislation in effect through the 2001-02 school year provided for four  different kinds of Title I grants:  Basic Grants are the primary vehicle for Title I funding and are the easiest  grants for which school districts can qualify. Districts are eligible for basic  grants if they have at least 10 poor children and the number of poor  children is more than 2 percent of the district\u2019s school-age children.Nationally, about 92 percent of school districts (containing over 99 percent  of poor children) receive basic grants, which accounted for about 85  percent of the Title I funds distributed in fiscal year 1999.", "Concentration Grants are somewhat more directed to poor districts than  basic grants because district eligibility criteria for concentration grants are  stricter than those for basic grants. Districts are eligible for concentration  grants if they have more than 6,500 poor children or the number of poor  children is more than 15 percent of the district\u2019s school-age children.  Nationally, about 60 percent of school districts (containing about 85  percent of poor children) receive concentration grants, which accounted  for about 15 percent of the Title I funds distributed in fiscal year 1999.", "Targeted Grants were not funded until fiscal year 2003. Targeted grants  would be directed more to high-poverty states and districts; as the number  and percentage of poor children in the district increase, the targeted grant  amount would increase both in absolute dollars and proportionally to  other districts. A district would be eligible for targeted grants if it had at  least 10 poor children and these children accounted for at least 5 percent  of its school-age children. In the 2001-02 school year, about 86 percent of  school districts, containing 99 percent of poor children would have been  eligible to receive targeted grants had they been funded.", "Incentive Grants were not funded until fiscal year 2003. Incentive grants  would not be distributed on the basis of poverty, but would provide  additional funds to states that demonstrate high state spending relative to  their tax base and states that have less disparity in funding among their  districts.  Under this formula, states would distribute funds to districts in  proportion to the remainder of their Title I allocations.", "Title I funds are distributed from the federal government to the states,  based on data that are measured at the school district and state levels.  Since school year 1999-2000, for each school district meeting eligibility  requirements based on numbers and/or percentages of poor children,  Education has based its formula calculations on the number of poor  children in the district.  (Prior to that time, formula calculations were  based on counties rather than school districts. The change occurred, in  part, due to concern that poor school districts in otherwise wealthy  counties were not receiving the Title I funds they needed.) The funding  formula for basic and concentration grants principally involves multiplying  the number of poor children in a school district area, as measured by  Census and other data sources, by the state\u2019s average per-pupil  expenditure, although these amounts are subject to hold-harmless  provisions and a \u201csmall state minimum\u201d provision. These key elements of  the funding formula for basic and concentration grants are described  below:", "Poverty: the number of poor children in the school district area, as  estimated by decennial Census data and updated by the Census using  statistical modeling techniques. (The poverty threshold for the 2000-01  school year for a family of four was an annual income of $17,050.)", "Expenditures: forty percent of the state\u2019s average per-pupil expenditure,  limited to a minimum of 80 percent and a maximum of 120 percent of the  national average expenditure. This measure is included as a proxy for  education costs.", "Small state minimum: Each state is guaranteed a minimum level of  funding, which is the smaller of either one-quarter of 1 percent of the  overall appropriation, or the average of one-quarter of 1 percent of the  overall appropriation and the state\u2019s number of eligible students multiplied  by 150 percent of the national average per-pupil payment.", "Hold-harmless provisions: guarantee each state and district a minimum  level of funding based on past allocations. That is, the allotment cannot be  less than a specified percentage of the preceding year\u2019s allotment. Such  provisions are intended to moderate the effects of any large year-to-year  shifts in program funding, numbers of eligible children, or state education  spending. The hold-harmless provisions protect states with declining  numbers of poor children from reductions in their allocations, but in the  absence of increased overall funding, this leaves fewer funds available for  states and districts with growing numbers of poor children. Specific hold- harmless rules have changed over time. In the authorizing statute, the  hold-harmless level for the basic and targeted grants is set at 85, 90, or 95  percent of the prior year\u2019s allocation, depending on the percentage of  children in the district who are eligible under the formula (formula  children). (The concentration grant does not have a hold-harmless  provision in the authorizing statute.) However, for the 1998-99, 1999-2000,  and 2000-01 school years, provisions in the appropriations legislation set  the hold-harmless level at 100 percent of the past year\u2019s allocation. This  100-percent rule was modified for school year 2001-02. Under this new  rule, rather than being guaranteed 100 percent of their prior year\u2019s funding  amount, districts were guaranteed the larger of either their previous year\u2019s  allotment or the amount they would have received had the authorizing  statute\u2019s hold-harmless rules been in effect.", "The Title I program was reauthorized in January 2002, with some  significant changes.

Districts then  generally allocate the remaining Title I dollars to the schools. In  distributing these dollars, districts are subject to several key restrictions.  For example, a district must serve eligible schools or attendance areas in  rank order according to their poverty percentage. A district must serve  those areas or schools above 75 percent poverty, including any middle or  high schools, before it serves any with a poverty percentage below 75  percent. Once all of the schools and areas with a percentage above 75  percent have been served, the district may serve lower-poverty areas and  schools either by continuing with the districtwide ranking or by ranking its  schools below 75 percent poverty according to grade-span groupings (i.e.,  K-6, 7-9, 10-12).

The new law  maintains these provisions and adds several more that give  proportionately more funds to states and districts with higher numbers  and percentages of poor children, as follows:", "Allocations will be based on each state\u2019s number of poor children, rather  than its total school-age population.", "Districts are required to have at least 10 poor children, making up at least  5 percent of enrollment to qualify for finance incentive funds, whereas  there had been no such enrollment requirement in prior law.", "Allocations will be made to school districts on the basis of a tiered  weighting system, like that in the targeted grant formula.  The incentive  grant weighting system provides proportionally more funds not only to  districts with greater numbers and percentages of poor children but also  to districts in states with less funding disparity among districts.", "Districts are newly required to allocate finance incentive funds to schools  in the same way that they allocate the other Title I funds (e.g., in rank  order of poverty) and to use finance incentive funds only for Title I  purposes.", "In addition, the new formula includes a per-pupil expenditure factor, like  that for the other grants, but more narrowly limited to a minimum of 34  percent and a maximum of 46 percent of the national average per pupil  expenditure, rather than the 32 percent minimum and 48 percent  maximum in the other grant formulas.", "Increased Overall Funding for Fiscal Year 2002:  The education  appropriations legislation includes a combined increase of nearly $1.8  billion in funding for Title I basic, concentration, targeted, and finance  incentive grants.  (See table 21.)", "Hold-Harmless: The prior authorizing legislation included a hold- harmless provision only for basic grants (districts were guaranteed 85, 90,  or 95 percent of the previous year\u2019s funding, depending on percentage of  poor children in the district).  However, as described in the body of the  report, appropriations language in recent years created more restrictive  hold-harmless provisions, including (1) a 100-percent hold-harmless  provision for basic grants and (2) a hold-harmless provision for  concentration grants that allowed even districts no longer meeting the  concentration grant eligibility criteria to continue receiving concentration  grants.  In contrast, the fiscal year 2002 appropriations language does not  include any provisions that override the authorized hold-harmless  provisions.  However, under the new authorizing legislation, hold-harmless  provisions will apply not only to basic grants but also to concentration  grants and targeted grants.  In addition, under the new authorizing  legislation, districts that become ineligible for concentration grants will  continue to receive concentration grant allocations for up to 4 consecutive  years.", "As a result of these changes, operative hold-harmless provisions for basic  grants are somewhat less restrictive than under prior law and, therefore,  will allow basic grant allocations to be more reflective of the number of  poor children in a school district.  Likewise, the newly authorized hold- harmless provisions for concentration grants are somewhat less restrictive  than the hold-harmless provisions previously included in appropriations  law.  In the end, allocations under these grants will be more reflective of  numbers of poor children than in the past, but not as reflective of them as  would have been the case under the prior authorizing legislation alone.", "Small State Minimum: The minimum level of funding guaranteed to each  state is increased over prior law.  Previously, each state was guaranteed  the smaller of 0.25 percent of total appropriations for that year, or the  average of that amount and the state\u2019s number of eligible students  multiplied by 150 percent of the national average per-pupil payment.  The  new law uses essentially the same calculation but instead of 0.25 percent  of the total appropriations, the new calculation will use 0.25 percent of the  amount appropriated in 2001, plus 0.35 percent of any subsequent  increases in appropriations over the 2001 level.", "States are required to reserve 2 percent of their Title I funds for school  improvement, increasing to 4 percent in fiscal year 2004.  Previously,  states were permitted, but not required, to reserve up to 0.5 percent of  their funds for school improvement.  States must pass at least 95 percent  of these funds directly to school districts.", "Districts must continue to reserve at least 1 percent of their Title I  allocations for parental involvement activities, as was required under prior  law, but the new law also requires that they pass 95 percent of these  reserved funds to Title I schools.", "Districts may use Title I funds for schoolwide programs, rather than  targeting funds to specific students, in schools where at least 40 percent of  the children in the school or school attendance area are from low-income  families.  Previously, schoolwide programs were allowed only in schools  in which at least 50 percent of the children in the school or school  attendance area were from low-income families."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following people made significant  contributions to this report:  Natalie Britton, Karen Brown, Patrick  DiBattista, Robert Dinkelmeyer, Jerry Fastrup, Sarah Glavin, Sonya  Harmeyer, Peter Minarik, and Michael Williams.
