For many years, the Congress has acknowledged the special role HBCUs have played in helping promote equal opportunity through postsecondary education.", "Compared with students at other schools, students at HBCUs generally rely to a greater degree on federal student loans. Students attending these schools received about $910 million in federal student loans in fiscal year 1996. Also, the average federal student loan default rate for HBCUs has generally been higher (currently, more than double) the average rate for other 2-year and 4-year schools. In general, institutions are prohibited from participating in federal student loan programs if their default rates exceed statutory thresholds, currently 25 percent, over 3 consecutive fiscal years, but the Congress has exempted HBCUs from this restriction. In recent years, this exemption has kept several dozen HBCUs from being dropped from the student loan program. However, the current exemption, which is part of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, expires in July 1998. Reauthorization of the act is slated for consideration during the second session of the 105th Congress.", "Over the past decade, a growing body of research has established that various measures of students\u2019 academic preparation and socioeconomic status predict how likely students are to default on their loans. In general, default rates tend to be higher among students who are not as well prepared academically as others and whose families are not as well off economically. You asked us to address several issues regarding default rates at HBCUs, including an analysis of these kinds of links. As agreed with your offices, we focused our work on the following questions:", "How do freshman students at HBCUs compare with those at all colleges and universities in terms of the academic and socioeconomic characteristics that have been linked to student loan defaults?", "Among 4-year HBCUs, how do such characteristics for undergraduate students differ at schools with higher default rates compared with schools with lower default rates?", "What measures has the Department of Education taken or planned to help HBCUs reduce their student loan default rates?", "How many HBCUs are potentially at risk of losing title IV student loan eligibility because of high default rates in 1993-95, and how many of these were potentially at risk in 1988-90?", "What measures have HBCUs taken to reduce or minimize their student loan default rates?", "To conduct our review, we analyzed available student databases with data on various characteristics that previous studies had shown to be related to the level of student loan defaults. Much of the data we analyzed were from the Department of Education, but some were developed from surveys by other researchers. Because the databases did not all contain the same information, we were not always able to apply the exact same set of characteristics. For example, one database might contain the high school grade point averages of entering freshmen as an indication of academic preparation, while another might have freshman retention rates or college graduation rates. Appendix I describes the studies we examined, including our scope and methodology, and appendix II lists the specific academic preparation and socioeconomic indicators we identified. In performing our analyses, we also interviewed representatives from the Department, HBCUs, and other organizations.

Collectively, HBCUs enroll about 16 percent of all black students attending all 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities in the United States.", "Title IV authorized the Department of Education to bar postsecondary schools with high fiscal year \u201ccohort default rates\u201d from continuing to participate in federal student loan programs. Each year, the Department assesses a school\u2019s eligibility on the basis of its three most recent available cohort default rates. In fiscal year 1998, eligibility is based on default rates for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995. A school remains eligible if its cohort default rate is below the statutory threshold, currently 25 percent, in at least 1 of the latest 3 consecutive fiscal years. A school becomes ineligible if its default rate equals or exceeds the default threshold in all 3 fiscal years. The Higher Education Act exempts HBCUs from this threshold requirement through June 1998.", "In addition to the cohort default rate threshold specified in the Higher Education Act, the Department has established\u2014through regulation\u2014a provision that allows it to start procedures to limit, suspend, or terminate a school\u2019s participation in all title IV federal student aid programs if the school\u2019s cohort default rate for a single year exceeds 40 percent. The exemption from the statutory threshold for HBCUs does not extend to this provision.", "Students get federal loans from two major programs: the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (FDLP). Loans made under FFELP are provided by private lenders and are ultimately guaranteed against default by the federal government.", "Loans made under FDLP are provided through schools, and the Department services and collects loans through contractors. FDLP was originally authorized by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. Since the first loans under FDLP were made in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994, the fiscal year 1995 cohort is the first cohort affected by FDLP defaults.", "Students at HBCUs make extensive use of these loan programs. Although HBCU students accounted for 1.9 percent of fall 1995 enrollments at all 2-year and 4-year public and private schools, they were awarded 3.5 percent of the total dollar volume of student loans under FFELP and FDLP in fiscal year 1996 (see table 1).", "On average, HBCUs have a higher student loan default rate than non-HBCUs, but the difference has narrowed somewhat. Between fiscal years 1993 and 1995, the aggregate student loan cohort default rate for HBCUs declined from 20.6 percent to 18.5 percent while the rate for non-HBCUs increased from 7.4 percent to 7.8 percent (see fig. 1).", "Before 1987, little research had been published that identified the factors that could predict high student loan default rates. However, in the past 10 years several empirical research studies have analyzed student borrowers from proprietary (private, for profit) schools as well as from public and private 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities. A key theme derived from these studies is that student loan repayment and default behavior are primarily influenced by individual borrower characteristics rather than by the characteristics of the educational institutions they attend. For example, one study concluded that \u201cstudent characteristics are of overwhelming importance in correctly predicting defaulters, in contrast to the institutions they attend, or the administrative practices those institutions use to try to curb student defaults.\u201d", "The studies indicate that characteristics playing an important role in determining the level of student default rates are related to students\u2019 academic preparation and socioeconomic background. In general, the higher the students\u2019 academic preparation and more advantaged the socioeconomic background, the lower the likelihood of defaulting on their student loans. Factors indicating good academic preparation, such as staying in college, earning good grades, and advancing to graduation, significantly decrease the probability of default. Two of the most important factors accounting for different college graduation rates among institutions are actually precollege factors: high school grades and college admissions test scores. The higher the grades and test scores, the greater the incidence of college graduation. Similarly, studies have shown that students who come from a more advantaged socioeconomic background\u2014indicated by higher parental education and income levels and two-parent families\u2014have better high school grades and lower student loan default rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Academic Preparation and Socioeconomic Levels of Freshman Students Vary by School Type", "paragraphs": ["Students attending 4-year HBCUs are less academically prepared and come from a more disadvantaged socioeconomic background than their counterparts attending all 4-year colleges and universities, according to our analysis of an annual survey of the fall 1996 freshman class.

In addition, the rate at which students starting at the same school graduated within a 6-year period was lower for HBCUs than for non-HBCUs. Relative to parents of freshmen at all 4-year colleges and universities, parents of 4-year HBCU freshmen were more likely to be divorced or separated, less likely to have a college education, and more likely to earn less than $20,000 a year.
