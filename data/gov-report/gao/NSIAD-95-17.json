The decision on the composition of the aircraft carrier force is essential for planning the defense budget, since new carrier procurement is a significant investment, and a long-term commitment to purchase and sustain associated air wing, escort, and support ships.", "In March 1993, the Secretary of Defense initiated the Bottom-Up Review (BUR)\u2014a review of the nation\u2019s defense strategy, force structure, modernization, infrastructure, and foundations\u2014because of the dramatic changes that resulted from the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As part of this review, the Department of Defense (DOD) evaluated key modernization programs, including the Navy\u2019s aircraft carrier program. The BUR concluded that a force of 10 carriers was adequate to meet war-fighting requirements, but 12 carriers (11 active and 1 reserve/training carrier) were needed for sufficient overseas presence. The BUR recommended that construction of CVN-76 begin in fiscal year 1995 to maintain the 12-carrier force structure, allow flexibility in the carrier force size, avoid cost increases associated with a delay in construction, and preserve the industrial base at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia.", "In fiscal year 1993, the Congress provided $832 million for long-lead procurement items (primarily nuclear components) for CVN-76. Congressional conferees on the Defense Appropriations Act for 1994 stated that $1.2 billion in the National Defense Sealift Fund may be made available for later transfer to the shipbuilding and conversion account for the carrier. In fiscal year 1995, the Congress appropriated about  $2.3 billion to cover the remaining construction costs of CVN-76, and $38.3 million in advance procurement funds for the nuclear refueling complex overhaul of the U.S.S. Nimitz (CVN-68), scheduled to begin in fiscal year 1998. The total cost of CVN-76 construction is estimated at $4.3 billion (current dollars for fiscal years 1993-95) and the U.S.S.

It is completing construction work on two new nuclear carriers, the U.S.S. John C. Stennis (CVN-74) and the U.S.S. United States (CVN-75), and the nuclear refueling complex overhaul of the U.S.S. Enterprise (CVN-65). The shipyard is also one of two locations that can construct nuclear submarines. It is completing work on its last construction contract for SSN-688 class submarines and is the lead design agent for the SSN-21 Seawolf.", "According to the BUR, delaying construction of CVN-76 would threaten the viability of the Newport News Shipbuilding shipyard due to the lack of work once existing contracts are completed in the mid-1990s. However, the BUR stated that if CVN-76 construction were delayed beyond fiscal year 1995, the risk to Newport News Shipbuilding could be minimized by rescheduling ship overhauls, delaying delivery of carriers currently being built, and assigning other work to the shipyard. To maintain the BUR force structure and/or critical industrial capabilities, the Navy developed the Navy\u2019s Recapitalization Plan. This plan transfers resources from the Navy\u2019s infrastructure and savings from a smaller fleet to fund the Navy\u2019s protected major procurement accounts, including the carrier program.

However, in the long term the employment levels in the BUR and the Navy\u2019s Recapitalization Plan also fall below 10,000 employees. In addition, options that include building CVN-76 in fiscal year 1995 require building carriers sooner than they are needed for force structure purposes and therefore incur expenses sooner than necessary.

A conventional carrier force structure would require less budget authority funding and fewer outlays than any force structure that continues to require building nuclear aircraft carriers.

In deciding to build nuclear-powered surface combatants, the Navy believed that the greatest benefit would be achieved when all the combatant ships in the task force were nuclear powered. Nonetheless, the Navy procured the last nuclear-powered surface combatant in 1975 because this vessel was so expensive. More recently, relatively new and highly capable nuclear-powered surface combatants have been decommissioned because of the affordability problems facing the Navy.", "Affordability is an important, but not the only, criterion when comparing nuclear and conventional carriers. Important factors also include operational effectiveness, potential utilization, and other intangibles. Flexibility of operations, such as the ability to steam at high speeds for unlimited distances without refueling; increased capacity for aviation fuel; increased capacity for other consumables, such as munitions; and the higher speeds of the advanced nuclear carrier over conventional carriers are some of the factors that need to be considered when evaluating nuclear- and conventionally powered carriers. Other considerations include the availability and location of homeports and nuclear-capable shipyards for maintenance and repairs and other supporting infrastructure, such as for training; the effect of out-of-homeport maintenance on the amount of time personnel are away from their homeport; and the disposal of nuclear materials and radioactively contaminated materials.

After fiscal year 2027, the employment level ranges between 11,900 and 16,500. (See fig. 2.14.)", "Since this option requires building CVN-76 in fiscal year 1995, the near term outlays are similar to those in the BUR baseline option. However, in the mid-term (fiscal years 1995-2015) and long term (fiscal  years 1995-2035), the outlays are approximately 25 percent less than those in the BUR option.

This option creates fewer drastic shifts in the overall employment level than the BUR option because it has a new carrier construction start rate of every 4 to 5 years compared with the BUR rate of 3 to 7 years. Two conventional carriers, the  U.S.S. Kitty Hawk (CV-63) and the U.S.S. Constellation (CV-64), are retained in the active fleet for several years longer than projected in the BUR option and are inactivated closer to or at the end of their projected useful lives.

Increased stability in shipyard employment requires fewer adjustments to the workforce over time. Compared to the BUR option, this option\u2019s employment troughs are significantly smaller in fiscal years 2004, 2018, and 2025-26. The Navy could mitigate the employment decline in fiscal year 1998 by redirecting other shipbuilding and maintenance work to the yard, or, as the BUR suggested, by rescheduling the delivery of carriers under contract, overhauls, and other work.", "DOD\u2019s financial investment requirement for this option is less than in the BUR option for the near term (fiscal years 1995-99), mid-term (fiscal  years 1995-2015), and long term (fiscal years 1995-2035).

DOD considered delaying the construction of CVN-76 until fiscal year 2000.

United States (CVN-75) and the nuclear refueling complex overhaul of the U.S.S. Nimitz (CVN-68), which begins in fiscal year 1998.

The reduction in outlays is a result of delaying the construction start of the next aircraft carrier until fiscal year 2002, building conventional carriers that have a much lower procurement cost, and retaining carriers longer in the active fleet. The near-term outlays (fiscal years 1995-99) are approximately 35 percent of the BUR option\u2019s outlays for the same period. In the long term (fiscal years 1995-2035), this option will save almost $19 billion in outlays over the amount projected to be spent for the BUR option.
