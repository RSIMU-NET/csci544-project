Three of the contracts were for construction, one contract was for design and supervision, and one contract was for project management. Several factors delayed the road\u0092s completion and increased costs. For example, according to USAID, when one contractor did not make acceptable progress, the agency reduced the scope of work, terminated construction of an 8-mile road section, and hired another contractor to complete the section. Other factors included the Indonesian government\u0092s difficulty in acquiring land for the road and local opposition to the new road alignment.", "USAID took several actions to ensure quality in the road\u0092s design and construction. For example, USAID hired an experienced, U.S.-registered professional engineer as Project Manager and hired a U.S.-based engineering firm to design the road and supervise most construction. USAID also required contractors to remain liable for any quality defects for 1 year after completing road sections. In addition, USAID required the Project Manager and the engineering firm to perform routine inspections, including final inspections when the warranties ended. Some inspections revealed poor-quality work that the contractors corrected. However, the engineering firm\u0092s and Project Manager\u0092s contracts ended in March 2012 and April 2012, respectively, leaving no qualified staff to inspect around 50 miles\u0097more than half of the completed road\u0097still under warranty.

However, various factors could affect the road\u0092s sustainability for its intended 10-year design life. For example, according to USAID and Indonesian officials, the Directorate lacks resources needed to maintain the road.

According to USAID, the  mission determined that WIKA was not making satisfactory progress,  owing in part to financial constraints and lack of equipment as well as  WIKA\u2019s changing its project leader three times. WIKA\u2019s limited  progress was primarily evident in one of the sections that comprised  the priority contract. By May 2008, this 8-mile section was about 20  percent complete compared with other sections that were  approximately 50 percent to 90 percent complete.

According to USAID, the Indonesian  government had difficulty acquiring over 4,000 parcels of land needed  for the new road alignment and right-of-way. The land was needed  because, in many areas, the tsunami had changed the entire  landscape such that parts of the road alignment, as it existed prior to  the tsunami, were now underwater or otherwise inaccessible or  unusable. In its efforts to acquire the land parcels, the Indonesian  government experienced delays in determining ownership and  locating owners because many owners had died in the tsunami. Also,  in some instances, ownership documents, which were the only  existing ownership records, were destroyed by the tsunami. Delays  also occurred because, in some instances, the land parcels that were  acquired were not contiguous and, as a result, construction  contractors did not have a sufficient amount of land on which to  initiate construction and store equipment and materials. For example,  initiation of work to construct the priority 3-mile segment was delayed  for approximately a year because the Indonesian government had  acquired less than a quarter mile of right-of-way, significantly less land  than USAID had expected to be available.", "Community opposition. Community opposition to the new road  alignment resulted in delays, according to USAID. For example,  construction was delayed because of disagreement between the  Indonesian government and individuals and communities about the  prices for land parcels. Also, for example, the proposed new  alignment involved laying pavement over more than 600 gravesites.  Upon learning that gravesites would be affected, some individuals and  communities erected roadblocks and conducted demonstrations in  opposition. To resolve the situation, Indonesian government officials,  with USAID coordination assistance, had to negotiate settlements and  identify and acquire new sites for the graves.", "Security problems. According to USAID, delays occurred because of  security concerns and violence. For example, security threats caused  delays in areas with a 30-year history of civil conflict between an  insurgency group and the Indonesian government. Also, delays  occurred when contractors received security threats, equipment was  intentionally damaged, and workers were assaulted in land-value  disputes. Figure 6 shows examples of community opposition that  involved community protests, in some cases resulting in damage to  contractor equipment.", "Flooding. During construction, delays resulted from flooding, caused  by unusually heavy rains that destroyed temporary access to  construction sites and to construction facilities where materials and  equipment were located. In some instances, according to USAID,  roads flooded even though drainage culverts had been built according  to design specifications (see fig. 7). Subsequent to this flooding, the  contractor corrected inaccurate design assumptions, caused by a lack  of reliable historical climatological data for the area, and increased the  capacities of some culverts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USAID Took Several Actions to Ensure Quality of Indonesia Road Design and Construction but Lacks Quality Assurance Mechanism for Sections Still under Warranty", "paragraphs": ["USAID\u2019s actions to ensure the Indonesia road\u2019s quality included, among  others, hiring an experienced project manager and requiring 1-year  warranties for completed road sections.

To design pavement and bridge structures that would be  capable of carrying anticipated vehicle loads, for example, design  engineers used the widely accepted U.S. standards of the American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as  well as regionally and locally applicable Indonesian standards, such as  those of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Use of AASHTO  pavement design standards enabled engineers to determine the  thickness of the road\u2019s layers (aggregate base layers covered with an  asphalt surface) that would be needed to sustain anticipated traffic  volumes and vehicle weights over its 10-year design life. In addition, use  of AASHTO and Indonesian bridge standards allowed engineers to  determine appropriate structural configurations for bridges in  consideration of site-specific traffic, thermal, and seismic conditions.", "Parsons also included several safety features in the design\u2014for example,  guardrails, warning signs, pavement markings, and protected walkways  on bridges\u2014that contributed to the road\u2019s quality.

For example, construction contractors employed Indonesian  heavy equipment operators and truck drivers, and Parsons trained  Indonesians to fill several key positions such as Finance Manager and  Public Information/Media Specialist. Also, according to USAID officials,  after the construction work was completed, USAID and Parsons provided  the Directorate with used vehicles for use in maintaining the road."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Could Affect Road\u2019s Sustainability during Intended 10-Year Life Expectancy", "paragraphs": ["Several factors\u2014the Directorate\u2019s limited capacity and resources, failure  to restrict overweight vehicles, construction in the road right-of-way, and  unauthorized access roads\u2014could lessen the road\u2019s sustainability for its  intended 10-year life expectancy.", "Limited capacity and resources. Although the Directorate has  provided a 5-year funding plan for the road and taken some actions to  replace missing guardrails, the Directorate lacks some equipment as  well as a sufficient number of staff for maintenance and repairs,  according to USAID and Directorate officials. For example, USAID  recommended in its checklist that the Directorate keep a jackhammer,  compressor, and four vibrator rollers at each of three proposed  maintenance facilities, but as of May 2012, the Directorate had not  established the maintenance facilities and had not provided the  equipment. Also, according to Directorate officials in Banda Aceh, the  Directorate has a limited number of staff to maintain existing roads  throughout Aceh Province.", "Overweight vehicles. The Directorate has not taken action to restrict  the use of overweight vehicles on the road, which could reduce the  road\u2019s life expectancy. USAID\u2019s design of the road with a 10-year life  expectancy is based on certain assumptions concerning the impact of  the number and weight of vehicles on the road\u2019s deterioration. For  example, USAID\u2019s design assumes that the heaviest trucks  anticipated (100,000-pound, 3-axle trucks) on the road will comprise  less than 1 percent of total traffic; however, this low volume of heavy  truck traffic will cause more than 60 percent of the road\u2019s deterioration  over its 10-year design life. A greater than expected volume of heavy  truck traffic, or use of the road by trucks that exceed 100,000 pounds,  will lead to a higher amount of deterioration and reduced life for the  road. To thwart acceleration of pavement damage resulting from  overweight vehicles using the road, USAID recommended that the  Directorate use portable scales to weigh suspected overweight  vehicles. However, as of May 2012, the Directorate had not taken any  actions to weigh vehicles. During our March 2012 inspection of the  road, we observed several heavily loaded trucks but saw no   permanent weigh stations and saw no vehicles being weighed with  portable scales.", "Construction in right-of-way. The road\u2019s intended 10-year life  expectancy is also based on keeping drainage culverts in the right-of- way clear of blockage, according to USAID\u2019s Project Manager.  However, the Directorate has not taken action to prevent the  construction of buildings and has not removed existing buildings that  have been constructed in the right-of-way. Such construction could  obstruct drainage channels and cause erosion and flooding.  According to USAID officials, USAID informed the Directorate of  numerous instances where buildings had been or were being  constructed in the right-of-way, but as of May 2012, the Indonesian  government had not taken any actions to remove or prevent such  construction. When we traveled the length of the road in March 2012,  we observed a completed building that had been constructed in the  right-of-way over the drainage channel.", "Unauthorized access roads. As of March 2012, according to  USAID\u2019s Project Manager, the Directorate had not taken action to  prevent the creation of unauthorized access roads, which also can  prevent proper drainage and cause erosion and flooding. These  unauthorized access roads have been constructed by removing  guardrail or moving soil, rocks, and other materials; in some  instances, these access roads may obstruct drainage channels and  cause erosion and flooding. During our March 2012 inspection of the  road, we saw several access roads that had been built by removing  guardrails and moving soil and other materials.", "Figure 13 shows a building that was constructed in the right-of-way and  an unauthorized access road where the guardrail was removed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["USAID has completed the construction of a major 91-mile road in a  coastal area of northern Indonesia that was heavily affected by the  December 2004 tsunami and, in doing so, has helped to provide an  opportunity for economic growth in the region. Although USAID  completed the road construction more than 2 years later than planned,  the agency finished the work by confronting and overcoming significant  obstacles while working in a challenging environment. However, despite  taking several actions to help ensure the road\u2019s quality, USAID currently  lacks the capacity to ensure that approximately 50 miles of recently  completed road sections\u201455 percent of the entire road\u2014still under  warranty perform as intended through the 1-year warranty period, as  stipulated in USAID\u2019s contracts with construction firms. Specifically,  although USAID officials in Jakarta told us that they are considering  rehiring the Project Manager on an interim contract, the agency has not  finalized this arrangement. Without qualified personnel inspecting these  road sections before their warranties expire, USAID cannot ensure that  the quality standards are met and that the contractor corrects any  deficiencies as required within the 1-year warranty period.", "To help ensure that the road will reach its intended 10-year life  expectancy, USAID took actions such as designing the road in  accordance with established standards and supporting the Indonesian  government\u2019s Directorate for Highways. However, the road may not  achieve its 10-year life expectancy unless the Indonesian government  properly maintains the road, restricts usage by overweight vehicles, and  prevents construction in the road right-of-way and creation of  unauthorized access roads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of USAID take the following two  actions:", "To help ensure that recently completed sections of the Indonesia road  meet quality standards as required during the 1-year warranty period,  ensure that the road sections are inspected in a timely manner and, if  deficiencies are found, require that the construction contractor repair  the sections before they are formally turned over to the Indonesian  government.", "To help ensure that the constructed road remains sustainable for 10  years as intended, direct the USAID Mission in Indonesia to work with  the Indonesian government to develop and implement a process  addressing factors that could affect the road\u2019s sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report, as well as a video of our March 2012  inspection of the road, to USAID and State for their review. USAID  provided written comments about the draft report, which are reprinted in  appendix II, and provided technical comments about the draft report and  the video that we incorporated as appropriate. State did not provide  comments on either the draft report or the video.", "In its written comments, USAID stated that our report presented an  accurate assessment of its construction operations and its efforts to  ensure the road\u2019s quality and sustainability. In addition, USAID concurred  with our recommendation that it ensure that road sections still under  warranty are inspected in a timely manner and that it require the  contractor to repair any defective sections. The agency stated that it will  retain qualified personnel who can perform inspections before the  warranties expire. USAID concurred with the intent of our  recommendation that, to help ensure the road\u2019s sustainability for the  intended 10 years, it should work with the Indonesian government to  develop and implement a process addressing factors that could affect the  road\u2019s sustainability. USAID noted that many of the factors that could  affect the road\u2019s sustainability are outside the agency\u2019s managerial  control and that, apart from the road sections still under warranty, the  road is under the Indonesian government\u2019s administration. USAID  indicated that any additional technical assistance it might offer the  Indonesian government would be contingent on the government\u2019s  receptiveness as well as the availability of USAID resources. We maintain  that it is essential that USAID work proactively with the Indonesian  government to develop and implement a process that addresses certain  factors, such as the use of overweight vehicles, construction in the right- of-way, and the creation of unauthorized access roads, that could affect  the road\u2019s sustainability.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of State, and the USAID Administrator.
