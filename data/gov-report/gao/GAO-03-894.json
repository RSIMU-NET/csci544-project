The group presented its final report to the President in May 2001. GAO was asked to (1) describe the process used by the NEPDG to develop the National Energy Policy report, including whom the group met with and what topics were discussed and (2) determine the costs associated with that process. Although appointed NEPDG Chair, the Vice President elected not to respond to GAO's request for certain factual NEPDG information. Accordingly, as authorized by GAO's access-torecords statute, and after exhausting efforts to achieve a resolution and following the processes specified in that statute, GAO filed suit in U.S. District Court to obtain the information. The district court later dismissed GAO's suit on jurisdictional grounds, without reaching the merits of GAO's right to audit and evaluate NEPDG activities or to obtain access to NEPDG records. For a variety of reasons, GAO decided not to appeal the district court decision. DOE, Interior, and EPA reviewed the draft report and chose not to comment. OVP declined an offer to review the draft and comment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to the best information that GAO could obtain, the National Energy Policy report was the product of a centralized, top-down, short-term, and labor-intensive process that involved the efforts of several hundred federal employees governmentwide. In the 3 = months between the inception of NEPDG and its presentation of the final report, the Principals (the Vice President, selected cabinet-level and other senior administration officials) and their support staff (Support Group) controlled most facets of the report's development, including setting meeting schedules and agendas, controlling the workflow, distributing work assignments, rewriting chapters, and approving recommendations. Senior agency officials served on a select interagency Working Group, while the majority of agency staff working on the NEPDG effort played a tributary role, helping their agencies fulfill their NEPDG-related obligations and responding to the Support Group's subsequent requests for information, review, or comment. In developing the National Energy Policy report, the NEPDG Principals, Support Group, and participating agency officials and staff met with, solicited input from, or received information and advice from nonfederal energy stakeholders, principally petroleum, coal, nuclear, natural gas, and electricity industry representatives and lobbyists. The extent to which submissions from any of these stakeholders were solicited, influenced policy deliberations, or were incorporated into the final report cannot be determined based on the limited information made available to GAO. NEPDG met and conducted its work in two distinct phases: the first phase culminated in a March 19, 2001, briefing to the President on challenges relating to energy supply and the resulting economic impact; the second phase ended with the May 16, 2001, presentation of the final report to the President. The Office of the Vice President's (OVP) unwillingness to provide the NEPDG records or other related information precluded GAO from fully achieving its objectives and substantially limited GAO's ability to comprehensively analyze the NEPDG process. None of the key federal entities involved in the NEPDG effort provided GAO with a complete accounting of the costs that they incurred during the development of the National Energy Policy report. The two federal entities responsible for funding the NEPDG effort--OVP and the Department of Energy (DOE)--did not provide the comprehensive cost information that GAO requested. OVP provided GAO with 77 pages of information, two-thirds of which contained no cost information while the remaining one-third contained some miscellaneous information of little to no usefulness. OVP stated that it would not provide any additional information. DOE, the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provided GAO with estimates of certain costs and salaries associated with the NEPDG effort, but these estimates, all calculated in different ways, were not comprehensive."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As one of the new administration\u2019s first major actions, on January 29, 2001,  the President created a group of cabinet-level and other senior federal  officials, chaired by the Vice President, to develop a national energy policy.  The President charged the group, called the National Energy Policy  Development Group (NEPDG), with developing \u201ca national energy policy  designed to help the private sector, and government at all levels, promote  dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound production and  distribution of energy for the future.\u201d NEPDG presented its final report to  the President on May 16, 2001. The report contained over 100  recommendations for executive actions or new legislation. The Congress is  now considering the energy-related legislative proposals.", "You asked us to examine the process used by the President\u2019s energy policy  taskforce. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) describe the process  used by NEPDG to develop the National Energy Policy report, including  whom the group met with and the topics discussed at these meetings, and  (2) determine the costs associated with that process. In order to close out  this request, we are providing a limited analysis based on the best  information that has been made available to us.", "To address our objectives, we followed a two-pronged information  gathering effort. First, starting in the spring of 2001, we began gathering  information from several federal agencies involved in the report\u2019s  development\u2014the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of the  Interior (Interior), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At  each of the agencies, we interviewed senior agency officials that were  involved in the NEPDG effort and received written correspondence and  other materials from them providing detailed responses to our questions.  Agency officials based most of their answers on their best recollections or  on information reconstructed from electronic schedules. Our meetings  with officials yielded information regarding the meetings that Cabinet-level  agency officials attended and meetings that agency officials held with  NEPDG support staff (Support Group). Officials also provided us with  selected information on meetings held with nonfederal energy stakeholders  to discuss issues related to energy aspects of their agency\u2019s activities.", "Second, also starting in spring of 2001, we initiated contact with the Office  of the Vice President (OVP), as NEPDG Chair, to obtain NEPDG records  responsive to your request. From the outset, OVP did not respond to our  request for information, including descriptive information on the process  by which the National Energy Policy report was developed, asserting that  we lacked statutory authority to examine NEPDG activities. We were also  denied the opportunity to interview staff assisting the Vice President on the  NEPDG effort. As a result, throughout the spring and summer of 2001, we  engaged in extensive attempts to reach an agreement with OVP on our  information request in an effort to fulfill our statutory responsibilities in a  manner that accommodated the Vice President\u2019s asserted need to protect  certain executive deliberations. Importantly, we significantly narrowed the  scope of our review by, among other things, withdrawing our initial request  for minutes of NEPDG meetings. We also offered flexibility in how we  would access certain documents. Despite our concerted efforts to reach a  reasonable accommodation, the Vice President denied us access to  virtually all requested information, with the exception of a few documents  purportedly related to NEPDG costs that OVP provided to us. The Vice  President\u2019s denial of access challenged GAO\u2019s fundamental authority to  evaluate the process by which NEPDG had developed a national energy  policy and to obtain access to records that would shed light on that  process. As authorized by GAO\u2019s access-to-records statute, after exhausting  the processes specified in that statute for achieving a resolution and  receiving a request from two senate full committee chairs and two senate  subcommittee chairs to pursue our evaluation, we filed suit in the U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia on February 22, 2002, to obtain  the limited factual NEPDG information that we had requested. On  December 9, 2002, the district court dismissed GAO\u2019s suit on jurisdictional  grounds, without reaching the merits of GAO\u2019s authority to audit and  evaluate NEPDG activities or to obtain access to NEPDG records. After  considerable bipartisan outreach efforts to the Congress, GAO decided not  to appeal the district court decision. A detailed chronology of our efforts  to obtain access to NEPDG records can be found on GAO\u2019s Web site.", "OVP\u2019s unwillingness to provide NEPDG records and other related  information precluded us from fully achieving our objectives in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards and substantially  limited our ability to answer the questions you asked and the depth of our  analysis. Yet, given the unique circumstances surrounding this request, our  protracted attempts to acquire this information, and the availability of  certain related documents in the public realm, we gathered and analyzed  available information on the NEPDG effort to provide as robust an account  as possible under the circumstances. Specifically, in order to more fully  analyze and describe the NEPDG report development process, beginning in  March 2002, we obtained, reviewed, and analyzed NEPDG-related  information from federal agencies involved in the NEPDG effort that was  released under court order in four other ongoing lawsuits filed under other  statutes. The agencies releasing documents included DOE, Interior, and  EPA, as well as the Department of Transportation, Department of  Commerce, Department of Agriculture, and the Office of Management and  Budget. We could not independently verify some of the information  contained in these documents because the agencies had redacted data from  more than one-third of the pages. The agencies asserted that the redacted  information was exempt from production under the Freedom of  Information Act because it reflected deliberative processes among other  things. For the thousands of pages that contained some information  responsive to our objectives, we compared and contrasted their contents,  sought corroboration from other sources, and pieced together a general  description of the National Energy Policy report development process.  Included in these pages were several hundred E-mails and other documents  generated by OVP or the Support Group. Some of these documents  revealed information about the process used to develop the NEPDG report,  but none of them contained cost information beyond that which we had  previously obtained."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The National Energy Policy Report Was the Product of a Centralized, Top-Down Process", "paragraphs": ["The National Energy Policy report was the product of a short-term, labor- intensive process that involved the efforts of several hundred federal  employees governmentwide.

The Working Group met frequently in February and March 2001 to  review the latest outlines and drafts, report on the status of their specific  assignments, represent agency views, provide comments to other agencies,  and obtain further instructions. For example, the first Working Group  meeting held on February 9, 2001, concentrated on the group\u2019s approach to  developing a national energy policy and the milestones for completing the  process. The second meeting held on February 13, 2001, focused on  determining the chapters that would be included in the final report.  Subsequent meetings typically involved a review of drafts in which the lead  authors would lead discussion on a chapter\u2019s main points. Attendees would  comment on the chapters or propose new or revised text for the group\u2019s  discussion. The Working Group considered various alternatives in  language, tone, and recommendations for the report and then decided on a  particular course of action to recommend to the Vice President.", "The Working Group met often in February and March 2001, generally  several days before and immediately following the Principals\u2019 meetings.  Most of these meetings took place in the Vice President\u2019s Ceremonial  Office, although several had to be rescheduled elsewhere. Working Group  meetings were frequently cancelled or postponed as a result of scheduling  conflicts.

Agencies had considerable latitude in determining how to staff their  NEPDG assignments. Most agencies developed a multilevel, top-down  process coordinated by the agency\u2019s lead NEPDG contact or Working  Group member. Generally, the NEPDG Support Group forwarded specific  writing assignments, information requests, meeting times and agendas to  the agency contacts, who then disseminated the information to a  coordination team. The coordination team distributed assignments to lead  officials in offices or bureaus throughout the department. These officials  then assigned staff to complete the tasks. When the completed work had  interoffice concurrence, it was then passed back up the chain of command.  The NEPDG agency staff contact then reviewed and approved all agency  submissions before releasing them to the Principals, the Support Group, or  other agencies for review or comment. Agency staff contacts also held  regular update meetings with the coordination team and provided assorted  updates and briefings to the agency Principal. Not all agencies experienced  the same workload. For example, DOE, which was assigned the lead role in  developing multiple chapters, had greater responsibilities, more meetings  to attend, and larger efforts to coordinate than some other agencies, such  as Interior, that played more of an advisory role. Frequent interaction also  took place between agencies in developing the report chapters.", "More than 80 DOE employees from eight departmental offices had direct  input into the development of the National Energy Policy report, including  science specialists and representatives with significant science expertise.  DOE\u2019s Senior Policy Advisor to the Secretary led the department\u2019s internal  effort to develop information for an interim and final report, and to identify  policy recommendations for the report. The official joined the Acting  Director of the then Office of Policy in periodic meetings with the Support  Group staff and other agency officials to discuss drafts of specific chapters.  In addition, the official joined DOE Office of Policy and program officials to  relay comments from NEPDG meetings and to coordinate writing activities  within DOE. The Acting Director of the Office of Policy, who was  responsible for the day-to-day coordination and management of the  process of producing DOE\u2019s contributions to the NEPDG effort, led a  coordination team of senior managers from the department\u2019s Office of  Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Office  of Fossil Energy, Office of Policy, Office of International Affairs, Energy  Information Administration, and the Bonneville Power Administration. The  team was charged with coordinating the writing of chapters, and each  office formed a similar group within their areas of expertise to write its  respective chapters. The Office of Policy took the lead on chapter 1  (Taking Stock), Energy Efficiency took the lead on chapter 4 (Using  Energy Wisely) and chapter 6 (Nature\u2019s Power), and Fossil Energy took the  lead on chapter 5 (Energy for a New Century). In addition, DOE  contributed draft sections to chapters for which other agencies had been  assigned the lead role. Each office developed recommendations and, after  internal discussions, forwarded them for high-level review within DOE  before they were released to the NEPDG Principals for review.", "DOE staff researched historical information about energy and energy  markets; identified key energy issues; examined and analyzed the current  situation in energy markets; discussed likely energy issues, such as energy  production, conservation and energy efficiency, energy prices, renewable  and alternative energy sources, and national energy security; and prepared  issue papers, memoranda, and talking points relating to these subjects.  They also assisted with writing and reviewing drafts of report chapters,  providing supporting statistical and other information, reviewing and  responding to comments from other executive branch components, fact- checking, developing citations and graphics, and briefing the Secretary on  energy policy issues.", "Interior was not assigned a lead role in writing any of the report chapters.  The department\u2019s relationship with NEPDG, including the Working Group  and Support Group staff, therefore consisted of the discussions at  Principals\u2019 and Working Group meetings, comments on drafts, provision of  an options paper, and responses to questions from NEPDG staff. To  support the NEPDG effort, Interior\u2019s Office of Policy Analysis formed an  energy task force comprised of 11 issue teams to examine opportunities to  make more energy available from public lands and to streamline and  improve various planning and permitting processes for facilitating energy  development. Approximately 100 Interior employees, representing 13  departmental offices or bureaus, helped to develop information for the  NEPDG effort. These teams helped develop an internal paper that agency  officials used during Working Group discussions of other agencies\u2019 draft  chapters.", "EPA\u2019s general role was to ensure that environmental issues were accurately  and adequately addressed and reflected in the development of the report.  More than 110 EPA employees participated in the agency\u2019s internal NEPDG  efforts.

This EPA official and  two senior managers from the Office of Air and Radiation worked closely  with senior staff from other offices within EPA and senior officials from  other contributing agencies.

DOE reported that the Secretary of Energy discussed  national energy policy with chief executive officers of petroleum,  electricity, nuclear, coal, chemical, and natural gas companies, among  others. The Secretary of Energy also reportedly asked nonfederal parties  for their recommendations for short- and long-term responses to petroleum  product price and supply constraints. Several corporations and  associations, including Chevron, the National Mining Association, and the  National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, provided the Secretary of  Energy with detailed energy policy recommendations.

However, the NEPDG executive director did not specify the frequency,  length, or purpose of the meetings, or how participants were selected to  attend. In addition, OVP reported that the Support Group staff also met  with numerous nonfederal stakeholders during the development of the  final report, including a meeting with representatives of various utilities  and two meetings with representatives of Enron Corporation.", "Finally, senior agency officials participated in numerous meetings with  nonfederal energy stakeholders to discuss the national energy policy.  Based on our analysis of the agency documents produced under court  order, senior DOE officials, in addition to attending meetings with the  Secretary of Energy, met with a variety of industry representatives,  lobbyists, and energy associations, including the American Coal Company,  Small Refiners Association, the Coal Council, CSX, Enviropower, Inc.,  Detroit Edison, Duke Energy, the Edison Electric Institute, General Motors,  the National Petroleum Council, and the lobbying firm of Barbour, Griffith  & Rogers. These senior DOE officials also solicited recommendations,  views, or points of clarification from other parties. For example, one senior  DOE official solicited detailed energy policy recommendations from a  variety of nonfederal energy stakeholders, including the American  Petroleum Institute, the National Petrochemical and Refiners\u2019 Association,  the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, and Southern  Company. This official also received policy recommendations from others,  including the American Gas Association, Green Mountain Energy, the  National Mining Association, and the lobbying firms the Dutko Group and  the Duberstein Group.

For the remainder of April 2001,  the Support Group mostly worked alone, selecting recommendations to  present to NEPDG Principals and rewriting the chapters to fit the  recommendations. The Principals met to discuss several of the potentially  more controversial recommendations and to decide which proposals to  add to the chapters. In some cases, agencies were told to rewrite sections  of the chapters to incorporate the proposed recommendations.", "The agencies continued to draft their chapters and incorporate various  other agencies\u2019 comments until the Support Group issued a deadline and  requested the final submission of chapters for editing.
