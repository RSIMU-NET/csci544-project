Two of these methods are (1) requiring researchers to obtain approval of their research protocols, including their consideration of alternatives, from their institutions, and (2) calling for or recommending researchers to use database searches to identify alternatives. HHS and USDA also help ensure that researchers consider alternatives through the agencies' oversight of research facilities. For example, USDA is to conduct annual inspections of nonfederal research facilities. Futhermore, the agencies have provided training to researchers on the consideration of alternatives.", "HHS, USDA, and EPA have facilitated the development and use of alternatives to animal use in research through individual and collaborative efforts. These efforts include agency strategies and policies for promoting the use of alternative methods and the development of testing methods that rely on non-animal models. Additionally, the agencies are members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, which is managed by HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The committee promotes testing methods that protect human health and the environment while reducing animal use. The interagency committee's 2018 strategic roadmap calls for it to identify appropriate metrics for monitoring progress and measuring success in adopting alternatives. However, the committee and its member agencies have not routinely developed or reported metrics that demonstrate how their efforts to encourage the use of alternative methods affect animal use. They have also not designated an interagency workgroup to address the challenges related to developing and reporting such metrics. Facilitating the establishment of such a workgroup would help the committee and its member agencies better monitor their progress across the range of their efforts to reduce animal use and report members' progress to the public."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that HHS's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences facilitate the establishment of an interagency workgroup to develop metrics for assessing progress on the development and promotion of alternatives to animal use and incorporate those metrics into public reports.

These procedures  may include surgery, inhalation toxicity studies, studies involving tumor  growth, and food or water deprivation or restriction. However, a growing  number of alternatives are available that enable researchers to replace,  reduce, or refine their use of animals. Researchers and agencies may  seek to develop and use alternatives for several reasons, including the  desire to promote animal welfare, the potential to provide more accurate  information about human diseases or health than animal research can  provide, and the potential to conduct research at a lower cost and in a  shorter time frame than with research using animals. Alternatives that  may replace animals or reduce their use in research include in vitro  methods (i.e., testing cells and tissues in test tubes or other chambers)  and computer modeling in biomedical research or drug safety testing.  Alternatives that may refine animal use include surgical methods that  minimize or eliminate pain and distress and adjustments that improve  animals\u2019 psychological and behavioral welfare such as enhancements to  housing conditions.", "Federal agencies are involved in animal research in several ways.  Agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Agricultural  Research Service (ARS) within the U.S. Department of Agriculture  (USDA) conduct or fund research using animals to answer important  questions about human or animal health. Other agencies, such as the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and HHS\u2019s Food and Drug  Administration (FDA), regulate products that are tested for safety or  efficacy using animals and conduct research to support regulatory  activities. In addition, USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  (APHIS) and NIH are responsible for overseeing the welfare of certain  species of animals used for certain types of research.", "Federal laws, regulations, and policies that govern how animals are to be  used and cared for call for the consideration of alternatives to animal  research. In particular, the Animal Welfare Act, administered by APHIS,  calls for the Secretary of Agriculture to establish standards for animal  care, treatment, and practice that minimize pain and distress of animals in  research facilities and directs that such standards require researchers to  consider alternatives to any procedure likely to produce pain or distress in  an experimental animal. The act\u2019s implementing regulations also require  that research facilities provide annual reports to APHIS containing  assurances that each of their researchers considered alternatives to  painful procedures. Similarly, under the Health Research Extension Act of  1985, applicants for funding from NIH and other HHS agencies covered  by the act must provide certain assurances to NIH for research on  animals. These assurances include that researchers involved with animal  care, treatment, and use have available to them instruction or training in  the concept, availability, and use of research or testing methods that limit  the use of animals or limit animal distress.", "Furthermore, in 1985, federal agencies that use or require the use of  experimental animals adopted certain principles that apply when agencies  develop requirements for testing, research, or training procedures  involving the use of vertebrate animals and whenever these agencies  actually perform or sponsor such procedures. Among other things, these  principles call for researchers to use the minimum number of animals  required to obtain valid results and to consider alternative methods such  as mathematical models, computer simulation, and in vitro biological  systems. The principles call for researchers to consider alternatives  regardless of whether the procedures cause pain or distress to the  animals.", "Federal agencies also have undertaken various efforts to further develop  and promote alternatives to animal research. For example, in June 2018,  EPA issued a strategic plan for the reduction of testing in vertebrates for  chemicals that the agency regulates under the Toxic Substances Control  Act. In addition, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences  within NIH manages the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the  Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), which is composed of  officials from U.S. federal regulatory and research agencies that require,  use, generate, or disseminate toxicological and safety testing  information. One of the committee\u2019s purposes is to reduce, refine, or  replace the use of animals in testing where feasible.", "We have previously reported on the use of animals in federal research. In  May 2018 we issued a report on selected agencies\u2019 reporting and sharing  of information on their animal use programs.

In particular, we discussed researchers\u2019 consideration of  alternatives to animal research and the agencies\u2019 procedures for and  results from conducting inspections or site visits at research facilities in  fiscal years 2015 through 2018.", "To learn more about researchers\u2019 consideration of alternatives to animal  research, we reviewed documents from and interviewed members of  animal care and use committees and other representatives from a  nongeneralizable sample of 12 research facilities\u2014six federal facilities  and six nonfederal facilities\u2014that conduct animal research. To select the  six federal facilities, we randomly selected one facility each from APHIS,  ARS, CDC, EPA, FDA, and NIH. We selected these facilities from among  the agency components that agency officials identified as performing the  most animal research. To select the six nonfederal facilities, we obtained  a list of research facilities that were registered with APHIS as of  September 26, 2018. We randomly selected from this list facilities that (1)  had an assurance under the Health Research Extension Act approved by  NIH as of September 26, 2018, and (2) were shown in publicly available  federal databases as having received federal funding from EPA, HHS, or  USDA at some point from 2015 through 2018. We used these criteria to  select facilities that interacted with at least one of the federal agencies in  our scope. We then interviewed the chair and other members of each  facility\u2019s animal care and use committee about the process each  committee uses to determine that researchers adequately consider  alternatives to animal use. We then performed a content analysis of the  officials\u2019 responses to our questions. The views of these representatives  are not generalizable to all research facilities that perform animal  research but provide examples of how federal and nonfederal research  facilities have addressed requirements to consider alternatives. We also  obtained copies of the protocol forms that the 12 facilities require their  researchers to use to describe their planned use of animals and  consideration of alternatives, and we compared the ways in which the  forms require researchers to document how they identified and  considered alternatives.", "To examine the efforts of HHS, USDA, and EPA to facilitate the use of  alternative research methods and assess the effect of their efforts on  animal use, we identified and reviewed statutes directing agencies to  develop alternatives to animal research or plans for increasing the use of  alternatives. In addition, we reviewed agency documentation related to  each agency\u2019s efforts to facilitate the use of alternatives, including  strategic plans, regulations and guidance regarding the review of the  safety and efficacy of products, and information published on agency  websites and in agency reports on alternatives the agencies have  developed. We interviewed officials from HHS, USDA, and EPA and their  component agencies and offices to identify illustrative examples of efforts  to develop new alternative methods or promote the use of alternative  methods by others. During our interviews with representatives from the 12  selected research facilities, we asked for their views on agencies\u2019 efforts  to facilitate the use of alternative research methods, challenges the  agencies face in developing or promoting alternatives, and how  researchers at the institutions obtain information on alternatives. To  describe interagency collaboration to facilitate the use of alternative  research methods, we reviewed documents from ICCVAM, such as its  website and 2018 strategic roadmap, and documents on the Toxicology in  the 21st Century Program.

As specified in the Animal Welfare Act  regulations and Public Health Service Policy, HHS, USDA, and EPA call  for researchers to send written descriptions of research projects involving  animals to animal care and use committees for their review and approval.

The principles require the consideration of  alternatives. In our review of protocol forms from our sample of 12  research facilities (including HHS, USDA, and EPA facilities), we found  that all of the forms requested information on researchers\u2019 consideration  of alternatives, though the forms varied in the particular information they  requested. The types of information requested included a rationale for  involving animals and for the number of animals to be used, assurance  that research activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous  experiments, and a description of the methods and sources used to  determine that alternatives were not available. Several of the protocol  forms required researchers to identify alternatives considered but not  adopted.", "Recommended method for identifying alternatives. In their  implementation of the Animal Welfare Act and Health Research  Extension Act, respectively, USDA and NIH consider database searches  as a best practice for researchers using animals covered by the acts to  identify and consider alternatives to animal testing. A database search  involves a researcher using keywords related to the planned use of  animals to query citations in databases of published scientific literature.  From April 1997 through July 2018, USDA maintained a policy, known as  Animal Care Policy #12, in its animal care policy manual. In Policy #12,  the agency recommended a database search as the most effective and  efficient method for demonstrating compliance with the requirement to  consider alternatives to painful or distressful procedures. According to  USDA\u2019s Deputy Administrator responsible for implementation of the  Animal Welfare Act regulations, in July 2018, USDA placed the policy in  inoperative status after determining that some research facilities and  agency inspectors had misinterpreted the policy as a requirement.

However, according to the Deputy Administrator, even  though Policy #12 is inoperative, USDA continues to advocate for  database searches, particularly through the USDA Animal Welfare  Information Center\u2019s provision of information to the scientific community  about how to search for alternatives. According to a senior NIH official,  NIH requires that agency researchers conduct database searches. Also,  in a sample animal study proposal form NIH has provided to animal care  and use committees, NIH recommends that researchers at other facilities  conduct database searches.

For example, CDC\u2019s Fort Collins, Colorado, facility requires  researchers to provide assurance on their protocol forms that the facility\u2019s  animal care and use committee\u2019s statistician reviewed the form to  determine whether the research would use an appropriate number of  animals or explain why a review of the number of animals did not occur.  Similarly, the Chairman of APHIS\u2019s National Wildlife Research Center  committee told us that its animal care and use committee includes a  biostatistician who conducts an analysis to ensure that the numbers of  animals to be used will produce statistically significant results.

The strategic plan states that the agency\u2019s  long-term goal is to reduce and eventually eliminate vertebrate animal  testing for chemicals regulated under the act. Pursuant to the strategic  plan, in June 2018 EPA published a list of methods the agency had  identified that require no vertebrate testing and that are capable of  providing information of equivalent or better scientific reliability and quality  than that which would be obtained from vertebrate animal testing.  According to EPA, the agency plans to update the list at least once a  year.

For example,  EPA issued guidance in May 2013 on the data that the agency needs in  order to adequately assess pesticide risks. The guidance also provided  information to manufacturers on how to request waivers from the data  requirements, which would enable the manufacturers to reduce animal  use. EPA also issued guidance in November 2016 that allows pesticide  manufacturers to request a waiver from the requirement to provide data  on acute toxicity tests and that contains a policy statement waiving all  acute lethality dermal studies for formulated pesticide products; such  waivers can reduce the need for pesticide manufacturers to conduct tests  using animals.

For example, EPA  launched the Toxicity Forecaster in 2007 as an effort to use automated  technologies to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals and  screen the cells or proteins when exposed to chemicals for changes in  biological activity that suggest potential toxic effects. According to EPA  documents, these methods could limit the number of required laboratory  animal-based toxicity tests while quickly and efficiently screening large  numbers of chemicals. According to EPA documents, in the first phase  of this effort, which the agency completed in 2009, EPA evaluated more  than 300 well-studied chemicals (primarily pesticides) that had extensive  data from traditional animal-based toxicity testing; the agency then  compared results from automated screening technologies with the results  from the traditional animal tests. As of 2018, EPA had developed and  made publicly available a library of toxicity data on more than 4,500  chemicals.

These include methods that ICCVAM and its member agencies  contributed to developing or validating. However, according to  ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap issued in January 2018, the committee  concluded that its evaluations of new methods during its first 15 years  were lengthy, inefficient, and resource intensive. ICCVAM concluded that  researchers and test method developers often initiated the development  of alternative methods with little input from federal agencies or regulated  industries and, therefore, these methods did not always meet the needs  of federal agencies. Consequently, these methods were either not  accepted by federal agencies or were accepted by the agencies but not  used by the regulated community. Recognizing these limitations, ICCVAM  initiated a strategic shift in 2013 aimed at adjusting the validation of new  test methods to be more responsive to the needs of federal agencies and  other stakeholders. Accordingly, ICCVAM\u2019s 2018 strategic roadmap set  new objectives for reducing animal use, including the following:", "Connect the developers of alternative methods with the regulatory  agencies and the regulated industries that would ultimately use the new  technologies to increase the likelihood of the methods being successfully  developed and implemented.", "Foster the use of efficient and flexible practices, such as public-private  partnerships to promote communication and cooperation, to establish  confidence in new methods.", "Encourage the adoption and use of new methods and approaches by  federal agencies and regulated industries, such as through training  programs on the use of new methods.", "ICCVAM has established workgroups to develop detailed implementation  plans to address roadmap goals. According to the strategic roadmap, the  implementation plans will include four key elements: (1) definition of  testing needs; (2) identification of any available alternative tests and  computer models; (3) a plan to develop integrated approaches to testing  and assessment and defined approaches for interpreting data; and (4) a  plan to address both scientific and nonscientific challenges, including  regulatory challenges, such as international harmonization. As of June  2019, workgroups on acute systemic toxicity, eye and skin irritation, and  skin sensitization had posted information concerning these elements on  ICCVAM\u2019s website. For example, each workgroup authored an article  published in a peer-reviewed journal and posted on the ICCVAM website  about the testing needs of regulatory agencies and information about  available alternatives.", "Another interagency effort that has a goal of promoting the use of  alternative methods is the Toxicology in the 21st Century (Tox21)  Program. Formed in 2008, the program is a collaborative effort among  NIH, FDA, and EPA to characterize the potential toxicity of chemicals by  using cells and isolated molecular targets instead of laboratory animals. A  central component of the program is its focus on developing and  evaluating automated in vitro screening methods to assess the hazards of  chemical substances. As of February 2018, the program had used this  method to assess approximately 10,000 chemicals for their potential  impacts on biological systems. According to NIH\u2019s Tox21 website, these  automated methods have yielded high-quality toxicity data on  environmental substances in a fraction of the time that would have been  required with traditional animal testing. To address key challenges in  toxicology testing, the program\u2019s federal partners developed a strategic  and operational plan in March 2018 that expanded the focus of Tox21\u2019s  research activities to include developing alternative test systems that  predict chemical toxicity in humans and addressing the technical  limitations of and strengthening scientific confidence in current in vitro test  systems. According to NIH, activities under the plan will lead to better  predicting chemical toxicity to humans through using non-animal  alternatives such as stem cells and computational models.", "Since 2011, federal agencies have also collaborated to develop devices  containing human cells that can be used for tests that otherwise might be  conducted using animals. See figure 1 for an example of such devices,  known as tissue chips or human microphysiological systems. According  to NIH officials, this evolving technology may reduce animal testing and  produce results more relevant to human health. The interagency effort  was initiated in September 2011 when the President announced the  formation of a collaborative project between NIH, the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency, and FDA to develop tissue chips loaded with  living human cells to screen the efficacy, safety, and toxicity of drugs,  vaccines, or biological products for humans. Subsequently, in July 2012,  NIH launched the Tissue Chip for Drug Screening program, which  provided 19 grants to research facilities to develop tissue chips that  accurately model the structure and function of the human lung, liver,  heart, and more. In September 2014, NIH announced a second phase of  the program in which researchers would refine existing tissue chips and  combine them into an integrated system that can mimic the complex  functions of the human body. In one example of this collaboration, two  project teams funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency\u2014the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Wyss  Institute at Harvard University\u2014are working with NIH-funded researchers  to develop platforms that integrate 10 tissue chips that each represent a  separate human organ.", "Federal agencies have also collaborated with nongovernmental  organizations on training to promote the use of alternative methods.

Webinar presenters described alternative  approaches for identifying substances likely to cause acute systemic  toxicity through inhalation. Similarly, EPA collaborated with the PETA  International Science Consortium and the Physicians Committee for  Responsible Medicine on webinars in November 2018, February 2019,  and April 2019 that addressed alternative methods for testing the effect of  chemicals on skin, for predicting the effect of inhaled substances, and for  identifying substances that cause irritation or inflammation in human  respiratory systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICCVAM and Its Member Agencies Have Not Established a Workgroup to Develop Metrics on the Effect of Their Efforts on Animal Use", "paragraphs": ["ICCVAM\u2019s strategic roadmap calls for its members to identify appropriate  metrics for prioritizing activities, monitoring progress, and measuring  success toward the goals described in the roadmap.

For example, according to agency officials, differences  in the regulatory contexts in which agencies use data generated through  animal research\u2014for example, in regulation of pesticides versus human  or animal drugs\u2014limit agencies\u2019 ability to develop metrics that can be  applied across multiple agencies. Furthermore, the ICCVAM roadmap  states that measuring the actual impact of encouraging the adoption and  use of new methods is difficult in the United States due to the limited  ability to quantify animals used for toxicity testing. In particular, the Animal  Welfare Act does not cover several species commonly used in research,  including mice, rats, and birds bred for research and cold-blooded  species such as fish. Therefore, research facilities are not required under  the act to report their use of those species to APHIS, and the data APHIS  receives from research facilities can only be used to track a subset of the  total number of animals used for research in the United States.", "Although ICCVAM and its member agencies face challenges in  developing metrics, the roadmap also states that agency-specific  mechanisms to measure progress may exist, such as tracking the number  of waivers granted for a particular animal test. For example, as discussed  above, EPA has estimated the extent to which its granting of data waivers  to pesticide manufacturers has reduced animal use and research costs.  Additionally, some agencies have estimated the effect that a new  alternative method could have on animal use. Moreover, officials from  FDA and EPA said that their agencies are able to accept non-animal test  data in lieu of animal test data if the data meet their regulatory needs.  Measuring the frequency with which the agencies receive non-animal test  data instead of animal data could be another mechanism for estimating  changes in animal use.", "In addition, the ICCVAM Authorization Act of 2000 requires ICCVAM to  prepare biennial public reports on its progress under the act\u2014including its  efforts to ensure that new and revised test methods are validated to meet  the needs of federal agencies and to reduce, refine, or replace the use of  animals in testing, among other things.
