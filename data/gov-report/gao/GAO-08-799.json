The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor (Labor) enforce several laws intended to prevent gender pay discrimination. GAO examined (1) how EEOC enforces laws addressing gender pay disparities among private sector employers and provides outreach and what is known about its performance, and (2) how Labor enforces laws addressing gender pay disparities among federal contractors and provides outreach and what is known about its performance. GAO analyzed relevant laws, regulations, monitoring reports, and agency enforcement data and conducted interviews at the agencies' central offices and two field offices experienced in gender pay cases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EEOC addresses gender pay discrimination primarily by responding to individual charges, initiating investigations, and conducting outreach, but the agency does not fully monitor gender pay enforcement efforts. EEOC prioritizes incoming charges of discrimination against employers that appear to merit further investigation, and GAO's analysis of EEOC data showed that charges of gender pay discrimination were prioritized for investigation more frequently than non-gender pay charges. EEOC collects detailed information on all its enforcement efforts and uses these data to monitor enforcement performance overall as well as by statute, including one statute dedicated to gender pay. However, EEOC does not monitor gender pay enforcement efforts under another statute that covers multiple discrimination topics and under which more than half of gender pay charges are filed. As a result, EEOC does not make complete use of available information to help identify trends related to gender pay cases, set agency priorities, or understand how its gender pay enforcement efforts are contributing to overall performance goals relative to other efforts. EEOC also conducts both fee-based and free outreach on a broad range of topics, which can include gender pay. EEOC monitors the number and type of free outreach activities and holds itself accountable for providing outreach to both employers and employees and obtaining high audience ratings on some fee-based outreach. Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) conducts compliance evaluations targeted to federal contractors based on whether they may be engaging in systemic discrimination, but efforts to monitor the performance of enforcement and outreach activities are limited. OFCCP uses a mathematical model to select contractors for review based on the likelihood of noncompliance, but it has not yet evaluated the model for how well it predicts systemic discrimination due to resource constraints. In addition, regulations require contractors to conduct a self-evaluation of their compensation systems to identify and address gender pay disparities. However, OFCCP's guidance on this is found in different source documents that are not cross-referenced, and its data system lacks a unique code to help the agency easily determine the extent to which contractors are complying with the self-evaluation requirement. While OFCCP collects enforcement data by type of discrimination and monitors enforcement performance overall, it does not monitor enforcement trends and performance outcomes regarding gender pay or other specific areas of discrimination. Even if it were to do so, questionable reliability of certain enforcement data undermines performance monitoring. As a result, OFCCP may have difficulty determining how best to prioritize its resources among the different types of discrimination it addresses. To increase awareness of anti-discrimination laws, OFCCP also conducts outreach to federal contractors on topics that include gender pay. OFCCP holds itself accountable for achieving a targeted number of events, but does not systematically gather recipient feedback and use it to measure the quality of its outreach efforts. In contrast, Labor's Women's Bureau, which also provides outreach to working women, sets performance targets and systematically measures its impact."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, along with  judicial precedents, are credited in part with narrowing the pay gap  between men and women over the past several decades.

Specifically, we address (1) how EEOC  enforces laws addressing gender pay disparities among private sector  employers and provides outreach, and what is known about its  performance, and (2) how Labor enforces laws addressing gender pay  disparities among federal contractors and provides outreach, and what is  known about its performance.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations  and each agency\u2019s policies, procedures, and monitoring reports relevant to  enforcement and outreach efforts. We interviewed EEOC and Labor  officials in their respective central offices and visited two field offices for  each agency. We chose field offices with recent experience with gender  pay cases that varied by size and geographic location. We also analyzed  EEOC\u2019s and OFCCP\u2019s data on gender pay and non-gender pay cases  reviewed from fiscal year (FY) 2000 to FY 2007. We determined that  EEOC\u2019s enforcement data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report by testing it for accuracy and completeness, reviewing  documentation about the data and systems that produced them, and  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data and data  systems. Using similar methods, we found that OFCCP\u2019s enforcement data  were not sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

Title VII requires EEOC to conduct outreach targeted to populations it  serves, particularly those that have been historically underserved, in  cooperation with other federal agencies, and to provide fee-based  training to employers and others on equal employment opportunity  topics.

Specifically, from FY 2000 to FY 2007, the number of gender pay charges  filed annually with EEOC decreased by 35 percent (from 3,165 to 2,064),  while the number of other individual charges filed annually remained  relatively constant at approximately 84,000. See figure 1. EEOC officials  told us they did not know the specific reasons for the downward trend in  gender pay charges, but noted that the types of charges filed with the  agency can be affected by issues covered in the media, changes in law, or  the state of the national economy.

Mediation between an  individual and employer is offered as an alternative to a lengthy  investigation. Participation in the mediation program is confidential,  voluntary, and requires the consent of both parties. If mediation is not  successful in resolving the charge, it is assigned for investigation.", "EEOC usually dismisses charges that do not appear to have merit or where  the agency does not have jurisdiction.", "If EEOC finds a violation as a result of its investigation, it attempts to  reach an agreement between the charging party and employer through a  conciliation process. If conciliation fails, EEOC may decide to litigate the  case in federal court. EEOC may resolve any charge with an employer  early in the process through settlement, which is a voluntary process. The  charge resolution process is depicted in figure 2.", "Compared to other types of charges, we found that gender pay charges  were less likely to be dismissed and more likely to be prioritized for  further investigation. Over the last 8 years, approximately 32 percent of  gender pay cases were prioritized for investigation, compared to about 21  percent of non-gender pay charges, as shown in figure 3. According to  EEOC officials, this difference may be attributable to the apparent  strength of evidence, such as payroll data, initially presented by charging  parties in gender pay cases as compared to non-gender pay cases.", "Although EEOC prioritized a greater percentage of gender pay cases for  investigation, the agency ultimately obtained a similar rate of outcomes  that were favorable to the charging party in gender pay cases as it did in  all others. Specifically, about 24 percent of gender pay charges, and 21  percent of all other charges, resulted in conciliation, settlement, or a  withdrawal that yielded monetary or non-monetary benefits from FY 2000  to FY 2007. Agency officials said the similarity in resolutions may be  attributable to the fact that most charges that enter mediation are resolved  in a manner that is favorable to the charging party but that charges filed  under the EPA are not mediated, pursuant to EEOC policy. According to  these officials, even though EPA charges are only one component of all  gender pay charges, this may lower the rate of favorable outcomes for  gender pay charges relative to non-gender pay charges.", "In addition to responding to individual charges, EEOC also initiates a  limited number of investigations, including gender pay investigations. As  shown in table 1, EEOC filed 35 agency-initiated gender pay investigations  and 153 non-gender pay agency-initiated investigations between FY 2000 to  FY 2007. The number of EEOC\u2019s agency-initiated investigations is small  compared to the more than 78,000 individual charges addressed annually  over the same period of time. Although EEOC is legally authorized to  pursue agency-initiated investigations, it is not required to do so.  According to agency officials, the large number of individual charges and  the agency\u2019s budgetary constraints make it difficult for EEOC\u2019s field  offices to carry out agency-initiated investigations. At the same time,  gender pay cases accounted for 19 percent of all agency-initiated  investigations.", "In 2006, EEOC instituted a greater focus on investigations of systemic  discrimination. These include agency-initiated charges and individual  charges that could benefit many individuals.  This increased focus on  systemic discrimination may explain an increase in agency-initiated non- gender pay investigations from 4 in 2005 to 25 in 2007. A similar rise is not  seen for agency-initiated gender pay cases.", "In addition, EEOC and OFCCP entered into a Memorandum of  Understanding in 1999, agreeing to coordinate efforts on compensation  discrimination cases. Pursuant to the memorandum, EEOC officials stated  that their field offices have liaisons with area Labor offices and that each  agency refers cases to the other.

For example, EEOC generates monthly and  quarterly reports on a number of charge statistics\u2014such as average charge  processing time, charge resolutions, and workplace and monetary  benefits\u2014by statute, including the EPA and Title VII. While the EPA  statistics exclusively reflect gender pay cases, the Title VII statistics cover  many topics and are not broken down by type of discrimination, such as  gender pay. Because over half of gender pay cases are filed only under  Title VII (see appendix II), trends involving cases filed under the EPA  would not necessarily be representative of all gender pay cases. The  agency also posts annual statistics on its Web site, showing the number of  charges filed under particular statutes, such as the EPA, as well as charges  pertaining to certain types of discrimination, including gender-based  discrimination. The statistics on gender discrimination include but are not  broken out by charges related to harassment, hiring, promotion, or gender  pay.", "EEOC also generates ad hoc reports for specific analyses pertaining to  issues of interest to agency stakeholders, such as members of the  Commission and community and advocacy groups. With respect to gender  pay, EEOC has used its enforcement workload information to help  determine human capital needs within the agency. Specifically, EEOC  analyzed its litigation workload in 2001 by type of case and, as a result of  this analysis, the agency developed a training course on resolving gender  discrimination charges, including charges of gender pay discrimination,  for its investigative and legal staff.", "Because performance information specific to gender pay charges is not  regularly monitored and reported, EEOC does not use that information to  identify trends or set priorities for enforcement or outreach related  specifically to gender pay. While EEOC generally reports charge  information by statute, gender pay charges can be processed and resolved  under multiple statutes; however, EEOC\u2019s reports do not show trends for  types of discrimination that are addressed under multiple statutes..  Reports that show only total charges by statute may make it difficult to  discern changes in the number of charges filed for particular types of  discrimination that result from new legislation, court decisions, or media  coverage of current events. For example, the Supreme Court issued the  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. decision in 2007, which affected  the filing timelines for pay discrimination charges under Title VII. EEOC\u2019s  regular reports would not show whether the number of pay discrimination  charges changed following the decision, because it affected a subset of  Title VII charges, namely charges of pay discrimination.", "EEOC does not know the extent to which its gender pay efforts, or its  enforcement efforts pertaining to any other particular type of  discrimination, are contributing to overall performance goals relative to  other types of discrimination. For example, EEOC has set an agencywide  goal of resolving 72 percent of its cases within 180 days for FY 2007.  Based on our review of EEOC data, 54 percent of gender pay charges meet  the 180-day goal, as compared to 63 percent of all other charges (see fig  ure 4). The only charges that consistently met EEOC\u2019s timeliness goal  were dismissals.", "In addition, even though the number of gender pay charge filings has  declined from FY 2000 to FY 2007, they are more frequently referred for  further investigation, which takes longer on average than mediation and  significantly longer than dismissals (see table 2). Such analyses could  provide EEOC a better understanding of its workload, which could assist  in setting performance targets related to timeliness.

At the same time, EEOC\u2019s inflation-adjusted  spending on outreach fell by 29 percent, driven largely by a 47 percent  decline in free outreach spending. EEOC officials told us that EEOC\u2019s  overall declining budget and shifting priorities led to the decline in free  outreach spending. They attributed EEOC\u2019s ability to conduct more  outreach with less money to changes in delivery methods, such as less  travel, greater use of technology, and shorter presentations.

EEOC surveys audiences at some fee-based seminars  and uses this feedback to measure the quality of the outreach, make  improvements, and plan future events. EEOC senior regional officials are  held responsible for conducting a specific number of these events and are  evaluated on achieving ratings of \u201chighly successful\u201d or above, as well as  on the percentage of attendees who complete evaluations.", "In contrast, free outreach is evaluated on whether it reaches a mix of  audiences and promotes agency priorities. EEOC sets nationwide goals for  the number of free outreach events conducted in conjunction with some of  its national initiatives. It monitors progress toward these goals by using  data collected on the number of attendees, type of event, audience  characteristics, and topics covered at each event. EEOC also uses its data  to evaluate whether each field office\u2019s annual outreach plans strike a  balance between employers and employees\u2014a balance that officials told  us is a priority for the agency. Unlike fee-based outreach, EEOC does not  evaluate its free outreach on its level of quality.

Although EEOC monitors the amount of outreach it  provides, it recently stopped using this information to measure the extent  to which its outreach efforts helped to achieve its agencywide measures,  after determining it could not do so accurately. However, in 2002, GAO  found that while it is difficult to measure outcomes, it is possible to tie  intermediate efforts, such as the number of events and attendees, to  outcomes using methods such as a logic model.

While the model  predicts the likelihood of discrimination, OFCCP does not make an actual  determination of discrimination until further review.", "OFCCP officials said that they began using the Westat model in FY 2004,  but have not yet assessed how effectively the model predicts systemic  discrimination and targets appropriate contractors for review. While  OFCCP reported that it originally expected to evaluate the model in 2007,  officials told us that they have not done so due to limited resources.  Officials indicated that they now plan to do this later in FY 2008, when  compliance evaluations from the 2 prior years are completed and  sufficient and appropriate staff resources are anticipated. OFCCP officials  indicated that the evaluation of the Westat model will incorporate lessons  learned from evaluating a prior model used to help select contractors for  review: the Equal Opportunity Survey. During the evaluation of that model,  OFCCP encountered unreliable data from some of the respondents and  low response rates, and did not verify contractors who claimed that the  agency did not have jurisdiction over them. According to OFCCP officials,  the agency subsequently addressed some of these challenges. For  example, OFCCP officials said that the reliability of the data has  significantly improved and that an initiative to identify establishments with  federal contracts\u2014known as Contracts First\u2014has resulted in a more  comprehensive list of establishments that fall under its jurisdiction.", "However, because OFCCP has not yet developed evaluation plans for the  Westat model, it is unclear whether low response rates will remain an  issue and, if so, how this will be addressed.

OFCCP\u2019s implementing regulations require that contractors\u2019 affirmative  action programs identify problem areas. Therefore, contractors must  perform in-depth analyses of their employment processes, including their  compensation systems, to identify any disparities for women and  minorities. However, OFCCP does not always review compliance with the  compensation self-evaluation requirement for the contractors selected for  a compliance evaluation. Officials in one regional office we visited told us  that, during the desk audit, they review whether the contractor\u2019s  affirmative action program contains a general narrative statement that a  self-evaluation was conducted. However, the other regional office we  visited did not perform this review. Central office officials expressed little  concern over this inconsistency, noting that the compensation self- evaluation aspect of contractors\u2019 affirmative action programs during desk  audits was not critical, because the desk audit would identify problem  areas with or without the contractor\u2019s affirmative action program.", "Inconsistent reviews of self-evaluation requirements may be due, in part,  to the fact that OFCCP\u2019s guidance for conducting these reviews is  contained in different source documents without clear cross-references or  links to each other. Specifically, OFCCP\u2019s compliance manual\u2014which is  posted to OFCCP\u2019s Web site and was last updated in 1998\u2014does not  explicitly direct OFCCP investigators to review whether contractors have  satisfied the self-evaluation requirement, and does not contain specific  procedures for OFCCP investigators to follow when examining a  contractor\u2019s compensation self-evaluation. Since 1998, OFCCP has issued  additional notices that have superseded the manual, one of which, issued  in 2006, contains voluntary guidelines for contractors to follow when  conducting their compensation self-evaluation. As a result, to ascertain  current policy, investigators and federal contractors have to check  multiple information sources. OFCCP\u2019s Web site includes references and  hyperlinks to some recently issued guidance on other issues, but has no  linkages to the voluntary self-evaluation guidelines.", "Even when OFCCP discovers through a compliance evaluation that the  contractor did not perform the required self-evaluation, OFCCP\u2019s  compliance evaluation database records this violation as a general  recordkeeping violation rather than a specific violation of the self- evaluation requirement, according to OFCCP officials. OFCCP officials  stated, however, that while the database lacks a specific code, the  underlying information is available in case files.

While OFCCP\u2019s compliance evaluation database  captures detailed data on all types of discrimination, including gender pay,  OFCCP does not use the data to monitor its performance regarding gender  pay or any other type of discrimination.", "OFCCP does conduct internal monitoring beyond its agency performance  indicators, but not with respect to gender pay enforcement. OFCCP has  stated that compensation discrimination\u2014while not an agency  performance indicator\u2014is a national priority; thus, OFCCP has  established performance standards for each of its senior regional officials  to evaluate how well each region develops systemic compensation cases.  However, these standards pertain to pay discrimination overall without  specifying whether it is based on gender, race, or some other basis.  OFCCP officials also said that they use a number of sources, such as  detailed weekly and quarterly reports, along with monthly phone calls, to  monitor how well regional offices carry out specific enforcement cases;  but this information is not structured to track trends, assess performance  outcomes, or prioritize limited agency resources by specific type of  discrimination. In general, OFCCP senior officials said they do not see the  benefit of using the data already collected to internally monitor trends in  gender pay enforcement\u2014or any other subset of the performance  indicators. However, without this type of monitoring, OFCCP may have  difficulty determining how best to prioritize its resources among the  different types of discrimination it addresses.", "Even if OFCCP chose to monitor gender pay enforcement, questionable  data reliability would undermine OFCCP\u2019s ability to assess how well its  overall enforcement efforts were working. While officials said that the  reliability of OFCCP\u2019s enforcement data has improved significantly since  FY 2005, problems still exist with erroneous, inconsistent, or missing data.  For example, using OFCCP\u2019s data, we were unable to determine the  correct number of gender pay cases that OFCCP handled over the 8-year  period of our review. In addition, in testing of OFCCP\u2019s data, we found  incorrect violation codes, inconsistent case closure dates entered, and  conciliation or financial agreements dates entered but corresponding  violations missing. While OFCCP officials said they check the data  accuracy of some compliance evaluations entered into the data system and  verify the accuracy of contractor data submitted at regular intervals,  OFCCP officials acknowledged a lack of standardized data entry  instructions and adequate internal controls to screen for data problems.

Most of  OFCCP\u2019s technical assistance efforts are designed to help federal  contractors meet their affirmative action requirements or understand  OFCCP\u2019s recent policy changes, including two changes involving gender  pay. For example, OFCCP issued new guidance in 2006 describing how it  will examine contractors\u2019 compensation practices by race and gender  during audits. Prior to and during the time these changes were  implemented, OFCCP officials provided technical assistance on how the  new policies would affect contractors.", "With respect to performance of its outreach efforts, OFCCP monitors the  number of outreach and technical assistance efforts. For example, OFCCP  has regional and national goals for the number of outreach events  conducted. Regional offices submit weekly reports to the central office,  which generally include the date, type, and location of outreach events,  but these reports do not always indicate the issue discussed at these  events, nor do they include the number of attendees. OFCCP uses this  information to generate quarterly and annual reports measuring its  progress toward its outreach targets. OFCCP also tracks the topics of e- mail and telephone inquiries, which it uses to develop the Frequently  Asked Questions section of its Web site, and requests feedback from  participants in its Web-based seminars.", "However, OFCCP\u2019s approach to measuring and monitoring the  performance of its outreach efforts is less systematic than EEOC\u2019s. Like  EEOC, OFCCP has no agencywide performance measures for outreach  and evaluates senior regional officials\u2019 performance based on the outreach  and technical assistance they provide. Conversely, unlike EEOC, OFCCP  has no specific targets related to the quality of outreach that senior  officials are required to meet. In addition, OFCCP is less systematic than  EEOC in collecting and reporting feedback on the quality of its outreach.  Officials told us that contractors and industry groups sometimes contact  OFCCP to provide informal feedback on outreach, and representatives of  several industry groups we spoke with said that OFCCP\u2019s outreach  generally meets their needs. Nonetheless, the weekly reports from the  regional offices we reviewed included a few favorable comments from  audience members rather than comprehensive feedback from all  attendees, making it difficult to objectively determine the audience\u2019s  overall assessment of the outreach. OFCCP officials said that these  informal methods of collecting and reporting feedback are sufficient.  However, by not systematically collecting and tracking objective feedback  from recipients, OFCCP has no reliable means of measuring the quality of  its outreach or using this information to assess the impact of its outreach  and improve future efforts.", "In addition to not knowing whether its outreach is effective, OFCCP does  not know how much it is spending on outreach. Officials estimate about 30  percent of the budget is spent on outreach. However, OFCCP officials we  spoke with did not know exactly how much was spent on outreach and  technical assistance, and they could not provide details on how these  funds are used.

This pay gap  underscores the importance of the federal government\u2019s role of enforcing  anti-discrimination laws and raising awareness of legal requirements  through outreach. While both EEOC and OFCCP have appropriately set  broad goals for enforcing all types of discrimination, limited monitoring of  specific enforcement efforts, such as gender pay, relative to other  areas,diminishes EEOC\u2019s and OFCCP\u2019s ability to pinpoint relative  workload trends, effective and ineffective strategies, and contributions to  performance goals. In turn, these agencies are ultimately less able to strike  an effective balance in allocating increasingly limited resources to address  overall discrimination issues. A robust performance monitoring effort  requires reliable enforcement data to obtain a complete and accurate  picture of how well anti-discrimination laws are being enforced, but the  absence of effective internal controls has undermined the reliability of  OFCCP\u2019s data.

However, until OFCCP evaluates the mathematical model used to help  target contractors, it cannot know how effectively it is using its limited  resources, or whether it is missing opportunities to apply a more effective  model.
