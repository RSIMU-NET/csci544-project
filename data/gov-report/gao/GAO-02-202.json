The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) slowed the implementation of scheduled M+C payment reforms and established a new-entry bonus payment in areas where M+C plans were not being offered. More recently, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) increased M+C payments on March 1, 2001. For the typical M+C plan, Medicare monthly, per enrollee payments increased by an average of $16 per member per month (PMPM), although the increase was much higher for some plans and lower for others. As a result of BIPA, aggregate M+C payments in 2001 are estimated to have increased by nearly $1 billion.", "When BIPA was enacted, M+C contracts for the 2001 benefit year had already been approved and the benefit package established for each plan. Therefore, the legislation required MCOs to submit a revised contract proposal for each plan that explained how the payment increase would be used. BIPA permitted three basic uses for the higher payment. MCOs could (1) improve their health plans\u2019 benefit packages, (2) set aside money for future years in a benefit stabilization fund, or (3) stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers.", "To assist in further congressional deliberations on M+C participation and payment issues, you asked us to examine (1) how MCOs used the additional money authorized by BIPA in 2001 and (2) the extent to which the availability of M+C plans changed after BIPA. To conduct our study, we analyzed data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, and interviewed agency officials responsible for implementing BIPA\u2019s M+C payment provisions. We reviewed all MCOs\u2019 initial (pre-BIPA) and revised (post- BIPA) 2001 contract proposals, which contained detailed information on their health plans\u2019 costs and covered benefits.

BBA also modified the method used to set payment rates, both to encourage MCOs to serve new geographic areas and to pay them more appropriately for the beneficiaries they enrolled. Since the first of BBA\u2019s payment reforms were implemented, MCOs have terminated some of their Medicare contracts and reduced the geographic areas served under other contracts. As a result, many beneficiaries previously enrolled in M+C plans have had to switch plans or return to the FFS program. In 1999, and again in 2000, Congress passed legislation that increased payment rates in an effort to make participation in the M+C program more attractive for MCOs.", "As of September 2001, about 5.6 million people\u2014or approximately 14 percent of Medicare\u2019s 40 million beneficiaries\u2014were enrolled in M+C plans.

The beneficiary\u2019s demographic characteristics and an indicator of his or her health status also affect the monthly payment. These adjustments are made to the county rate so that the payment amount better reflects the expected health care costs of the specific beneficiary.", "Benefit packages\u2014in terms of premiums, required cost sharing, and covered services\u2014vary among M+C plans. All plans must cover the services available in the FFS program, with the exception of Medicare\u2019s hospice benefit. MCOs may include additional benefits in their health plans, such as coverage for routine physical examinations and outpatient prescription drugs. Every July, as part of the annual contracting process, MCOs must estimate how much it will cost them to provide Medicare- covered benefits during the next calendar year. These estimated costs, which may include the organization\u2019s normal profits, are supposed to reflect the premiums that the MCOs would charge to commercial and other customers, adjusted to reflect differences in Medicare\u2019s covered benefits and beneficiaries\u2019 expected use of services. For each M+C plan they intend to offer, MCOs submit a document, known as an adjusted community rate proposal (ACRP), that contains detailed estimates of the plan\u2019s expected costs and revenues associated with providing covered benefits, and a description of the plan benefit package. CMS reviews each ACRP and compares the estimated costs to the plan\u2019s projected Medicare revenues. If the estimated costs are less than the projected Medicare revenues, the MCO must either use the difference to cover additional benefits or contribute to a benefit stabilization fund that it can draw on to augment the plan\u2019s revenues in future years.

These county payment rates\u2014reflecting the underlying pattern of FFS spending\u2014ranged from $221 to $767 PMPM in 1997. This variation in payment rates may have contributed, along with many other factors, to the uneven availability of Medicare managed care options across the country. Our work and research by others has found that the methodology used to adjust payments for the expected service use of enrolled beneficiaries did not adequately reflect the above average health status and below average expected health costs of typical M+C enrollees. Consequently, Medicare paid MCOs substantially more than it likely would have spent if beneficiaries enrolled in M+C plans had instead received services in the FFS program.", "Beginning in 1998, BBA substantially modified the method used to set county payment rates for M+C plans. Some of the modifications were designed to reduce excess payments, while others were designed for other purposes\u2014such as increasing program participation of MCOs in geographic areas that historically had low payment rates. Specifically, the law required that each county\u2019s payment rate equal the highest of three rates: a minimum amount, or \u201cfloor\u201d (set at $367 in 1998 and increased each year); a minimum increase (2 percent) over the previous year\u2019s payment rate; or a blend of historical FFS spending in a county and national average costs adjusted for local price levels. BBA required, for five years, that the annual payment rate updates to the floor and blend rates be lower than the increases in national FFS per capita spending.

CMS expects that an additional 536,000 beneficiaries will be affected by withdrawals that will occur at the end of 2001. Most of the affected beneficiaries live in areas where other M+C plans are available, but approximately 38,000 beneficiaries will no longer have access to a M+C plan and will have to return to the FFS program.", "Managed care industry representatives have attributed the withdrawals to BBA\u2019s payment reforms and new administrative requirements for MCOs.

The law also affected payment rates by modifying implementation of certain BBA payment reforms. In December 2000, Congress passed BIPA, which increased payment rates in all counties in March 2001. Before BIPA took effect, the floor rate was $415 PMPM in 2001. BIPA created a new rate category for counties located in metropolitan areas of at least 250,000 people and established $525 as the floor rate for those counties in 2001; for all other counties, the law increased the floor rate to $475. BIPA also mandated that 2001 county payment rates exceed 2000 rates by at least 3 percent, a 1 percentage point increase in the minimum annual update specified in BBA. The increases in county rates that resulted from these changes ranged from about $5 to $110 PMPM (or 1 to 27 percent).

The amount of the increase depended on the specific counties each plan served and its expected enrollment in each county. Half of the M+C plans received overall payment rate increases of less than $10 PMPM, while the other half received $10 PMPM or more. BIPA provided that MCOs could use the additional money for each plan toward any combination of the following options: Improve the benefit package by   Reducing beneficiary premiums,   Reducing beneficiary cost sharing,   Adding benefits,   Enhancing benefits;   Contribute to a benefit stabilization fund; or   Stabilize or enhance beneficiary access to providers.", "BIPA required MCOs to submit revised contract proposals to cover that portion of the 2001 contract year\u2014March through December\u2014when the increased payment rates would be in effect and explain how they would use the additional money.
