For industrial base information, DOD periodically conducts studies of specific industry sectors using industrial base questionnaires. These studies sometimes address the level of foreign participation in a particular industry sector.", "The United States currently conducts defense trade with 21 countries under the terms of reciprocal defense procurement memoranda of understanding (MOU). These agreements were designed in the late 1970s to promote rationalization, standardization, and interoperability of defense equipment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).Consistent with relevant laws and regulations, these MOUs seek to eliminate the application of nations\u2019 buy-national laws and tariffs relating to defense procurements. DOD\u2019s Office of Defense Procurement (Foreign Contracting) monitors the level of two-way defense procurement activity under MOUs by preparing summaries on the annual defense trade procurement balances between the United States and the 21 countries. The Office uses these summaries internally and exchanges the data with MOU countries that give the United States their defense procurement statistics. DOD has exchanged data with six MOU countries: Finland, Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom. DOD does not compare the other countries\u2019 defense trade information with its own because it does not know how the other countries define and collect their defense trade information.", "As part of its efforts to monitor foreign procurements, DOD established in 1982 a reporting requirement to identify certain subcontracts performed outside the United States. In the fiscal year 1993 defense authorization legislation, Congress required any firm performing a DOD contract exceeding $10 million, or submitting a bid or proposal for such a contract, to notify DOD in advance if (1) the firm or any of its first-tier subcontractors intends to perform work exceeding $500,000 on that contract outside the United States and Canada and (2) such work could be performed inside the United States or Canada. This information must be made available for preparing required national defense technology and industrial base assessments. DOD regulations also require prime contractors to submit notification of contracts exceeding $500,000 when any part of the contract that exceeds $25,000 will be performed outside the United States, unless a foreign place of performance (1) is the principal place of performance and (2) is in the firm\u2019s offer. Contracts for commercial items or identified exceptions need not be reported. First-tier subcontractors awarded subcontracts in excess of $100,000 are also subject to the reporting requirement.", "Prime contractors and first-tier subcontractors are required on a quarterly basis to submit information such as the type of supply or service provided, the principal place of subcontract performance, and the dollar value of the transaction.

As shown in figure 2, the value of DOD prime contracts performed outside the United States declined from about $12.5 billion to about $6.9 billion, while the total value of DOD prime contract awards also declined from about $197 billion to $119 billion.

Contractors gave various reasons for not filing the DD 2139 forms. Some said they were unaware of the requirement to report foreign subcontract awards; others had apparently misinterpreted the law and regulation. A few of them said that the regulation was not clear and that a better understanding of the intent of the law and regulation would help them determine if they needed to report. Examples of their rationale for not filing included the following:", "Two contractors stated that Defense Acquisition Circular 91-5 rescinded the DD 2139 form. However, the circular deleted only the form and not the reporting requirement. Also, a subsequent circular reinstated the DD 2139 form.", "One contractor interpreted the dollar thresholds in the reporting requirement as applying only to the foreign subcontracts, not to the value of the prime contract. This contractor did not file a DD 2139 form, even though the value of the prime contract was above the $500,000 threshold, because the foreign subcontract was below this amount. The regulation required a contractor to report foreign subcontracts greater than $25,000 for prime contracts exceeding $500,000.", "One contractor awarded a foreign subcontract as part of a co-production program with Germany. The contractor cited the existence of an MOU between the United States and Germany for a specific program as the justification for not filing a DD 2139 form.

According to the contractor, no U.S. or Canadian firm was licensed to produce it, although the U.S. company had the manufacturing capability to produce this item. Given this circumstance, a company official said that he believed that the company did not have to report this subcontract. The official, however, expressed uncertainty about the reporting requirement and later indicated that the company would report this subcontract to the Office of Foreign Contracting.", "We also identified 12 subcontracts, which were valued at almost $67 million, that were not reported to the Office because of possible weaknesses in the procedures used to collect foreign subcontract data. First, contracts should include the foreign subcontract reporting requirement to ensure that contractors report their foreign subcontracts to the Office. We found one contractor that did not file the DD 2139 forms for four subcontracts because the reporting requirement was erroneously omitted from the prime contract. Second, we found three companies that did not file DD 2139 forms for eight subcontracts because, consistent with the reporting requirement, this information was reported in their initial offers and was submitted either to the contracting officer or to the prime contractor. However, the information was not forwarded to the Office by the contracting officers as stipulated by the regulation. The contracting officers we spoke with were not aware they were required to send this information to the Office of Foreign Contracting for inclusion in the  DD 2139 database.", "Although the law requires advance notification of contract performance outside the United States, we spoke with several contractors that regularly submitted DD 2139 information but used different criteria for identifying a foreign subcontractor. The various criteria included (1) no U.S. taxpayer identification number, (2) incorporation outside the United States, (3) foreign ownership, (4) place of contract performance, and (5) requirement of an export license. Sometimes this caused contractors to report transactions differently, which would create inconsistent data. For example, one contractor said it would report subcontracts awarded to a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company because the subsidiary would be manufacturing overseas. However, another contractor said it would not report a subcontract awarded to a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company because the subsidiary is domestically owned. Contractors also lack clear guidance about whether deobligations of foreign subcontracts should be reported. Currently, the Office of Foreign Contracting enters any subcontract deobligations voluntarily reported by contractors into its database, but there is no requirement that contractors report these deobligations. As such, deobligations are being reported inconsistently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Database Management Minimize Usefulness of the Foreign Subcontract Data", "paragraphs": ["The DD 2139 database lacks documentation defining the database\u2019s structure, critical data fields, and procedures for data entry, all of which makes the data highly questionable.

As a result, determining the dollar value of these subcontracts can lead to varying values, depending on the method used to query the database. We queried the database using two different methods and obtained a difference of $15.3 million in the total dollar value of foreign subcontracts in fiscal year 1997 and a difference of $2.8 billion for fiscal year 1990 to 1997.", "The current DD 2139 database structure of 30 data fields is based on a November 1985 version of the DD 2139 form (Subcontract Report of Foreign Purchases). However, some of the data no longer need to be reported. For example, the database contains six data fields of dollar values, but only two of the six fields are needed to calculate the value of foreign subcontracts awarded. According to an agency official, the remaining four data fields are irrelevant. The DD 2139 database also contains two fields related to offsets, but contractors are no longer required to submit this information. The Office of Foreign Contracting, however, continues to enter into its database offset information when it is voluntarily provided by contractors.", "The lack of standards and procedures for data entry has caused numerous data entry errors that compromise the database\u2019s usefulness.

Our review, however, demonstrated that similar data are being collected by other offices. Further, our recommendation is in accordance with DOD\u2019s policy that states the Department will regularly review and evaluate opportunities for improvements to increase the usefulness of information and reduce the cost of information collection activities for both DOD and contractors. We have modified our recommendation to clarify that we are referring to the existing data collection requirement.", "DOD also stated that the reporting requirement is clear from the language in the relevant Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause.", "However, the reporting requirement has been interpreted differently by contractor and government officials. The varying interpretations indicate a lack of understanding about what subcontracts should be reported, which detracts from the consistency of information actually contained in the database.", "DOD did not fully concur with our second recommendation to improve the collection and management of foreign subcontract data. Our findings relating to poor database management arose from our attempts to use the database to determine the total value of DOD\u2019s foreign subcontract awards. We could not determine the total value from the database. First, some entries were coded so as not to be counted in the totals. Second, subcontracts for National Aeronautics and Space Administration procurements and for direct commercial sales, which should not be included in this database, were. Third, subcontracts performed in the United States, which should not be included in this database, were. Finally, in our attempt to match entries from the DD 2139 database with the subset of information on foreign subcontracts found in the Defense Contract Management District International database, we found subcontracts that should have been in the DD 2139 database but were not. Taken together, these findings represent a significant degradation of the value of the information. If DOD plans to use the data, and a recent directive by the Under Secretary suggests that it will become more important, the integrity of the data needs to be enhanced.", "Our analysis showed that these problems are directly attributable to the lack of controls and procedures for periodically verifying compliance with the reporting requirement and the lack of procedures for managing and using the database. DOD stated that it already maintains the most complete database on foreign subcontracting and that periodically verifying compliance would be too costly. Having the most complete database does not address the value of the data contained in it. In addition, periodically verifying compliance with the reporting requirement could be accomplished as part of contracting officers\u2019 routine oversight responsibilities.", "DOD agreed that there are no written procedures for managing and using the DD 2139 database, but stated that none are needed.

We examined the amounts DOD purchased at the prime contractor level by country and by item. We performed a similar assessment of DOD\u2019s data on foreign subcontract awards. However, we did not include a trend analysis of DOD\u2019s foreign subcontract procurements because of the data weaknesses described in this report. In addition, we reviewed DOD\u2019s annual reports to Congress on purchases from foreign entities for fiscal year 1995 to 1997 and the laws and regulations requiring advance notification of contract performance outside the United States.

We also examined DOD\u2019s policy and the chronology of changes to regulations regarding this reporting requirement.", "To determine the completeness of DOD data collection efforts, we tried to compare the DD 2139 database to other government and commercial databases. We were unable to use many of the sources we identified because they did not contain fields that could be readily compared to the DD 2139 database. We obtained foreign subcontract data from the Defense Contract Management District International (DCMDI) and the Defense Contract Management Command\u2019s (DCMC) customs team. Each of these data sources contained similar information to the DD 2139 database, including prime and subcontract numbers, transaction values, and subcontractor names. However, the DCMC import data were based on actual deliveries and not contract awards, unlike the DD 2139 and DCMDI data. Given the time difference between contract award and delivery data, we concentrated on matching the DD 2139 database with the DCMDI database.", "DCMDI\u2019s database is used internally to track foreign subcontracts administered by the district\u2019s field offices and is not representative of the universe of foreign subcontracts. We did not perform a reliability assessment of the DCMDI database because we only used it to identify possible unreported foreign subcontracts that we could trace back to original source documentation.", "To compare the two databases, we performed an automated and manual match of fiscal year 1997 DCMDI data with multiple years of the DD 2139 data to verify data entries. We sampled data records from the DCMDI database, which led us to examine 49 foreign subcontracts. We then eliminated all National Aeronautics and Space Administration and fuel and subsistence contracts because these types of subcontracts are excluded from the foreign subcontract reporting requirement. By comparing the two data sets, we found 7 subcontracts that matched and 42 subcontracts that did not appear in the DD 2139 database. For the 42 subcontracts, we obtained contractual documentation from the DCMC field offices and contractors to verify information about the prime contracts and subcontracts and to ensure that the contracts contained the foreign subcontract reporting requirement clause. We interviewed the contractors to determine whether they reported the foreign subcontracts to the Office of Foreign Contracting and discussed reasons for not reporting.", "We also interviewed officials from several defense companies, DCMC representative offices, and program offices. We discussed with company officials their processes for tracking foreign subcontracts and compliance with the DD 2139 reporting requirement.

We are not proposing the establishment of a new data collection requirement. Instead, we are recommending that the current data collection efforts be enhanced to satisfy the information needs of the offices working on defense trade and industrial base issues. Such action would be in compliance with DOD policy to regularly review and evaluate opportunities for improvements to increase the usefulness of information and reduce the cost of information collection activities for both DOD and contractors. If the collection of foreign subcontracting award data (DD 2139) were improved, the data could meet multiple information needs. To avoid further misunderstanding, we have clarified the wording of our recommendation. 2. Prior to our review, the Office of Industrial Capabilities and Assessments was unaware of the data collection efforts of the Office of Foreign Contracting. The Office of Industrial Capabilities and Assessments has an industrial base questionnaire that, in part, collects information on subcontractors similar to the information collected by the Office of Foreign Contracting. The two offices would benefit from coordinating with each other to avoid some duplication of effort and alleviate burdening industry for similar information. According to DOD policy, information should be collected in a nonduplicative and cost-effective manner. Moreover, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology recently initiated reviews of the globalization of the defense industrial base and its effects on national security. Information on suppliers located outside the United States, particularly those at lower tiers, such as that collected by the Office of Foreign Contracting, or owned by foreign entities, will be instrumental in evaluating the extent and effects of this globalization. 3. The Office of Foreign Contracting has no mechanism for systematically verifying contractor compliance with the foreign subcontract reporting requirement. Unless some verification is performed, DOD has no assurance of the accuracy of the total value of foreign subcontracts awards. We recognize that the Office of Foreign Contracting has limited resources for performing an extensive verification of contractor compliance. To assist in the verification process, some follow-up could be performed by contracting officers because defense companies are required to submit certain DD 2139 information to them. However, the contracting officers that we spoke with were often unaware of this reporting requirement and, therefore, would need to be educated about the requirement so that they could periodically check contractor compliance when performing routine oversight functions such as certifying duty-free entry of imported items.", "In 1989 we reported that the Office of Foreign Contracting sent a letter to the top 100 prime contractors informing them of the foreign subcontract reporting requirement and found that about one-third had reported. The Office of Foreign Contacting has not performed another survey of defense companies since then. Furthermore, officials from defense companies told us that the Office of Foreign Contracting had not contacted them to verify the data they had submitted. Periodic follow-up with the defense companies would help ensure that erroneous information, such as subcontract awards for nondefense contracts, would not be submitted. 4. For awarded contracts, the reporting requirement provides instructions on when and how contractors are to report subcontract performance outside the United States to the Office of Foreign Contracting. However, for offers exceeding $10 million, if the company is aware at the time its offer is submitted that it or its first-tier subcontractor intends to perform any part of the contract that exceeds $500,000 outside the United States and Canada, and if that part could be performed inside the United States or Canada, DD 2139 information must be submitted with the offer to the contracting officer. The regulation (Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 225.7202) then stipulates that contracting officers are to forward a copy of reports submitted by successful offerors to the Office of Foreign Contracting. However, the contracting officers we spoke with were not aware that the regulation instructed them to forward any information to the Office of Foreign Contracting and had never provided the Office with such information. Consequently, information provided in firms\u2019 offers is not being fully captured by the Office\u2019s database. 5. Poor database management practices undermine the reliability of DOD\u2019s foreign subcontract data. The Office of Foreign Contracting lacks appropriate written standards for entering and verifying data. Such standards are necessary to ensure the reliability and integrity of the data. Our example of a programming error that resulted in 13 miscoded data entries merely illustrates the problems that can arise when no system controls are in place. DOD\u2019s calculation of an error rate based on these 13 entries is erroneous and misleading. It is erroneous because statistical inferences such as error rates must be based on a random statistical sample assessed against defined parameters such as written procedures for data entry, verification, or database queries. Without such documentation, we were unable to assess data reliability fully. It is also misleading because, as detailed in our report, we found numerous other examples of problems with the DD 2139 database that undermine its credibility. Besides the programming errors, we found data entry errors such as the inclusion of National Aeronautics and Space Administration subcontracts, direct commercial sales subcontracts, and U.S. subcontract awards. Other problems included evidence of noncompliance with the reporting requirement and inconsistent treatment of data. These problems support the need for written standards explaining the DD 2139 database\u2019s structure, data fields, and procedures for data entry and verification."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of General Counsel, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Raymond J.
