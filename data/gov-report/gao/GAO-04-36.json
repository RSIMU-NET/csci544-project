OSC took an average of more than six months to process a whistleblower disclosure case. Over the seven-year period, 34 percent of the prohibited personnel practices cases were backlogged as were 96 percent of the whistleblower disclosure cases. In an attempt to address workload issues, in 2001 OSC streamlined processes and hired additional staff. OSC data indicate that the merger of the agency's investigators and attorneys into a single unit increased the average number of cases processed per individual from June 2001 to June 2002. A case priority processing system for prohibited personnel practices and whistleblower disclosure cases allowed OSC to process more important cases more expeditiously, according to OSC. OSC officials told us that the primary reason the agency has not been more successful in meeting the statutory time limits for its cases, particularly those involving whistleblower disclosure, is lack of an adequate number of staff. Our analysis of OSC data indicates, however, that even with increased staffing, the agency was not able to process a significantly larger number of cases within the time limits. OSC noted that staff turnover and the need to train new staff lowered its productivity. Officials also noted the difficulty in meeting the 15-day limit for processing whistleblower disclosure cases, but have not proposed an alternative time limit. In external documents to Congress, OSC has discussed its case processing and backlog difficulties, but has not developed a comprehensive strategy for dealing with them. Presenting such a strategy would provide Congress with information that it needs for oversight and resource allocation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Office of Special Counsel\u2019s (OSC) primary mission is to protect  federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.

If OSC finds reasonable grounds for believing that a violation  occurred, OSC can seek corrective action, disciplinary action, or both  through negotiation with the agency involved.  If an agreement cannot be  reached, OSC can file a petition (for corrective action) or a complaint  (seeking disciplinary action) with the Merit Systems Protection Board  (MSPB).

Under this approach, cases are  investigated and analyzed based on the category to which they have been  assigned.  Category 1 prohibited personnel practices cases consist of the  most serious personnel actions, involving employees who are threatened  with removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, geographic  reassignments, and reductions in grade.  Category 2 cases are less severe,  including cases where suspensions are 14 days or fewer, performance  appraisal ratings are below \u201cfully successful,\u201d and denials of within-pay  grade increases are being challenged.  Category 3 cases involve the least  serious adverse personnel actions, such as lower performance ratings that  are still \u201cfully successful,\u201d non-geographical reassignments or details,  failure to promote, and reprimands.  For category 3 cases, investigators  may use streamlined procedures that may require less time and staff  resources to complete.", "In addition, within each of these categories, prohibited personnel practices  cases may be designated \u201cpriority\u201d\u2014meaning they will receive the most  prompt attention\u2014based on the following factors:  the urgency of the need  for redress, the strength of the evidence supporting a violation, or the  public interest in prompt resolution of the case.  For instance, priority  cases within category 1 must either (1) meet OSC\u2019s criteria for seeking a  stay of the personnel action or already have a stay in effect, or (2) be a case  in which OSC believes, on the basis of the evidence, that there is a  substantial likelihood that the complaint is meritorious and in which OSC  will seek corrective or disciplinary action.  Within each category,  whistleblower reprisal complaints are given top priority.", "Since the implementation of this system for prohibited personnel practices,  OSC has been able to process priority cases faster than the non-priority  cases.  OSC\u2019s statistics show that from January 1, 2002, through September  30, 2002, OSC processed category 1 priority cases 17 percent faster than  non-priority cases, category 2 priority cases 30 percent faster, and category  3 priority cases 50 percent faster.  From October 1, 2002, through July 31,  2003, similar results were reported for category 1 and 3 cases.  The number  of category 2 priority cases during this period was too small for a reliable  comparison with non-priority cases.", "OSC also has procedures to prioritize whistleblower disclosures.  Although  these procedures have been in use since 2002, an agency official indicated  that they have not been adopted through a policy directive.  Under the  priority system, all cases are reviewed by the unit head, who makes an  initial assessment of whether the cases are likely to meet the \u201csubstantial  likelihood\u201d determination and places the cases in one of three priority  categories.  Priority 1 cases are those that would likely meet the  determination and would be referred to the agency head for investigation.   Priority 1 cases are further categorized into two subcategories.   Subcategory A cases deal with disclosures of substantial and specific  dangers to public health and safety, while subcategory B cases are those  dealing with non health and safety disclosures.  Priority 2 cases are those  where further review may be appropriate and would be referred to the  agency\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.  These cases do not include health  and safety allegations.  Priority 3 cases are those that are not likely to meet  the substantial likelihood determination and, therefore, likely to be closed.   OSC further categorizes these disclosures into subcategory A for those that  involve disclosures of public health and safety and subcategory B for all  other disclosures.  According to OSC, in fiscal year 2002, on average,  priority 1A cases\u2014dealing with health and safety disclosures\u2014were  referred to agency heads 1.2 times faster than priority 1B cases, which deal  with other violations.  In fiscal year 2003, on average, OSC stated that  priority 1A disclosures were referred to agency heads 2.4 times faster than  priority 1B disclosures.", "Since 2000, OSC has been using an ADR program for a small number of  prohibited personnel practices cases, which has reduced the average  processing time for these cases and reduced case backlog slightly.  Through  ADR, OSC reported that it resolved 13 cases in fiscal year 2002 and 15 cases  in fiscal year 2003.  The number of backlogged cases in table 4 reflects the  resolution of these cases through ADR.  Similarly, OSC reported that cases  that went through ADR took 115 days in fiscal year 2002 and 122 days in  fiscal year 2003.  The data from table 2 on the processing time for  prohibited personnel practices cases reflect that a small percentage of  these cases was resolved through ADR.

From fiscal year 1991 to 1993, the number of  new cases increased nearly 36 percent.  Still, OSC data show that at the  beginning of fiscal year 1993, no prohibited personnel practices case was  more than 6 months old\u2014well within the 240-day limit.  The number of new  cases declined slightly between fiscal years 1994 and 1996.  During this  period (1991-1996) the number of full-time equivalent staff dropped from 90  to 86.  These data, however, cover a period before the seven-year period  that we examined.  Since 1994, OSC has had backlogged prohibited  personnel practices cases, and the number of such cases has fluctuated.", "OSC officials said budget for staff has not increased fast enough to allow  the agency to consistently meet the statutory time limits, especially for  whistleblower disclosure cases.   During fiscal years 2000 and 2001,  Congress authorized OSC to hire 15 additional staff, which brought its full- time equivalent staff to 106.  To decrease case processing times, most of the  new staff were added to the divisions responsible for investigating and  prosecuting cases.", "It does not appear that these staff and productivity increases after the  merger of attorneys and investigators into one division translated into the  processing of a significantly larger number of prohibited personnel  practices and whistleblower disclosure cases.  The total cases processed in  fiscal year 1997 was 2,385.  The figure dropped in each of fiscal years 1998,  1999, 2000, and 2001 before increasing slightly in fiscal year 2002 and  moderately in fiscal year 2003.  The number of whistleblower disclosure  cases processed dropped in both fiscal year 2001 (by about 13 percent) and  the following year (by about 16 percent), before rebounding with a 40  percent increase in fiscal year 2003.  But the number of such cases  processed that year was still slightly less than in fiscal year 1999 (401 cases  vs. 414).  The number of new prohibited personnel practices cases  processed declined from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000, with  small increases in each of the next three years.  But the number of cases  processed in fiscal year 2003 was about the same (1732 vs. 1695) as that in  fiscal year 1999.", "OSC officials offered several mitigating factors that they say limited the  agency\u2019s ability to process more cases despite increases in staff.  First,  agency data showed a high turnover in staff between 2000 and 2003, which  deprived the agency of institutional knowledge at a time when officials  were trying to train the new staff.  During this period, OSC hired 47 new  staff and had 37 departures\u2014all of whom were investigators or attorneys  involved in processing cases.  Second, officials indicated that new staff  need training and time to develop experience before they can become full  contributors to case processing efforts.  The ability of the staff to develop  requisite experience through on-the-job training was hindered by the high  turnover.", "Another contributing factor cited by OSC officials leading to the agency\u2019s  difficulty in processing prohibited personnel practices cases within  statutory time limits are the substantive and procedural processing  requirements imposed by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 and the  OSC Reauthorization Act of 1994.  The OSC reauthorization law added to  the time it could take the agency to process certain prohibited personnel  practices cases.  Before the law was enacted, if OSC decided there were no  reasonable grounds for believing such a violation occurred, the agency  could immediately issue a final letter notifying a complainant of the  termination of the investigation.  The reauthorization law, however,  requires OSC to send the complainant a status report of its proposed fact  findings and legal conclusions supporting this decision and give the  complainant 10 days to submit comments before OSC\u2019s decision becomes  final.", "The 1989 whistleblower law and the 1994 reauthorization law require more  information in the final letters OSC sends to complainants notifying them  of the termination of the prohibited personnel practice investigation.  Prior  to the 1989 law, OSC was simply required to notify the complainant of the  termination \u201cand the reasons therefore\u201d.  The 1989 law required additional  information in the notification letter, namely a summary of the relevant  facts, including the facts that support, and do not support, the  complainant\u2019s allegations.  In addition, the 1994 OSC reauthorization law  required that the notification letter address any comments submitted by the  complainant in response to OSC\u2019s proposal to terminate the investigation.   While the expanded letters were intended to be more \u201ccustomer friendly\u201d,  they are more time-consuming to write than the shorter letters that the  agency sent to complainants before the 1989 law was enacted.", "According to OSC, in the fall of 1993, the agency implemented new  procedures in response to congressional criticism about the breadth of the  agency\u2019s investigations and to be more consistent with the \u201cspirit\u201d of the  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.  These new procedures required  broader investigations in all cases and created additional internal  memoranda on each case.  As a result, investigations take longer, resulting  in the processing of fewer cases, and an increased backlog.  Before these  new procedures were implemented, OSC officials said, the agency achieved  higher productivity by limiting the duration of the investigation and the  subsequent explanation of the reasons for closure in cases where the  agency found no merit.", "The changes prompted by these statutes and congressional interest,  however, were implemented before the period that we examined.  Thus, it  is worth noting that for both whistleblower disclosure and prohibited  personnel practices cases, if OSC had been able to process as many cases  during each of the fiscal years from 1997 through 2003 as it did in its best  year for each type of case (1997 for prohibited personnel practices cases,  1999 for whistleblower disclosure cases), the backlog for both would have  been significantly lower by the end of fiscal 2003 than it was.  Other than  the increase in, and complexity of, whistleblower disclosure cases after  September 11, 2001, OSC did not inform us of any significant events during  the years for which we obtained data that would have prevented the agency  from achieving this goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meeting 15-day Limit for Whistleblower Disclosure Cases Is Difficult, But OSC Has Not Proposed an Alternative Time Limit", "paragraphs": ["According to OSC, in 1978, during congressional consideration of the Civil  Service Reform Act of 1978, senators drafting the legislation envisioned  that 15 to 20 full-time staff would be needed to process whistleblower  disclosure cases within 15 days.  OSC has never assigned more than five  staff to whistleblower disclosure cases and typically has assigned only two.   Given that OSC\u2019s total full-time staff has never exceeded more than 106 and  given the greater volume of prohibited personnel practices cases, assigning  several more staff to whistleblower disclosure cases would require the  agency to shift staff from one kind of case to the other.  OSC officials said  they have not shifted staff from what they consider their primary mission\u2014 prohibited personnel practices cases\u2014to whistleblower disclosure cases  because this would decrease timeliness for prohibited personnel practices  cases.", "OSC officials pointed out that no special counsel has believed that OSC  could meet the 15-day case processing time limit for whistleblower  disclosures and that cases have generally become more complex in recent  years.  OSC officials told us they were not aware of any proposal by the  agency to have the 15-day limit increased.", "Another reason that OSC officials cited for not meeting the 15-day time  limit is that it can be difficult to contact whistleblowers to discuss their  allegations and receive relevant documentation from them and from  agency officials within this short time frame.  In one case that was referred  by a congressional committee, for example, it became increasingly difficult  to conduct business during the day because the whistleblower preferred to  receive calls at night and would use only a commercial fax machine on  weekends to send supporting documentation.  In this case, delays in  submitting the evidence contributed to OSC missing the 15-day limit.", "More broadly, if OSC has a strategy for deploying any or all of the  additional staff it received in 2000 and 2001 on whistleblower disclosure  cases and a way of evaluating whether that strategy is working, the agency  has not shared it with us.  Having such a strategy could be important for  ensuring that the most serious whistleblower disclosure cases receive not  just the most prompt\u2014but also the most comprehensive\u2014attention.  If the  OSC 2000 data are any guide to the future, the majority of cases (96 percent  from fiscal years 1997-2003) will continue to be those that do not meet the  \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d standard.  If a quick determination can be made in  a large number of these cases that the standard is not met, it may be that  OSC should deploy more staff to this \u201cweeding out\u201d process.  Alternatively,  if it is not immediately clear in a significant number of these cases whether  the \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d standard can be met, then OSC might consider  devoting more staff to reviewing these cases.  Although OSC\u2019s description  of the cases priority system indicates that they can track pending and  closed whistleblower disclosure cases and use these data to review  workload distribution and cases processing efficiency, officials have not  indicated that they have been able to use these data to reduce the time  spent processing cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While OSC Reports to Congress and OMB Specify Some Reasons for Case Processing Difficulties, These Reports Have Not Proposed Solutions to Them", "paragraphs": ["In the last several years, OSC has issued a number of mandated reports and  correspondence to the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget  that discuss OSC\u2019s case processing difficulties and resulting backlog.  But  OSC has not specified proposed long-term solutions for them.  In its Annual  Report to Congress, OSC is required to report information on prohibited  personnel practices cases that are backlogged.  In the annual reports that  we reviewed, the agency did so and acknowledged that the backlog was a  problem.   For example, in its fiscal year 1999 report to Congress, OSC  disclosed that a significant backlog of cases was pending at the agency that  resulted in delays in resolving complaints.  The fiscal year 2002 report  noted that reducing the backlog is important because (1) Congress  imposed the 240-day limit for prohibited personnel practices cases in  response to widespread criticism concerning long delays in the processing  of complaints by OSC, and (2) a large backlog can prevent OSC staff from  quickly investigating and resolving more critical cases.  But none of the  annual reports has discussed specific actions that OSC expects to take and  how these actions would affect its ability to process cases\u2014either within  or outside statutory time limits\u2014and reduce the backlog or the actual  effects of actions the agency took in previous years.", "OSC requested seven additional staff in its fiscal year 2004 budget request  to the Congress, but did not discuss how the additional staff would be  deployed or the extent to which they would help the agency process cases  more quickly and reduce the backlog.  Nor did OSC provide the Congress  with an estimate of the number of staff required to solve these problems  and/or an analysis of other changes necessary to do so.", "In September 2003, the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee wrote  to OSC expressing concerns about the backlog of whistleblower disclosure  cases and requesting information on how OSC planned to address the  backlog.  In an October 2003 response, the Acting Special Counsel said OSC  has long struggled with how best to address the backlog of whistleblower  disclosure cases.  He cited past efforts, including assigning such cases to  attorneys from units that would not normally handle whistleblower  disclosure cases, which led to the resolution of some cases, but was not as  successful as the agency hoped.  He said he had assigned two more  investigators to assist with the whistleblower disclosure caseload.  But the  Acting Special Counsel did not specifically discuss what effect the  additional investigators would have on the agency\u2019s ability to meet the 15- day limit or to reduce the number of backlogged whistleblower disclosure  cases.", "Strategic workforce planning\u2014planning that focuses on developing long- term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization's  people aligned with human capital approaches that are clearly linked to  achieving programmatic goals\u2014is an essential element of a modern,  effective human capital management system.  OSC\u2019s fiscal year 2004 annual  performance plan includes workforce strategy as one of six strategic goals  and discusses strategies that the agency plans to take \u201cto maintain a highly  skilled, well-trained, customer-oriented workforce, and to deploy it most  effectively to carry out the agency\u2019s mission.\u201d  This plan discusses changes  in staff at the beginning of fiscal year 2001 due to attrition and the addition  of new staff, and the fact that experienced staff has been diverted from  their usual duties to mentor and help train new staff.  The agency has also  identified critical skills and developed data on employee attrition and  retirement.  However, the agency\u2019s planning to date lacks in long-term  solutions directly associated with improving case processing and reducing  case backlog.

In addition to the Privacy Act, the Whistleblower Protection  Act requires that the identity of any employee, former employee, or  applicant for employment who makes a whistleblower disclosure may not  be disclosed by OSC without such individual\u2019s consent unless OSC  determines that the disclosure of the individual\u2019s identity is necessary  because of an imminent danger to public health or safety or imminent  violation of any criminal law.", "Generally, unless permitted under one of the Privacy Act\u2019s exceptions, OSC  cannot disclose any of its records by any means to any person, or to  another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior  written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains.

As required by the Privacy Act, OSC has published a  descriptive listing of its routine uses in the Federal Register, 66 Fed. Reg.  36611 and 51095 (2001).  For example, OSC may provide information to the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about allegations of  discrimination and to the Merit Systems Protection Board when filing a  petition for disciplinary action.  In the event that OSC believes that  disclosure may be appropriate in a circumstance when it has not received a  written request or consent from a complainant or whistleblower, and  routine use or other Privacy Act condition of disclosure does not apply,  OSC will seek written authorization from the complainant or  whistleblower.", "Regardless of the permissibility of disclosure under the Privacy Act, OSC is  specifically prohibited by law from responding to inquiries concerning  work performance, ability, aptitude, general qualifications, character,  loyalty or suitability for any personnel action of any complainant who filed  a prohibited personnel practice allegation, unless (1) the complainant  consents in advance, or (2) an agency requires the information in order to  make a determination concerning the complainant\u2019s access to highly- sensitive national security information.
