HUD had previously revised its regulations to allow for the refinancing of FHA-insured projects. Assisted living facilities offer a combination of housing and personalized health care, including separate living units for residents, common areas, and assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing, and eating. According to HUD\u2019s Director of Insured Multifamily Housing Development, assisted living facilities under the nursing home program will generally be unsubsidized, market-rate projects serving the moderate- and upper-income elderly.", "FHA\u2019s terminated retirement service center program also served the upper-income elderly, providing unsubsidized rental housing that had more services and amenities, such as meals, than those available in the typical FHA-insured project for the elderly. HUD established this program administratively under section 221(d)(4) of the National Housing Act, which provides for multifamily rental housing for moderate-income families. The retirement service center program was not part of the nursing home program. Because retirement service center loans are included with other market-rate housing loans, HUD\u2019s data systems cannot readily identify retirement service center projects. According to HUD\u2019s July 12, 1995, report on retirement service centers, 85 retirement service center loans with original face amounts of $689 million were in force as of September 30, 1994.", "When a default occurs on an insured loan, a lender may assign the mortgage to HUD and receive payment from HUD for an insurance claim.

FHA is also required each year, under the Credit Reform Act of 1990, to estimate credit subsidies\u2014the net costs to the government of insuring new mortgages. The act requires that for credit instruments\u2014including mortgage insurance\u2014budget authority be provided for credit subsidies to cover the government\u2019s cost before such credit is extended.

At that time, the Congress believed that sponsors of for-profit nursing homes had difficulty in obtaining financing on reasonable terms. According to officials in the Policies and Procedures Division of HUD\u2019s Insured Multifamily Housing Development Office, lenders generally viewed nursing homes as risky ventures prior to the establishment of the Medicaid reimbursement program in 1965. The nursing home program was intended to overcome private lenders\u2019 reluctance to finance nursing homes by drawing on FHA\u2019s experience in credit enhancement programs to minimize the lenders\u2019 risk of financial losses. The passage of the Medicaid program in 1965 provided a more reliable income stream for nursing homes by reimbursing their costs.", "Since the program\u2019s inception, FHA has insured over 2,000 nursing home loans totaling about $5.1 billion. By comparison, over 16,000 skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities were in the United States as of March 1994. In addition, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reports that an estimated 32,000 licensed board and care homes are in the United States, some of which are assisted living facilities. Because assisted living facilities can be called by a variety of names, the exact number is difficult to determine; however, the Assisted Living Facilities Association of America represents about 12,000 facilities. These statistics indicate that a relatively small number of nursing homes operating in the United States today were financed with mortgage loans carrying FHA insurance. Nonetheless, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs and officials in HUD\u2019s Insured Multifamily Housing Development Office and in the Housing Management Divisions of two of the three field offices we visited believe that the nursing home program furthers HUD\u2019s broad mission of increasing opportunities for housing and community development.", "Specifically, HUD officials said that the program supports HUD\u2019s mission by insuring mortgages for nursing homes that may serve populations such as low-income individuals or areas such as small rural communities or inner cities that are not adequately served by the private sector. In addition, HUD officials said the program also supports the Department\u2019s mission by assisting borrowers who might otherwise be unable to obtain financing for nursing homes. Along these lines, a 1993 report indicates that nonprofit, public, and small for-profit entities are most likely to obtain financing from either the FHA or state programs, whereas large for-profit entities generally obtain financing from commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and life insurance companies and through the stock market.", "Nonetheless, the extent to which the program actually achieves the purposes cited by the HUD officials is uncertain. For example, the nursing home program is not targeted to specific unmet market needs, such as providing access to nursing homes to underserved locations and populations, nor are borrowers required to demonstrate that they could not obtain financing without FHA mortgage insurance. Current FHA borrowers that we contacted cited various reasons why they used FHA insurance in financing their nursing homes. While some noted the unavailability of other financing, others cited different reasons; for example, the program enabled them to obtain lower interest rates and the program offers \u201cnonrecourse\u201d terms, which protect investors. While FHA does have requirements to determine whether sufficient market demand exists for nursing home projects that it insures, the requirements are not specifically aimed at determining whether a project will meet a need that would not otherwise be met by the private sector. Furthermore, HUD does not collect and analyze information on whom the program is serving, such as the income levels of the patients served by FHA nursing homes, the economic characteristics of the communities in which FHA nursing homes are built, or the borrowers\u2019 ability to obtain financing without FHA insurance.", "Available information indicates that participation in FHA\u2019s nursing home program varies widely by state. About 32 percent of FHA\u2019s nursing home loan balances cover facilities located in New York, and another 38 percent of FHA\u2019s nursing home loan balances cover facilities located in seven other states. (See fig. 1.) In contrast, FHA currently insures only a small number of nursing homes in many states. For example, FHA currently insures 2 percent of the nursing homes in California and 1 percent of the nursing homes in Texas.

When HUD terminated the retirement service center program in 1991, it reported that the program primarily assisted the upper-income elderly and that the private sector also had been developing a wide variety of similar products for the upper-income elderly.", "HUD established this program administratively in 1983 with the urging of developers to provide market-rate rental housing for the elderly with a significant level of services and amenities over and above those found in the typical HUD-insured project for the elderly. However, as the HUD Inspector General has noted, HUD implemented the program without having fully assessed the risks and benefits of the Department\u2019s involvement in underwriting loans for retirement service centers. In particular, HUD did not do an adequate job of analyzing the market for such housing\u2014an error that was also made by some private sector investors in retirement centers in the 1980s who also incurred losses as a result of defaults.", "For example, HUD underestimated the reluctance of many seniors to move from their current home to alternative housing. In addition, because retirement service centers had no direct federal rental subsidies, the high rents associated with these projects made them affordable to only the upper-middle-income to upper-income elderly population. As a result of these and other factors, the program incurred a high level of loan defaults.", "Because of the defaults, the Secretary placed a moratorium on insuring additional facilities in 1989. HUD terminated the program in 1991, at which time, it reported that approximately 53 percent of the retirement service center projects had either defaulted or were experiencing financial or operational difficulties. In terminating the program, HUD noted that this action would not cause a gap in the types of housing and support services available to serve the lower-income elderly because retirement service centers charged market rate rents and had no direct federal rental subsidies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Data and HUD\u2019s Analyses Indicate Losses for Programs", "paragraphs": ["Because of data limitations, the financial performance of the nursing home and retirement service center programs can only be estimated.

Therefore, this information does not establish whether the programs operate at a profit or a loss. Furthermore, while HUD\u2019s data systems currently track receipts and expenditure data associated with its individual mortgage insurance programs, cumulative receipts and expenditure data for its insurance programs are not available because historically the data systems have not tracked these data for the Department\u2019s individual programs. Consequently, the actual financial performance of the nursing home and retirement service center programs can only be estimated.", "Data from HUD that may be used to approximate the financial performance of the nursing home program from its inception to September 30, 1994, indicate that losses were likely incurred under this program. Specifically, HUD\u2019s data on loan defaults, original loan amounts, premium payment requirements, and recoveries from the sale of notes and properties indicate that the nursing home program has incurred losses of approximately $187 million, adjusted for inflation, since its inception.Primarily because of the data limitations, we excluded some expenses, such as administrative costs, and developed some assumptions, for example, on recovery amounts from the sale of defaulted notes or properties, which tend to understate the cost of the nursing home program. These factors are discussed in more detail in appendix III, which summarizes our methodology for estimating the losses of the nursing home program.", "Available data indicate that the terminated retirement service center program has incurred losses as well. For example, in terminating the program in 1991, HUD estimated that net losses to the insurance fund could total about $300 million. Furthermore, HUD\u2019s data show that about 46 percent of the total retirement service center portfolio of about $1.4 billion had defaulted as of September 30, 1994.

On a net present value basis, FHA estimated that it will sustain approximately $724 million in future losses from loan defaults. This amount includes an offset representing estimated premium receipts for loans evaluated in the analysis as having a low risk of default. The loss reserves represent about 19 percent of the total unpaid principal balance of nursing home loans insured as of September 30, 1994.", "FHA\u2019s loan loss reserve estimates are based primarily on analyses of the financial and physical condition of properties with FHA mortgage insurance. They do not specifically consider the potential financial impacts of changes in health care policies on nursing homes. Although the exact nature of future national changes in health care is uncertain at the present time, the health care industry is currently undergoing significant changes as a result of national and state efforts to contain costs and reform the health care system. Industry and government officials with whom we spoke generally do not believe that proposed and ongoing changes in the health care industry will have a negative impact upon FHA\u2019s nursing homes. However, efforts by federal, state, and local governments to control rising health care costs\u2014such as current state and federal actions to reduce Medicaid and Medicare costs\u2014could increase risks and undermine the financial viability of some of these projects. For example, a substantial portion of nursing homes\u2019 revenue is provided from Medicaid reimbursements. (See app. IV.)", "In addition to the high number of defaults of retirement service center loans that have occurred to date, more defaults are expected. We conducted a survey of HUD\u2019s loan servicers in November 1994 to determine the extent to which they believed the remaining retirement service center loans were likely to default in the future. (See app. V for the scope and methodology for the survey.) The results of this survey and the recent financial analysis of most of the remaining retirement service center loans by a HUD contractor indicate that additional loan defaults under the program are likely. HUD\u2019s loan servicers indicated that about 18 percent of the remaining retirement service center loans that we identified were likely to default in the future. The unpaid principal balance for these projects was approximately $192 million as of September 30, 1993.", "Furthermore, an analysis of the 1993 audited financial statements of 90 retirement service center projects, conducted in 1994 for HUD by a contractor, rated one-half of these projects as \u201cpoor\u201d in at least two of the five financial ratios evaluated. In nine of these cases, the auditors\u2019 opinions raised a \u201cgoing concern issue,\u201d indicating that the auditors seriously question the continued viability of these projects.

For several reasons, we believe that this estimate may not be reliable. First, according to HUD budget staff, the credit subsidy calculation was based on assumptions about loan performance contained in a 1992 report by Price Waterhouse that HUD applied to a standard credit subsidy model (spreadsheet) used by the Office of Management and Budget. According to the HUD staff, the data used to provide the credit subsidy estimates have not been updated even though the most recent data used in the Price Waterhouse study are from 1990. Furthermore, according to the study, because of the lack of available financial data on nursing home loans, the models used in the study were based on historical trends and economic indicators and did not incorporate project-specific financial indicators. The study noted that the general economic models used in the study cannot explain loan performance as accurately as loan-specific models.", "Second, HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1996 credit subsidy estimate assumes a higher recovery rate on defaulted loans than HUD has historically experienced\u201460 percent as opposed to the 40.2-percent rate supported by HUD\u2019s data. Third, HUD\u2019s credit subsidy estimate does not take into account the differences in default risk that may result from HUD\u2019s insurance of assisted living facilities compared with its insurance of nursing homes. These differences are discussed in the next section of our report. And last, a recent study prepared for the Mortgage Bankers Association indicates that the nursing home program has incurred losses in the last 8 years and requires a small credit subsidy. That study also used the 60-percent recovery rate that HUD uses in its credit subsidy model, which may underestimate the program\u2019s losses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program and Agency Changes May Further Strain FHA\u2019s Management Capacity", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in our June 1995 report on FHA\u2019s loan loss reserves and default prevention efforts, HUD is unable to provide adequate oversight and management of its existing multifamily loan inventory, including nursing home and retirement service center loans.

The agency currently insures a number of multifamily properties that are in poor condition and projected losses of $9.5 billion from future defaults of loans in its $45.4 billion insured multifamily portfolio as of September 30, 1994. Although HUD is taking steps to overcome staffing inadequacies, data deficiencies, and poor management controls that have hindered its ability to manage the portfolio for many years, many of the Department\u2019s efforts to improve its management are in the early stages. Some of the corrective actions could take years to accomplish. For example, efforts to overcome the serious data deficiencies in FHA\u2019s multifamily portfolio are only at the strategic planning stage. As such, HUD continues to have only limited ability to oversee these programs, and we cannot determine at this time whether HUD\u2019s initiatives will be successful.", "In addition, HUD is proposing organizational changes and staffing cuts that could, at least in the short run, place additional strains on FHA\u2019s portfolio management. In December 1994, HUD issued its \u201cReinvention Blueprint\u201d proposing broad departmental changes, including restructuring FHA, in an effort to operate more efficiently and effectively. HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget proposal would streamline HUD\u2019s headquarters and field office operations, reducing staff from the current level of 12,000 to about 7,500 over the next 5 years. Under HUD\u2019s proposal, FHA would be transformed into a \u201cstreamlined, business-oriented government entity.\u201d As a new \u201cmarket-driven corporation,\u201d FHA would consolidate its many existing insurance programs into three broad authorities: single-family homeownership; multifamily rental housing; and health care facilities. These sweeping proposals are likely to change the nature and extent of FHA\u2019s future involvement in managing the multifamily portfolio.", "According to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs, HUD is studying ways to consolidate its multifamily underwriting and asset management responsibilities in response to the proposed departmental restructuring and downsizing. For example, HUD is planning to assign loan originations for assisted living facility loans for its Region 10 offices in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington State to the Seattle, Washington, field office to bring efficiency and specialization to the loan origination process for nursing home loans that are unlike other multifamily loans. The Deputy Assistant Secretary said that concentrating highly experienced staff in a few locations will reduce the risk associated with certain types of loans, such as those of assisted living, board and care, and intermediate care facilities. In addition, the Deputy Assistant Secretary indicated that HUD is currently redesigning its program for nursing homes and other residential health care facilities. The Department is considering changing fees and premiums as well as basic underwriting terms, such as reductions in loan-to-value limits and shorter mortgage terms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program\u2019s Expansion May Further Strain HUD\u2019s Oversight Ability", "paragraphs": ["The recent expansion of the nursing home program to include mortgage insurance for assisted living facilities (as well as for refinanced loans covering non-FHA-insured nursing homes) could strain HUD\u2019s already limited capacity to manage nursing home and other multifamily loans. Our work in several HUD field offices, as well as data from FHA\u2019s loan loss reserve analysis, indicates that HUD\u2019s loan servicers provide limited oversight of nursing home and retirement service center loans. For example, of the 142 nursing home loans that HUD sampled in its fiscal year 1994 loan loss reserve analysis, only 36 had received recent management reviews and 87 had current physical inspections. In general, HUD\u2019s loan management staff that we contacted viewed nursing home loans as low-risk and, as a result, generally do not focus attention on nursing home loans unless financial trouble appears imminent or a default occurs.", "The new assisted living component of the nursing home program has the potential to further strain HUD\u2019s management capabilities. This additional strain could result not only from the fact that the program could increase the size of FHA\u2019s insured loan portfolio but also because the default risk associated with insuring assisted living facilities could be higher than that for other nursing home loans\u2014particularly if the new program is not effectively managed. In this regard, assisted living facilities differ from nursing homes in fundamental ways that can potentially increase the risk of default. For example, while most states limit the supply of skilled nursing homes through the certificate-of-need process, similar limits are not placed by most states on assisted living facilities. Furthermore, the new assisted living facilities program shares some characteristics with the failed retirement service center program in that both target the moderate- and upper-income elderly. As such, these projects typically do not receive Medicaid financing and require careful analysis to ensure that sufficient market demand exists to support the facilities.", "Officials in HUD\u2019s Insured Multifamily Housing Development Office believe that several differences between assisted living facilities and retirement service centers will mitigate the risks associated with their similarities. For instance, unlike retirement service centers, FHA\u2019s assisted living facilities (1) will be licensed and regulated by the states; (2) are expected by FHA to be developed and managed by developers and operators experienced in the delivery of long-term care, although no specific level of experience is required; and (3) are intended for residents who, by virtue of their physical condition, no longer have the option of living independently, resulting in a more need-driven market for these facilities. However, as noted earlier, state monitoring and regulation, which focus on the adequacy of health care, do not address default prevention. Furthermore, the extent to which experienced developers and adequate market analysis are used in this program will depend on the HUD field staff responsible for analyzing and underwriting the insurance.", "HUD\u2019s Director of Insured Multifamily Housing Development acknowledged that excessive workloads could limit HUD\u2019s ability to adequately administer the assisted living program. However, she stated that HUD will attempt to minimize the risks of assisted living projects through careful underwriting evolving, in part, from HUD\u2019s plans to provide special training to field staff. Training is critical because, as HUD has recognized, the lack of extensive training in underwriting projects exacerbated the problems that HUD experienced with the failed retirement service center program. Nonetheless, HUD\u2019s plans to have initial training completed in early 1995 were not implemented. However, HUD did provide training for underwriting assisted living facility loans to its field offices via a live broadcast from headquarters on August 16, 1995. In addition, HUD plans advanced valuation training for staff from several field offices in August 1995. The training will emphasize market and marketability issues for nursing homes and board and care and assisted living facilities.", "HUD\u2019s ability to effectively oversee the assisted living program may be further constrained, in our view, by the fact that the Department has not conducted a market feasibility study to fully assess the risks and benefits associated with assisted living facilities. According to HUD officials, the Department\u2019s policy is to perform feasibility studies only for new programs. Because HUD views the assisted living program as an expansion of FHA\u2019s nursing home program rather than a new program, it does not believe that the assisted living program warrants a feasibility study. However, as noted earlier, the lack of a full assessment of the risks and benefits in underwriting retirement service center loans was cited by HUD\u2019s Inspector General as contributing to the problems associated with that program.", "Officials in HUD\u2019s Insured Multifamily Housing Development Office and field offices also believe that FHA\u2019s experience with board and care projects will help ensure effective management of the loans for the assisted living program. However, according to available data, board and care projects are a small part of the nursing home portfolio, and many of HUD\u2019s field offices have little or no experience with board and care facilities.", "In addition, in response to our questions about the default risk of board and care facilities, HUD conducted a preliminary analysis of nursing home default claims since 1986 that indicates that FHA may need to strengthen its underwriting standards for board and care facilities. According to the Deputy Director of the Office of Insured Multifamily Housing Development, the preliminary results indicate that a higher proportion of loans for board and care facilities have defaulted than these facilities\u2019 relative share of the nursing home business.

Appendix VI contains the complete text of HUD\u2019s comments, which were provided by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing Programs. HUD\u2019s comments did not include any substantive disagreements with the facts presented in the report. However, as discussed below, HUD disagreed with the scope of our report and one of our recommendations. HUD also cited actions it was taking to address the other recommendations and provided comments on a number of issues covered in the report.", "HUD characterized the scope of the draft report as misleading because it did not, in the Department\u2019s view, appropriately distinguish between the operations or status of the nursing home and retirement service center programs. HUD stated that the programs are different products serving different markets and argued that we should issue separate reports on these two programs. However, throughout the report, we provide information on each program separately. We believe the report clearly distinguishes between the operations and status of HUD\u2019s nursing home and retirement service center programs. While there are clearly differences between the two programs, there are also similarities and instances in which the operation of one program has implications for the other. In addition, many in the housing and medical facility fields see housing and care for the elderly as a \u201ccontinuum of care.\u201d The continuum starts with facilities that provide the lowest levels of assistance, such as retirement service centers; moves toward increased levels of care provided by board and care and assisted living facilities; moves to the various levels of nursing home facilities; and finally ends with hospital care. For these reasons, we believe it is appropriate to discuss both programs in a single report.", "HUD disagreed with our recommendation that the Department collect data on the characteristics of patients, locations, and borrowers for future nursing home projects. The Department suggested additional language to the recommendation to state that the recommendation\u2019s purpose is to ensure that the Department serves the target population and then stated that nothing in the legislation directs the Department to target certain areas or populations. However, our recommendation is directed at HUD\u2019s obtaining a better measure of the outcomes of the program\u2014that is, to have information on whom the program is serving. We believe this information is important for assessing the costs and benefits of the program. In addition, the Department maintained that a major effort at this time to collect such data is overly burdensome. To avoid an undue burden on the Department, our recommendation is prospective in nature.", "Accordingly, we do not agree that collecting some additional data on new loans would be unnecessarily burdensome.", "HUD also noted actions that it is taking as part of a strategic plan prepared in November 1994 that it believes will address our recommendations. While these actions appear worthwhile, they do not, in our view, affect the validity of our recommendations. For example, HUD states that its credit subsidy estimates are a subject of continuing discussion with the Office of Management and Budget and that as better data are obtained and more experience is gained, credit subsidy estimates will be refined and revised. However, HUD\u2019s comments are unclear about what specific improvements it expects to make in its credit subsidy estimates for the nursing home program and when those improvements will be made. Similarly, HUD states that its strategic plan includes other actions such as redesigning products to ensure a self-sustaining FHA, monitoring the financial performance of FHA programs, and implementing a variety of remedial actions on the basis of lessons learned from past practices. However, it is unclear what all of these actions will involve and how soon some of them will be completed.", "HUD also provided comments on other issues in the report. For example, HUD pointed out that (1) the retirement service centers are \u201cdemand-driven\u201d because they appeal to a relatively independent and well-off segment of the elderly population that has other options, including staying in their own home, and (2) assisted living facilities and board and care facilities are \u201cneed-driven\u201d because they address situations in which the elderly can no longer remain fully independent and need the support and health-related services. Our report reflects these differences. Nonetheless, we note that this distinction does not guarantee a market for these facilities. For example, affordability and location are also likely to be important factors. Private sector experts with whom we spoke indicated that identifying the market for assisted living facilities is a difficult and complex task.", "HUD asserted that the nursing home program serves those not served by the private sector. However, HUD acknowledged that it does not have data to substantiate its position. In our view, without such data, it is not clear to what extent FHA-insured facilities serve a need that would not otherwise be met by the private sector.", "In our report, we provide information on the number of nursing homes in each state compared with the number of nursing homes currently in FHA\u2019s loan portfolio to show that participation in FHA\u2019s nursing home program varies widely by state. HUD stated that FHA\u2019s share of the market should be computed by comparing what has happened in the market over the last few years. We noted in the draft report that the data presented provide an approximate representation of FHA\u2019s role in providing nursing homes in each state, and we identified the limitations in the data provided. In response to the Department\u2019s comment, we have further clarified that the information we provide is not sufficient to represent a complete analysis of FHA\u2019s share of the nursing home market.", "We also note that HUD\u2019s data systems do not provide reliable data on the types of nursing home projects insured, and thus comparisons with market data are limited. In addition, available market data are based on varying definitions of housing and medical care facilities for the elderly, which further limit analysis. Nonetheless, in its comments, HUD reported that the American Seniors Housing Finance Association and AARP estimate that since 1990, the FHA nursing home program has been responsible for 20 to 25 percent of the loans for seniors\u2019 housing for board and care and assisted living facilities. Through discussions with HUD and AARP officials, we understand that this information is based on an undocumented, informal analysis by HUD of incomplete data on the number of FHA-insured facilities and those in the private sector during this time period. On the basis of these data, the Department also expressed the opinion that a similar situation exists for nursing homes but did not provide quantitative support for this assertion.", "HUD\u2019s response also asserts that FHA-insured nursing home facilities lower the government\u2019s Medicaid costs. The Department stated that because FHA-insured borrowers have loans with lower interest rates, Medicaid\u2019s capital reimbursement costs are lower. While this may be true, other variables, such as loan term and mortgage insurance premiums, affect total loan costs. Furthermore, while FHA\u2019s program may result in savings to the government from lower Medicaid costs, it also carries with it increased risks of losses resulting from future loan defaults.", "HUD also provided us with information on the steps being taken to overcome identified management deficiencies and improve its operations, such as moving to a team approach to underwriting loans, upgrading technology and skills through providing computers and software and training, and designing and implementing new information systems for tracking, monitoring, and evaluation. Our draft report recognized that HUD had a number of initiatives under way, and we have added additional information into the final report on the basis of the Department\u2019s comments. However, we still have concerns about HUD\u2019s ability to effectively manage the nursing home and retirement service center programs in the near future. The actions being undertaken are in the planning or early implementation phase, and it is too early to know if they will be effective. In addition, the Department\u2019s proposed organizational changes and staffing cuts will, at least in the short run, place additional strains on HUD\u2019s management capacity, which is currently inadequate to effectively oversee the multifamily loan portfolio.", "We conducted our review from September 1994 through July 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to officials in HUD\u2019s Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing, the face amount of the original mortgages is the best proxy for claims payments. Furthermore, for the nine nursing home properties that went through foreclosure and sale from 1987 through 1994, the cumulative face amount of the loans and the cumulative amount of claims paid were close\u2014$40.4 million versus $40.2 million. We also note that using the face value of the loan to represent HUD\u2019s expenditures may produce cost estimates that are more likely to be understated than overstated because HUD also incurs costs while the properties are in the HUD-held inventory. For example, for the nine recent cases for which we have data, HUD\u2019s \u201cnet investment\u201d in the properties was $43 million, compared with the original loan amount of $40.4 million.", "Another data limitation is that HUD does not have historical data on recoveries from the sale of nursing home properties or mortgage notes prior to 1987.

We used a higher rate than the rate of HUD\u2019s actual recoveries for the nursing home program from 1987 through 1994 because HUD management believes that recoveries will be higher than the historical rate as the Department uses foreclosures and property disposition less and increases its use of note sales at foreclosures and third-party note sales upon loan assignment.", "For the cases totaling $229 million for which the note or property sales have been completed, we estimated recoveries on HUD\u2019s actual recovery rate of 30 percent for the nursing home program for fiscal years 1987 through 1994.

The 30-percent weighted recovery rate reflects actual recovery rates of 11 percent for property sales and 44 percent for note sales.

However, while market demand for nursing homes may remain stable or increase in the future, the attempts to control medical costs may make it more difficult for nursing homes to remain financially viable. For example, according to officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, skilled nursing homes could face difficulties in covering costs through Medicare and Medicaid as they admit more patients with greater care needs and lose patients requiring less care to other facilities.
