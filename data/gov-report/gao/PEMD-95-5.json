The activities of two programs run by NHTSA are the focus of this report. NHTSA\u2019s Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance performs a compliance testing program of 30-mile-per-hour full-frontal crashes of automobiles, light trucks, and vans into a fixed rigid barrier. This program was created under section 103 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, and it is designed to ensure that vehicles meet minimum safety requirements as specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 -Occupant Crash Protection (FMVSS 208).", "Also under the authority of NHTSA is the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), conducted by the Office of Market Incentives. This program, mandated under title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, was created to provide information to consumers on the relative crashworthiness, or safety, of automobiles. This charge differs from the compliance test in that vehicles tested in NCAP are not required to meet specified safety standards, while the purpose of compliance tests is to ensure that vehicles meet a level of safety required by law. The NCAP test also differs from the compliance test in two important aspects: NCAP crashes its vehicles at 35 miles per hour, which translates to over one-third more energy than compliance tests, and NCAP engages all manual and automatic restraints, while the compliance test employs only passive restraints. By using all restraint systems, NCAP assesses the maximum crashworthiness of a vehicle in high-speed frontal crashes.", "In addition to the two programs described above, NHTSA\u2019s Office of Crashworthiness Research conducts a variety of tests to study a wide range of individual safety issues that arise from specific crash configurations.

We chose to focus on these programs because both conduct tests that are similarly configured, employ standardized procedures, and have been assessing vehicle crashworthiness over a period of years. The two other crash test programs run by DOT are largely research based and, although important, have different purposes from those of our study.", "Our analysis consisted of three parts: (1) an examination of trends over time in crash test results of both programs, (2) an assessment of the reliability of NCAP results, and (3) a review of the relationship between NCAP results and real-world traffic injuries and fatalities. We first reviewed the background, sample selection, and testing procedures of both NCAP and the compliance program. (See appendix I). We then examined what it is that crash tests measure, as wellas how well measurement devices used in crash tests simulate human biomechanics and physiological response by reviewing biomechanic, human tolerance, and automotive safety literature and by interviewing experts in those fields. (See appendixes II and III.)", "Next, we analyzed changes in crash test results by year for both the compliance program and NCAP. (See appendix IV.)", "To address the reliability of crash test results, that is, the degree to which consistent results are obtained through repeated trials, we examined research conducted by NHTSA and compared NCAP results with those obtained in crash tests conducted by manufacturers. (See appendix V.) Finally, we conducted analyses using two national databases that allowed us to relate real-world fatality rates for drivers with the predicted injury risks derived from NCAP results. (See appendix VI). For this analysis, we used Poisson regressions to assess the relationship between fatality rates, derived from the Fatal Accident Reporting System and the R.L. Polk Vehicle Registration System, and the combined injury risk calculated from the NCAP measurements that assess the potential for skeletal injuries to the head and chest. Analyses were conducted for restrained drivers in one- and two-car frontal crashes.", "We did not include information from the compliance program in the analyses we conducted on either the reliability or the predictive validity of crash test results. In our assessment of the reliability of crash test results, we did not uncover a quantity of data sufficient enough to compare the results of two or more trials of vehicle models. In the case of the predictive validity of crash test results, we did not use compliance test data for two reasons. First, the compliance program had conducted only 145 tests between 1987 and 1992. Second, the variation among compliance results was relatively narrow and scores tended to cluster far below the ceiling values for the compliance tests. These two items resulted in a dataset that was insufficient for conducting detailed statistical analyses.", "We conducted our review in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Analysis", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Automobiles Have Become More Crashworthy", "paragraphs": ["In NCAP crashes, nearly all cars now meet the head and chest injury standards of the compliance tests, although they are 36-percent more violent than compliance crashes. The average probability of sustaining a serious injury in a 35 mile-per-hour crash as measured by NCAP has declined from over 0.5 in 1980 to less than 0.2 in 1993. (See figure 1.) Differences among the crashworthiness scores of vehicles tested in this program have experienced similar declines. The introduction of air bags has contributed significantly to this improvement. (For a complete discussion of the trends in crash test results, see appendix IV.)", "A causal linkage between improved crash test scores and declining highway fatalities cannot be asserted with certainty because of both the many variables involved in a crash and the increased emphasis on traffic accident and injury prevention over the past decade. Nonetheless, it seems reasonable to conclude that manufacturers\u2019 successful efforts to improve their products\u2019 performance in NHTSA crash tests, particularly in NCAP, have contributed to improved occupant protection in real-world crashes, although we were unable to quantify that contribution. These improvements to performance have derived from a variety of efforts, with two examples being modernized manufacturing techniques and an increased emphasis on safety systems and designs.", "In addition, in recent years, automotive designers have turned more to computer-based simulations to assist in the design of vehicles that meet crash test standards. Although we did not evaluate the state of the art in computer-based crash models, we learned from industry personnel that such modeling appears to accurately predict the results of actual crash tests. Indeed, one computer specialist informed us that the industry uses crash tests in part to validate their computer models.", "Although simulated crashes are costly as they currently require access to supercomputers, they do allow the manufacturer to assess the crashworthiness of a vehicle in more trials, more quickly, and at impacts points other than the front (or side) of a car. These benefits over actual crash testing permit the identification of crash forces upon an occupant in a time frame that offers immediate redesign implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crash Test Results Have Questionable Reliability", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether the result of any test is reliable, consistent results must be obtained through repeated trials of a specified procedure. In the case of crash tests, this means that consistent results of repeated tests of a specific vehicle model are required. This is particularly crucial when comparing the safety ratings of different vehicles. Both the NCAP and compliance programs generally conduct only one trial of a specific vehicle model; thus, insufficient data exist to accurately define the reliability of crash test results. That is, the ability to predict with confidence the likelihood of a tested model\u2019s receiving similar scores if tested again is low.", "We found only two sources of information on which to assess the reliability of crash test results: a study conducted by NHTSA in 1984, which examined the variations in test results of 12 consecutively manufactured Chevrolet Citations, and our own analysis of the differences between results for vehicle models tested in NCAP and the results for those vehicles in corresponding tests conducted by automobile manufacturers. Our analysis of the data derived from NHTSA\u2019s 1984 study revealed wide variations in the head injury criterion (HIC) results, the measurement taken to assess potential skeletal head injuries. (See appendix V.) Although NHTSA ascribed the variation in results to a number of sources, including the test itself, it failed to discuss the implications of the combined effect of these sources on crash test results; namely, that even within a specific vehicle line, the result of one test may not be indicative of the model\u2019s performance from trial to trial, and large differences in the resultant HIC may occur.", "We also examined the differences between the results of NCAP and manufacturers\u2019 tests provided to us by NCAP officials. The tests conducted by the manufacturers essentially duplicated the NCAP test procedures. We compared the results of the two tests using the star rating system recently developed by NCAP, hypothesizing that if the manufacturer test were considered a second trial for a model line, its results should be consistent with the NCAP, or first trial. The star rating system ranks cars from 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the best rating, or safest car, and 1 star being the worst rating, or least safe car. These ratings are based on the risks of serious injury for vehicles, which are calculated from the head injury criterion and chest acceleration scores from NCAP tests. (For a discussion of crash test measurements and the star system, see appendix II.)", "We found that in only about one-half of the paired comparisons would NCAP- and manufacturer-tested vehicles have received the same star rating. In 32 percent of the comparisons, the results of the second trial would have changed by 1 star, while in 8 percent of the cases, the ratings of the vehicles would have changed by 2 or more stars. When we compared the risks of serious injury (the base unit categorized into the five star ratings) derived from the manufacturer and NCAP data, we found that each star category was associated with a wide band in which the resultant risk scores of subsequent tests might fall. For example, the results of a second test of a vehicle rated as 4 stars by its first test could fall between 5 stars and 2 stars.", "The analyses described above are based on the only two sources of information we could find. The quantity of data in each analysis was not enough for us to fully quantify the reliability of crash test results; however, we were able to determine that NCAP scores, whether reported in raw HIC and chest acceleration scores or as categories of injury probability, have associated levels of imprecision and that seemingly large differences in crash test results may not necessarily reflect true differences in a vehicle\u2019s safety potential. By not properly defining and publishing the degree of reliability, consumers may be misled into purchasing a vehicle purported to be more crashworthy than another when, in fact, it may be no more safe, or even less safe, than the comparison vehicle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCAP Results and Real-World Fatality Rates", "paragraphs": ["Since NCAP crash tests are designed to simulate full-frontal collisions, we restricted our analysis to those types of crashes and found the results of NCAP crash tests are generally reflected in real-world fatality rates. That is, on the whole, a statistically significant relationship exists between real-world highway fatality rates associated with vehicles tested in the NCAP program and their scores in crash tests. However, we concluded that this relationship derives mainly from the high fatality rates of vehicles with the worst NCAP scores. When we divided vehicles into NCAP score quintiles\u2014that is, placed the vehicles into one of five 20-percentile categories based on their location in the distribution of NCAP results\u2014we found that the quintile with the worst NCAP scores (those vehicles in the highest 20-percentile category) had significantly higher fatality rates than the remaining 80 percent of NCAP-tested vehicles.

While we cannot state with certainty that NHTSA crash tests are a causal factor in improved crashworthiness, we believe that efforts on the part of automobile manufacturers to produce vehicles that score well on these tests have contributed to the improvement of the overall safety of vehicles. At the very least, the results of NCAP and compliance tests provide indications that the vehicle fleet, on the whole, has become safer over the past 15 years.", "These trends in the mean score of crash tests, however, do not necessarily suggest that individual vehicles have well-defined levels of safety, nor do they suggest that the relative rankings of two vehicles would be the same if subsequent trials were conducted. They also do not suggest that differing test results are reflected in data derived from real-world traffic collisions. Indeed, only the poorest performers in NCAP had associated fatality rates that were significantly different than other NCAP vehicles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our findings, we make two recommendations to the Administrator of NHTSA. First, we recommend that information on NCAP reliability be updated and made available, in clear language, to the general public. Such an effort would require an update of the repeatability study the agency conducted in 1984 and could result not only in a better understanding of the reliability of crash tests for predicting injury risk, but also in discovering ways in which NHTSA can limit the error that derives from sources under its control.", "We also recommend that NHTSA explore the feasibility of alternative means of testing the crashworthiness of new vehicles. Computer simulations may provide one such alternative. It may be possible to better assess the safety potential of a vehicle through computer-based modeling as this allows more trials, more quickly, and modeling is capable of simulating impacts at all points of a vehicle. In addition, this rapidly emerging technology has the added capability of providing immediate insights into redesigning vehicles in which the crashworthiness may not yet be optimal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Department of Transportation.

As noted above and explained in detail in appendix V, this new format does not resolve our questions concerning NCAP reliability.", "The Department interpreted our second recommendation as a recommendation to augment or replace \u201clive\u201d crash tests with computer simulations and did not concur with us. The Department cited concerns about the costs and predictive limitations of such simulations. We share these concerns, but we believe the Agency has misinterpreted the recommendation. We avoided recommending the adoption of any particular substitute for the current crash test procedures at this time. Rather, we urged the Agency to explore all possible means of reliably defining vehicle crashworthiness. Computer modeling is a potential alternative that deserves exploration and monitoring as the technology matures. Other alternatives could include extending testing programs to include side, rear, and frontal-offset impacts to gain a better understanding of the total safety of a vehicle or seeking greater sharing of crash test data developed by automotive manufacturers either through crash tests replicating NHTSA\u2019s or through their individual component testing programs.", "The Department provided a number of other specific comments. They are reproduced in appendix VII, together with our response. We have also made modifications to the report as we deemed appropriate on the basis of these comments.

The criteria used to determine which specific makes and models to test are based on whether a vehicle is in its first or second model year, whether safety features have been added or redesigned, and how many units are on the road. In selecting models for testing, NHTSA also includes any evidence of poor crashworthiness derived either from consumer complaints filed about specific models or from other crash test programs (in particular, NCAP). Through these criteria, NHTSA compiles a preliminary list of about 50 candidate vehicles for testing and requests information on crash test performance from the manufacturer of each candidate model to determine the final list of vehicles to be tested.

That is, if a vehicle performed reasonably well on these tests, which required dynamic testing, then it would likely meet compliance test requirements because the NCAP test involves a more violent crash than the one required for the compliance test. If a vehicle performed poorly, the information would be transmitted to the Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance for testing its compliance with the safety standards.

NCAP is a market-based program that disseminates information to consumers on the relative safety of passenger vehicles. There are no minimum allowable safety performance criteria that vehicles must meet, although NCAP collects the same measurements as the compliance test. Despite the fact that NCAP is not a compliance program, industry personnel have expressed the opinion that the NCAP test has become the de facto regulation.

For example, not only does the Hybrid III measure injury potential to the skeletal structures, but it can also determine injury potential to the soft tissues in the upper thorax through the chest compression measure. Further, the Hybrid III has accelerometers and load cells placed in the neck and lower legs that can measure the potential for injuries caused to those anatomical areas. To date, no criteria have been established for meeting compliance for the additional measures other than chest compression. However, the measures do provide DOT with additional information on the potential physiological responses associated with vehicular crashes.", "Currently, the determination of which dummy to use in a test is made by the manufacturer of the vehicle being tested. Through 1993, manufacturers chose to use the Hybrid III in 36 of the 133 tests of passenger cars in the compliance program and in 30 of the 86 tests of passenger cars in NCAP since the dummy became available for use in the two programs (1988 and 1990, respectively). One expert hypothesized that the reason so few compliance tests involve Hybrid III dummies is that they tend to receive higher HIC scores, especially in noncontact situations and that there is no guarantee that a car designed around the Hybrid II will pass a test using a Hybrid III.", "The differences between the dummies used in NHTSA\u2019s tests, described above, led us to compare the driver-side HIC and chest acceleration scores from passenger-car compliance and NCAP tests in an attempt to quantify the potential effects on test reliability such differences could create. In this analysis, we controlled for the presence of a driver-side air bag in the car. In general, we found the Hybrid III dummy scores were lower than the Hybrid II scores, but that the presence of air bags strongly affects the relative performance of the two dummy types. (See tables III.1 and III.2.)", "Chest acceleration (g\u2019s)", "For passenger cars from 1990 to 1993, with and without air bags.", "Specifically, we found that", "Vehicles tested with Hybrid III dummies had lower HIC and chest acceleration scores than those tested with Hybrid II dummies in both compliance and NCAP tests. In NCAP tests, Hybrid III dummies averaged 156 HIC and 3.6 g\u2019s less than Hybrid II dummies. (See table III.1) Similarly, in compliance tests, the mean head injury criterion score for cars tested with Hybrid III dummies was 97 HIC lower than the score for tests that used the Hybrid II, while the mean chest acceleration score was about 2 g\u2019s less for test cars that used the Hybrid III. (See table III.2)In both the NCAP and compliance tests, Hybrid III had significantly lower HIC scores than Hybrid II dummies in vehicles equipped with air bags. In vehicles without air bags, Hybrid IIIs had significantly higher HIC scores than Hybrid IIs. The difference could occur because of the greater flexibility of the Hybrid III\u2019s neck.In both the NCAP and compliance tests, Hybrid III dummies had significantly lower chest acceleration results than Hybrid II dummies in cars with air bags. There was little difference between the chest scores of Hybrid III and Hybrid II dummies in cars without air bags.", "Chest acceleration (g\u2019s)", "For passenger cars from 1988 to 1993, with and without air bags.", "Manufacturers have been reluctant to use Hybrid III dummies for tests of cars not equipped with air bags because these dummies tend to produce higher HIC results, especially in cases where the dummy\u2019s head did not contact the interior components of the car. (Only 18 percent of compliance tests of cars without air bags from 1988 to 1993 and 18 percent of NCAP tests of cars without air bags from 1990 to 1993 used the Hybrid III.) Industry representatives stated that because HIC was developed to determine potential skull injuries\u2014a condition that will not occur if the head does not contact the vehicle\u2019s interior\u2014it should be applied only to cases in which the head actually makes contact. Although they agree that brain injuries can occur when the head does not contact the interior, they contend that the instrumentation in the dummy\u2019s head does not measure the potential for these types of injuries. Therefore, they conclude that in cases of \u201cnoncontact\u201d HICs, the results are meaningless and misleading. Thus, rather than risk a spuriously higher HIC score in either the compliance or NCAP tests, manufacturers have tended to use the Hybrid II for vehicles that do not have air bags.", "While these complex interactions of dummy type, safety equipment, and test conditions can be explained by biomechanical differences between the Hybrid II and Hybrid III dummies, they may also be explained by differences in the test vehicles themselves. As we noted earlier, the manufacturers specify which dummy type to use in NHTSA crash tests, and one may assume that, in the absence of other motivations, they would choose the dummy they anticipate will yield more favorable results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exclusive Use of the Hybrid III", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, each manufacturer undergoing a compliance test may specify either the Hybrid II or the Hybrid III test device. But in recent years, NHTSA has become more convinced that using the Hybrid III will help ensure that all new vehicles are designed with the benefit of the most human-like test dummy available. NHTSA regards the Hybrid III as more representative of human responses in frontal crashes, and it can monitor more types of potential injuries as well. Further, NHTSA has come to recognize that exclusive use of the Hybrid III for compliance testing under FMVSS 208 would result in greater comparability of test results among vehicles produced by different manufacturers.", "For these reasons, the agency recently issued a Notice of Final Rule that requires the exclusive use of the Hybrid III for all compliance testing under standard no. 208. The final rule takes effect September 1, 1997, to coincide with the date at which all passenger cars and 80 percent of light trucks must be equipped with air bags and all light trucks must have passive (automatic) restraint systems. NCAP will also switch to exclusive use of the Hybrid III test dummy beginning with the 1996 model year. These modifications to the two programs will create a greater degree of standardization of crash tests, thereby, in NHTSA\u2019s view, increasing the \u201ccomparability of test results among vehicles produced by different manufacturers, particularly those that now use different dummy types.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Trends in Crash Test Results", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in NCAP Injury Risk Over Time", "paragraphs": ["We conducted analyses of the trends in NCAP test scores from 1979 through 1993 and found that scores have both improved and become more uniform during the period.

The figure also indicates that the significant reduction in the combined risk derives from a significant and consistent decrease in the mean head injury risk probability. While the mean chest injury risk declined significantly during the period, it has been relatively stable since 1983. The variation between the individual test results has also decreased over the years. For example, NCAP head injury criterion scores for vehicles in 1979 ranged from 521 HIC to 4,513 HIC, whereas in 1993, the range was between 273 HIC and 1,459 HIC.", "One reason for the decline in the mean combined injury risk and its accompanying variation over time is the increasingly widespread installation of air bags. Cars equipped with air bags had significantly lower head injury risk probabilities than cars without air bags. (See figure IV.2.) Since the first NCAP test of cars equipped with air bags in 1987, these vehicles have scored an average head injury risk of 0.063, while cars without air bags have averaged 0.216.", "There is little difference, however, between the mean chest injury risks for passenger cars equipped with air bags (0.108) and those that did not employ this type of restraint (0.120). (See figure IV.3.) Given the relatively flat chest injury risk shown in figure IV.1, it appears that this risk factor, regardless of the type of restraint, has contributed little to the declining trend for the combined injury risk.", "We also conducted similar analyses for passenger cars tested in the compliance program. Despite fluctuations from year to year, the combined injury risk did not change significantly from 1987 to 1993. (See figure IV.4.)", "For all passenger cars. Does not include light trucks and vans.", "During the same period a steady, though not statistically significant, decline in the mean head injury risk was offset by a significant increase in the mean chest injury risk. These opposing trends are associated with the increased installation of air bags, which are associated with lower head injury risk probabilities and higher chest injury risk probabilities for compliance tests. (See figures IV.5 and IV.6.)", "The contrasting chest injury risk results between NCAP and compliance programs may have occurred because of the differences in the configuration of the two tests\u2014largely from the determination of which restraint systems are used. In an NCAP crash that makes use of all available passive and manual restraint systems, the seat belt absorbs the dummy\u2019s kinetic energy over a gradual period (for a crash event) before the dummy contacts the air bag. However, cars with air bags are not required to have automatic seat belts. And since manual seat belts are not engaged in compliance tests, the dummy in the driver position is not likely to be restrained by a safety belt in compliance tests of cars with air bags. The dummy, therefore, is likely to move forward without a reduction in its kinetic energy, resulting in a more forceful collision with the air bag than if a seat belt was also in use. Over time, as more of the vehicles tested in the compliance program came equipped with air bags, the mean compliance chest score increased.", "This is not to say that an air bag-equipped vehicle is less safe than one that does not have an air bag. Indeed, the chest g results of cars with air bags may not be directly comparable to those without the devices because the distribution of the force loading on the chest is different for air bags than for safety belts. Air bags distribute the load caused by chest contact across a larger surface area than safety belts. Nevertheless, the higher chest g result for an air bag-equipped vehicle is consistent with the view held by many traffic safety experts that safety belts alone (that is, without air bags) are much more effective than airbags alone (that is, without safety belts).", "The decreasing mean crash test results parallel a similar trend with annual fatalities, and part of that latter trend can rightfully be attributed to NHTSA crash tests. In discussions with industry representatives, we found that automobile manufacturers attempt to design vehicles to meet compliance levels for frontal collisions in the NCAP test, as well as ensure that all other safety criteria are met. In addition to \u201clive\u201d crash tests, manufacturers use computer models of frontal collisions, rear and side impacts, and roof crush to simulate NHTSA crash tests and to ensure that the cars meet NHTSA standards. The types of simulations range from models of specific components of the vehicle to nonlinear finite-element models, which incorporate all specifications of the automobile and can predict interactions between the car and its occupants during a collision. These simulations allow manufacturers to gain insight into the deformation of the vehicle, likely intrusions into the occupant compartment, and the force loads generated by various structural components. Though computer- simulated crashes are expensive because they generally require access to a supercomputer, they do allow manufacturers to gain knowledge of how the car will perform and how to correct problems before building prototypes. They are also much less costly and less time-consuming than building and crashing prototypes. In addition, one simulation expert stated that the results of finite-element simulations generally reflect the results obtained in actual crash tests and that the industry uses crash tests in part to validate its computer-based crash models."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reliability of NCAP Results", "paragraphs": ["Our analyses of the trends in NCAP test results have shown that (1) injury risk probabilities have declined over time and (2) the variation between test results has lessened over time.

It would seem that cars have become more crashworthy\u2014at least as measured by NCAP\u2014and that this improved crashworthiness is more uniformly distributed across the passenger car fleet. Indeed, in 1979 the combined injury risk for NCAP-tested vehicles ranged from 0.106 to 1.0 (rounded), whereas in 1993, the ends of the distribution ranged from 0.096 to 0.581. Despite the decreased variation in test results, however, the difference between the highest and lowest risk probabilities is still substantial.", "This variation is open to two quite different interpretations. It may indicate the sensitivity of crash tests to real differences between vehicle models, or it may reflect the imprecision of the test scores. In classical measurement theory, reliability is defined as the repeatability of test results. The reliability of crash tests would be estimated by comparing the results from repeated crash tests of the same model vehicle.", "On only one occasion has NHTSA attempted to determine whether NCAP crash test results are, in fact, reproducible by crashing a single model on multiple occasions. In this study, 12 consecutively manufactured 1982 Chevrolet Citations were crash-tested by three test facilities, with each facility testing four vehicles, in an attempt \u201cto quantify the degree of variation, as well as develop generalized statistical conclusions about test repeatability.\u201d The mean HIC score for the 12 tests was 685, with the scores ranging from 495 HIC to 954 HIC. NHTSA identified several sources of variation in results derived from the test procedure, as well as from the testing facilities, the test instrumentation, the test dummy used, and the individual vehicles. NHTSA could not quantify the amount of variation attributable to each of these five areas because of the number of possible sources of error within each.", "Although the amount of variation that can be attributed to any of the sources of error is incalculable, the confounding interactions of accumulated error lead to questions about the reliability of NCAP results. The variation between different units was artificially constrained by selecting 12 consecutively manufactured Chevrolet Citations, yet the head injury results still had a range of 459 HIC. This variation among the HIC scores implies that two scores with a range of less than 219 are not, in statistical terms, significantly different and that any score between 781 HIC and 1,219 HIC is not significantly different from 1,000.", "Table V.1 illustrates how this level of reliability could affect the interpretation of other crash test scores. The table displays the mean HIC score from the 12 Citation crash tests and the HIC scores of four other vehicles of similar weight. It also indicates whether the NCAP HIC scores are significantly different from (1) the mean Citation score and (2) the putative ceiling of 1,000. The HIC scores received by all the vehicles except the 1990 Lexus are significantly lower than 1,000.

These data represent the results of crash tests of model-year 1991 through 1994 vehicles conducted by automobile manufacturers in tests that essentially duplicate the NCAP test conditions. The data were voluntarily submitted to NHTSA before planned NCAP tests.", "We compared the manufacturer scores with those obtained from NCAP after translating them into the single injury probability score that serves as the basis for NHTSA\u2019s recently introduced star rating system. (See appendix II.) We found that a statistically significant first-order correlation exists (r = .72) between the two sets of injury risk probabilities.", "We then compared the distributions of star ratings derived from NCAP and manufacturers\u2019 tests. Table V.2 compares the star ratings for the driver position, and table V.3, for the passenger position. If agreement between the two sets of tests had been perfect, all events in the tables would have fallen on the diagonals from upper left to lower right. In actuality, star ratings are the same for approximately one-half of the vehicle models tested (55 percent for the driver position and 45 percent for the passenger position). Differences of one or more stars exist between manufacturer and NCAP ratings for about one-half of the tests; 8 percent of the vehicle models have differences of two or more stars.", "As appendix II explains, each of NHTSA\u2019s star ratings represents a range of injury probability. For example, a rating of 4 stars indicates that in a crash situation similar to that tested by NHTSA the probability of serious injury to an individual is between 1 in 10 and 2 in 10. The solid bars in figure V.1 depict these probability ranges for each star rating. The lines attached to the bars represent \u201cconfidence intervals\u201d that we estimated from the standard deviation of the absolute difference between the combined injury risks for drivers derived from manufacturer and NCAP tests. These confidence intervals represent the estimated range of injury probability within which a vehicle with a nominal rating could be expected to vary if tested again. For example, a 4-star rating could be associated with a vehicle with a \u201ctrue\u201d injury probability between zero and 0.363. This range overlaps the confidence intervals associated with the 5- and 2-star ratings.", "Our estimates of the reliability of NCAP crash tests are based on the only two sources of relevant information we are aware of: the repeated crashes of the 1982 Chevrolet Citation, and a comparison of manufacturer and NCAP test scores from 1991 to 1994. Neither of these sources provides ideal information for precisely quantifying the measurement error associated with NCAP scores. We do not know how well the results of the Citation experiment can be applied to vehicles manufactured and crash-tested 10 years later. While the manufacturer-NCAP comparison applies to a large number of late-model cars, we cannot be sure how well the manufacturers succeeded in replicating NCAP crash test conditions in each case or to what extent the results from other manufacturer tests varied from the ones reported to NHTSA.", "Nevertheless, both analyses support the same conclusion that NCAP scores, whether reported in raw HIC and chest acceleration scores or as categories of injury probability, have associated levels of imprecision.

The NASS year corresponds to the calendar year rather than the automobile industry\u2019s model year, and emphasis is placed on the most recent 5 model-year vehicles.

NCAP results from 1983 through 1992 were chosen for the analysis for two reasons: (1) We assumed that crash test results are applicable for a given time (as cars age, their crashworthiness may decrease owing to wear and tear) and (2) NASS data were available for the calendar years 1988 through 1991. Because NASS emphasizes for inclusion collisions involving vehicles from the 5 most recent model years, we chose 5 years as the period of time at which a test score no longer applies; therefore, NCAP scores from 1983 were the earliest we included in the analysis. In addition, each NASS year has a half-year\u2019s data from the following model year, as the model year usually begins in late summer. Therefore, the 1991 NASS had some accidents involving 1992 model-year automobiles.", "The NCAP results were matched to the NASS data set on the following criteria: the make of the vehicle (that is, the manufacturer), the model, the model year, and the body type (sedan, convertible, and so forth).

Next, we regressed fatality rates on additional characteristics associated with vehicles using a Poisson model, which allows one to compare rates of individual cases, especially when the sample size is moderately large and the probability of an event occurring is either very low or very high.

Unfortunately, no equivalent test of how effective these changes were in reducing the variability between test scores was subsequently performed.", "After NHTSA had provided its official comments on our draft report, the agency also provided us with crash test results from automobile manufacturers for model-year 1991 through 1994 vehicles. These data were provided to NHTSA in preparation for tests conducted under NCAP and were results of tests that essentially duplicated the NCAP testing procedure. The agency had previously declined to provide this information because they considered it proprietary. We analyzed these data and have included our findings in the body of the report (see pp. 39-41). Though this information cannot define the boundaries of NCAP reliability, the difference between manufacturer and NCAP results reinforces our conclusion that the reliability of NCAP results is limited. 3. We do not disagree with NHTSA that rigorous protocols for crash testing are followed and that NHTSA verifies the results of the crash test with high-speed film. However, this process merely verifies that the accelerometers placed in the test dummy accurately recorded the data from the specific trial. It does not address the issue of reliability, which in classic statistical theory holds that test data are reliable if consistent results are obtained through repeated trials of an experiment using specific procedures. In the case of NCAP crash testing, a specified procedure exists, but the model of the test vehicle changes. Unless multiple trials of the same model line are conducted, we cannot determine the reliability of test results.", "We are sensitive to the costs the Agency could incur in addressing our recommendation that it update and publish, in clear language, its knowledge of the reliability of NCAP results. For this reason, we suggest that the Agency explore alternative means for accomplishing this goal, in particular by making use of the knowledge base developed by manufacturers. Regardless of the method the Agency uses to address the recommendation, its purpose will not be, as NHTSA suggests, to \u201cenhance the scientific reliability of its data\u201d or \u201cnarrow its standard deviation,\u201d but to assure American consumers that they are provided with accurate information about the relative crashworthiness of vehicles. 4. We agree that NHTSA has found a statistically significant difference between the fatality risk of belted drivers involved in two-car frontal collisions in cars with \u201cgood\u201d NCAP performance and those that were \u201cpoor\u201d performers. In our analysis of the fatality rates, though using a different methodology, we found similar results.", "The analyses we performed shared a common weakness with NHTSA\u2019s; namely, they were both limited to a relatively small proportion of real-world crashes. NHTSA\u2019s estimate of reduced fatality risk for better scoring NCAP cars is derived from analyses using only two-car crashes in which both drivers were belted and at least one occupant was killed. These conditions limited their analyses to between 81 and 170 crashes. (NHTSA\u2019s database was drawn from the 1979 through 1991 FARS years, which represent between 40,000 and 50,000 highway fatalities annually.)", "Our analysis was also limited to NCAP cars involved in fatal accidents with restrained drivers, although we also included single-vehicle crashes and FARS data from 1987 through 1991. These limitations reduced our sample to 884 cars. Both NHTSA and we agree that a statistically significant correlation between NCAP scores and real-world crashes can be found but, to use NHTSA\u2019s words, the correlation is \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d Our analyses suggested that this correlation derived from the fatality rates of the worst scoring cars, and not from crashworthiness differences among relatively good NCAP performers. 5. We generally agree with NHTSA\u2019s comment that the improvement in NCAP scores over time has contributed to an improvement in highway safety. However, many other influences unrelated to crash testing, such as safety belt usage laws, and the toughening of drunk driving laws, have also contributed to this trend. 6. Our report does not address the purported ease of interpretation associated with the new star rating system. However, we did incorporate NHTSA\u2019s new reporting system into our analysis of the new data provided us by NHTSA. Our findings provide detail to support the conclusion of our draft report: that a reporting system can be no more reliable than the scoring system on which it is based.", "We disagree that the new star rating system \u201celiminates . . .  implied precision\u201d of HIC, chest, and femur scores. It is true that some cars with nonsignificant differences in scores would end up in the same category under the new system, and thus correctly be presented to the public as roughly equal in crashworthiness. However, it is also true that other cars with nonsignificant score differences could be placed in different categories, a scoring artifact that incorrectly implies substantial differences in the relative levels of crash protection provided by the vehicles. For example, while a vehicle with a chest g of 40 and a HIC of 550 will receive 5 stars, one with a chest g of 40 and a HIC of 555 will receive 4 stars. We do not believe that this difference in HIC scores implies an actual crashworthiness difference. 7. NHTSA appears to suggest that it has already complied with this recommendation through the adoption of its new reporting system. We disagree. The new system, while seemingly clear, does not communicate to the public the band of uncertainty associated with star ratings. Our analyses of the manufacturers\u2019 NCAP test results suggests that this band is sizable and illustrates its potential effects. However, additional information needs to be collected and analyzed before the precision of crash test results can be adequately defined. 8. The recommendation is to explore alternative methods for determining the crashworthiness of vehicles. We cited computer simulations as one promising avenue to explore. We recognize the limitations of the current capabilities of computer simulations (the high cost of supercomputers, the complexity of programming, and so on), and we agree with NHTSA that this technology could not replace actual crash tests in the near future. However, NHTSA\u2019s comment suggests that it has examined the potential benefits of this rapidly emerging technology and has dismissed them. We believe that it should continue to monitor and periodically reassess them.", "It appears to us that as the technology develops and becomes less costly, the potential benefits of such a system extending to a much larger set of crashes than NCAP now considers at some point in the future may outweigh its costs.", "Other possible approaches include ones that NHTSA is already considering, such as extending the range of tests to include both side-impact crashes and frontal-offset crashes. While such tests would expand the applicability of NCAP tests to a larger portion of real-world events, they would also substantially increase the costs of the program. This consideration reinforces our belief that the costs and benefits of alternative approaches such as computer modeling need to be revisited regularly over the next decade. 9. We are aware of the limitations of the NASS database, and we agree with NHTSA that the number of cases that mimic the NCAP configuration are few. Indeed, in the 4 years of NASS data we analyzed for the project, only 46 of over 14,000 cases applied to our model most closely resembled the NCAP configuration.", "We disagree that the methodology was inappropriate. The models used in the analyses were designed not only to simulate the NCAP conditions, but also to discover the sensitivity of NCAP for predicting other frontal collisions, and thereby maximize the number of frontal crash configurations for which the test was applicable and meaningful. It seems reasonable to expect that, given enough cases, NCAP should predict real-world traffic injuries and fatalities in collisions that essentially duplicate the test conditions; however, given the small number of actual events that apply to this configuration, the meaning of any unweighted statistically significant relationship is questionable. 10. There is no contradiction between these statements. NCAP\u2019s relative rankings of different models may be inaccurate in some cases. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the parallel improvement in NCAP scores and highway safety statistics over the past 15 years is totally coincidental. 11. We agree with NHTSA\u2019s comment about manufacturer participation in NCAP, and the language has been changed. With respect to the quasi-regulatory nature of NCAP, manufacturers repeatedly stated that they must design automobiles to meet this test as if it were the standard. In oral commentary on our draft report, one NHTSA official pointed out that almost all passenger cars meet compliance standards in the NCAP test, and that \u201cin effect, it\u2019s a de facto standard.\u201d 12. The 220-point reduction in the mean HIC falls short of statistical significance (p = .171). This, we believe, is a function of the low number of cases and high variations in the early years of compliance testing. Although the decline is not statistically significant, we would reiterate that, on average, vehicles tested for compliance with FMVSS 208 tend to have HIC and chest acceleration scores that are far below the maximum allowable levels. 13. Although \u201cit has not been proven,\u201d it seems reasonable to assume that a 1979 vehicle that was involved in an accident in 1991 no longer had the same level of structural integrity as it did when it was new, owing to the rusting of the frame, for example, or the weakening of welds. It also seems reasonable to assume that a 1979 model-year vehicle would not perform at its full original safety potential in a collision that occurred in 1991. 14. As our report states, and NHTSA cites, no statistical analysis can, by itself, establish cause-and-effect linkage, and we do not demand this result of our analyses. 15. We accepted NHTSA\u2019s suggestion and used SUDAAN to perform additional analyses of the NASS data. The results were inconclusive. In one case (two-vehicle collisions), we found a statistically significant relationship between NCAP scores and serious injury. (See table VI.4.) However, this result could easily be spurious since the application of NASS sampling weights (which vary substantially and can be quite large) to the small subset of cases that both fit our criteria and have no missing data can greatly distort the analysis. If, as NHTSA suggests, a subset of NASS data is \u201cinsufficient to conduct any type of statistical analyses,\u201d applying sampling weights to a nonrandom selection of variously weighted cases is potentially misleading. 16. We are aware that in some analyses, NHTSA has used the combination of subject vehicle weight and its ratio to the other vehicle weight as predictors of injury instead of simply using the weight of the two vehicles.", "We did not feel it necessary to reanalyze the data using weight and weight ratio since, as NHTSA has pointed out, they \u201care mathematically equivalent to the information provided by the two individual vehicle weights.\u201d17. We used the traditional adjustment, the ratio of fatalities to the number of registered vehicles, to correct for the variations in exposure to accident involvement among the NCAP-tested vehicles. We agree with NHTSA that other factors, such as driver age and driving history, are also important predictors of accident involvement and are not captured by this adjustment.  Our goal here, however, was to answer the simple question: Are proportionately more drivers killed in poor scoring NCAP cars than in better scoring cars? Our answer is \u201cyes.\u201d 18. Based on NHTSA\u2019s comment, we converted HIC and chest g scores to the combined injury probability, which forms the basis for NHTSA\u2019s new rating system, and used it as a variable in the analyses conducted and presented in this report. 19.
