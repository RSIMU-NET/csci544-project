To store assets, terrorists may choose similar commodities that maintain their value and liquidity. The extent of terrorists' use of alternative financing mechanisms is unknown, owing to the criminal nature of terrorists' use of alternative financing mechanisms and the lack of systematic data collection and analysis of case information. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not systematically collect and analyze data on these mechanisms. Furthermore, the Departments of the Treasury and of Justice have not yet produced a report, required under the 2002 National Money Laundering Strategy, which was to form the basis of a strategy to address how money is moved or value transferred via trade in precious stones and commodities. In monitoring terrorists' use of alternative financing mechanisms, the U.S. government faces a number of challenges, including accessing ethnically or criminally based terrorist networks, targeting high-risk financing mechanisms that the adaptable terrorists use, and sharing data on charities with state officials.

As initial U.S. and  foreign government deterrence efforts focused on terrorists\u2019 use of the  formal banking or mainstream financial system, terrorists may have been  forced to increase their use of various alternative financing mechanisms.

Al Qaeda is an international terrorist  network led by Osama bin Laden that seeks to rid Muslim countries of  western influence and replace their governments with fundamentalist  Islamic regimes. The al Qaeda network conducted the September 11 attack  on the United States and was responsible for the August 1998 bombings of  U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as other violent attacks on  U.S. interests. Al Qaeda reportedly operates through autonomous  underground cells in 60 to 100 estimated locations worldwide, including  the United States. Hizballah is a Lebanese group of Shiite militants that  seeks to create a Muslim fundamentalist state in Lebanon modeled on Iran.  Hizballah has planned, or been linked to, numerous terrorist attacks  against America, Israel, and other western targets. Although Hizballah\u2019s  leadership is based in Lebanon, Hizballah is a vast organization with a  global network of supporters and established cells in Africa, North and  South America, Asia, and Europe. According to the State Department,  HAMAS has pursued the goal of replacing Israel with an Islamic  Palestinian state. While HAMAS supplies humanitarian aid to Palestinians  and has participated in peaceful political activity, the organization  conducts large-scale suicide bombings. According to the State  Department, HAMAS currently limits its terrorist operations to targeting  Israeli civilians and the Israeli military in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank,  and Israel, but Americans have been killed in HAMAS attacks, and the  organization raises funds in North America and Western Europe.", "These terrorist organizations are known to have used alternative financing  mechanisms to further their terrorist activities. Government officials and  researchers believe that terrorists do not always need large amounts of  assets to support an operation, pointing out that the estimated cost of the  September 11 attack was between $300,000 and $500,000. However,  government officials also caution that funding for such an operation uses a  small portion of the assets that terrorist organizations hold\u2014assets  earned, moved, or stored through mainstream financial or alternative  financing mechanisms. According to the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign  Assets Control, the support infrastructure critical for indoctrination,  recruitment, training, logistical support, the dissemination of propaganda,  and other material support requires substantial funding.", "A number of strategies and laws guide the U.S. government in deterring  terrorists\u2019 use of alternative financing mechanisms. Among the strategies,  for example, the Departments of Justice and the Treasury publish an  annual National Money Laundering Strategy, which has increasingly  focused on terrorist financing, including alternative financing methods.  This strategy sets goals for U.S. agencies in combating terrorist financing  and reports on progress made in implementing these goals. In addition, the  Department of State issues an annual International Narcotics Control  Strategy Report, which features a section describing mechanisms, cases,  and efforts to deter terrorist financing. Moreover, the President\u2019s National  Security Strategy of the United States of America calls for the United  States to work with its allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism by  blocking terrorist assets, and the National Strategy for Combating  Terrorism includes an objective to interdict and disrupt material support  for terrorists. Regarding laws, the authority of the USA PATRIOT Act of  2001 significantly expanded U.S. law enforcement\u2019s ability to deter,  investigate, and prosecute cases of terrorist financing. More recently, the  United States enacted the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism  Convention Implementation Act of 2002, which implements the  requirements of the 1999 International Convention for the Suppression of  the Financing of Terrorism. Among its provisions, this act makes it a crime  to provide or collect funds with the intention of using the money for  terrorist activities.", "Deterring terrorists\u2019 use of alternative financing mechanisms falls within  the overall U.S. interagency framework of plans, agency roles, and  interagency coordination mechanisms designed to combat terrorism. In  general, the National Security Council manages the overall interagency  framework. The National Security Council heads the Counterterrorism  Security Group, which is composed of high-level representatives (at the  Assistant Secretary level) from key federal agencies that combat terrorism.  To implement directives and strategies, various federal agencies are  assigned key roles and responsibilities based on their core missions.

To earn assets, they focus on profitable crimes or  scams involving commodities such as smuggled cigarettes, counterfeit  goods, and illicit drugs and the use of systems such as charitable  organizations that collect large sums.

Terrorists have been reportedly involved in  trafficking illicit drugs, the most lucrative commodity illegally traded,  according to the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics  and Law Enforcement Affairs. According to the U.S. State Department\u2019s  2003 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, this trade is valued  in the billions and allows drug traffickers to corrupt government and law  enforcement officials worldwide, particularly in countries with weakly  enforced laws and regulations where officials are poorly paid. In East Asia,  trafficking in drugs and weapons\u2014as well as engaging in organized crime  and official corruption\u2014are serious international crimes that terrorist  organizations have exploited to finance their operations. In South Asia, al  Qaeda is reported to have trafficked heroin to support its operations and  Osama bin Laden was reportedly involved. In Latin America, terrorists  trafficked in drugs and arms to finance their activities. In some South  American countries, international terrorist groups have established  support bases that sustain their worldwide operations. For example, the  triborder area where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay  converge continues to be a safe haven for Hizballah and HAMAS, where  the organizations raise funds to finance their operations through criminal  enterprises.

According to officials from the ATF, Hizballah, HAMAS, and al  Qaeda have earned assets through trafficking in contraband cigarettes or  counterfeit cigarette tax stamps. ATF officials told us that as of August  20, 2003, they were investigating at least six such cases with ties to  terrorist groups. ATF officials also believe that there are several other  investigations under way that may produce evidence linking them to  terrorist groups. In the one closed case example, during 2002, an ATF  investigation revealed a conspiracy where the defendants were illegally  trafficking cigarettes from 1996 to 2000 between North Carolina, a low tax  state, and Michigan, a high tax state, and funneling some of the illegal  proceeds back to the Hizballah. In this case, family and religious ties  enabled the smugglers to sell illegal cigarettes at a network of small  convenience stores in Michigan. Figure 1 shows how the Charlotte, North  Carolina, Hizballah cell profited from this illegal activity. The total value of  the assets seized was about $1.5 million and consisted of cigarettes, real  property, and currency. The investigation resulted in at least two  convictions, in June 2002, for cigarette trafficking, money laundering, and  providing material support to a terrorist organization. More generally, the  opportunity to earn illegal profits in the cigarette industry is significant  given the growing trend of counterfeit cigarettes and Internet cigarette  sales. According to a European Commission Anti-Fraud Office official,  cigarette smuggling is widespread in Europe, and in many eastern  European countries smuggled cigarettes are commonly used as currency.  (The Anti-Fraud Office could not formally discuss ongoing cases involving  terrorists\u2019 links, because it would jeopardize ongoing investigations.)", "Terrorist organizations have earned funds using systems such as  charitable organizations that provide a ready source of sizable funds  generated from religious, ethnic, or geographic ties between people with  similar interests. In many countries, charitable giving is a religious duty  and, although most contributions are intended for legitimate humanitarian  purposes, terrorists are able to divert these funds owing to the lack of  oversight or financial controls for charities to ensure that moneys are  spent according to their intended purpose. The potential misuse of  charitable contributions by terrorist organizations can take many forms.  According to the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering\u2019s  2002-2003 Report on Money Laundering Typologies, some charitable  organizations were established with a stated charitable purpose but may  actually exist in part or only to earn funds for a terrorist organization. For  example, according to the Treasury, Holy Land Foundation for Relief and  Development in Texas raised $13 million in the United States in 2000,  claiming that the money it solicited went to care for needy Palestinians,  although evidence shows that HAMAS used some of the money that the  Holy Land Foundation raised to support suicide bombers and their  families. Terrorists or their supporters may also infiltrate legitimate  charitable organizations and divert funds to directly or indirectly support  terrorist organizations. In both cases, the charitable organizations may  collect donations from both witting and unwitting donors. An example of a  witting donor would be one who donated funds to a charity knowing that  the funds would go to al Qaeda. An unwitting donor would be one who  donated funds to the charity not knowing that funds would go to al Qaeda."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Terrorists Move Assets via Systems and Commodities That Allow Ease of Concealment and Liquidity", "paragraphs": ["To move assets, terrorists use mechanisms that enable them to conceal or  launder their assets through nontransparent trade or financial transactions  such as charities, informal banking systems, bulk cash, and commodities  such as precious stones and metals. Although charities and informal  banking systems serve many legitimate purposes, they entail a significant  degree of nontransparency that terrorist groups and their supporters can  exploit to move funds raised in the United States and elsewhere across  borders. To carry assets across borders without detection, terrorists seek  to smuggle bulk cash or convert their assets into commodities that are  relatively liquid and easy to conceal. Terrorists can also convert their  assets into internationally traded commodities that serve as forms of  currency, such as gold, but are not subject to standard financial reporting  requirements. Commodities that can be smuggled owing to their ease of  concealment are particularly attractive. While terrorists use legitimate  systems and commodities in an illicit manner to move their assets, they  may also use illicit means such as trade-based money laundering to move  assets or settle accounts.

For example, according to  court documents, the Global Relief Foundation, an Illinois-based charity,  sends more than 90 percent of its donations abroad, and, according to  DOJ, the foundation has connections to and has provided support and  assistance to individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda  network, and other known terrorist groups. The Global Relief Foundation  has also been linked to financial transactions with the Holy Land  Foundation. Similarly, the DOJ asserts that the Illinois-based Benevolence  International Foundation moved charitable contributions fraudulently  solicited from donors in the United States to locations abroad to support  terrorist activities.

An informal banking system is one in  which money is received for the purpose of making it, or an equivalent  value, payable to a third party in another geographic location, whether or  not in the same form. Such transfers generally take place outside the  conventional banking system through nonbank money services businesses  or other, often unregulated and undocumented, business entities whose  primary business activity may not be the transmission of money.  Traditionally, expatriates\u2014traders and immigrant laborers\u2014used informal  banking systems by sending money home from or to countries lacking  formal and secure banking systems. Informal systems are still used by  immigrant ethnic populations in the United States and elsewhere today.  Such systems are based on trust and the extensive use of connections such  as family relationships or regional affiliations. These systems also often  involve transactions out of the United States to remote areas with no  formal banking system or to countries with weak financial regulations,  such as Afghanistan and Somalia, where the Al Barakaat informal banking  system moved funds for al Qaeda. Figure 3 provides an example of how a  simple hawala transaction can occur.", "According to FinCEN, while the majority of informal banking systems\u2019  activity may be legitimate in purpose, these systems have been used to  facilitate the financing of terrorism and the furtherance of criminal  activities. As a result, law enforcement and international entities have  focused a great deal of attention on the possibility that terrorist financing  takes place through informal banking systems such as hawala to move  money, particularly since September 11. For example, according to the  FBI, some of the 19 September 11 hijackers allegedly used hawala to  transfer thousands of dollars in and out of the United States prior to their  attacks. Somalis working in the United States used the Al Barakaat  informal banking network, founded with a significant investment from  Osama bin Laden, to send money to their families in Somalia.

Bulk cash smuggling is an attractive financing mechanism because U.S.  dollars are accepted as an international currency and can always be  converted; there is no traceable paper trail; there is no third party such as  a bank official to become suspicious of the transaction; and the terrorist  has total control of the movement of the money. Conversely, the factors  against cash smuggling include the costs of couriers and equipment, the  risk of the courier stealing the money, the risk of informants within the  network, or losses due to border searches or government inquiries that  could compromise the network or mission. In the United States, bulk cash  smuggling is a money laundering and terrorism financing technique that is  designed to bypass financial transparency reporting requirements. Often  the currency is smuggled into or out of the United States concealed in  personal effects, secreted in shipping containers, or transported in bulk  across the border via vehicle, vessel, or aircraft. According to the FBI,  some of the 19 September 11 hijackers allegedly used bulk cash as another  method to transfer funds.", "Furthermore, in response to the September 11 events, Customs initiated  an outbound-currency operation, Operation Oasis, to refocus its efforts to  target 23 identified nations involved in money laundering.

Diamonds are also easily  smuggled because they have high value and low weight and are  untraceable and odorless. The international diamond industry is  fragmented, with numerous small mining operations located in remote  areas of Africa, in countries that have porous borders and no rule of law.  There is limited transparency in diamond flows owing to the complex way  in which diamonds move from mine to consumer, the existence of  significant data inconsistencies, and the industry\u2019s historical avoidance of  close scrutiny. Diamonds are often traded fraudulently, and smuggling  routes for rough diamonds are well established by those who have used  such routes for decades to evade taxes or move stolen diamonds.  According to a Belgian law enforcement official, a substantial number of  the diamonds traded in Antwerp, the world\u2019s largest trading center, are  sold on the black market with no transaction records.

According to OGQ officials,  they had approximately 580 open terrorist financing cases and 559 closed  cases between OGQ\u2019s inception in October 2001 and February 2003.  However, Customs officials told us that, although cases may initially be  thought to have a terrorist link and be categorized as such in their  database, they might not be recategorized as nonterrorist cases once no  terrorist link was found. Rather, the database captured criminal cases that  may or may not have had a terrorist link; and the number of actual cases  with a terrorist link, which would also depend on how \u201clink\u201d is defined, is  not readily known. Second, ICE officials and former OGQ officials  confirmed that they could not readily distinguish among the types of  alternative financing mechanisms in their case database. According to  these officials, it would take an intensive effort to segregate data by  categories of alternative financing mechanisms. They said that they  believed they could accomplish this, but that it would take resources and  time, because the system was not set up to search for these mechanisms.  Further, this method does not identify a terrorist link, requiring further  effort to determine whether such a link existed.", "Moreover, while ICE officials use an analytical tool known as the  Numerically Integrated Information System to investigate money  laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities, the tool, while  useful, could not be used to automatically analyze information on  alternative methods of terrorist financing and the extent of their use. The  tool enables users to analyze databases for anomalies, criminal patterns,  and specific transactions in global commerce when the user knows what  to look for, based on other information or a tip; however, the tool does not  automatically identify problem areas for attention. For example, if ICE  officials know to compare export and import data between the United  States and another country, and that country shares its data, then trade  anomalies can be identified and further investigated using a number of  databases and features. Customs officials used the system to identify  money laundering based on irregular patterns in the gold trade between  the United States and Argentina. However, the tool cannot be used to  automatically flag anomalies in all U.S. imports and exports. Officials  agreed that an automated feature would be beneficial and they believed  that it would be developed in the future. Further, according to the May  13, 2003, DOJ and DHS memorandum of agreement concerning the FBI\u2019s  management of terrorist financing cases, resulting DHS analyses will be  shared with the FBI, but it remains unclear how or if this information  might be integrated with FBI databases or analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis and Reporting on Terrorist Use of Alternative Financing Is Limited and Sometimes Conflicting", "paragraphs": ["Despite an acknowledged need from some U.S. government officials and  researchers for further analysis of the extent of terrorists\u2019 use of  alternative financing mechanisms, in some cases, U.S. government  reporting on these issues has not always been timely or comprehensive.

We recognize the inherent difficulty in monitoring  terrorists\u2019 use of alternative financing mechanisms and highlight three key  challenges in this report. First, accessing the networks through which  alternative financing mechanisms operate is difficult for U.S. authorities,  because such systems are close knit and nontransparent. Second, the  adaptable nature of terrorist groups can hinder authorities\u2019 efforts to  target industries and systems vulnerable to terrorists\u2019 use. Finally, when  monitoring alternative financing mechanisms, U.S. agencies face  competing priorities that may present challenges for utilizing and  enforcing existing laws and regulations or fully implementing strategic  efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accessing Terrorists\u2019 Close-knit, Nontransparent Financing Networks Presents Challenges for U.S. Law Enforcement", "paragraphs": ["The difficulty of accessing the networks through which alternative  financing mechanisms operate represents a significant challenge for U.S.  efforts to monitor terrorists\u2019 use of such mechanisms. In particular, these  networks are difficult to access because they are close knit and based on  trust. Informal banking systems, the diamond industry, and organized  crime networks such as those that smuggle cigarettes and drugs are  examples of alternative financing mechanisms that share these common  factors. Similarly, terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda and Hizballah  are close knit and difficult to penetrate. The closeness and high degree of  trust between parties to terrorist financing networks are often based on  long-standing ethnic, family, religious, or organized criminal ties.  According to officials from U.S. law enforcement and the Treasury,  investigators who seek to monitor such networks rely on developing  inside sources of information, but the high degree of trust within the  networks poses challenges for recruiting informants and conducting  undercover operations. Law enforcement and the Treasury also report that  language and cultural barriers can increase the difficulty of accessing such  networks by impeding communication between government officials and  parties to the networks.", "Nontransparency in many of these alternative financing mechanisms poses  another challenge to U.S. law enforcement\u2019s ability to access and monitor  terrorists\u2019 use of them. One component of this nontransparency is lacking  or indecipherable transaction records. While officials report that  transaction records in the formal banking sector have been critical to their  ability to freeze terrorists\u2019 assets, the lack of a paper trail created by  alternative financing mechanisms limits investigators\u2019 ability to track and  apprehend terrorist financiers. In one case, DEA pursued drug smugglers  with suspected terrorist links who used hawala to transfer their profits to  Lebanon. However, the indecipherable records of the hawala transactions  to Lebanon impeded DEA\u2019s ability to trace the money once it reached  Lebanon. As a result, DEA was not able to ascertain if the smugglers were  providing material support to terrorists.", "In addition to the lack of a paper trail, key trade data and accountability  measures for industries vulnerable to terrorist financing can be poor or  nonexistent, contributing to this nontransparency. For example,  international data on the diamond industry show that import, export, and  production statistics often contain glaring inconsistencies.  Comprehensive international trade data on the industry are not available  in volume terms, even though volume data are a better indicator of true  trade flows. These data flaws inhibit analysts\u2019 ability to find patterns and  anomalies that could reveal criminal smuggling of the diamonds, including  for terrorist financing. Further, as we previously reported, while a recent  international initiative to curb trade in illicit diamonds, known as the  Kimberley Process, incorporates some elements of increased  transparency, critical shortcomings exist with regard to internal controls  and monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Terrorists\u2019 Adaptability Hinders Efforts to Target High-risk Mechanisms of Terrorist Financing", "paragraphs": ["Terrorist organizations\u2019 adaptability can hinder U.S. law enforcement\u2019s  efforts to target industries and mechanisms that are at a high risk for  terrorist financing. According to law enforcement and researchers, once  terrorists know that authorities are scrutinizing a mechanism they use to  earn, move, or store assets, they may switch to an alternate industry,  commodity, or fundraising scheme to avoid detection. According to a  former intelligence official, in one case, terrorists who were counterfeiting  household appliances switched to creating their own appliance brand  when law enforcement began to scrutinize their activities. Analysts from  the former Customs Service have identified various counterfeit goods  including CDs, DVDs, and apparel as having a possible connection to  terrorist financing.", "Additionally, according to researchers, terrorist groups such as al Qaeda  can exploit their geographically diffuse structure to move the location of  their operations if they are notified that authorities are pursuing their  financing activities in a particular location. The DOJ reports that the  Director of the Pakistan office of the Benevolence International  Foundation, an international charity whose U.S. Executive Director was  indicted for supporting al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations,  avoided a Pakistani intelligence investigation by moving to Afghanistan  with the foundation\u2019s money and documents. Within the United States,  geographic flexibility may also facilitate terrorist financing. For example,  according to IRS investigators and researchers, terrorists may have moved  their charity from one state to another and changed the charity\u2019s name to  evade law enforcement.", "This adaptability also presents challenges in monitoring terrorists\u2019 use of  informal banking systems, such as hawala. The USA PATRIOT Act  strengthened existing anti-money laundering laws by requiring that  operators of informal banking systems register with FinCEN and obtain  state licenses, where required under state law. The act also requires that  informal banking systems report suspicious transactions to FinCEN and  maintain anti-money laundering programs. However, officials and  researchers report that these requirements are difficult to enforce, and it is  likely that numerous small hawala operations remain unregistered and  noncompliant with one or more of these requirements. Terrorists may  have adapted to these new regulations by developing and maintaining  relationships and conducting business with the hawala operators that  remain underground, increasing the likelihood that their transactions will  not be detected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competing Priorities Present Challenges for Monitoring of Alternative Financing Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["Addressing competing priorities presents challenges for U.S. government  agencies\u2019 efforts to monitor use of alternative financing mechanisms.

While the FBI is the  lead agency on terrorist financing investigations, all agencies have an  inherent responsibility to aid in this effort. However, some agency officials  noted that new tasks sometimes compete with traditional roles or increase  workloads, creating a strain on their resources, which could slow the  sharing of potentially useful information.

While neither the IRS\u2019s nor the states\u2019 primary goal is deterring  terrorism, using data-sharing systems is even more important now, when  feasible, in light of the charities cases involving terrorist financing. States  have an important role in combating terrorist financing because states  share overall oversight responsibility for charities with the IRS. Further,  according to state officials, questionable charities tend to move from state  to state to avoid detection. According to the President of the National  Association of State Charitable Organizations, the system of proactive  information-sharing discussed with us in 2002 (including final denials of  applications, final revocations of tax-exempt status, and notices of a tax  deficiency) could be very useful for states in identifying and shutting down  suspect charities, including charities involving terrorist financing.
