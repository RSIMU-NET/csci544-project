However, not more than 1 in 500 DI beneficiaries, and few SSI beneficiaries, have left the rolls to return to work. Therefore, although they may provide a measure of income security, DI and SSI do little to enhance work capacities and promote economic independence.", "Yet societal attitudes, as reflected in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), have shifted toward goals of economic self-sufficiency and the right of people with disabilities to full participation in society. Moreover, medical advances and new technologies provide more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities to work.

After the onset of a disabling condition, a worker with a temporary work incapacity may receive short-term cash benefits from an employer, a private insurer, one of the few states providing temporary disability insurance, or a workers\u2019 compensation program. Those who do not return to the workplace may seek long-term cash benefits to replace lost wages.", "A worker covered under Social Security and unable to work because of a severe long-term disability could be eligible for cash benefits from DI\u2014the country\u2019s long-term public disability insurance program. Workers can supplement DI coverage with cash benefits from private long-term disability insurance or pensions if their employers provide such plans or if the workers have purchased supplemental insurance on their own. Moreover, workers injured on the job can receive cash benefits through their states\u2019 employer-financed workers\u2019 compensation programs. An individual can receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits and DI simultaneously, although the DI cash benefit generally is reduced by workers\u2019 compensation. But a worker who is ineligible for cash benefits from either private insurance or workers\u2019 compensation and who is unable to be accommodated in the workplace may discover that DI offers the only potential for wage replacement.", "Long-term cash benefits may also be sought by people with disabilities who have low income and limited resources, regardless of their work histories. SSI provides income support at the national level regardless of work connection for low-income people with disabilities. Similarly, a veteran with wartime service who has low income and a disability unrelated to active military duty can be eligible for a veteran\u2019s pension.", "DI and SSI are the two largest federal programs providing cash assistance to people with disabilities. DI, established in 1956, is an insurance program funded by payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers into a Social Security trust fund. The program is designed to insure covered workers against loss of income due to a disabling condition. Workers who have worked long enough and recently enough become insured for DI coverage. In addition to cash assistance, Medicare coverage is provided to DI beneficiaries after they have received cash benefits for 24 months. In 1995, about 4.2 million working-age people (aged 18 to 64) received DI cash benefits. DI cash benefits in that year totaled about $36.6 billion, with average monthly cash benefits amounting to $680 per person. In 1994, the Congress reallocated payroll tax receipts, estimated to total almost $500 billion by the end of 2016, from the Social Security Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund to the DI Trust Fund to prevent impending insolvency.", "In contrast, SSI is a means-tested income assistance program for disabled, blind, or aged individuals regardless of their prior participation in the labor force. Established in 1972 for individuals with low income and limited resources, SSI is financed from general revenues. In most states, SSI entitlement ensures an individual\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid benefits. In 1995, about 2.4 million working-age people with disabilities and 917,000 children under 18 received SSI benefits. In the same year, federal SSI cash benefits paid to SSI beneficiaries with disabilities equaled $20.6 billion, and average monthly SSI cash benefits amounted to about $365 per beneficiary.", "The DI and SSI programs use the same statutory definition of disability. To meet this definition, an adult must be determined to be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last at least 1 year. Moreover, the statutory definition further specifies that, for a person to be determined to be disabled, the impairment must be of such severity that the person not only is unable to do his or her previous work, but, considering his or her age, education, and work experience, is unable to do any other kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy. (See app. I for a more complete description of the five-step process used to determine DI and SSI eligibility.)", "Once a person is on the disability rolls, disability benefits continue until one of three things happens: the beneficiary dies; SSA determines that the beneficiary is no longer eligible for benefits; or, for DI beneficiaries, benefits convert to Social Security retirement benefits at age 65. Generally, a beneficiary loses eligibility for benefits for one of two reasons: the beneficiary earns more income than allowed or SSA decides that the beneficiary\u2019s medical condition has improved to the point that he or she is no longer considered disabled. To make this latter determination, SSA periodically performs continuing disability reviews."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiple Factors Contribute to Rapid Program Growth", "paragraphs": ["DI and SSI grew rapidly between 1985 and 1995.

(See fig. 1.) At the same time, while the number of working-age beneficiaries who received disability benefits increased from 4.0 million to 6.6 million, DI and SSI experienced an increase in the proportion of adult beneficiaries with the types of impairments that lead to the longest entitlement periods, signifying lengthy stays on the rolls for some. Individuals with mental impairments accounted for most of this growth. (See app. II for an overview of the reasons for program growth.)", "The number of children receiving SSI has more than tripled since 1990, from about 300,000 to more than 900,000 in 1995. A number of factors have contributed to the growth in children\u2019s awards, including outreach efforts by SSA and child advocates, rising numbers of children in poverty, and major changes in the criteria for determining whether children are disabled.

For other beneficiaries, the ability to find and maintain employment may be challenging because they need to learn basic skills and work habits and build self-esteem to function in the workplace. Some may lack access to the assistive technologies that could enhance their work potential. Still others might face tight labor market conditions, particularly for low-wage positions, that could constrain employment opportunities. Moreover, the nature of some disabilities may limit full-time work, while others may result in logistical obstacles such as transportation difficulties. And despite antidiscrimination laws, some disabilities may stigmatize individuals, making them appear less attractive to employers and less likely to be hired.", "While beneficiaries may face many challenges in attempting to return to work, research suggests that successful transitions to work may be more likely for younger people with disabilities and for those who have greater motivation to work and more education. Studies have shown that a significant number of DI and SSI beneficiaries possess these characteristics. The DI and SSI disability rolls increasingly are composed of a significant number of younger individuals. Among working-age DI and SSI beneficiaries, one out of three is under the age of 40. In addition, in 1993, 35 percent of the 84,000 DI beneficiaries who responded to an SSA questionnaire in May 1993 expressed an interest in receiving rehabilitation or other services that could help them return to work, an indication of motivation.

The Social Security Act requires that the assessment of an applicant\u2019s work incapacity be based on the presence of medically determinable physical and mental impairments. SSA maintains a Listing of Impairments (usually referred to as \u201cthe listings\u201d) for medical conditions that are presumed to be, according to SSA, ordinarily severe enough in themselves to prevent an individual from engaging in any gainful activity. About 70 percent of new awardees are eligible for disability benefits because their impairments meet or equal the listings. But findings of studies we reviewed generally agree that medical conditions are a poor predictor of work incapacity.", "Relevant studies indicate that the scientific link between work incapacity and medical condition is a weak one. While it is reasonable to expect that some medical impairments prevent individuals from engaging in work (for example, people who are quadriplegic with profound mental retardation), it is less clear that some other impairments that qualify individuals for disability benefits prevent individuals from engaging in any substantial gainful activity (for example, people who are missing both feet). Moreover, while most medical impairments influence the extent to which an individual is capable of engaging in gainful activity, other factors\u2014vocational, psychological, economic, environmental, and motivational\u2014are often considered to be more important determinants of work capacity.", "Concerns about the relationship between medical status and work incapacity were raised before the DI program was implemented. In deliberations leading to the establishment of the DI program, the 1948 Advisory Council on Social Security recommended that compensable disabilities be restricted to those that can be \u201cobjectively determined by medical examination or tests.\u201d Physicians, however, testified before the Congress that disability determination is inherently subjective and they could not provide the kind of objective determination that policymakers desired. According to this view, physicians can attest to the existence of medical impairments, but they can neither quantify inability to work nor certify that the impairments render a person unable to work. \u201cinformation about a claimant\u2019s medical condition and vocational background cannot conclusively demonstrate that he or she cannot work.

Conversely, applicants have a disincentive to demonstrate any capacity to work because doing so may disqualify them for benefits. Furthermore, the documentation involved in establishing one\u2019s disability can, many believe, create a \u201cdisability mind-set,\u201d which weakens motivation to work.

As part of their consideration of whether to undergo rehabilitation, attempt work, or both, beneficiaries may weigh the financial gains of working against the value of their monthly cash and health benefits. On the one hand, rehabilitation and work require significant time commitment and the chance of success is unknown; on the other hand, program benefits are secure and free individuals from having to devote time to obtaining economic stability.

At the end of the trial work period, if a beneficiary\u2019s countable earnings are more than $500 a month, cash benefits continue for an additional 3-month grace period and then stop, causing a precipitous drop in monthly income from full benefits to no cash benefits. SSA researchers have noted that such a drop in income is a considerable disincentive to finishing the trial work period as well as to beginning work.

When this coverage ends, these individuals may purchase Medicare coverage at the same monthly premium paid by uninsured retired beneficiaries. But the monthly premium\u2014exceeding $300 in 1996\u2014may be a hardship for beneficiaries, especially individuals with low earnings.

And, although less is known about how many DDS referrals are accepted by state VR agencies, previously we estimated that less than 10 percent of beneficiaries referred by DDSs were accepted as clients. Several factors contribute to limited access, including restrictive state VR policies that limit categories of people referred by DDSs, a referral process that is not monitored (reflecting its low priority and removing the incentive to spend time on referrals), and a success-based VR reimbursement system that is ineffective in motivating VR agencies to accept beneficiaries as clients.

Recognizing that new legislation may be required to implement such a strategy, we also recommended that SSA identify needed legislative changes to make such a return-to-work focus a reality. SSA agreed that beneficiaries face a number of barriers and disincentives that impede entry into the labor force and that many current beneficiaries have the potential to return to work. SSA expressed an interest in determining whether the return-to-work practices of other systems could be useful in improving beneficiary return-to-work rates and emphasized that making program improvements would involve input from a myriad of relevant federal, state, and private sector stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of Social Security shared our concern that beneficiaries face a number of barriers to entering or reentering the workforce and agreed that compelling reasons exist to try new return-to-work approaches. (See app. III for the full text of SSA\u2019s comments.) SSA is seeking statutory authority to create a voucher-type system that beneficiaries could voluntarily use to obtain rehabilitation and employment services from a participating public or private provider of their choice. Additionally, provision of extended medical coverage for beneficiaries who return to work is also being sought. These initiatives, reflected in the President\u2019s 1998 budget, attempt to place greater emphasis on return to work and to providing alternatives to the state VR agency structure. Although not specifically mentioned by SSA in its comments, given this increased priority we would expect to see SSA set explicit performance measures under its Government Performance and Results Act strategic plan regarding its return-to-work efforts.", "In its proposed initiatives, SSA recognizes that extending medical coverage can be an important factor in reducing the perceived risks a beneficiary faces in returning to work. But other weaknesses in the DI and SSI programs\u2014including a determination process that concentrates on applicants\u2019 incapacities and work incentives that act as disincentives\u2014remain unchanged, suggesting that the impact of SSA\u2019s initiatives may have a more limited effect than desired. A new VR service delivery system would be likely to have the greatest effect if it were integrated into a comprehensive return-to-work strategy that incorporates earlier intervention, a focus on developing productive capacity, and changes to the structure of benefits. Such a strategy would encourage beneficiaries to take advantage of rehabilitation services and provide incentives for beneficiaries to return to work.", "In addition, while we firmly advocate the critical importance of evaluation, the proposed 7-year pilot period for the new VR service delivery system apparently focuses on one system to the exclusion of other alternatives. If SSA tests only one type of service delivery system, the agency will forego the opportunity to compare the results of the proposed outcome-based payment system with those of alternative systems, such as combining outcome-based payments with reimbursements to providers based on milestones reached prior to the beneficiary leaving the rolls.", "SSA also made some technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and other interested parties.

In the first step, an SSA field office determines if an applicant is working at the level of substantial gainful activity and whether he or she meets the applicable nonmedical eligibility requirements (for example, residency, citizenship, Social Security insured status for DI, and income and resources for SSI). An applicant who is found to be not working or working but earning less than the substantial gainful activity level (minus allowable exclusions), and who meets the nonmedical eligibility requirements, has his or her case forwarded to a state Disability Determination Service (DDS) office. Applicants who do not meet these requirements, regardless of medical condition, are denied benefits.", "DDS offices gather medical, vocational, and other necessary evidence to determine if applicants are disabled under the Social Security law. In step two, the DDS office determines if the applicant has an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe and could be expected to last at least 12 months. According to SSA standards, a severe impairment is one that significantly limits an applicant\u2019s ability to do \u201cbasic work activities,\u201d such as standing, walking, speaking, understanding and carrying out simple instructions, using judgment, responding appropriately to supervision, and dealing with change. The DDS office collects all necessary medical evidence, either from those who have treated the applicant or, if that information is insufficient, from an examination conducted by an independent source. Applicants with severe impairments that are expected to last at least 12 months proceed to the third step in the disability determination process; applicants without such impairments are denied benefits.", "At step three, the DDS office compares the applicant\u2019s condition with the Listing of Impairments (the \u201clistings\u201d) developed by SSA. The listings contain over 150 categories of medical conditions (examples of conditions include the loss of both feet or an IQ score below 60) that, according to SSA, are severe enough ordinarily to prevent an individual from engaging in substantial gainful activity. An applicant whose impairment is cited in the listings or whose impairment is equally as severe or more severe than those impairments in the listings, and who is not engaging in substantial gainful activity, is found to be disabled and awarded benefits. An applicant whose impairment is not cited in the listings or whose impairment is less severe than those cited in the listings is evaluated further to determine whether he or she has vocational limitations that, when combined with the medical impairment(s), prevent work.", "In step four, the DDS office uses its physician\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s residual functional capacity to determine whether the applicant can still perform work he or she has done in the past. For physical impairments, residual functional capacity is expressed in certain demands of work activity (for example, ability to walk, lift, carry, push, pull, and so forth); for mental impairments, residual functional capacity is expressed in psychological terms (for example, whether a person can follow instructions and handle stress). If the DDS office finds that a claimant can perform work done in the past, benefits are denied.", "In the fifth and last step, the DDS office determines if an applicant who cannot perform work done in the past can do other work that exists in the national economy. Using SSA guidelines, the DDS considers the applicant\u2019s age, education, vocational skills, and residual functional capacity to determine what other work, if any, the applicant can perform. Unless the DDS office concludes that the applicant can perform work that exists in the national economy, benefits are allowed.", "At any point in the sequential evaluation process, an examiner can deny benefits for reasons relating to insufficient documentation or lack of cooperation by the applicant. Such reasons can include an applicant\u2019s failure to (1) provide medical or vocational evidence deemed necessary for a determination by the examiner, (2) submit to a consultive examination that the examiner believes is necessary to provide evidence, or (3) follow a prescribed treatment for an impairment.

In 1993, 880,000 immigrants were admitted to the United States, compared with 570,000 in 1985. In addition, nearly 3 million formerly illegal immigrants attained legal residence status under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.
