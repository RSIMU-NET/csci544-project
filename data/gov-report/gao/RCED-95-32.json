By the end of 1993, over 16 million Americans were using cellular telephones, and the industry estimates that in less than a decade, over 60 million Americans will be using a cellular communications device. About one-third of all cellular telephones currently in use are hand-held portable models, which are growing in popularity. Industry forecasters predict a high demand for a new generation of personal communications devices that will offer a greater range of uses. Technology enthusiasts envision a future in which nearly all Americans will have a wireless portable communications device."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cellular Communications Equipment and Technology", "paragraphs": ["Cellular telephones come in a variety of styles, but all fall into the following three general categories: car telephones, in which the telephone is installed in the vehicle and the antenna is mounted on the roof, trunk, or rear window; transportable telephones, in which the telephone body, antenna, and handset are carried in a briefcase or bag, but the handset is separated from the body and antenna for use; and portable telephones, in which a self-contained handset houses a battery and an antenna in a unit generally small enough to fit in a purse or pocket.", "Portable cellular telephones are the subject of this report because\u2014unlike with car telephones and transportable telephones\u2014their antenna is very close to the user\u2019s head when the telephone is in use. Figure 1.1 shows some typical models of portable cellular telephones and the proximity of the antenna to the user\u2019s head. (From left to right) Telephone A is an example of the first style of hand-held portable cellular telephone; it is characterized by a bulky body and a nonretractable antenna. It is heavier than most of the newer portable cellular telephones. Telephone B is an example of the \u201cflip-style\u201d cellular telephone; it features a mouthpiece that can be folded over the keypad and a retractable antenna for storage while not in use. Telephone C is an example of a nonflip-style telephone; it has a shorter nonretractable antenna. Telephone D is the newest style of portable cellular telephone; it is designed to transmit and receive digital signals.", "All devices that transmit radio signals\u2014such as radio broadcast towers and cellular telephones\u2014emit radio-frequency radiation. Radio-frequency radiation is electromagnetic energy emitted in the form of waves. Cellular telephones transmit voice messages by sending electronic signals from an antenna over radio waves at frequencies between 824 and 894 megahertz (MHz). These signals are a form of radio-frequency radiation.", "At sufficient power levels, radio-frequency radiation can heat body tissue and cause biological damage such as burns. These effects of exposure to radio-frequency radiation, called thermal effects, are immediately observable. According to the 1982 American National Standards Institute\u2019s (ANSI) standard for radiation exposure, a nongovernment standard that some federal agencies use, devices operating on 7 or less watts of power at frequencies below 1,000 MHz will not produce immediate thermal effects.Portable cellular telephones operate on well below 7 watts of power. They use up to a maximum of 0.6 watts of power\u2014less than the amount of power required to light a flashlight bulb. However, questions have been raised about whether long-term or frequent exposures to low levels of radio-frequency radiation have other biological effects that are delayed or not immediately observed in human cells and animals.", "Portable cellular telephones transmit messages to a cellular transmitter tower. More power is required to transmit a signal when the telephone is farther away from a tower. For example, if a caller is located at a great distance from the tower, the telephone may use the full 0.6 watts of power to transmit the signal. However, if the caller is near the tower, the telephone may only need to use about 0.2 watts of power to transmit the signal.", "Cellular telephones transmit either analog or digitized voice messages, depending on the type of cellular telephone used and the service available. In analog radio communication systems, messages are transmitted by modulating, or varying, either the amplitude (height) or the frequency (number of wave crests) of the radio wave. In digital communication systems, messages are transmitted as a series of digits in rapid bursts, or pulses. These are sometimes referred to as pulse-modulated signals. An advantage of digital transmission is that it increases channel capacity by allowing several users to transmit messages over the same radio wave simultaneously. As figure 1.2 shows, analog signals are continuous radio waves, while digital signals are binary\u2014usually represented by ones and zeroes. (See app. I for additional information on these two technologies.)", "The next generation of cellular communications is called personal communications services. In this system, inexpensive, pocket-sized communications devices that use digital technology will deliver voice, data, and images. They will operate at higher radio frequencies (between 1,850 and 2,200 MHz) and will likely use less power to operate than the current generation of portable cellular telephones. A personal communications device carried from place to place will enable the person to be reached at any location by dialing a single telephone number. Because personal communications services devices are still under development, it is not clear whether the antenna will be in close proximity to the user\u2019s head when the device is in use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Three federal agencies play a role in ensuring the safety of cellular telephones by sharing responsibility for regulating devices that emit radio-frequency radiation and protecting the public from exposure to radiation: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).", "Under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, as amended, FDA is responsible for establishing and carrying out a program, designed to protect public health and safety, to control radiation from electronic products. These responsibilities include (1) developing and administering performance standards for electronic products; (2) planning, conducting, coordinating, and supporting research, development, training, and operational activities to minimize the emissions of, and exposure of people to, unnecessary radiation from electronic products; and (3) developing, testing, and evaluating the effectiveness of procedures and techniques for minimizing exposure to electronic product radiation. FDA has the authority to set performance standards for electronic products if it determines that such standards are necessary for the public health and safety. In carrying out its responsibilities, FDA reviews and comments on industry research and also works with electronic product manufacturers when it receives complaints or has some concerns about a product but lacks sufficient scientific evidence to determine if a performance standard is necessary. Consistent with the principle of keeping exposure \u201cas low as reasonably achievable,\u201d FDA has worked with a variety of manufacturers to reduce radiation emissions. For example, FDA has worked with manufacturers of video display terminals and police radar devices to address concerns about excessive exposure to radiation and with manufacturers of electric blankets to redesign the blankets to reduce electric and magnetic fields.", "Under the Federal Radiation Council Authority, transferred to EPA by Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, EPA is responsible for, among other things, advising the President on radiation matters, including providing guidance for all federal agencies on formulating protective standards on radiation exposure. Upon presidential approval of EPA\u2019s recommendation on formulating standards, the pertinent federal agencies would be responsible for implementing the guidance. Under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), FCC is required to consider whether its actions\u2014including actions that may lead to human exposure to radio-frequency radiation\u2014in authorizing communications equipment significantly affect the quality of the human environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, requested that we review (1) the status of scientific knowledge on the potential health risks of radio-frequency radiation emitted by portable cellular telephones and federal involvement in any related research and (2) the actions of the responsible federal agencies to ensure the safety of portable cellular telephones and similar communications devices.", "To assess the status of scientific knowledge on the health risks of portable cellular telephone use, we met with scientists who have conducted research on cellular telephones and visited industry, university, and government laboratories where research is taking place. We met with scientists and researchers in the field of electromagnetic radiation at the Department of Defense, EPA, FCC, FDA, and the National Academy of Sciences.

According to FDA and the National Science Foundation, both types of research are needed to determine whether cellular telephone use poses any health risks.", "To date, no epidemiological studies have been conducted of human exposure to radio-frequency radiation as a result of using cellular telephones. Some recent biological and behavioral laboratory studies on animals and cell samples have provided information on the potential health effects posed by low-level exposure to radio-frequency radiation, although none has examined radiation exposure specifically from cellular telephones. FDA has questioned the interpretation, significance, or applicability of the studies\u2019 findings to cellular telephones. According to EPA, the significance of recent research suggesting a potential for adverse health effects cannot be determined until these studies have been independently confirmed. Because of the limitations of the research, FDA and EPA agree that more research would be necessary to determine whether portable cellular telephones pose a human health risk.", "The following are examples of some research results that scientists say have raised questions about exposure to low-level radiation similar to that emitted by portable cellular telephones, especially pulse-modulated radiation, which is comparable to digital signals. (See app. III for more information about some of these studies and app. IV for a list of other relevant studies.)", "A University of Washington study found that rats had difficulty learning a maze exercise after 45 minutes of exposure to low-level, pulsed radio-frequency radiation near the frequencies that personal communications devices will use. The researchers concluded that exposure to low-power radio-frequency radiation appears to decrease certain chemical agents in the rodents\u2019 central nervous system essential for spatial learning. In a 1983 study of cells from the immune system, the researchers found that the effectiveness of certain immune system cells in fighting off tumor cells was temporarily diminished after only 4 hours of exposure to low-power, pulsed radio-frequency radio signals. The researchers found that the effectiveness of the immune system cells was diminished most when the radio-frequency radiation was pulse-modulated 60 times per second, slightly more than the 50 times per second that digital cellular telephone signals \u201cpulse.\u201d (See app. I for information on digital signals.) In a 1991 study, the researchers found that low-power radio-frequency radiation may facilitate the development of cancer in the presence of other substances known to cause cancer. They found that when cells were exposed for 24 hours to low-level, pulsed radio-frequency radiation alone, there was no effect on the cells\u2019 survival or transformation into tumor cells. However, when the cells were treated with a tumor-promoting chemical, exposure to radio-frequency radiation significantly enhanced the transformation of the cells into tumor cells.", "Although these and a few other studies suggest that exposure to low levels of radio-frequency radiation may cause effects in animals and certain cell systems, other studies do not. For example, in a 1993 study, researchers injected brain tumor cells into rats and exposed them to low levels of radio-frequency radiation\u2014near the frequency that cellular telephones use\u2014that was either continuous (as in analog technology) or pulsed 50 times per second (as in digital technology).

In addition, NCI has planned other epidemiological studies to determine whether (1) exposure to radio-frequency radiation, among other possible risk factors, is associated with an increased risk of brain tumors, and (2) the incidence of cancer can possibly be linked with the use of portable cellular telephones. These studies involve comparing the names on lists of cellular telephone users in New York State with the names on New York\u2019s statewide cancer registry.

In May 1993, CTIA, along with other members of the cellular telephone industry, established a Science Advisory Group on Cellular Telephone Safety.

According to the chairman, payment for peer review activities will be provided through a blind trust established by the advisory group. The chairman stated that the purpose of creating the blind trust for peer review was to provide independence. However, the science advisory group does not enjoy similar financial independence. The direct funding of the research by CTIA raises questions about the objectivity and credibility of the research effort.
