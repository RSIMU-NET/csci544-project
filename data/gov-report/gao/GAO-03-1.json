Some have termed invasive  species \u201cbiological pollutants.\u201d Unlike some chemical pollutants that can  degrade over time, biological pollutants have the potential to persist,  multiply, and spread. In addition to their economic costs, invasive species  can have a devastating effect on natural areas, where they have strangled  native plants, taken over wetland habitats, crowded out native species, and  deprived waterfowl and other species of food sources. Conservation  biologists rank invasive species as the second most serious threat to  endangered species after habitat destruction. Overall, scientists,  academicians, and industry leaders are recognizing invasive species as  one of the most serious environmental threats of the twenty-first century.  We have issued two prior reports on this subject: one on funding to address  invasive species and the other on the government\u2019s approach for quickly  responding to invasions by new species.", "In February 1999, in response to the challenges faced by state and federal  agencies to minimize the spread of invasive species, President Clinton  issued Executive Order 13112. The order directs federal agencies to take  actions that will prevent the introduction of invasive species; provide for  their control; and minimize their impact on the economy, the environment,  and human health. The order established the National Invasive Species  Council, which now comprises the heads of 10 federal departments and  agencies, to provide national leadership and coordination in federal  invasive species activities and to issue a national invasive species  management plan. The order also directed the Secretary of the Interior  to establish an advisory committee to provide information and advice to  the council.", "The problem of invasive species is an international one. Organisms are  brought, intentionally or unintentionally, from one country to another. They  may also spread on their own across international borders. Because of the  international aspects of the issue, as well as the seriousness of the problem  for both Canada and the United States, we undertook a review of federal  invasive species management in cooperation with the Office of the Auditor  General of Canada. One issue of particular importance to both countries is  preventing aquatic invasive species from entering the Great Lakes in the  ballast water of ships. We and the Auditor General are issuing  simultaneous but separate reports. The Office of the Auditor General\u2019s  Report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable  Development to the House of Commons contains a chapter on Canada\u2019s  invasive species management efforts.", "The objectives of our review were to (1) assess the usefulness of analyses  that have estimated the economic impact of invasive species in the  United States to federal decision makers responsible for preventing and  controlling their spread; (2) assess the National Invasive Species  Management Plan, including the extent to which the plan has been  implemented; (3) provide the views of experts on the adequacy of  U.S. and Canadian federal government efforts to prevent the introduction  of invasive species into the Great Lakes via the ballast water of ships; and  (4) describe how the United States and Canada are coordinating invasive  species management efforts.", "Among the efforts we undertook to analyze these issues was a survey  of all 32 members of the Invasive Species Advisory Committee.

The cost to control invasive species and the cost of damages they  inflict, or could inflict, on property or natural resources are estimated to  total billions of dollars annually. For example, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Formosan termite causes at  least $1 billion annually in damages and control costs in 11 states (in 2001  dollars). USDA also estimates that, if not managed, fruit flies could cause  more than $1.8 billion in damage each year (in 2001 dollars).", "According to the National Invasive Species Council, hundreds, and perhaps  thousands, of nonnative species have established populations in the United  States. Invasive species continue to be introduced in new locations, with  recent examples including the northern snakehead fish in Maryland and the  emerald ash borer in Michigan. Many scientists believe that invasive  species are a significant threat to biodiversity and are major or contributing  causes of population declines for almost half the endangered species in the  United States. Invasive species can alter entire ecosystems by disrupting  food chains, preying on critical native species such as pollinators,  increasing the frequency of fires, or\u2014as in the case of some plants\u2014simply  overshadowing and smothering native plants. Invasive species may arrive  unintentionally as contaminants of bulk commodities such as food, in  packing materials and shipping containers, or in ships\u2019 ballast water. Others  may be introduced intentionally; kudzu, for example\u2014a rapidly growing  invasive vine that thrives in the southeastern United States\u2014was  intentionally introduced from Japan as an ornamental plant and was used  by USDA in the 1930s to control soil erosion. Other invasive species are  imported as crops, livestock, aquaculture species, or pets, and later escape  or are released into the environment. (See fig. 1 for details on the mute  swan, intentionally introduced to adorn parks and private bird collections.)", "Not all nonnative species, however, cause harm. Many nonnative species,  such as cattle, wheat, soybeans, many fruits, and ornamental plants (such  as tulips and chrysanthemums), have been largely beneficial and their  propagation controllable.

(See fig. 2.) States also have a significant  management role, but the extent of their involvement varies considerably.  USDA has the largest federal role because of its responsibility to  (1) conduct port-of-entry inspections and quarantine goods coming into the  country, (2) manage more than 190 million acres of national forests and  grasslands, (3) conduct research, and (4) provide technical assistance to  the private sector and in large agricultural pest control projects. We  reported that in fiscal year 2000, seven of the departments obligated more  than $624 million for activities related to invasive species management.  According to the council, appropriations to those departments for such  activities increased in fiscal year 2001 to approximately $1.05 billion, of  which USDA received almost $975 million.", "In February 1999, invasive species prevention and control efforts  received heightened attention with the issuance of Executive Order 13112.  The executive order established the National Invasive Species Council,  which is now made up of the secretaries and administrators of 10 federal  departments and agencies. The executive order required the Secretary  of the Interior to establish an advisory committee to provide information  and advice to the council. Accordingly, in November 1999, the  secretary established the Invasive Species Advisory Committee,  composed of 32 nonfederal members representing a range of interests  relevant to invasive species, including academia, environmental  organizations, industry, trade associations, Native American tribes, and  state government.", "The executive order also required that the council develop a national  invasive species management plan using a public process and revise it  biennially. Among other things, the executive order called for the plan to  (1) recommend performance-oriented goals and objectives and specific  measures of success, (2) recommend measures to minimize the risk of new  introductions of invasive species, and (3) review existing and prospective  approaches and authorities for preventing the introduction and spread of  invasive species. The council and its staff worked with members of the  advisory committee and other interested parties to produce draft  management plans for public comment. In January 2001, the council issued  the final plan, which identifies nine categories of planned actions to aid in  the prevention, control, and management of invasive species in an effort to  minimize their economic, environmental, and human health impacts. (See  fig. 3.) The council\u2019s plan calls for member departments to implement a  total of 86 discrete actions, each with an associated due date or start date.

Each country is the other\u2019s  largest trading partner, sending and receiving a variety of goods, such as  crops, livestock, wood, and horticultural products, that can harbor invasive  species. Therefore, species that enter one of the two countries have  opportunities to spread into the other.", "The Great Lakes\u2014a shared U.S. and Canadian resource\u2014have been  subject to invasion by nonnative species since the settlement of the region.  At least 160 nonnative aquatic organisms have become established in the  lakes since the 1800s, most of which have come from Europe, Asia, and the  Atlantic coast. More than one-third of the organisms have been introduced  in the past 30 years, a trend coinciding with the opening of the St. Lawrence  Seaway in 1959 and other changes in ship operations. Ballast water in ships  is considered a major pathway for the transfer of invasive aquatic  organisms to the Great Lakes. Ballast is essential to the safe operation of  ships because it enables them to maintain their stability and control how  high or low they ride in the water. Ships take on or discharge ballast water  over the course of a voyage to counteract the loading or unloading of cargo,  and in response to sea conditions. The ballast that ships pump aboard in  ports and harbors may be fresh, brackish, or salt water. These waters may  contain various organisms that could then be carried to other ports around  the world where they might be discharged and survive.", "Canada adopted voluntary ballast water management guidelines in 1989  in response to the 1988 discovery of nonnative zebra mussels in  Lake St. Clair. The Canadian guidelines were superceded by new guidelines  in 2000 and encourage ships\u2019 masters entering the Great Lakes and other  waters under Canadian jurisdiction to employ management practices\u2014 such as exchanging ballast water in the open ocean\u2014to minimize the  probability of future introductions of harmful aquatic organisms. They also  direct ships\u2019 masters to provide ballast water details to Canadian  authorities. The United States followed the Canadian lead and passed the  Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. This  legislation directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue voluntary  ballast water guidelines and regulations for the Great Lakes. Joint United  States and Canadian voluntary guidelines, which closely tracked the 1989  Canadian guidelines, went into effect in March 1991. The U.S. Coast Guard  issued the first set of mandatory ballast water regulations for the  Great Lakes in April 1993.

Narrowly  focused analyses include estimates of past damages that are limited to  commercial activities such as agricultural crop production and simple  accountings of the money spent to combat a particular invasive species.  These estimates typically do not include the economic impact of these  species on natural ecosystems, the expected costs and benefits of  alternative measures for preventing their entry or controlling their spread,  or the impacts of possible invasions by other species in the future. On the  other hand, more comprehensive\u2014and rare\u2014analyses are those that  examine the past and prospective economic impact of invasive species to  both commercial activities and natural ecosystems and the potential costs  of preventing or controlling them. Few analyses have been done that  examine the likelihood that new species will invade new locations and that  estimate their costs. Although the estimates we reviewed may have served  the purpose for which they were intended, the narrow scope of many of  them may limit their usefulness to decision makers formulating federal  policies on prevention and control. In general, the more comprehensive the  approach used to assess the economic impacts of invasive species, the  more likely its usefulness to decision makers for identifying potential  invasive species, prioritizing their economic threats, and allocating  resources to minimize overall damages. Federal agencies recognize the  value of this type of analysis and have recently taken steps to use it more  often. According to officials from several agencies, however, efforts to  improve economic impact analyses are hampered by a lack of data on  invasive species and a lack of economists assigned to assessing their  economic impacts on commercial activities and natural ecosystems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Narrow Scope of Many Analyses May Limit Their Usefulness to Decision Makers", "paragraphs": ["The narrow scope of many analyses of the economic impacts of invasive  species may limit their usefulness to decision makers developing policies  and allocating resources to address the problem. First, many of the  analyses we reviewed do not address the economic impact of invasive  species on natural area ecosystems. Instead, they reflect the impacts of  invasive species on commercial activities such as agricultural and  timber production and fisheries. This reflects the fact that most of the  management and control of invasive species in the United States has  focused on those species that damage agricultural crops and livestock.  For example, the Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of  Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW) studied the economic impact of  weeds on the U.S. economy and found the estimated value of losses from  invasive weed species to be about $15 billion per year.12,  However, the  committee reported that the economic impact on most nonagricultural  sites was not available. Focusing solely on the impact of invasive species  on commercially valuable activities ignores the potential impact of invasive  species on ecosystems as a whole, possibly understating the impact of  these species. Consistent with that point, according to the Environmental  Protection Agency, the true cost of invasive species is underestimated if  estimates of damages do not include lost ecosystem services, such as water  purification and aesthetic values.", "Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds,  Invasive Plants: Changing the Landscape of America, Fact Book, Washington, D.C.:  FICMNEW, 1998.", "Second, many of the existing analyses do not fully account for the expected  costs and benefits that are associated with different control methods for  invasive species. Two frequently cited summations of the aggregate  impacts of invasive species in the United States were based on estimates of  this type. The first, by the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment (OTA),  estimated that by 1991 at least 4,500 nonnative species had become  established in the United States, of which about 600 had caused severe  harm. The OTA was able to obtain data showing that the economic impact  of 79 of these species totaled about $118 billion between 1906 and 1991 and  impact included damage to agricultural crops, industrial activities, and  human health. The second effort was by researchers at Cornell University  who estimated in 1999 that approximately 50,000 nonnative plant and  animal species are known to have entered the United States\u2014although not  all have established harmful populations\u2014and that the overall cost of the  harmful species is about $137 billion annually. However, the estimates  that these aggregate studies relied on typically did not include an analysis  of whether control measures are desirable given their costs or what the  most cost-effective methods for preventing or controlling particular  invasive species would be. (Many of the estimates included in these  aggregate studies also lack information on the impact of invasive species  on natural area ecosystems.)", "It is not unusual for analyses to lack information for the assessment of the  cost-effectiveness of prevention and control measures. The most complete  data on invasive species damages, and prevention and control costs and  effectiveness are available for known pests that the USDA has identified as  serious threats to agriculture on the basis of past invasions. These include  diseases and pests such as the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease,  citrus canker, and the Mediterranean fruit fly. Yet, even for these pests,  relatively little is known about the likely success of alternative methods for  preventing their entry or controlling their spread. For example, an official  in charge of risk analysis for USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service (APHIS) told us that there is a general lack of information on the  likely success of different measures\u2014short of outright bans on the  importation of some products\u2014that could be used to prevent the  importation of invasive species into the country. He said that even for a  pest such as the one that causes foot-and-mouth disease, for which the  potential costs of an outbreak have been studied, data are not available on  the cost-effectiveness of many prevention methods. Prevention methods  could range from a ban of all products that might carry the disease from all  countries known to harbor it to less stringent restrictions that allow more  trade but that might provide less protection. For invasive species that have  previously entered the United States and caused damages, there is also  little information available on the likelihood that they will do so again at  particular times and by particular pathways. Even less information of this  nature is available for non-agricultural pests. More comprehensive analyses  that include such information may help decision makers allocate limited  resources among different prevention and control efforts.", "A third way in which the narrow scope of many estimates may limit their  usefulness is that they focus on the impact of species that are known to  cause problems but do not provide decision makers with information on  the likelihood that new species will invade and cause damage. The typical  estimate includes data on the damages already caused by species or the  money spent to control them. The OTA and Cornell estimates mentioned  above are largely based on these types of estimates. Other examples  include USDA\u2019s report that it cost about $26 million between 1996 and 2000  to remove trees infested with Asian long-horned beetle in New York and  Illinois and the estimate by North Dakota State University researchers in  1996 that three species of knapweed cause about $48 million per year in  damage to Montana\u2019s economy. Data such as these can be used to  estimate the continued effects of a species in the same location or the  potential effects in a new location. For example, researchers used data on  the effects that the European green crab had had on East Coast fisheries to  estimate that this invasive species could damage native oyster, clam and  crab fisheries on the West Coast by as much as $54 million per year. (See  fig. 4 for more information on the European green crab.)", "However, experts in biological invasions caution that it is difficult to  extrapolate from a past invasion event to introductions of new species that  have not occurred. According to an official with the Department of the  Interior, decision makers need guidance on which potential invasive  species pose the greatest threat to the United States and how to best design  policies for combating them. Some researchers suggest that the best way of  protecting ourselves from invasive species is to try to predict new arrivals  of potentially invasive species, study the basic biology of probable new  arrivals, and work on biological controls for them as part of a program for  early detection and rapid response. One environmental scientist has  suggested that one of the best ways to predict the introduction of and  damage from species new to the United States is to study recent  introductions of species into other countries that have ecosystems similar  to those in this country. While USDA and others have done some studies  of this type, particularly for agricultural pests, the preponderance of  economic analysis has focused on species that have already invaded the  United States rather than on new species that could invade in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Comprehensive Analyses Are Potentially More Useful to Decision Makers", "paragraphs": ["While most of the analyses that we reviewed have limitations in their scope  that lessen their usefulness to decision makers, some used a more  comprehensive approach. Some analyses accounted more fully for the  expected costs and benefits to producers and consumers of different  control measures. For example, to further improve analysis of the expected  costs and benefits of control measures, the Risk Assessment and  Management Committee under the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force  expanded the scope of existing federal risk assessment processes and  methodologies to include the socioeconomic impacts of invasive species.  In a case study covering, in part, the effects of importing the Asian black  carp, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) researchers balanced the potential for  economic gains from intentionally introducing this species\u2014it eats snails  that may harbor parasites in fishponds and zebra mussels in the wild\u2014 against the potential for economic and environmental damage if it became  established in the wild. Risks were estimated by expert judgment. Based  upon the outcome of the assessment, the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task  Force decided that establishment of this species would create an  unacceptable level of potential harm. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has  proposed amending its regulations to add the Asian black carp to a list of  injurious fish, crustacean, and mollusk species that are not allowed to be  imported into the United States.", "Researchers also recently discussed how the benefits from integrating risk  assessment and benefit cost analysis into the regulatory process can  provide decision makers with more information than is available when only  a single dimension of information is considered. These two dimensions of  information give decision makers an opportunity to evaluate the tradeoffs  that they face when they choose among alternative regulatory measures.  The researchers addressed the question of the tradeoff between banning  the imports of commodities that may harbor invasive species and enjoying  the benefits of those commodities. As an example, they analyzed a partial  ban on imports of Mexican avocados and found that, based on the  assessment of invasion risk alone, the ban seemed to have greater benefits  than costs. However, when they incorporated into their analysis the costs  to U.S. consumers that the ban would impose in terms of reduced  availability of low-cost avocados, they found that less stringent regulations  would likely be more desirable than the ban.", "As another example, the same researchers demonstrated the benefit of  integrating benefit cost analysis and risk assessment simultaneously into  the evaluation of risk management options for the invasive fungus that  causes Karnal bunt disease in wheat. In this case, they illustrated how  analyses that estimate invasion risks and costs and benefits for control  programs for this species but do not adjust benefit estimates of the control  program components for risk may not help decision makers choose control  policies with the greatest overall benefit. USDA had estimated that the  Karnal bunt fungus could cause more than $500 million per year in  damages to the U.S. wheat industry by reducing the amount of wheat  suitable for export and had adopted a program to control the spread of the  fungus. However, researchers found that the USDA\u2019s estimate was  incomplete, in part because it focused on reducing the probability of an  outbreak of the disease by adopting multiple quarantine options but did not  examine whether each option was an economically efficient quarantine  policy. When the researchers examined these options individually, they  were able to identify the most efficient options, that is, those imposing the  least cost on producers. According to these researchers, by not adopting  only the most efficient options, the costs of the agency\u2019s program for  controlling the spread of the fungus exceeded the program\u2019s benefit. The  researchers suggest that failure to look at the expected marginal benefits  and costs of various quarantine options may have led to the adoption of an  unnecessarily costly quarantine policy.", "Another way in which some estimates have been more comprehensive is by  including an examination of the impact of invasive species on more than  just commercial commodities. For example, in estimating the effect of  gypsy moth caterpillars on forest trees, researchers estimated that benefits  from programs that would slow their spread would be between $1 billion  and $4.8 billion in present value, depending on their rate of spread and the  control programs adopted, in increased timber production, recreational  opportunities, residential and scenic land values, water quality and other  amenities, over 25 years. In another example, researchers used an  economic model based on property values to estimate damages to  lakefront properties in New Hampshire from milfoil, an invasive aquatic  weed that causes serious economic, recreational, and ecological damage.  Their estimates showed that between 1990 and 1995, property values on  milfoil-infested lakes were about 16 percent lower than similar properties  on uninfested lakes. According to an official with the Department of  Commerce, the state of New Hampshire adopted a program to control this  invasive weed on the basis of this study.", "Finally, some analysts are taking more comprehensive approaches  by analyzing the likelihood that species will be introduced, become  established, and cause harm in particular geographic areas or via particular  pathways. For example, a researcher has built upon earlier USDA work on  pest risk assessment to evaluate the likelihood of establishment of  Eurasian poplar leaf rust.  The researcher combined information on the  incidence of the disease and the location of susceptible plant hosts in the  United States with data on past invasions of this species in similar  ecosystems abroad, to assess the likely danger to geographic areas in the  United States.", "In another example, USDA examined the likelihood that the Eurasian  pine shoot beetle would enter and spread via various pathways and which  pathways would impose the greatest risk of harm. This beetle emerged as  a new and potentially serious pest of timber in the upper midwestern  United States in 1992. Potential losses from the beetle were large, and the  state of Michigan proposed 25 mitigation measures that would have  included large expenditures on pesticide sprays. USDA\u2019s analysis, which  included a risk assessment of the likely pathways by which the beetle might  spread, showed that 99.8 percent of the risk of spread occurred by one  pathway in a 2-week period during the timber\u2019s processing. Using this  information, the timber industry took appropriate control measures during  this 2-week period to effectively manage the risk at low cost and without  the need for regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Actions May Prompt More Comprehensive Analyses", "paragraphs": ["Recent federal actions may help to prompt further improvements in the  economic impact analysis available to decision makers. Among other  things, Executive Order 13112 calls on federal agencies to prevent the  introduction of invasive species, and to detect, respond rapidly to, and  control them in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner. The  executive order also directs agencies to determine that the benefits of  any actions they take that are likely to cause or promote the introduction  or spread of invasive species clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by  the species and to take measures to minimize the risk of harm in  conjunction with these actions. Implementing the order will thus  require agencies to undertake more comprehensive studies of risks, costs,  and benefits.", "In addition, the federal Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force has  developed a process to evaluate the risk of introducing nonnative  organisms into a new environment and, if needed, determine the correct  management steps to mitigate that risk. The task force has also developed  guidelines to provide direction to assist states in the development of their  own management plans for aquatic nuisance species. The guidance,  formally adopted by the task force in 2000, emphasizes a need for feasible,  cost-effective, comprehensive plans that can be developed quickly, and can  be used to focus on the most pressing species problems that can be  effectively managed. As an example of how these efforts have been used,  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health  Inspection Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, in conjunction with state authorities, have prevented the  spread of the aquatic weed caulerpa in U.S. coastal waters.", "USDA has also taken recent steps to refine its risk assessment practices.  Over the years, in making decisions about allowing the importation of  certain agricultural commodities from countries known to harbor  potentially serious plant pests, USDA occasionally used analysis that led to  partial rather than outright bans of those commodities in recognition of  both risks of invasion and the benefits that consumers would obtain from  access to that commodity. An impetus for doing more of this type of  analysis was international trade agreements that call for the United States  and others to use the least restrictive measures to protect against invasive  pests. In other words, the trade agreements prohibit countries from  imposing outright bans of certain agricultural commodities if biological and  economic data show that partial bans would be just as effective. Partly in  response to these agreements, USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service issued for the first time in August 2001 guidelines for the agency to  use when assessing the risks posed by diseases and pests. These  guidelines state that risk assessments should consider the probable  biological and economic consequences of the entry and establishment of  invasive species, as well as the likelihood that those species will enter.  However, according to the chief of APHIS Risk Assessment Systems,  agency assessments done in the past frequently focused on the  likelihood that species will enter and become established and, because of a  lack of credible data, were less focused on their biological and  economic consequences.", "Moreover, USDA recently established a task team to improve the ways in  which risk assessment is incorporated into the department\u2019s analyses of the  economic impacts of invasive species. Agency officials said that this effort  would better enable federal decision makers to adhere to Executive Order  13112\u2019s emphasis on a risk-based approach to dealing with invasive species.  In addition, the officials said that the information generated by the task  team would also help the National Invasive Species Council implement the  national management plan, which calls for a risk-based approach to  preventing potential invasive species from becoming established.", "Officials from the National Invasive Species Council staff and departments  within the council agreed that improved economic analysis would help  the federal government develop an overall budget for invasive species  programs. However, they cautioned that the capacity of the federal  government to do this work is limited. Specifically, there are limits to the  data available on the biology of invasive species and the impacts they  have\u2014particularly on natural ecosystems\u2014and the effectiveness of control  methods. The officials also stated that there are not enough resources  devoted to analyzing the impacts of invasive species."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The National Management Plan Lacks a Clear Long- Term Outcome, and Its Implementation Has Been Slow", "paragraphs": ["While the National Invasive Species Council\u2019s 2001 management plan,  Meeting the Invasive Species Challenge, calls for actions that are likely to  help control invasive species, it lacks a clear long-term outcome and  quantifiable performance criteria against which to evaluate the overall  success of the plan. Federal officials recognize that there are deficiencies  in the plan and are working toward improving it. At present, however, the  only available performance measure that can be used to assess overall  progress is the percentage of planned actions that have been completed by  the due dates set in the plan. By this measure, implementation has been  slow. Specifically, the council departments have completed less than  20 percent of the planned actions that were called for by September 2002,  although they have begun work on others. A large majority of the members  of the invasive species advisory committee who responded to our survey  believe that the pace of implementation is inadequate. In addition, some of  the actions that agencies have reported to the council are not clearly linked  to coordinated implementation of the management plan. Our survey and  other evidence indicate numerous reasons for the slow progress, including  delays in establishing implementation teams that will be responsible for  carrying out the planned actions, the low priority given to implementation  by the council, and the lack of funding and shortage of staff responsible for  doing the work. Another factor contributing to slow progress was the need  to transition to a new administration. However, while the national  management plan calls for many actions that would likely contribute to  preventing and controlling invasive species, even if the actions in the plan  were more fully implemented their effect would be uncertain because they  typically do not call for quantifiable improvements in invasive species  management or control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Invasive Species Management Plan Does Not Clearly Define a Long-Term Outcome or Contain Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["The national management plan does not clearly define a long-term outcome  or measures of success as are called for by sound management principles.

Both the executive order and this  guiding principle are also consistent with the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993, which emphasizes setting measurable goals and  holding agencies accountable by evaluating performance against  those goals.", "However, the council did not articulate in the plan a long-term outcome  or condition toward which the federal government should strive. For  example, the plan does not contain overall performance-oriented goals and  objectives, such as reducing the introduction of new species by a  certain percentage or halting the spread of established species on public  lands. Instead, the plan contains an extensive list of actions that, while  likely to contribute to preventing and controlling invasive species, are not  clearly part of a comprehensive strategy.", "Similarly, many of the actions in the plan call for the federal departments to  take certain steps rather than achieve specific results and do not have  measurable outcomes. For example, the plan calls for the council,  starting in January 2001, to work with relevant organizations to \u201cexpand  opportunities to share information, technologies, and technical capacity on  the control and management of invasive species with other countries.\u201d  Another action item calls for the council to have outlined by June 2001 a  plan for a campaign to encourage U.S. travelers to voluntarily reduce the  risk of spreading invasive species overseas. Other actions call for the  council to support international conferences and seminars. We believe that  these types of actions are more process-oriented than outcome-oriented.  Taken individually, the actions may be useful, but it will be difficult to judge  whether or not they are successful and have contributed to an overall goal.", "Respondents to our survey also raised concerns about the lack of  measurability in the plan. While the majority of respondents (17 of 23)  said that the plan is focused on the most important issues, 9 criticized it for  a lack of specificity or a clear mechanism for measuring effectiveness or  holding departments accountable for implementing it. Of these, several  commented that it is unclear how we will know when actions are  implemented and completed. Others noted that there are no consequences  for the council, staff, or agencies if they miss deadlines. Other stakeholders  made similar comments to us. For example, one person who was involved  in the development of the management plan told us that it represents a  \u201cfundamentally misguided approach\u201d and that it contains no coherent goal  or measures of success. He said that the plan should have measures of  success such as a reduction in the rate of introduction or spread of species.  Another stakeholder said that the plan is unclear with regard to what  actions would be enough to help solve the problem and echoed concerns  about the difficulty measuring success. Eight respondents to our survey,  however, made more positive comments about the degree of specificity in  the plan, stating that the plan was clear, measurable, and achievable and  that it had very specific actions with deadlines for agencies to implement.", "The council acknowledged in the plan itself that many of the details  of the actions called for would require further development in the  implementation phase. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Deputy Assistant  Secretary for Performance and Management told us that the plan was  developed with little input from people trained in performance  management processes. In addition, the Executive Director of the council  staff told us that, in her opinion, given the scope of this first-time effort, it  would have been unrealistic and difficult to also agree on specific  measurable goals. She also said that in many areas, the federal government  does not have the data on invasive species conditions needed to set long- term goals and develop better performance measures. She said that many  of the actions called for in the management plan are designed to help  develop needed data. In their comments on our draft report, EPA and the  Department of the Interior also noted that it would be difficult to apply  performance measures to invasive species management activities.", "The executive order calls for the council to revise the plan by January 2003.

The plan called for a crosscut budget  proposal for federal agency expenditures concerning invasive species  beginning in fiscal year 2003. The council and OMB are hoping to have a  proposal ready for the fiscal year 2004 budget cycle. According to the  Department of the Interior official responsible for this project on behalf of  the council, the proposal will represent the beginnings of a strategic plan  for the federal government\u2019s invasive species activities. It will be  performance-oriented with common long-term goals, intermediate  goals, and definitions for the relevant departments. OMB will identify  performance measures with help from a task team of federal stakeholders  and will initially focus on early detection and rapid response, control, and  prevention.

Council  departments have begun work on a national public awareness campaign\u2014 cataloging existing public awareness programs and conducting a survey of  public attitudes toward invasive species\u2014and are seeking budget approval  for starting the campaign in fiscal year 2004. They missed the June 2002  completion date called for in the plan. Among those actions that the  council is working on that are not due until after September 2002 is a  risk-based comprehensive screening system for evaluating first-time  intentionally introduced nonnative species, which is due by  December 2003.

Nor has the council moved to ensure that a clearly defined  process and procedures be in place by July 2001 to help resolve  jurisdictional and other disputes regarding invasive species issues.  Two respondents to our survey commented on the lack of council progress  toward a resolution process, citing the need for it in cases such as one  where federal agencies are taking contradictory actions with respect to an  invasive rangeland grass (see fig. 6 for more on buffelgrass).

Researchers explain this range by pointing out that  organisms in sediment at the bottom of the tanks may not be flushed out by  an exchange.", "Third, there is some uncertainty regarding what percentage of the water in  the tanks is actually flushed out during a typical ballast water exchange.  When determining whether tanks have been flushed and refilled in the open  ocean, the Coast Guard tests the new ballast water to see if it has a salt  concentration of at least 30 parts per thousand. However, given  uncertainties about the salinity of a ship\u2019s original ballast water and  evaporative losses that occur during transit, it is not clear from a basic  salinity test what percentage of the original ballast water\u2014and the  potentially invasive aquatic organisms it may contain\u2014has been removed.", "Fourth, there is growing concern that freshwater organisms may be able to  survive the saline environment created by mid-ocean exchange. Certain  organisms have a stage in their life cycle during which they are \u201cresting  eggs\u201d or \u201ccysts\u201d and may be tolerant of salt water. Once discharged into the  Great Lakes freshwater system, these organisms can regain viability. There  are also examples of species\u2014including alewives and the sea lamprey\u2014 that normally spend part of their lives in salt water and part in freshwater,  but have been able to thrive despite being \u201clocked\u201d into the freshwater of  the Great Lakes.", "In an effort to reduce the further introduction of nonnative species, the  Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and its Canadian  counterpart, the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation, amended  their joint regulations in February 2002 to require all commercial ships  entering the Seaway system to comply with Great Lakes shipping industry  codes for ballast water management. These codes contain \u201cbest  management practices\u201d that are intended to reduce the number of  organisms in ballast tanks. Such practices include not taking on ballast at  night\u2014when marine organisms are more likely to be near the surface\u2014and  regularly cleaning tanks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Decisions, Technological Developments, and Ship Modifications Needed to Significantly Reduce Ballast Water Invasions Will Take Many Years", "paragraphs": ["According to experts we consulted, it will take many years to solve the  problem of nonnative aquatic organisms arriving in ballast water. The  Coast Guard is now working to develop new regulations that would include  a performance standard for ballast water\u2014that is, a measurement of how  \u201cclean\u201d ballast water should be before discharge within U.S. waters. In  May 2001, the Coast Guard requested comments on how to establish a  ballast water treatment standard and offered for consideration four  conceptual approaches. The agency received numerous comments  showing a wide range of opinion. As a result, it issued an advanced notice  of proposed rulemaking and another request for comments in March 2002  on the development of a ballast water treatment goal and an interim ballast  water treatment standard. The Coast Guard is expecting to have a final rule  ready for interdepartmental review by the fall of 2004 that will contain  ballast water treatment goals and a standard that would apply not only to  ships entering the Great Lakes but also to all ships entering U.S. ports from  outside the Exclusive Economic Zone.", "Once the Coast Guard sets a new performance standard for how clean  ballast water should be, firms and other entities will have a goal to use  as the basis for developing and measuring treatment technologies.  Government, industry, academia, and other nongovernment interests are  investigating several technologies, including filtration, hydrocyclonic  separation, and chemical and physical biocides such as ozone,  chlorination, ultraviolet radiation, heat treatment, and vacuum. Each  technology has its strengths and weaknesses. One major hurdle facing any  technological solution is how to treat large volumes of water being pumped  at very high flow rates. Container vessels and cruise ships, which carry a  smaller volume of ballast water, may require different technologies than  larger container vessels. As a result, it is likely that no single technology  will address the problem adequately. To facilitate technology development,  the Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation\u2019s Maritime  Administration are developing programs to provide incentives for ship  owners to actively participate in projects designed to test treatment  technologies.", "To help with technology development, the National Invasive Species Act  created a ballast water demonstration program that funds select proposals  to develop and demonstrate new ballast water technologies. Under this  program, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have funded 20 ballast water technology  demonstration projects at a total cost of $3.5 million since 1998. Other  programs also support research, such as the National Sea Grant College  Program, which has funded nine projects totaling $1.5 million. In addition,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through the  National Sea Grant College Program, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  announced on June 6, 2002, that they expect to make $2.1 million available  in fiscal year 2002 to support projects to improve ballast water treatment  and management. In conjunction with this program, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Maritime Administration expects to make available  several ships of its Ready Reserve Force Fleet to act as test platforms for  ballast water technology demonstration projects. In fiscal years 2001 and  2002, Congress appropriated $550,000 to the Coast Guard for research and  development related to ballast water management. In addition, EPA and the  Coast Guard expect to contribute $210,000 to fund a 3-year study on the  transfer of aquatic organisms in ballast water. Nonfederal researchers in  industry and academia are also studying the content of ballast water and  prospective treatment technologies. For example, a Canadian shipping  company funded the installation of a treatment system on one of its ocean- going ships and allowed the Michigan Department of Environmental  Quality to perform testing on the system.", "Once effective technologies are developed, another hurdle will be installing  the technologies on the world fleet. New ships can be designed to  incorporate a treatment system. Existing ships, on the other hand, were not  designed to carry ballast water technologies and may have to go through an  expensive retrofitting process. With each passing year without an effective  technology, every new ship put into service is one more that may need to be  retrofitted in the future.", "Public and private interests in the Great Lakes have expressed  dissatisfaction with the progress in developing a solution to the problem  of nonnative aquatic organism transfers through ballast water. An industry  representative told us that she and other stakeholders were frustrated with  the Coast Guard\u2019s decision to make a second request for public comment  on a treatment standard; she said they were anticipating that the agency  would publish a proposal rather than another request for information. More  broadly, in a July 6, 2001, letter to the U.S. Secretary of State and the  Canadian Minster of Foreign Affairs, the International Joint Commission  and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission stated their belief that the two  governments were not adequately protecting the Great Lakes from further  introductions of aquatic invasive species. They also noted that there is a  growing sense of frustration within all levels of government, the public,  academia, industry, and environmental groups throughout the Great Lakes  basin and a consensus that the ballast water issue must be addressed now.  The two commissions suggested that the re-authorization of the National  Invasive Species Act is a clear opportunity to provide funding towards  implementing research aimed at developing binational ballast water  standards. The International Joint Commission recommended in its 2002  11th Biennial Report that the U.S. and Canadian governments fund  research recommended by expert regional, national, binational panels, task  forces, and committees.", "In an effort to prevent the introduction of nonnative aquatic organisms into  their waters, several Great Lake states have considered adopting ballast  water legislation that would be more stringent than current federal  regulations. For example, the legislatures in Illinois, Minnesota, and  New York are currently considering ballast water legislation that would,  among other things, require ships to \u201csterilize\u201d their ballast water\u2014a  standard that would exceed even those for drinking water. The Michigan  legislature also debated a proposal that would have required ships to  sterilize ballast water before discharge. The stringency of that proposed  legislation was a result of one Michigan legislator\u2019s frustration with the  federal government\u2019s slow progress in implementing an effective national  plan to protect the Great Lakes from invasions through ballast water. The  bill that passed into law in Michigan, however, has requirements similar to  those in the federal program.", "Citing inadequacies in the United States\u2019 regulatory program, an  environmental organization petitioned EPA in 1999 on behalf of  15 nongovernmental, state, and tribal organizations to address ballast  water discharges under the Clean Water Act. The petition asked the agency  to eliminate the exemption that currently excludes ballast water discharges  from regulation under its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  program. Eighteen members of Congress followed the petition with a  letter also requesting that the agency examine whether the Clean Water Act  could be used to provide effective regulation of nonnative aquatic  organisms in ballast water. In its September 10, 2001, draft response to the  petition and the congressional letter, the agency concluded that the  exemption should not be lifted because regulation of ballast water  discharges under the Clean Water Act would be more problematic than the  process already in place under the National Invasive Species Act. The  agency asserted that issuing uniform discharge requirements would require  significant federal and state agency resources and would not necessarily  provide protection greater than the National Invasive Species Act. The  agency also stated that the using the Clean Water Act would likely subject  ship operators to multiple and potentially different state and federal  regulatory regimes.", "On the international level, the United States is also an active member of the  International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized United Nations  agency that is also addressing ballast water management. In 1997, the  organization adopted \u201cGuidelines for the Control and Management of  Ships\u2019 Ballast Water to Minimize the Transfer of Harmful Aquatic  Organisms and Pathogens.\u201d The IMO requests that all maritime nations  adopt and use these voluntary guidelines that call for, among other things,  open-ocean ballast water exchange. Member nations are also working  toward an international convention to address ballast water management.  According to a State Department official who is a member of the  U.S. delegation to the IMO, the organization is developing a new  convention for possible adoption in the fall of 2003. The State Department  official told us that the convention would probably include ballast water  exchange as an interim method and would likely include provisions for  modifying the performance standard over time to correspond with and spur  improvements in technology. Even if a convention were available for  signature in the fall of 2003, it would take some years for it to enter into  force and for effective treatment technologies to be installed on the  world fleet. Recognizing the time needed to develop and install new  technologies, the Coast Guard has suggested to the Marine Environment  Protection Committee that the date by which ships must meet a new  performance standard be 10 years after the organization adopts a  convention (in this case, 2013)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Continued Introduction of Nonnative Aquatic Organisms Via Ballast Water Could Have Major Economic and Ecological Effects on the Great Lakes", "paragraphs": ["Although no estimates have been made, using the past as a guide,  the continued introduction of nonnative aquatic organisms into the  Great Lakes could have significant economic and ecological impacts on the  Great Lakes basin.

As a result, experts dread the introduction  of the \u201cnext zebra mussel.\u201d The zebra mussel was introduced to the  Great Lakes in 1988 and is continuing to wreak havoc on the ecosystem and  surrounding economies. Zebra mussel control measures alone are  estimated to have cost municipalities and industries $69 million from  1989 through 1995.

We have discussed two  species and listed others that have been introduced since ballast water  regulations were implemented. (See fig. 10.) In addition, scientists have  identified 17 species from the Ponto-Caspian region (Caspian, Black, and  Azov Seas) of Eastern Europe alone that have a high invasion potential, are  likely to survive an incomplete ballast-water exchange, and are considered  probable future immigrants to the Great Lakes.", "The continued introduction of nonnative aquatic organisms could further  damage a U.S. and Canadian Great Lakes sport and commercial fishing  industry that is valued at almost $4.5 billion annually and supports  approximately 81,000 jobs. Aggressive fish that have invaded the lakes in  the past (such as the sea lamprey, the Eurasian ruffe, and the round goby)  have harmed native fish by directly preying either on them or on their food  supply. Two of the potential species from the Ponto-Caspian region, the  amphipods Corophium curvispinum and Corophium sowinskyi, could  significantly alter biological communities along shorelines and food chains  in North American river systems. Invasive species can also carry parasites  and pathogens that could affect existing fish populations. For instance, fish  pathologists fear that continued introductions of species such as the  Eurasian ruffe may facilitate the introduction of new and potentially  harmful parasites and pathogens, such as viral hemorrhagic septicemia,  a serious disease of rainbow trout in Europe that could affect  North American fish populations.", "Ballast water is also known to carry human pathogens, although the  risks they pose to human health has not been determined.

We believe that the decision to take more  immediate action to solve the problem is a policy decision best left to the  Congress or the administration. The commission also suggested that we  ask the Congress to consider completing reauthorization of the National  Invasive Species Act. While we recognize the importance of the  commission\u2019s suggestion, we did not evaluate the current proposal to  reauthorize the act. The department and the commission also offered  minor corrections, which we have made.", "The National Invasive Species Council concurred with our  recommendations but made several clarifying comments. In particular,  it noted that the management plan\u2019s deadlines were optimistic and  suggested that we should have evaluated whether the deadlines were  realistic or attainable. We believe that an assessment of its deadlines is an  appropriate task for the council when it revises the management plan. In  addition, the council commented that the report undervalued the progress  being made toward coordination and cooperation among federal agencies  and gave examples of such activity. We acknowledge that coordination  between departments has increased as a result of the creation of the  council and the management plan, and we have added language to support  this point. Nevertheless, the report provides support for the position that  improvement can still be made in this area. Finally, the council made other  minor comments that we have incorporated where appropriate.", "The Environmental Protection Agency commented that our  recommendations were reasonable and believes that their  implementation would enhance the federal government\u2019s response to  dealing with the problem of invasive species. The agency also noted that  the report is well written and helpful in assessing the progress made in  coping with invasive species. The agency also made several clarifying  comments that we have incorporated where appropriate. The agency  questioned whether we should have based our conclusions about the pace  of implementation of the management plan solely on the results of our  survey of the members of the first term of the advisory committee, given  the small size of the population and their possible biases. We did not draw  our conclusions about the pace of implementation solely, or even primarily,  from the survey. Our statement that less than 20 percent of the plan has  been implemented is based on our analysis of information from the  National Invasive Species Council staff and the council\u2019s member  departments. EPA also noted that the report\u2019s section on ballast water  focused on the Great Lakes and pointed out that work is being done and  needs to be done in other parts of the country. We agree that ballast water  is an important issue in other parts of the country. However, our objective,  as part of our coordinated review with the Canadian Office of the Auditor  General, was to focus on the Great Lakes. Finally, EPA made a number of  technical clarifications that we have incorporated, where appropriate, in  the report.", "The invasive species coordinator for the Department of Agriculture said  that our comments on the implementation of the national management plan  were fair and on target. This official also provided two minor clarifying  comments that we have incorporated.", "The Department of Transportation\u2019s Director for Performance Planning in  the Office of Budget and Program Performance provided oral comments on  the draft. He told us that the department disagreed with our draft  recommendation calling for the members of the National Invasive Species  Council to incorporate the national management plan into their annual  performance plans. He said that the department does not believe that it is  appropriate to include performance goals with respect to invasive species  in its performance plan because managing invasive species is not one of its  core missions. In addition, he told us that the agencies within the  department that have a more direct role with respect to invasive species,  such as the Coast Guard, Maritime Administration, and Federal Highway  Administration, are at liberty to include invasive species management goals  in their annual performance plans. In response to this comment, we  modified the wording of the recommendation to specify that the national  management plan should be addressed in the most appropriate annual  performance plan, whether at the departmental level or the agency level.  The department also commented that there are many mechanisms other  than ballast water by which invasive species are introduced into the  environment. We agree, and noted some of them in the report. However,  our objective specifically focused on the issue of ballast water in the  Great Lakes.", "A representative with the Office of Planning in the Department of the  Treasury's U.S. Customs Service told us that because the current national  management plan does not call for the Customs Service to undertake  significant activity on invasive species, it does not believe that it is  appropriate for it to address the management plan in its annual  performance plan as called for in our recommendation.  We acknowledge  that the current plan does not have action items directed to the Customs  Service, and we modified our recommendation to clarify its applicability to  those member agencies that are specifically responsible for action items in  the existing (2001) national management plan.  If future versions of the  plan specify action items for other agencies, we would encourage them to  follow the same practice with regard to their department- or agency-level  annual performance plans.  The Customs Service made no technical  comments.", "We are sending copies of this report to the other members of the  National Invasive Species Council: the Secretaries of State, Defense,  Transportation, Health and Human Services, and Treasury, and the  Administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency and the  U.S. Agency for International Development.

We also reviewed the literature that  describes and evaluates U.S. regulatory policies for invasive species. We  paid particular attention to the literature that evaluates how well cost- benefit analyses of invasive species\u2019 effects, and of regulatory policies to  control them, have been adjusted to reflect uncertainties and risks  associated with these assessments. To further determine the usefulness of  the existing studies, we selected and interviewed experts, including some  authors of studies, and government officials involved in both authoring and  using the economic impact studies. We identified these experts through our  literature search.", "To assess the National Invasive Species Management Plan, including the  extent to which the United States government has implemented it, we first  analyzed the content of the plan in relation to the requirements spelled out  in Executive Order 13112. In particular, we analyzed the extent to which it  contained \u201cperformance-oriented goals and objectives and specific  measures of success for federal agency efforts concerning invasive  species.\u201d The plan contains 57 enumerated actions. However, several of  those actions have distinct subparts. In consultation with council staff, we  agreed that there are a total of 86 distinct actions called for by the plan. To  evaluate the extent to which the plan has been implemented, we focused  primarily on those actions that had a start or completion date of September  2002 or earlier. There are 65 actions in that category. To determine whether  actions had been completed, were in progress, or had not been started, we  relied on the National Invasive Species Council\u2019s summary of agency  progress, materials provided to us by agency officials, and interviews with  council staff and agency officials. For those actions that had been started  but not completed, we did not attempt to characterize the extent to which  they had been completed. In only a few instances did we attempt to  determine when incomplete actions would be complete.", "To assist in our evaluation of the plan and our assessment of its  implementation, we surveyed the 32 people serving on the Invasive Species  Advisory Committee for a 2-year term beginning in December 1999. We had  several reasons for surveying this group: (1) they participated in developing  the national management plan; (2) they represented a wide range of  interests relevant to the invasive species issue; and (3) by virtue of their  professions and their involvement with the committee, they were likely to  have information and opinions on how the management plan was being  implemented. The Secretary of the Interior reappointed 15 of these 32  people for another term on the advisory committee beginning in April 2002.", "One of the members of the original advisory committee told us that he had  resigned from the committee partway through his term and did not believe  that he was informed enough about events surrounding the council, the  committee, or the management plan to respond to our survey. Therefore,  for the purposes of calculating a response rate, we are using 31 as the size  of our survey population. Twenty-one of the 31 members of the committee  completed our survey, while 2 others completed a small portion of the  survey. Therefore, while the response rate was 74 percent, the completion  rate was 68 percent. Thirteen of the 15 people reappointed to the  committee responded to the survey.", "The survey instrument contained questions that asked for either numerical  or open-ended answers. The survey, including a tally of the numerical  answers, is in appendix IV. Because we did not take a sample of the  committee members, the numerical answers are presented as a  straight percentage of the total number of respondents. There are no error  rates associated with the results. We did not reprint the open-ended  answers in the report because they are too numerous and lengthy.", "To determine the experts\u2019 views on the adequacy of U.S. and Canadian  efforts to control the introduction of invasive aquatic species into the  Great Lakes via the ballast water of ships, we selected and interviewed  experts from various stakeholder interests. We identified experts through a  literature search and by soliciting the names of other expert contacts  throughout our review. In the end, we contacted experts from U.S. federal  agencies, academic institutions, and the shipping industry. We also met  with staff from two binational agencies\u2014the International Joint  Commission and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission\u2014and with  representatives of the Great Lakes Commission. In addition, we attended a  conference on aquatic nuisance species to obtain opinions from a range of  stakeholders on ballast water and associated shipping vectors.", "To describe the current management of ballast water in the Great Lakes,  we researched U.S. and Canadian legislation, regulations, and guidelines. In  order to determine the compliance rate and effectiveness of the current  regulatory regime for the Great Lakes, we obtained compliance and  other data from the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment and the  Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation in Massena, New York.  The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation also showed us the  U.S. ballast water inspection procedures on a vessel docked in Montreal,  Canada, and bound for the Great Lakes. We also reviewed studies on the  introduction of nonnative aquatic organisms traced to ballast water, paying  particular attention to those that have invaded after the ballast water  regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes took effect in 1993. We  interviewed both United States and Canadian scientists on the significance  of the continued invasions since 1993.", "For the international perspective on ballast water management, we  reviewed the history and development of the current International  Maritime Organization policies and guidelines. We also met with members  of the U.S. delegation to the organization to determine the status of  negotiations on a future international agreement related to ballast water.  These officials represent the United States on the Marine Environmental  Protection Committee and lead the correspondence group that is tasked  with developing a performance standard for the future International  Maritime Organization Convention on ballast water management.", "To describe coordination between the United States and Canada, we  interviewed officials from departments in the National Invasive Species  Council to determine if their departments were involved in any significant  efforts to coordinate with Canadian officials on invasive species  management. From these discussions, we learned that coordination efforts  on a binational (or in some cases trinational) level have focused primarily  on shared boundary waters and agriculture. We obtained further  information from the relevant departments on the nature of those  coordination efforts. To learn more about how nonfederal organizations  can play a role in coordinating the work of the two countries, we  interviewed and obtained documents from officials representing the  International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, the  Great Lakes Commission, and the North American Commission on  Environmental Cooperation. We also obtained documentation that  described relevant work being done by the International Plant Protection  Organization, the North American Plant Protection Organization, the North  American Animal Health Committee, and the Trilateral Committee for  Wildlife and Ecosystem Conservation and Management. Finally, we relied  on previous GAO work on foot-and-mouth disease.", "In choosing invasive species to profile, we judgmentally selected  species that (1) illustrate problems in a variety of environments (aquatic,  terrestrial, managed, and natural areas), (2) are drawn from a wide  variety of taxonomic groups (vertebrate, invertebrate, virus, and plant),  (3) include some that are well known by the public and others that are not,  and (4) provide a selection whose distribution collectively covers a large  portion of the United States.
