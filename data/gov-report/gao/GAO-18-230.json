The law established the  procedures for making recommendations for base closures and  realignments and originally required DOD to submit a 6-year force- structure plan and base its closure and realignment decisions on that  plan. For the 1991, 1993, and 1995 BRAC rounds, DOD performed a  detailed capacity analysis based on extensive data-collection efforts to  identify specific bases capable of accommodating additional forces to  develop its proposed list of closures and realignments. In 1997, after  DOD requested another BRAC round, Congress required DOD to submit  a report on, among other things, the need for any additional BRAC rounds  and an estimate of the amount of DOD\u2019s excess capacity at the time. In  2001, when Congress authorized a BRAC round to begin in 2005, it  required DOD to submit a force-structure plan to cover a 20-year period  and an infrastructure inventory with its budget-justification documents for  fiscal year 2005 before proceeding with the extensive data gathering  efforts and analysis associated with the BRAC process. The submission  was also to discuss categories of excess infrastructure and infrastructure  capacity.", "Prior statutes included provisions for us to review DOD\u2019s 1998 and 2004  excess capacity reports, which used a method to estimate excess  capacity that was very similar to the method used in its 2017 report.

In these three  previous reports, we concluded that DOD\u2019s methodology to estimate  excess capacity had a number of limitations, and thus gave a rough  indication that excess capacity existed. Specifically, we identified the  following four limitations with the method used in DOD\u2019s 1998 and 2004  reports:  Installations were assigned to a single-mission category, yet most  installations perform more than one mission.", "Military services used different metrics to evaluate installations in  similar mission categories.", "DOD used a 1989 baseline that did not take into account any excess  capacity or capacity shortfall that may have existed at the time.", "DOD\u2019s analysis did not consider the possibility that a mission category  might have a capacity shortage; mission categories were determined  to have either an excess or no excess capacity.", "DOD agreed that our 2013 report properly highlighted the limitations in  DOD\u2019s methodology for estimating excess capacity. At that time, DOD  reiterated that the purpose of its methodology is to provide an indication  of whether sufficient excess exists to justify authorization of another  BRAC round.

Similarly, in the case of Army maneuver installations, the  needed infrastructure was described in terms of maneuver acres needed,  but did not describe other infrastructure necessary to support assigned  units. Consequently, the description of infrastructure needed does not  provide DOD and Congress with a complete picture of the infrastructure  needed to support the force structure at these major installations.  However, as DOD points out in its report to Congress, the analysis  performed does not provide the detail necessary to identify specific  infrastructure for elimination; instead it provides an indicator of the  categories of excess.

According to  generally accepted research standards, listed in appendix I, the baseline  and other data used to support the analysis should be determined to be  reliable and valid. Specifically, the baseline should be fully and completely  identified and used consistently, where appropriate. In addition, the data  limitations should be identified and the effect of these limitations should  be fully explained. DOD has also recognized that using 1989 as a  baseline did not account for excess capacity that existed in 1989.  However, DOD only partially explained the effect of this limitation on its  estimate of excess capacity.", "First, using 1989 as the baseline assumes that the bases and facilities as  they existed in 1989 were appropriately sized to support their missions.  However, DOD\u2019s 2017 infrastructure capacity report did not provide a  rationale for either why 1989 was an appropriate baseline or why the  bases and facilities were assumed to be appropriately sized at that time.  In fact, as discussed below, DOD has stated that excess capacity existed  in 1989, but does not attempt to quantify the amount. Further, in at least  one mission category, Marine Corps Bases, DOD acknowledges that it  overstated excess capacity because the baseline ratio was based on  infrastructure numbers that were not adjusted to recognize the  documented shortfalls that existed in 1989.", "Second, the effects of DOD\u2019s assumptions about the 1989 baseline have  not been consistently reported by DOD. DOD has used the same  baseline in its three analyses conducted over the past 20 years, yet DOD  draws different conclusions concerning how the baseline affects its  estimates of excess capacity. For example, DOD concluded  in 1998 that excess capacity existed in the 1989 baseline because the  majority of realignment and closures took place after 1989;  in 2004 that very significant excess capacity existed in the 1989  baseline; and  in 2017, in DOD\u2019s infrastructure capacity report, that the 1989  baseline was both properly sized to support assigned missions and  forces and included significant excess capacity.", "Nevertheless, DOD has consistently stated that its estimate of excess  capacity is likely conservative because significant excess existed in 1989.  DOD also stated that its analysis provides an indicator of the categories  where excess might exist and that only through a BRAC round can the  department undertake the detailed analysis necessary to make closure  and realignment recommendations. Since 1988, DOD has completed five  BRAC rounds that have closed a significant number of DOD facilities. In  addition, as discussed below, DOD facility standards and requirements  have been updated and new weapon systems have been introduced,  which can affect the amount and type of infrastructure needed.  Consequently, without a definitive measure of the excess that existed in  1989, as well as adjustments in the method to account for the effect of  updated facility standards and requirements, and new weapons systems,  there is no clear rationale for using 1989 as a baseline year in the  estimate of excess capacity provided by DOD\u2019s analysis.", "Third, during the last 29 years DOD facility standards and requirements  have been updated and new weapon systems with greater ranges and  capabilities have been developed that have changed the amount and type  of infrastructure needed to support DOD\u2019s forces. For example, we  recently reported that only 11 of the Navy\u2019s 18 drydocks are configured to  perform maintenance on the newer ship and submarine classes like the  Ford-class aircraft carrier and Virginia-class submarine. Using such an  old baseline, without making adjustments in the method to account for  these changes, leads us to conclude that DOD\u2019s results are likely  inaccurate.", "Because DOD continues to use its outdated 1989 baseline we found that  DOD\u2019s 2017 excess capacity analysis results in estimates that are likely  inaccurate. Without updating the baseline that is used in the methodology  to calculate excess capacity across DOD, DOD will not have accurate  information for making critical decisions related to investments in  infrastructure.

According to generally accepted research standards,  reasonable assumptions are characterized by being realistic, credible,  and accompanied by a statement of their rationale. In addition, these  standards also state that assumptions should support a sound analysis  (e.g., the assumptions should not skew the results of the analysis or  reduce the range of possible outcomes).", "We previously reported limitations related to DOD\u2019s assumptions when  we examined DOD\u2019s excess capacity analyses in 1998, 2004, and  2013. DOD continues to use the same methodology in 2017 that it has  previously used to estimate excess capacity; thus, these limitations  continue to exist in its methodology in its 2017 report. First, DOD\u2019s  approach of assigning an installation to only one mission category treats  an installation as if it has only one mission, yet most installations support  more than one mission. As a result, only a small portion of an  installation\u2019s infrastructure may be considered by DOD\u2019s analysis. For  example, in the case of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which is included in  the maneuver base category by the Army, base acres are included in the  analysis, but more than 43.8 million square feet of infrastructure is not  considered. Similarly, in the case of Naval Base Kitsap, Washington,  which is included in the Naval Station category by the Navy, the pier  space is considered in the analysis, but the more than 7.5 million square  feet of facilities is not considered. In addition, as discussed later in this  report, there were instances where the military departments included  installations in more than one mission category. Finally, there are several  categories that measure capacity in terms of direct labor hours or work- years, but the analysis does not include the actual infrastructure, such as  buildings, structures, and linear structures. Consequently, the assumption  that each installation is included in one mission category may not be  reasonable because only a portion of the infrastructure at the installations  is being considered when identifying potential excess capacity.", "Second, as implemented, DOD\u2019s estimate of excess capacity may be  overstated because its methodology did not account for any potential  shortfalls in capacity\u2014not having enough infrastructure to support the  mission\u2014and did not provide a rationale for this approach in its  calculations. As illustrated in table 2, when DOD\u2019s calculation identifies  that the proportional capacity is less than the infrastructure capacity for  the year being analyzed (i.e., DOD needs less infrastructure than it has),  DOD concludes that excess capacity exists and provides a percentage  amount of excess capacity. However, when the proportional capacity  exceeds the infrastructure capacity for the year being analyzed (i.e., DOD  may need more infrastructure), DOD concludes that no excess capacity  exists. Moreover, DOD\u2019s calculation provides a zero percentage for  excess capacity, rather than a negative percentage that would account for  a potential capacity shortfall in its analysis. DOD\u2019s 2017 infrastructure  capacity analysis identifies zero percent excess capacity in nearly half (14  of 32) of the installation categories that needed more capacity\u2014included  in the analysis, including 8 or 12 Navy installation categories.", "Because DOD\u2019s methodology uses the excess capacity percentages from  the 32 installation categories to compute a weighted average for excess  capacity across the department, treating a negative percentage from a  mission category as 0.0 percent would increase DOD\u2019s overall excess  capacity percentage. DOD officials believe that treating these 14  installation categories as if they have 0.0 percent excess capacity is  appropriate because the purpose of the analysis is to identify the  categories where excess capacity may exist. In addition, they asserted  that treating these categories as if they had a shortfall would assume that  infrastructure from 1 of the 18 other installation categories identified as  having excess capacity could be used to offset the shortfall when the  categories are likely to have different metrics. DOD officials also told us  that, from their perspective, no increase does not mean that there is large  deficit of infrastructure within a mission category; it just means that the  infrastructure to force-structure ratio indicates that the particular category  does not have excess. We found, however, 6 installation categories  where the force-structure measure exceeds the capacity measure, which  indicates that a shortfall exists. In addition, because most installations  support more than one mission and have more infrastructure present than  the mission category metric measures, including potential capacity  shortfall in its analysis could provide DOD and Congress with a more  accurate estimate of excess capacity.", "DOD\u2019s methodology to estimate excess capacity includes assumptions  that are not reasonable. Without using assumptions to estimate excess  capacity that are considered reasonable (i.e., realistic, credible, and  accompanied by a statement of their rationale), DOD\u2019s methodology may  overstate its estimate of excess capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Method for Estimating Excess Capacity Is Not Always Sufficient or Implemented Consistently", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s method for estimating excess capacity across the department is  not sufficient because it is based on a nongeneralizable sample and  therefore its reported estimates cannot be generalized to describe excess  capacity across the department. Furthermore, DOD\u2019s sampling method  is not always implemented effectively because some of the military  departments adjusted the sampling approach. According to generally  accepted research standards, the methods used and the analysis should  be sufficient for accomplishing the objectives of the study. In addition, the  analysis should be executed consistently with the study plan or the  described methodology. We found that the calculations performed by  DOD in the analysis were generally accurate.", "First, DOD and the military departments used a nongeneralizable sample  of different types of installations to develop an excess capacity estimate.  However, a nongeneralizable sample cannot be used to develop a  department-wide estimate of excess capacity because this technique is  not designed to yield a sound probable statistical estimate. Specifically,  when the analysis was first done in 1998, the military departments sorted  installations into categories and only included installations that were  considered by the departments to be \u201cmajor installations.\u201d The  departments were to assign each \u201cmajor installation\u201d to only one mission  category. The departments were to then calculate the estimated capacity  by mission category for both the baseline year, 1989, and the projected  force-structure year, 2003. The same approach was used for the 2017  analysis; however, neither the 1998 nor the 2017 analysis provided  guidance to the military department concerning what constitutes a \u201cmajor  installation.\u201d This approach for selecting and sorting samples of  installations relies on the judgment of each of the military departments,  yielding a nongeneralizable sample of installations that vary across the  military departments. Consequently, the results from the analysis cannot  be used to make inferences about the amount of excess capacity across  DOD.", "Second, the military departments did not follow a consistent approach  when calculating excess capacity. Specifically, the DOD method bases its  excess capacity estimate on the number of installations in each mission  category. However, we found that, in the 2017 analysis, the military  departments did not consistently follow the practice of including  installations in only one category across the services when the analysis  was performed in 2017. For example, we found several installations that  were included in more than one category by some of the military  departments:  In the 2017 analysis, the Air Force included two subcategories under  the heading of \u201cEducation and Training\u201d: \u201cFlight Training\u201d and  \u201cClassroom.\u201d The flight training subcategory included 13 installations  and the classroom subcategory included 14 installations. We found  that all 13 of the flight training installations were also included as  classroom installations. Yet, when the analysis was performed in both  1998 and 2004, the same 14 installations were used, but 8 of the  installations were then categorized as being flight training installations  and the other 6 installations were categorized as classroom  installations. If this previous categorization approach was used in the  2017 analysis, the Air Force estimate of excess capacity would have  been about 2 percent lower.", "In two instances, the Navy included the same installations in both the  \u201cNaval Station\u201d and \u201cAir Station\u201d categories and, in one instance, the  Navy included a joint base in both the \u201cNaval Station\u201d and \u201cShipyards\u201d  categories. According to a Navy official, these installations were  included in both categories because a major mission would have been  omitted from the analysis if the bases were included in only one  category. This treatment, however, is not consistent with DOD\u2019s  methodology.", "Including the same installation in multiple installation categories may have  resulted in double counting of capacity, and thereby affected the resulting  estimate of excess capacity for multiple installation categories.", "Third, the military departments did not consistently account for the joint  bases in their excess capacity analysis. In some instances, we found  that only the lead military department included the joint base in its  analysis. For example, in the case of Joint Base Lewis-McChord,  Washington\u2014an Army-led joint base comprising Fort Lewis and McChord  Air Force Base\u2014the Army, consistent with its treatment of Fort Lewis in  previous excess capacity analyses, included the joint base in its  maneuver category. However, the Air Force did not include McChord Air  Force Base in its analysis in 2017 although it had in previous years. In  these instances where only the lead military department included the joint  base in its analysis, the infrastructure associated with the tenant military  department was usually left out of the analysis because the metric used  by the leading department does not incorporate the same measures of  infrastructure and force structure as the tenant department. In the Joint  Base Lewis-McChord example, the Army included the base in the  maneuver category, which is measured by the ratio of maneuver acres to  maneuver battalion equivalents while the Air Force had previously used  the ratio of parking apron space to number of aircraft to measure capacity  at McChord Air Force Base. Consequently, DOD\u2019s analysis no longer  takes into account the infrastructure that supports the flying mission at  this joint base.", "In other instances, we found that both the lead military department and  the tenant military department included their portion of the infrastructure  in their analyses. For example, for Joint Base Charleston, South  Carolina\u2014an Air Force-led joint base comprised of Charleston Air Force  Base and Naval Support Activity Charleston\u2014each of the military departments continued to include their portion of the infrastructure in their  individual analyses. Consequently, DOD\u2019s analysis accounts for the  infrastructure that supports both missions at the joint base.", "DOD\u2019s method for estimating excess capacity is not always sufficient and  is not implemented consistently across the military departments because  DOD lacks specific department-wide guidance, according to DOD  officials.

These topics were discussed in meetings with  military department officials, but, according to DOD officials, no specific  method was identified for department-wide use.

DOD provided written comments, which are reproduced in  appendix II.", "DOD concurred with one recommendation and partially concurred with  the other two recommendations.", "DOD stated that it concurred with our first recommendation, which called  for it to reliably update the baseline used for estimate excess  infrastructure capacity. Specifically, the department stated that it would  review methods to update the baseline for future excess capacity analysis  that is undertaken.", "The department partially concurred with our second recommendation,  which called for the department to use assumptions that were considered  reasonable (i.e. realistic, credible, and accompanied by a statement of the  rationale) in estimating excess capacity. Specifically, the department  agreed that its capacity report should lay out any assumptions made and  the rationale for each assumption and will ensure that any future capacity  report includes that information. The department did not concur, however,  that assumptions used in its 2017 infrastructure capacity report were  other than reasonable, realistic, or credible. While we are encouraged  that the department will lay out any assumptions and the rationale for  each assumption in future capacity reports, not all assumptions used in  the 2017 analysis were reasonable (i.e. realistic, credible, and  accompanied by a statement of the rationale) as outlined in this report.  For example, we found that assigning installations to only one mission  category was not realistic because most installations support more than  one mission.", "The department partially concurred with our third recommendation that  DOD develop guidance to improve the methods used in the analysis and  ensure consistent implementation of DOD\u2019s methodology to produce  reliable estimates of excess capacity across the department.

DOD  concurred that guidance should precede any future infrastructure capacity  review and that such guidance should include definitions and  implementation instructions, but the three items identified would not  necessarily be applicable for a future analysis. Provided that future DOD  guidance addresses all appropriate characteristics for analysis, such  guidance would meet the intent of our recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force; and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment.
