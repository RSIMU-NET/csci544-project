(DCALP)\u2014a limited partnership formed by the owner of the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals\u2014agreed that DCALP would build a sports arena (estimated to cost about $175 million) and that the District would be responsible for financing certain predevelopment costs.", "The District agreed to be responsible for the following predevelopment costs: acquiring land, including the purchase of property not then owned by the connecting the Gallery Place Metrorail station to the sports arena; relocating District employees from two buildings on the site to other demolishing buildings, remediating soil, relocating utilities, and securing all regulatory approvals necessary for construction of the sports arena.", "The Omnibus Budget Support Act of 1994 (Arena Tax Act), as amended, provides for a Public Safety Fee (Arena Tax) to be levied on businesses located in the District based upon the annual gross receipts of such businesses. The Arena Tax is due on or before June 15 of each year. The Arena Tax Act provides that if on or before December 1 of each year, the Mayor estimates that the Arena Tax revenue is less than $9 million, the Mayor is required to raise the Arena Tax rates to provide for an estimated revenue of not greater than $9 million. The Arena Tax Act also authorized RLA to pledge the Arena Tax as security to repay loans to finance predevelopment activities. The Arena Tax was first levied in fiscal year 1995 and mostly used to fund predevelopment activities. In subsequent years, the Arena Tax was used to pay principal and interest (debt service) on the bonds as required by the bond resolution.", "To initially finance the predevelopment costs of the sports arena, $2.5 million was advanced by the District\u2019s Sports Commission. The funds were provided with the understanding that they would be repaid from the proceeds of a loan the District would secure. In August 1995, the District received a $53 million loan commitment (line of credit) from a consortium of banks. In January 1996, RLA issued about $60 million in revenue bonds backed by the Arena Tax and paid off the $36.6 million portion of the line of credit used.", "The funds originally available to pay the arena\u2019s predevelopment costs and to establish a debt service reserve totaled $66.6 million. These funds consisted of (1) $57.4 million in net bond proceeds (after financing costs) from the sale of RLA Revenue Bonds in January 1996 and (2) about $9.1 million in 1995 tax collections from the dedicated Arena Tax. Of the $66.6 million then available, $11 million was placed in two reserves. A mandatory $5 million capital reserve, which was required by the bond resolution, was established to pay for any insufficiency in the project fund. A reserve of about $6 million was established for debt service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine the status of the sports arena project\u2019s (1) predevelopment costs, (2) revenue collections, and (3) construction status.", "To determine the status of expenditures for predevelopment activities for the sports arena, we interviewed District officials on the Arena Task Force, the District\u2019s Sports Commission and Corporation Counsel, the Office of the D.C. Treasurer, and the Office of Tax and Revenue. We also met with trustees for the bonds and lockbox (into which dedicated taxes are deposited). In addition, we discussed the construction progress of the arena and Metrorail connection with officials from DCALP and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).", "We statistically selected a sample of expenditures for review. Our sample was drawn from payments made from the funds provided by the District\u2019s Sports Commission, the loan from the consortium of banks, the 1995 Arena Tax collections, and the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds. The sample was comprised of 56 expenditure items, which, at the time of our audit, represented 92 percent of the total funds spent. We reviewed each sampled expenditure item to determine whether it was made within the terms of the contract or invoice amounts, it had been approved for payment by a District official, and the funds had actually been disbursed.", "We did not audit the reported taxes collected and deposited for the sports arena project. Therefore, we did not determine if the District government accurately identified the universe of taxpayers or reported all dedicated taxes for this project. However, we reviewed the lockbox procedures that were established to collect the dedicated taxes, and we also reviewed monthly statements provided by the lockbox trustee to determine the amount of taxes collected and placed in escrow. In addition, we reviewed the District\u2019s lead underwriter\u2019s assumptions pertaining to the early redemption of the term bonds.

The District had two appraisals performed on the land in question. The first appraisal reflects a value of $5.25 million, and the second appraisal a value of $6.56 million. The owner has an appraisal showing a value of $10.6 million, and the owner\u2019s last requested price was $8.6 million.

The significant increase in expenditures in this category is primarily a result of a negotiated settlement related to delays in construction activities due to extended time frames for soil remediation efforts. The actual cost for soil remediation ($3.5 million) has not increased since our last report.", "The majority of the increase in spending ($4 million) was paid to DCALP\u2014the developer. DCALP, on behalf of its subcontractors, had claimed losses arising from construction delays. According to DCALP, subcontractors had to pay additional premium labor rates to get back on schedule, and additional materials were also required. DCALP claimed that under the terms of the ground lease, the District was responsible for these costs. As part of its settlement, the District has obtained a legal agreement, intended to preclude the developer from prevailing in any further claims for losses arising from soil remediation efforts. In our last report, we had mentioned that the District\u2019s Deputy Corporation Counsel stated that the District would take legal action against the alleged source of the contaminants if it does not receive compensation. However, as of October 21, 1997, the District had not determined the amount or presented a claim to the alleged source of the contaminants.", "The $4 million was paid out of the project fund following a transfer of that amount from the Mandatory Capital Reserve Fund. The Mandatory Capital Reserve Fund was initially established with $5 million, as required by the bond resolution, to cover any insufficiency in the project fund. The Mandatory Capital Reserve Fund currently has a balance of about $1 million. The bond resolution requires that any funds in excess of $1 million in the Mandatory Capital Reserve Fund as of September 1, 1997, that are not required to be used to finance any portion of the project be transferred to the Redemption Fund and be used to redeem term bonds on November 1, 1997.

In our last report, we stated that all of the leasehold improvement costs associated with the relocated employees should have been paid from the District\u2019s sports arena project fund rather than from the District\u2019s appropriated funds because this activity was an allowable cost for the sports arena project. We had informed the District\u2019s Chief Financial Officer of this matter, and he had agreed to recoup the money from the sports arena project fund. However, as of October 7, 1997, the funds had not yet been returned to the District\u2019s General Fund. The project manager of the arena project fund contends that this amount should be borne by the District since it was not factored into the original predevelopment activities budget. We disagree.

The District forecasts Arena Tax collections of $9 million for each year that the bonds are outstanding. For 1995 and 1996, the trustees for the lockbox collected Arena Tax revenues of about $9.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively.

As was done in previous years, taxpayers were instructed to send their payments to a lockbox under the control of bank trustees. We verified that these funds were transferred to the trustee for the bonds and placed in accounts for principal and interest payments.", "The combined total of $18.6 million in dedicated tax revenues collected for 1996 and 1997 is being used to pay principal and interest on the sports arena bonds.

As of November 30, 1996, the District had paid principal and interest of $5.8 million on its serial bonds.

DCALP will make annual payments in quarterly installments to RLA, upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
