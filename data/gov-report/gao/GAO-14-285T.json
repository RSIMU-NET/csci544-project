GAO's recent work on NextGen has highlighted three key implementation issues:", "Improving NextGen Leadership: Complex transformations, such as NextGen, require substantial leadership commitment over a sustained period, and leaders must both be empowered to make critical decisions and be held accountable for results. The 2012 Act created a Chief NextGen Officer that FAA appointed in June 2013, and FAA has recently filled other key NextGen leadership positions. With these positions filled, FAA should be in a better position to resolve its NextGen leadership challenges.", "Demonstrating Near-Term Benefits: The 2012 Act included a number of provisions aimed at accelerating the creation of performance-based navigation (PBN) procedures, such as following precise routes that use the Global Positioning System, which can save airlines and other aircraft operators money through reduced fuel burn and flight time. FAA must continue to deliver PBN capabilities and begin to demonstrate a return on operator's investments. As of January 2014, FAA has implemented PBN procedures at two of the five airports selected for early deployment.", "Balancing the Needs of the Current Air\u2013Traffic Control System and NextGen: While the 2012 Act contained a number of provisions aimed at accelerating NextGen implementation, GAO found that FAA's budget planning does not fully account for the impact on the agency's operating costs of the NextGen systems that will be deployed in future years, along with the need for continued operation and maintenance of existing systems and facilities. Cost estimates for maintaining existing systems and facilities coupled with implementing NextGen exceed anticipated funding levels.

However, FAA continues to experience challenges implementing the provisions in the 2012 Act and integrating UAS into the NAS. For example, although FAA has had efforts under way since 2008 supporting a rulemaking on small UAS, it is unlikely that FAA will meet the August 2014 final rule deadline required by the 2012 Act since it has not yet issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. In addition, while FAA created the UAS Integration Office in 2013 to lead UAS integration, as of January 2014, the program lacks an operations budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to testify today on progress made by the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in implementing key provisions of  the FAA Modernization and Reform Act (the 2012 Act).

Nevertheless, FAA must not become  complacent because of the extraordinary level of connectivity and mobility  the system affords us, or the safety record that has been achieved to  date. Thus, in the 2012 Act, the Congress directed FAA to take various  actions to improve the safety and efficiency of the current air traffic control  (ATC) system while transitioning to the Next Generation Air  Transportation System (NextGen). In addition, given the potential  opportunities afforded by new unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), the  2012 Act included several provisions with respect to FAA safely  integrating UAS into the national airspace system (NAS).

NextGen was envisioned as a major redesign of the air  transportation system to increase efficiency, enhance safety, and reduce  flight delays that would entail precision satellite navigation and  surveillance; digital, networked communications; an integrated weather  system; and more. Figure 1 provides examples of changes and benefits  that are expected to come from NextGen.", "The transition to NextGen\u2014which encompasses multiple programs,  procedures, and systems at different levels of maturity\u2014is a complex,  incremental, multi-year process. Since 2006, we have monitored FAA\u2019s  development of NextGen and identified a number of key challenges  facing the agency\u2019s implementation efforts. The 2012 Act included several  provisions that address some of the issues that we have identified in our  work, including incentivizing aircraft operators to equip with NextGen  technologies, developing performance measures, and involving  stakeholders in NextGen development.progress in implementing NextGen has highlighted ongoing challenges in   Our recent work on FAA\u2019s  three areas: improving leadership, demonstrating near-term benefits, and  balancing the needs of the current system while implementing NextGen  systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improving NextGen Leadership", "paragraphs": ["Our work has found that complex organizational transformations, such as  NextGen, involving technology, systems, and retraining key personnel  require substantial leadership commitment over a sustained period, and  that leaders must be empowered to make critical decisions and held  accountable for results. Transitions, inconsistent leadership, and unclear  roles and responsibilities can weaken the effectiveness of the internal and  external collaboration required for successful implementation. Both the  magnitude of the multi-year transition, as well as the numerous efforts  under way throughout the different offices and divisions in FAA to  effectuate that transition, will require FAA\u2019s leaders to manage all aspects  of NextGen in a strategic, timely, and coordinated fashion.", "FAA has struggled to have the leadership in place to manage and  oversee NextGen implementation, but more recently, has begun to fill  key positions. In June 2013, FAA appointed a new Deputy Administrator  and designated a Chief NextGen Officer, in response to Section 204 of  the 2012 Act. In addition, in September 2013, FAA appointed a new  Assistant Administrator for NextGen\u2014a position that had previously been  vacant. Designating one leader\u2014such as the Deputy Administrator\u2019s  responsibility over NextGen\u2014can be beneficial because it centralizes  accountability and can speed decision-making. With these positions now  filled, FAA should be in a better position to resolve its NextGen leadership  challenges. However, as I have stated in other work, a number of offices  oversee certain aspects of NextGen, not all of which report to the  Assistant Administrator, and implementation will require successful  collaboration between these offices. As these positions have only recently  been filled, it is not yet clear how effective the changes resulting from the  2012 Act will be in achieving that collaboration.", "Another key development in NextGen management envisioned by  Section 208 of the 2012 Act redesignated the Director of the Joint  Planning and Development Office (JPDO) as an Associate Administrator  reporting directly to the FAA Administrator and defined that  administrator\u2019s responsibility for coordination and planning with FAA\u2019s  partner agencies. This change has not been fully implemented by FAA.  However, in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014, Congress  eliminated direct funding of JPDO, and subsumed JPDO in FAA\u2019s  operations budget. At this point, it remains unclear whether a JPDO  Director position will continue and, if not, how the roles and  responsibilities of that office, particularly with respect to long-term  planning and coordination of research and development efforts across  partner agencies, will be redistributed within FAA. We will continue to  monitor these issues in two studies requested by this committee\u2014one  examining the organizational and leadership structure of the NextGen  effort, and one looking more in-depth at actions FAA has taken to  streamline its organization. We have begun both of these examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstrating Near-Term Benefits", "paragraphs": ["To convince operators to make investments in NextGen equipment, FAA  must continue to deliver systems, procedures, and capabilities that  demonstrate near-term benefits and a return on an operator\u2019s  investments. In particular, a large percentage of the current U.S. air  carrier fleet is equipped to fly more precise performance-based navigation  (PBN) procedures, such as following precise routes that use the Global  Positioning System or glide descent paths, which can save airlines and  other aircraft operators money through reduced fuel burn and flight time.", "However, aircraft operators have expressed concerns that FAA has been  slow to produce new procedures for various reasons, and has not  produced the most useful or beneficial PBN routes and procedures.", "The 2012 Act included a number of provisions aimed at accelerating the  creation of PBN procedures. For example, Section 213 of the 2012 Act  directed FAA to develop plans to identify beneficial PBN procedures and  to prioritize their implementation at key airports. We reported in April of  2013 that FAA had made progress in focusing its PBN efforts at seven  priority metroplexes with airport operations that have a large effect on the  overall efficiency of the NAS. More recently, FAA reports that it is  considering recommendations from the NextGen Advisory Committee  (NAC) regarding revalidation of the criteria used to prioritize these  metroplexes, and that recent efforts have been diverted to metroplexes  where the deployment of the new En Route Automation Management  (ERAM) system is complete, in order not to interfere with ERAM  deployment at those locations where it is ongoing.", "Our work also found that FAA does not have a system for tracking the  use of existing PBN procedures. As a result, FAA is unable to assure that  investment in these routes is worthwhile or that they justify the cost to  develop and maintain them. Further, in the absence of data on the use of  existing PBN routes, airlines and other stakeholders remain unconvinced  that the investments needed for the full implementation of NextGen will be  justified. Such data could help the agency demonstrate the value of PBN  technologies and any resulting benefits, as well as allow the agency to  identify routes that need to be revised to increase their use. We made  recommendations to FAA to develop a system to track the use of PBN  procedures and a process to proactively identify new PBN procedures  based on NextGen goals and targets. We will continue to monitor FAA\u2019s  progress in implementing these recommendations.", "The 2012 Act also included two other key provisions to accelerate the  creation of PBN procedures. The first was a categorical exclusion from  environmental review for PBN procedures that if implemented could  demonstrate measurable reductions in fuel consumption, carbon dioxide  emissions, and noise, on a per-flight basis, as compared to aircraft  operations that follow existing procedures. However, our April 2013  report found that, according to FAA, potential noise impacts are  measured cumulatively for all flights and that FAA has not yet identified  an approach for per-flight assessments. FAA officials stated that no  currently available methodology resolves the technical problems involved  in making such a determination, so the agency has not applied this new  categorical exclusion. Second, the 2012 Act called for the agency to  establish a program for qualified third parties to develop, test, and  maintain flight procedures. FAA has made some progress in this area  by awarding a $2.8-million contract to GE\u2019s Naverus and a partner to  develop two PBN procedures each at five mid-sized airports. The  contractors are to design, evaluate, and maintain these procedures and  be responsible for providing environmental data and analysis to FAA to  support categorical exclusions and for drafting any required National  Environmental Policy Act reviews, for review and approval by FAA. As of  January 2014, PBN procedures had been implemented at two of the five  selected airports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balancing the Needs of the Current and NextGen Systems", "paragraphs": ["NextGen represents a transition from existing ATC systems and facilities  to new systems, potentially necessitating changes to or consolidation of  existing facilities. We have reported over the years that various  investment and policy decisions, including what existing ATC systems  and facilities will remain in the NAS during the transition and for how long,  have yet to be made. For the systems and facilities that remain, FAA will  have to monitor and maintain their performance and condition while the  agency implements the NextGen transition. Decisions about the number  of existing systems and facilities that will remain in operation during the  transition have implications for FAA\u2019s capital and operations budgets  going forward. If aging systems and associated facilities are not retired,  FAA will miss potential opportunities to reduce its overall maintenance  costs at a time when resources needed to maintain both systems and  facilities may become scarcer.", "The 2012 Act contained a number of provisions aimed at accelerating the  implementation of NextGen systems. However, we found in August  2013 that FAA\u2019s budget planning does not fully account for the potential  impact of NextGen systems that will be deployed and the need for  continued operations and maintenance of existing systems and  facilities. In the 2012 Act, Congress also expressed concern regarding  the condition of FAA facilities and mandated that we study their condition.  In our September 2013 report, we noted that FAA estimates its staffed  facilities like towers and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON)  facilities have about $260 million in deferred maintenance; unstaffed  facilities, such as shelters and communication towers that house and  support NAS equipment, had an estimated $446 million in deferred  maintenance in 2012. These, and other cost estimates for maintaining  existing systems and facilities, along with implementing NextGen exceed  anticipated funding levels. However, we concluded that FAA\u2019s imprecise  facility-condition data do not facilitate agency-wide priority assessments,  which, in turn, could hinder the agency\u2019s ability to target its limited  resources on those projects in greatest need of repair and that are most  critical to the NAS. In addition, section 804 of the 2012 Act directed FAA  to complete a study on the consolidation and realignment of FAA services  and facilities to support the transition to NextGen. However, FAA has yet  to identify which facilities would be consolidated or realigned, and  according to FAA officials, the study will continue through 2014.", "In our August 2013 report we recommended improvements to FAA\u2019s  budget-planning and infrastructure-condition data, improvements that  FAA is currently considering. Improved budget planning and accurate and  reliable data on infrastructure condition could help Congress better  understand the funding requirements of existing systems and facilities  and facilitate FAA\u2019s efforts to support the agency\u2019s mission of continuing  to safely operate the NAS along with the longer-term goal of transitioning  to NextGen.

As part of FAA\u2019s efforts to maintain and improve the safety of the system,  FAA issues certificates and approvals for new air operators, new aircraft,  and aircraft parts and equipment, and grants approvals for changes to air  operations and aircraft based on FAA\u2019s interpretation of federal standards  (see fig. 2). These certificates and approvals indicate that such things as  new aircraft, the design and production of aircraft parts and equipment,  and new air operators are safe for use in the NAS. However, our previous  work has highlighted FAA\u2019s inconsistent regulatory interpretation of  certification standards. In 2010, we found that variation in FAA\u2019s  interpretation of standards for certification and approval decisions was a  long-standing issue and made recommendations to improve those  processes. Subsequently, the 2012 Act required FAA to work with  industry to assess the certification process, including reviewing our  previous work and developing recommendations to address the concerns  that we and others have raised.", "As required by Section 312 of the 2012 Act, FAA, in consultation with  representatives of the aviation industry, made recommendations to the  director of FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service regarding streamlining and  reengineering the certification process. These recommendations, which  we found to be relevant, clear, and actionable, called for FAA to:  1.  improve the effectiveness of its delegation programs,  2.  update certification procedures to reflect a systems approach to  3.  review operational safety and rulemaking processes, and  4.  implement efficiency reforms, among others.", "In July 2013, FAA released its plan to implement these recommendations.  The plan included 14 initiatives and programs that FAA either had under  way or intended to start to improve efficiency and reduce costs related to  certifications. We found these initiatives were generally relevant to the  recommendations and were clear and measurable. However, we found  that FAA\u2019s plans do not contain some of the elements essential to a  performance measurement process. For example, FAA has developed  milestones for each initiative and deployed a tracking system to monitor  the implementation of all certification-related initiatives, but it has not yet  developed performance measures to track the success of most of the  initiatives and programs. According to an FAA official, the agency has  started discussions with industry stakeholders to identify key goals related  to performance measurement. Because industries\u2019 goals and FAA\u2019s goals  may be different with respect to the certification process, developing  meaningful performance measures is a complex task that the agency  plans to continue in 2014. The Committee recently asked us to examine  in more detail FAA\u2019s progress and any challenges experienced in  implementing the recommendations and making improvements to its  certification processes, and will be tracking FAA\u2019s efforts going forward.", "Also resulting from issues found in our 2010 report on certification,  section 313 of the Act directed FAA to establish an advisory panel to  address inconsistencies in the interpretation of regulations by the  certification offices. Consistent with issues raised in our 2010 report, this  committee identified three root causes of inconsistent interpretation of  regulations: (1) unclear regulatory requirements; (2) inadequate and  nonstandard FAA and industry training in developing regulations, applying  standards, and resolving disputes; and (3) a culture that includes a  general reluctance by both industry and FAA to work issues of  inconsistent regulatory application through to a final resolution and a \u201cfear  of retribution.\u201d To address these root causes, the committee made six  recommendations, including developing a master source of guidance and  developing instructions for FAA staff with policy development  responsibility. We found that the advisory committee took a reasonable  approach in identifying the root causes and that its recommendations  were relevant, actionable, and clear. The committee also considered the  feasibility of the recommendations by identifying modifications to existing  efforts and programs and prioritizing the recommendations.", "FAA reported in January 2014 that it was still determining the feasibility of  implementing these recommendations. The agency told us that it  expected to publish an action plan to address the recommendations and  metrics to measure implementation by late June 2014, more than six  months after FAA\u2019s initial target. We note that while measuring  implementation may be useful, FAA is not intending to measure  outcomes, a measurement that could help in understanding if an action is  having the intended effect."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Progress Has Been Made, Safely Integrating UAS into the NAS Will Continue to Present Challenges for FAA", "paragraphs": ["UAS are aircraft and associated equipment that do not carry a pilot  aboard, but instead operate on pre-programmed routes or are manually  controlled by pilot-operated ground stations.

In January 2013 we  reported that of the seven deadlines that had passed, FAA had completed  two items. However, since that time, FAA has satisfied a number of  additional milestones (see app. III for an update of all the 2012 Act\u2019s  requirements with respect to UAS). Of particular note:  JPDO and FAA released a UAS Comprehensive Plan and a UAS  Roadmap, respectively, in November 2013 to outline the nation\u2019s UAS  goals and objectives and the tasks necessary to achieve UAS  integration.   In late December 2013, FAA selected the six locations for its UAS test  site program.", "FAA established permanent Arctic areas where small UAS can  operate for research and commercial purposes and the first flight took  place in the fall of 2013.", "While progress has been made implementing some of the key milestones  established in the 2012 Act, integrating UAS into the NAS continues to  challenge FAA leading to uncertainty about when UAS integration will be  achieved. For example, while FAA announced the six locations for its  UAS test site program, FAA has not yet defined what operational, safety,  and performance data it needs from the test sites and how that data will  be collected and analyzed. We previously reported that use of these data  would be important in developing safety, reliability, and performance  standards, which are needed to guide and validate the supporting  research and development efforts. FAA and industry stakeholders have  stated that data and other information generated by the test sites will be  important in helping FAA answer key research questions related to UAS  operations and developing regulations and operational procedures for  future commercial and civil use of UAS. Finally, to increase collaboration  and provide stable organizational leadership, and focus on UAS  integration efforts, FAA created the UAS Integration Office in 2013. While  the office did not have an operations budget, as of January 2014, the  office has 33 full time employees, and FAA is still finalizing agreements  and other arrangements related to the reorganization, and it remains  unclear what resources the office will have available to fulfill its role.", "Moving forward, FAA has a number of important milestones it must meet  to ensure UAS integration into the NAS. A key next step, according to  FAA officials and industry stakeholders, will be to adopt a final rule for  small UAS operations. Although FAA has had efforts under way since  2008 supporting a rulemaking on small UAS, it is unlikely that FAA will  meet the August 2014 final rule deadline required by the 2012 Act. For  example, FAA has not yet issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for  small UAS, and recently estimated that one will not be released until  November 2014. Further, FAA must develop standards\u2014and determine  what data are necessary to inform that process\u2014to facilitate safe UAS  integration into the NAS. More broadly, to achieve UAS integration, FAA  faces the challenge of ensure that all of the various efforts supporting  these integration issues within its own agency, as well as across federal  agencies and other entities, align and converge in a timely fashion. We  have begun additional work on UAS that will be looking specifically at  collaboration between federal agencies responsible for UAS integration  into the NAS and the research and development priorities in the area of  research and development to support UAS integration.", "In closing, FAA has made some progress in implementing various parts of  the 2012 Act, and is seeking to address some of the key challenges it  faces. Going forward, we will continue to monitor FAA\u2019s progress,  highlight the key challenges that remain, and the steps FAA and industry  can take to find a way forward on the issues covered in this statement as  well as other issues facing the industry. For example as previously  mentioned, we have work underway to examine organizational and  leadership issues with NextGen, and to examine, in greater detail, FAA\u2019s  certification processes and progress made with respect to UAS. In  addition, for this Committee we will be examining issues related to  funding airport development, including passenger facility charges, airport  improvement program grants, and the potential for greater private sector  investment through public-private partnerships.", "Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member Larsen, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

We made a number of  recommendations to improve the board\u2019s planning and make the most  effective use of its limited resources and also noted that Congress  should consider authorizing an appropriate federal agency\u2019s Office of  Inspector General to provide additional oversight.", "Airport-intercity passenger rail connectivity.
