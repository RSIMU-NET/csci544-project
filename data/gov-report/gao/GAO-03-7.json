However, this date can be extended if fewer than 85 percent of households in a market are able to receive the digital signals. GAO was asked to assess issues related to the DTV transition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Numerous factors are impeding the progress of the DTV transition, making it unlikely that 85 percent of households will be able to receive DTV signals in many markets by December 2006. Few consumers own digital television equipment. Only about 1 percent of television equipment sold in 2001 could receive digital signals. This is largely because digital television sets and tuners are expensive and high definition programming is limited. Many consumers are unaware of the DTV transition. In a random household survey conducted for GAO, 40 percent of respondents had never heard about the transition; only one in five were \"very aware\" of it. In addition, the quality of information that consumers receive about DTV products at the retail level may be inconsistent. In visits to 23 DTV retailers, GAO found that sales staff sometimes provided inaccurate or incomplete information about DTV equipment and programming. Cable and satellite digital carriage is limited. The great majority of American households receive their television via cable or satellite. However, cable carriage of local digital broadcast channels is very limited. Furthermore, satellite providers currently do not carry any markets' local digital broadcasts. To speed the DTV transition, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has required that by 2007 most new television sets be capable of receiving digital signals over the air. Another policy option to speed the transition would be to also require that new sets be capable of receiving digital signals via cable. Because many more American households receive television via cable than receive it over the air, mandating that new sets be \"digital cable-ready\" could effectively speed the transition. However, the cost to consumers of such a policy would first need to be assessed, and outstanding issues related to the compatibility between cable systems and DTV equipment would need to be resolved. Currently, broadcast stations have the right to require that cable systems in their market carry their analog signals (a right known as \"must-carry\"). One policy option to facilitate the transition would be to set a fixed date when this must-carry right would transfer from broadcasters' analog signals to digital signals. This option might speed cable carriage of digital broadcasts without requiring cable systems to carry both analog and digital broadcasts simultaneously. Because such a policy could have both advantages and disadvantages, it needs to be carefully evaluated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The transition to broadcast digital television (DTV) offers the promise of more programming options, interactive services, and the high-resolution picture quality provided by \u201chigh definition television.\u201d It also will allow some of the valuable radiofrequency spectrum now used for broadcasting to be made available for other uses. To help realize this transition, the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have established requirements for television stations to broadcast digital signals. In an April 2002 report, we discussed the progress that stations are making in rolling out these digital broadcasts. Although the provision of digital broadcast signals is progressing, many other things must happen before the transition can be successfully completed. These include the adoption of DTV equipment by consumers, cable carriage of digital broadcast channels, and the availability and provision of digital programming.", "As FCC Chairman Michael Powell has noted, at the heart of the DTV transition lies a classic chicken-and-egg problem. Until more consumers have purchased digital television sets, there is little incentive for networks to provide and cable systems to carry more digital programming. Yet without much digital programming available, consumers have little incentive to purchase digital television sets. In April 2002, the Chairman issued a proposal for industry actions to speed the DTV transition. The proposal laid out specific\u2014though voluntary\u2014actions that various industries should take to provide an \u201cimmediate spur\u201d to the DTV transition. In addition, in August 2002, FCC established a requirement that by July 2007 most new television sets include a tuner capable of receiving over-the-air digital broadcasts.", "The DTV transition began in 1987 when, at the request of many broadcasters, FCC began to investigate issues related to the introduction of advanced technologies for improvements to television picture and sound. This process led to a study of the feasibility of transitioning from the conventional analog broadcasting system to a digital broadcasting system. Since that time, regulatory actions by FCC, in conjunction with direction set out by the Congress in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, have established the framework and timeline for the DTV transition. During the transition, all television stations in the United States have been provided with a second channel on which to operate a digital broadcast in addition to the channel on which they operate their analog broadcast. Once the transition is complete, broadcast stations will operate solely in digital. FCC set 2006 as the target date for the completion of the DTV transition. The Congress later codified this date but also provided for extending the date under certain conditions. The goal is for broadcasters to cease broadcasting the analog signal by the target date so that some of the radiofrequency spectrum needed for analog broadcasting can be made available for other uses. However, many believe that the transition will not be completed by the target date.", "We were asked to assess issues related to the DTV transition, including (1) the benefits and implications of turning off the analog broadcast signals, (2) consumer awareness and adoption of DTV, (3) cable and satellite carriage of digital signals, (4) the availability of digital programming and the role of copy protection concerns, and (5) issues related to DTV tuner mandates.", "To meet these objectives, we interviewed representatives of companies in several key industry segments, including broadcasters, television producers, cable and satellite companies, and retailers and manufacturers of DTV equipment. We also had several meetings with FCC staff and various industry trade groups. To better understand consumer knowledge of the DTV transition, we contracted with a survey research firm to conduct a random household survey that asked questions designed to ascertain consumers\u2019 level of knowledge about the DTV transition. We also visited a variety of retail stores to obtain anecdotal information on retail practices in marketing and selling DTV products. A more detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is provided in appendix I.", "We performed our review from May 2001 through August 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The nation is currently undergoing a transition from analog to digital television broadcasting. Traditional analog broadcasting uses the radiofrequency spectrum to transmit analog signals\u2014that is, signals in which motion pictures and sounds have been converted into a \u201cwave form\u201d electrical signal. With digital technology, the analog wave form is converted into a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones. For digital television service, like analog service, broadcast stations have been allotted 6 MHz of radiofrequency spectrum for each television channel. However, because digital video signals can be compressed, the spectrum can be used more efficiently, allowing much more information to be broadcast using the same amount of spectrum.", "As a result, digital broadcasting provides greater flexibility in terms of the type of television content that can be provided. Most notably, digital broadcasting makes it easier to offer high definition (HD) television. HD television provides roughly twice as many lines of resolution, creating a television picture that is much sharper than traditional analog television pictures. HD television can also provide CD-quality sound and is in \u201cwidescreen\u201d format, with display screen ratios similar to a movie theater. With digital broadcasting, 6 MHz of spectrum can be used for at least one channel of HD programming, or it can be subdivided to allow the simultaneous transmission of as many as six separate TV programs of lower quality standard definition television, a concept known as \u201cmulticasting.\u201d A broadcast station can also provide \u201cdatacasting\u201d\u2014using digital signals to transmit text or data, such as stock quotes or electronic newspapers. \u201cBroadcast stations,\u201d also known as \u201cbroadcasters,\u201d are local operations that transmit signals over the air from the station\u2019s transmission tower to the antennas of television sets. Broadcast stations may get their programming content through an affiliation with a \u201cbroadcast network\u201d (such as ABC, NBC, or PBS) or a station may be an independent broadcaster. Most stations also produce some of their own content, such as local news programming.", "More than four-fifths of American households do not receive their primary television service over the air via their television set\u2019s antenna. Instead, they pay a fee to a subscription television service, such as a cable or satellite service. A \u201ccable system\u201d is a company that runs a localized network of cable lines to deliver television signals to subscribers. Some cable systems are individually owned, while others are owned by companies that own and operate more than one cable system. Direct broadcast satellite is a nationally distributed service that transmits programming from orbiting satellites to a customer\u2019s satellite dish. Cable systems carry all of their markets\u2019 local analog broadcast stations, while satellite services carry local broadcast stations in select markets. \u201cCable networks\u201d (such as CNN or MTV) produce or acquire television programming that is delivered to cable systems and satellite operators.", "Like broadcasters, cable television systems are also transitioning to digital, although they are under no government mandate to do so. Many cable operators have added \u201cdigital tiers\u201d to their programming offerings. Satellite systems have always transmitted their signals in digital. Both cable and satellite systems primarily use digital technology as a way of increasing the number of channels they can offer. References in this report to the \u201cDTV transition\u201d refer to the transition by local broadcast stations to the use of digital broadcast signals; it does not refer to the way that cable or satellite systems transmit their signals.", "For the DTV transition to be completed, and analog broadcasting to end, two major things need to happen: (1) television stations must broadcast a digital signal and (2) consumers must be able to view that signal. By May 1, 2002, all full-power commercial television stations across America were to have begun airing a DTV signal. As of October 17, 2002, however, only about 43 percent of these stations were broadcasting digitally; the remainder had filed for extensions with FCC. By May 1, 2003, all public broadcast stations also are to be broadcasting a DTV signal.", "For a household to see local digital broadcast signals via cable or satellite service, the household must have the necessary equipment, and its cable or satellite service must also carry local digital signals. For consumers to see the digital signal over the air via an antenna, they must either have a digital-to-analog converter box that will allow them to watch digital signals on their existing analog set, or they must own a digital television set that includes a tuner capable of receiving and processing a digital signal. To speed the DTV transition, FCC adopted in August 2002 a requirement that most new television sets must include an over-the-air tuner that receives digital broadcast signals. FCC set various deadlines for manufacturers to include DTV tuners in new television sets, with all sets over 13 inches required to include the tuners by July 1, 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transition to DTV Will Allow the Return of Valuable Spectrum but Will Require Millions of Americans to Buy New Equipment", "paragraphs": ["One important goal of the DTV transition is to recapture portions of the radiofrequency spectrum currently used for analog broadcasting so this spectrum can be used for public safety needs and auctioned to private companies. Under the law, the spectrum is due to be reclaimed by December 2006, but this date can be extended if less than 85 percent of households in a given market can receive the DTV signal. FCC is still in the process of determining how to interpret the statutory provisions concerning when the 85 percent threshold has been met. Even when 85 percent of households can receive DTV, concerns remain about the impact on the remaining 15 percent of the population, who would not be able to access some or all broadcast channels until they purchased new equipment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recapture of Broadcast Spectrum Is an Important Goal of the DTV Transition", "paragraphs": ["An important motivation for completing the DTV transition is to recapture parts of the broadcast spectrum. One goal is to free up portions of the broadcast spectrum that have been reallocated for public safety needs, such as communications by local police and fire departments. The Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee, in a 1996 report to the FCC, said that an additional 97.5 MHz of spectrum would be needed for public safety communications uses by 2010. In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congress directed FCC to reallocate 24 MHz of the spectrum to be reclaimed from broadcasters to public safety uses. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Chairman of FCC said that freeing up spectrum for public safety uses has become an even higher priority.", "In addition, the vast expansion of wireless technologies in recent years by mobile telephone, broadband Internet, and wireless companies, has greatly increased these industries\u2019 demand for portions of the radiofrequency spectrum currently used for television broadcasting. This demand arises not only because of the general scarcity of spectrum, but also because the spectrum used for broadcasting has qualities that make it ideal for the provision of many wireless mobile services.", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 directed FCC to auction certain portions of the spectrum freed up by the DTV transition according to certain timelines. The Congressional Budget Office has raised concerns that early auction timing could devalue the spectrum because bidders would have to wait years before being able to use the spectrum. The Auction Reform Act of 2002 modified the statutory deadlines set by the Balanced Budget Act and gave FCC increased flexibility in determining when to complete auctions for the remainder of the spectrum. The Auction Reform Act noted that delay in the return of portions of the spectrum used for broadcasting reduces both the amount of money that auctions are likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum will be purchased by the entities that will put it to its most productive use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Date When DTV Transition Will Be Completed and Spectrum Returned Is Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["FCC established 2006 as the target date for completing the DTV transition, and this was later codified by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. By December 31, 2006, the goal is for broadcasters no longer to broadcast the analog television signal, and for the spectrum that they vacate to be returned so that it can be made fully available for other uses. However, because the Congress was concerned about leaving substantial numbers of households without the ability to access broadcast television signals, the law specifically provided for extensions in certain circumstances. Under the statute, FCC must grant extensions to requesting stations in a television market where it finds that one of the following three conditions exists: 1.  at least one television station affiliated with the four largest national networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, or NBC) is not broadcasting a DTV signal; 2.  the technology to convert a digital signal for use on an analog television set is not generally available; or 3.  fewer than 85 percent of television households in the television market has the ability to receive DTV\u2014a television household would not count as receiving DTV if it (a) did not subscribe to a \u201cmultichannel video programming distributor\u201d (such as a cable or satellite service) that carries a digital broadcast channel from each broadcaster in that market and (b) did not have a television receiver or a digital-to-analog converter capable of receiving digital broadcast signals.", "How FCC interprets the third provision\u2014sometimes referred to as the \u201c85 percent rule\u201d\u2014has important implications for when the broadcast spectrum can be returned. Several aspects of this provision are still to be determined. For example:   Defining a \u201cmarket\u201d: It has not yet been established what constitutes a television market under the statute. FCC officials told us that they have not yet determined what market definition to use, and that this would likely be established in a formal proceeding.", "Counting cable subscribers: For a household to count as receiving DTV via cable, its cable service must carry at least one digital programming channel from each broadcaster in its market. But it is not yet clear whether a household subscribing to such a service counts if it does not have the equipment necessary to actually view that programming (i.e., it does not have a digital television set or set-top converter box).", "Method of measurement: It is not yet clear what method would be used to actually measure how many households in a market can receive DTV signals. Some information may be available from cable and satellite providers, but it is uncertain how FCC will determine how many households in a market have the equipment to receive DTV over the air.", "In a January 2001 notice of proposed rulemaking that focused on cable carriage of DTV signals, FCC included a section seeking comment on how to count DTV households for the purpose of reaching the 85 percent threshold. FCC has not yet issued a ruling on this notice, and FCC officials told us that few of the comments received touched on the 85 percent rule. The officials also noted that because DTV penetration is still very low, clarifying the 85 percent rule does not need to be addressed immediately. We asked FCC in a letter for its interpretation of the statute regarding how cable subscribers will count. In a return letter, FCC said that it has not yet adopted a definitive interpretation of that provision of the statute, but that it may initiate a proceeding in the near future that focuses on soliciting public comment on the issue.", "The first and second provisions of the statute cited above\u2014that major network affiliates broadcast the digital signal and that technology be available to allow the signal to be converted for use on an analog television set\u2014are not likely to be an obstacle to the transition. However, there was a consensus among most industry experts we spoke with that the third provision\u2014the 85 percent rule\u2014will probably not be met in most markets by 2006. To reach 85 percent penetration of DTV signals, a series of interrelated changes need to occur, many of which are largely driven by the market. These changes include the availability of more digital programming, increased carriage of digital signals by cable companies, and increased consumer purchases of DTV receivers or converter boxes. As discussed throughout this report, serious roadblocks still remain to achieving each of these changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DTV Transition Will Require Millions of American Households to Buy Additional Equipment to Continue to Access Broadcast Stations", "paragraphs": ["The DTV transition will impose some cost, either directly or indirectly, on all television viewers. To be able to receive DTV signals, a household must take one of several actions. It either must (1) purchase a television set that includes a tuner capable of receiving digital broadcast signals, (2) purchase a converter box that captures the digital broadcast signal and converts it to a format that can be shown on an analog television set, or (3) subscribe to a cable or satellite provider that is carrying the broadcast stations\u2019 digital signals as well as have the equipment necessary to receive that provider\u2019s digital signals. All of these options involve some financial cost related to DTV equipment\u2014and digital television sets and tuners are currently relatively expensive. Although the price of these technologies is expected to drop dramatically as more units are produced, the cost still may be a burden to many households, particularly low-income households.", "Once the 85 percent threshold has been met in a market and the analog signals are turned off, the remaining 15 percent of households will no longer be able to receive some or all broadcast channels. Households that were receiving their television solely over the air, and had not yet purchased a digital television set or converter box, would lose all television service. These households would need to purchase a new television set or converter box to resume their access to broadcast television. Households that were subscribing to cable or satellite would, depending on their circumstances, need to get the necessary equipment to view their cable or satellite services\u2019 digital signals or purchase an over- the-air digital tuner (if they did not have one already) to continue to receive the local broadcast channels not being provided by their cable or satellite service. Nationwide, 15 percent of American television households represents nearly 16 million households, consisting of about 40 million people, who would lose access to at least some of their local broadcast channels until they purchased additional equipment.", "In addition, many households that are able to receive all DTV signals via their cable system will still face some loss of television service. Many households that have cable or satellite service also have one or more additional television sets that are not hooked up to this service. Any such sets that do not contain an over-the-air digital tuner will no longer function without the purchase and installation of a set-top converter box once analog service ends. Overall, approximately 81 million television sets in 42 million American homes currently receive their television signal solely over the air, according to Consumer Electronics Association estimates.", "Policy-makers will likely find it unpalatable to disenfranchise a large number of American households from the ability to receive broadcast television signals. The importance that many Americans attach to having television access was illustrated a few years ago in a series of lawsuits involving several broadcasters and a satellite video distribution company named PrimeTime 24. As a result of court rulings, the satellite distributor was ordered to stop providing certain broadcast signals to about 2 million satellite subscribers. This potential loss of service engendered an enormous amount of correspondence from affected satellite subscribers to Members of Congress, resulting in considerable pressure for a solution before the signals were to be shut off. The PrimeTime 24 case is not a perfect analogy to the DTV transition: that case had the potential to completely turn off certain television signals to certain consumers, whereas at the completion of the DTV transition, households can choose to maintain their television service by purchasing additional equipment. But the PrimeTime 24 case does serve to illustrate how the public may react to any disruption in their television service. As with the PrimeTime 24 case, political pressure will likely develop among those American households faced with an impending loss of television service due to termination of the analog signals.", "Many other countries also are wrestling with how to complete their DTV transition without stranding substantial numbers of consumers who have not yet adopted DTV equipment when the analog signals are shut off. For example:   The government of the United Kingdom has said that its broadcasters will turn off the analog signals when at least 95 percent of households can receive the digital signals. In addition, United Kingdom officials have noted that their decision about a turn-off date will also factor in the affordability of DTV equipment.", "The Canadian government\u2019s recent policy statement on DTV states that \u201cconsumers will be able to upgrade their equipment at their own pace and convenience\u201d and that the transition will be \u201cmarket-driven.\u201d Canadian officials told us that industry interests opposed any strict deadlines for turning off analog signals. In setting the date for turning off analog signals, the Japanese government factored in the average life cycle of a television set in Japan (8 years) and the expected cost of digital television sets after the economies of mass production are realized. On the basis of that analysis, government officials told us that consumer adoption of digital television sets will be sufficient to turn off the analog signals without serious adverse effect to consumers by 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consumer Adoption of DTV Has Been Slow, Partly Because Many Americans Are Unaware of the Transition and Are Not Well Informed about DTV Products", "paragraphs": ["In a telephone survey of 1,000 randomly selected American households, we found that many people have little understanding of the DTV transition and its implications.

For example, we found that men were considerably more likely to know about the transition than women, and those who were college- educated were more knowledgeable than those without advanced education. Also, we found some evidence that respondents who received television over the air were less likely than cable or satellite subscribers to know about the transition to DTV.

If consumers are unfamiliar with DTV\u2014 particularly with benefits such as high definition television\u2014they are less likely to purchase digital television sets. Yet, if few consumers purchase digital television sets, producers have little incentive to provide much digital content and cable systems have little incentive to carry the digital signal. Thus, consumer awareness of the transition\u2014and subsequent consumer adoption of DTV equipment\u2014is a key element in facilitating the transition.", "Chairman Powell\u2019s April 2002 proposal for voluntary industry actions to speed the DTV transition suggested several actions that sought to increase consumer awareness. The Chairman called on broadcast stations to use their analog channel to promote the content on their digital channel. He also called on cable systems to market their DTV products and programming on the air and in customers\u2019 monthly bills. In addition, he asked DTV equipment manufacturers and retailers to market broadcast, cable, and satellite DTV options to consumers at the point-of-sale. In response to this proposal, the 10 largest cable operators said they would do more to advertise and market their value-added DTV programming, and consumer electronics makers said they would use point-of-sale promotions and a national public awareness campaign to promote DTV set-top boxes. In addition, in January 2002, the broadcast and consumer electronics industries formed a joint initiative to increase awareness and understanding of DTV through promotional activities in select cities.", "FCC itself has not undertaken any significant activities to raise public awareness about the DTV transition and its implications. An FCC official told us that the agency provides information about DTV in several places on its Web site and through the call center of its Consumer & Governmental Affairs Bureau. However, although the Powell plan addresses actions that industry should take, FCC has no specific initiatives of its own under way regarding public education on DTV or the transition. FCC officials told us that the bulk of consumer education that is related to DTV will likely be provided by the private sector, such as through advertisements and point-of-sale discussions, rather than by the government. However, because DTV sales and programming are still relatively limited, consumer electronics makers and other industries may not have sufficient market incentives to provide a high-profile DTV marketing campaign in the short term.

The law says that households receiving DTV via cable count toward the 85 percent threshold only when their cable system carries a digital broadcast channel from all stations broadcasting digitally in their television market.

As a result, it appears highly unlikely that cable carriage of local digital broadcast signals will be sufficient to substantially contribute to reaching an 85 percent market penetration by 2006. To some extent, this problem is mitigated by FCC\u2019s recent DTV tuner mandate. In the future, as cable customers purchase new television sets that contain a DTV tuner, they will be able to receive digital signals over the air even if their cable system is not carrying those signals.

With few viewers owning digital television sets, networks have little incentive to provide more value- added digital programming, such as HDTV. This completes a circle: with few consumers owning digital television sets, and little digital programming available, few cable systems have any incentive to carry local digital signals.

FCC officials told us that such a scenario could have two unintended outcomes. First, it could create a de facto policy of dual must-carry. Second, the policy could inadvertently harm smaller broadcast stations and their viewers. Once the analog must-carry requirement were to end, many cable systems might choose to continue carrying the analog signals of large stations (which have a large market share) but not of small stations.

To continue to receive local broadcast channels via cable once the switchover occurred, consumers whose cable system was no longer providing any analog signals would require either a digital cable-ready television set or some form of cable set-top box. Digital cable-ready television sets are not yet available on the market, and some consumers are resistant to using set-top boxes. NCTA officials also said that smaller cable systems with no digital capability at all may need some kind of exemption.

However, given that more than two-thirds of Americans get their television via cable, and given that the DTV tuner mandate will not take full effect for several more years, policies targeted at cable households could be important to meeting the 85 percent threshold in a timely fashion. NCTA officials\u2019 concern about ensuring that consumers have the necessary equipment for a date-certain switchover is also understandable: the rollout of DTV-compatible cable equipment will likely be costly, cumbersome, and confusing. However, it is important to note that for the DTV transition to occur, this rollout will occur with or without a date-certain switchover.

FCC and television manufacturers generally consider a digital cable-ready set to include, at a minimum, a digital cable tuner (to receive and process digital signals) and a slot for a \u201cpoint of deployment\u201d (POD) security device (to handle encrypted cable programming).", "In February 2000, after much negotiation, the Consumer Electronics Association and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association submitted to FCC an agreement of basic technical standards for a digital cable-ready television set. However, since that time, the two industries have been unable to resolve details related to that agreement, including licensing and programming guide issues. Television manufacturers say they are reluctant to roll out digital cable-ready sets until all cable systems implement the agreed-upon technical standards, and they have requested that FCC implement a timetable for national cable standards. FCC and the Congress are monitoring the negotiations but so far have left the issues to the industries to resolve on their own and, to date, have not imposed any significant requirements regarding digital cable-ready television sets.", "Because far more households receive local broadcast signals via cable than via over the air, pairing a digital cable-ready mandate with the existing over-the-air tuner mandate might be an efficient policy for ensuring that households are able to receive and watch DTV signals. It is not clear what the additional manufacturing cost would be of incorporating digital cable tuners and POD slots into television sets that already include digital over-the-air tuners. The Consumer Electronics Association has stated that because the electronic components for digital cable tuners are almost identical to those for digital broadcast tuners, \u201cmanufacturers could include combination broadcast and cable tuners in their products at a cost that would be little greater than the cost of either a broadcast-only tuner or a cable-only tuner.\u201d Nonetheless, a more detailed cost-benefit analysis would need to be undertaken before such a policy was implemented, particularly in light of the probable requirement for a POD slot to make the set digital cable-ready.", "The idea previously discussed in this report for a \u201cdate-certain\u201d cable switchover from analog signals to digital signals might be especially effective if paired with a mandate that all new television sets sold be digital cable-ready. Because about 25 million new television sets are sold each year, significant numbers of households would own a television set capable of receiving digital signals via cable without the need for a set-top box by the date-certain cable switchover, thereby lessening the need of cable subscribers to obtain set-top boxes when the switchover occurs.", "Direct broadcast satellite service, like cable and over the air, requires a digital tuner to decode the digital signal and turn it into the picture that appears on the television screen. Satellite uses a third format for transmission of digital signals. Some digital television sets on the market are digital \u201csatellite-ready\u201d in that they incorporate a satellite tuner and do not require a set-top box to receive satellite service. However, a satellite DTV tuner mandate would not help reach the 85 percent threshold to the extent that a cable DTV tuner mandate would. First, there are many more cable subscribers than satellite subscribers in the United States. In addition, unlike cable operators, satellite operators are not required to carry local broadcast channels (although if they choose to carry any local channels in a market they are required to carry all of that market\u2019s channels). Satellite companies are uncertain about their plans for offering local broadcasts once the DTV transition is complete. This is partly because the HD programming that many local stations will be providing requires greater bandwidth than current analog programming, and this will impact the satellite systems\u2019 capacity to carry local broadcast stations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The DTV transition will affect nearly all Americans by changing the nature of television\u2014a main source of news and entertainment\u2014and requiring nearly every household to obtain new equipment. Despite this, few Americans seem aware of the DTV transition and the implications it will have for them. This lack of knowledge is, in and of itself, a barrier to the transition\u2019s timely completion. It is likely a factor in the sluggish sales for DTV equipment and the lack of pressure by viewers for networks to provide more HD programming and for cable systems to carry local digital broadcasts. To date, FCC has made recommendations to the private sector but has not undertaken significant initiatives of its own to increase public awareness about DTV and the transition.", "Until recently, laws passed by the Congress and rules implemented by FCC regarding the DTV transition have been focused largely on the rollout of DTV signals by broadcast stations. But factors driving consumer adoption also are important because the transition cannot be completed until sufficient numbers of households can view the digital broadcasts. The realization of most of these factors has largely been left to market forces. Generally, market-driven adoption of new technologies is considered best, but the current circumstances in the DTV transition suggest that it is unrealistic to anticipate that market forces will bring about the completion of the transition within the originally anticipated time frame. Thus, it would be helpful for policy-makers to better understand the various options that could be implemented to advance the timeliness of the DTV transition.", "FCC\u2019s recent DTV tuner mandate serves as a notable exception to the transition\u2019s market-driven approach. However, that mandate alone\u2014which will not take full effect until mid-2007\u2014may not be enough to complete the transition in a timely and reasonably seamless manner. An additional option would be to require digital cable-ready capability in addition to the over-the-air digital tuner. Because more than two-thirds of households receive cable, mandating that televisions be digital cable-ready may prove a cost-effective policy option for hastening the DTV transition, particularly when paired with the existing over-the-air mandate. While the additional cost of the digital cable tuner is likely small, it is less clear what the incremental cost of the POD slot would be. In addition, outstanding cable compatibility issues would need to be resolved before a digital cable-ready mandate could be implemented.", "Another policy option related to DTV that we have identified is to set a date-certain when broadcast stations\u2019 right to invoke a must-carry status for their stations\u2019 signals would transfer from their analog signals to their digital signals. This option could have the advantage of speeding up cable carriage of digital signals while avoiding problems inherent in requiring dual carriage. Pairing this date-certain switchover with a digital cable- ready mandate has the potential to be especially effective. The digital cable mandate would ensure that when the switchover did occur, a significant portion of households would both receive local digital broadcast signals and have the equipment in place to view those signals. However, the switchover policy could have disadvantages as well, such as possible adverse effects on smaller stations. As such, this policy would need to be evaluated more closely.", "One of the most important goals for completing the DTV transition is the recapture of the broadcast spectrum that televisions stations will be returning. There is significant economic value embodied in this spectrum, and it has been allocated for both public safety needs as well as for new commercial services. Delays in completing the DTV transition would compromise for some time the ability to fully utilize this spectrum. Understanding the relative time frames for the transition\u2014that is, the time frame with and without certain policy changes\u2014is key to understanding the implicit cost to society of allowing the transition to move at its current pace. Ultimately, decisions about implementing further legal or regulatory changes to speed the DTV transition require balancing the costs and burdens of those changes with the benefits of returning the broadcast spectrum in a timely fashion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Some issues affecting the DTV transition, such as the production of HD television programming, are largely outside of traditional federal legislative or regulatory control.

Our recommendations are in areas over which FCC or the Congress have authority, and that have not been widely discussed but could have an important impact on the success of the DTV transition and the speed with which spectrum used for broadcasting can be returned for other uses.", "We recommend that the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission take the following actions: 1.  Explore options to raise public awareness about the DTV transition and the implications it will have. For example, FCC might consider a public education campaign of its own, or it might consider partnering with the affected industries to provide consumers with more information about DTV products and the DTV transition. Such actions could help speed consumer adoption of DTV equipment as well as inform the public about a transition that will affect nearly all Americans. 2.  Direct the relevant FCC bureaus and offices to examine the costs and benefits of mandating that all new televisions be digital cable-ready in addition to the existing mandate for a digital over-the-air tuner. As part of this process, FCC should conduct an independent analysis that estimates (1) the additional cost to consumers of adding a digital cable tuner and POD slot and (2) the timetable of the DTV transition with and without such a mandate. FCC should then report its recommendations as to the actions it believes the Commission or the Congress should take regarding a digital cable-ready mandate. 3.  Direct FCC\u2019s Media Bureau to examine the advantages and disadvantages of a policy that would set a date-certain for cable carriage to switch from full carriage of analog signals to full carriage of digital signals. Such a policy could be implemented by transferring broadcasters\u2019 must-carry rights from analog to digital on that date, or through some other means. The Chairman also should direct the Media Bureau to examine the possibility of combining such a policy with a digital cable-ready mandate. As part of this examination, FCC should estimate the amount of time it will take for the DTV transition to be completed with and without implementation of these policy options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FCC for review and comment.

Regarding our recommendation on cable-ready DTV equipment, FCC noted that it has been engaged in a long-term effort to achieve compatibility between digital television sets and cable systems, and that many of the technical standards for digital cable-ready sets were not finalized until recently. FCC said it will be addressing these issues in a forthcoming Report and Order. Regarding our recommendation related to a date-certain for transfer of must-carry rights from analog signals to digital signals, FCC noted that its digital carriage proceeding sought comment on a wide range of options regarding must-carry, including an option similar to the one we described in our draft. FCC said that the record is now closed in that proceeding, and that its staff is preparing a draft order for the Commission\u2019s consideration.

To obtain anecdotal information on retail practices in marketing and selling DTV products, we visited 23 retail consumer electronic stores that sell DTV equipment in several locations: Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts; Las Vegas, Nevada; Los Angeles, California; and the Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. During our visits, we posed as shoppers and asked sales staff a standard set of questions designed to gauge their knowledge of information that would be important to a potential consumer of DTV equipment. We also interviewed senior executives at the corporate offices of 4 consumer electronics retailers.", "In addition, to gauge consumer awareness and understanding of the DTV transition, we contracted with Opinion Research Corporation (ORC), a national market research firm, to include questions regarding the DTV transition in one of the national telephone surveys conducted by ORC on a regular basis. The survey contained a set of 10 questions that asked respondents general questions about their television use (such as how they receive their television signal) and some questions specifically designed to gauge their knowledge and familiarity with the DTV transition. The questions were closed-ended, with response options read to the respondents. A total of 1,009 adults in the continental United States were interviewed between November 29 and December 2, 2001. The contractor\u2019s survey was made up of a random-digit-dialing sample of households with telephones, stratified by region.", "To use the survey results to make estimates about the entire adult population 18 years and older in the continental United States, ORC weighted the responses from the survey to represent the characteristics of all adults in the general public according to four variables: age, gender, geographic region, and race. Because our results are from a sample of the population, the resulting estimates have some sampling error associated with them. Sampling errors are often presented as a 95 percent confidence interval. The percentage estimates we present in this report have a 95 percent confidence interval of about plus or minus 3 percentage points or less. The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce nonsampling errors. As in any survey, differences in the wording of questions, the sources of information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not respond can lead to somewhat different results. We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors. For example, we developed our survey questions with the aid of a survey specialist and pretested the questions before submitting them to ORC.", "To understand the role of cable and satellite carriage in the DTV transition, we spoke with representatives from 5 large companies that that own multiple cable systems; 10 broadcast stations, including those with and without cable carriage of their digital signals; and the 2 national providers of direct broadcast satellite service.
