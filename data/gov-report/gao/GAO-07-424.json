DHS has also not fully implemented the key practices needed to actually control investments--either at the project level or at the portfolio level. For example, according to DHS officials and the department's control review schedule, DHS investment boards have not conducted regular investment reviews. Further, while GAO found that control activities are sometimes performed, they are not performed consistently across projects. In addition, because the policies and procedures for portfolio management have yet to be defined, control of the department's investment portfolios is ad hoc, according to DHS officials.

Each phase of the process is made up of multiple steps that set  out requirements that need to be met in order for the boards to make  decisions about the investments. The investment management phases are  aligned with projects\u2019 life cycle phases, as illustrated in figure 3.

The  document is to provide initial information, which is to be used to establish  a schedule for the investment\u2019s key milestone reviews and be reviewed by  the Integrated Project Review Team (IPRT). For major investments (level  1 and 2 investments), project managers are required to also assemble an  interdisciplinary team to assist in the management of the investment.  During this phase, the EAB assesses investments for alignment with the  enterprise architecture and provides recommendations to the appropriate  decision-making authorities (recommendations for level 1 investments are  made to the IRB, those for level 2 investments are made to the JRC, and  those for level 3 and 4 investments are made to the heads of the  components).

All new and existing  investments are to go through this phase in support of DHS\u2019s annual  programming and budgeting process. Based on the assessments during the  select phase, DHS is to prioritize investments and decide which  investments to include in its portfolios. The select phase is also intended  to help the department justify budget requests by demonstrating the  resources required for individual investments.

The purpose of the  reviews is to ensure that investments are performing within acceptable  cost, schedule, and performance parameters. The Acquisition Program  Baseline is the main control instrument used through predeployment to  baseline these parameters for investments. The IPRT reviews the  Acquisition Program Baseline and other periodic reporting documents and  provides recommendations to the project teams, if needed.

The overriding purpose of the framework is to encourage  investment processes that promote business value and mission  performance, reduce risk, and increase accountability and transparency in  the decision process. We have used the framework in several of our  evaluations, and a number of agencies have adopted it. These agencies  have used ITIM for purposes ranging from self-assessment to redesign of  their IT investment management processes.", "ITIM\u2019s five maturity stages (see fig. 4) represent steps toward achieving  stable and mature processes for managing IT investments. The successful  attainment of each stage leads to improvement in the organization\u2019s ability  to manage its investments. With the exception of the first stage, each  maturity stage is composed of \u201ccritical processes\u201d that must be  implemented and institutionalized in order for the organization to achieve  that stage. These critical processes are further broken down into key  practices that describe the types of activities that an organization should  be performing to successfully implement each critical process. It is not  unusual for an organization to be performing key practices from more than  one maturity stage at the same time. However, our research shows that  agency efforts to improve investment management capabilities should  focus on implementing all lower stage practices before addressing higher  stage practices.", "In the ITIM framework, Stage 2 critical processes lay the foundation for  sound IT investment processes by helping the agency to attain successful,  predictable, and repeatable investment control processes at the project  level. At Stage 2, the emphasis is on establishing basic capabilities for  selecting new IT projects, and on developing the capability to (1) control  projects so that they finish predictably within established cost, schedule,  and performance expectations and (2) identify and mitigate potential  exposures to risk.", "Stage 3 is where the agency moves from project-centric processes to  portfolio-based processes and evaluates potential investments by how well  they support the agency\u2019s missions, strategies, and goals. This stage  requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of complete investment portfolios\u2014integrated  and competing sets of investment options. It focuses on establishing a  consistent, well-defined perspective on IT investment portfolios and  maintaining mature, integrated selection (and reselection), control, and  evaluation processes, which are to be evaluated during PIRs. This  portfolio perspective allows decision makers to consider the interaction  among investments and the contributions to organizational mission goals  and strategies that could be made by alternative portfolio selections,  rather than to focus exclusively on the balance between the costs and  benefits of individual investments.

The officials attributed the absence of  procedures to resource constraints, stating that, with a full time staff of six  to support departmentwide investment management activities, they are  more focused on performing investment management rather than  documenting it in great detail. While we do not question the importance of  actually implementing IT investment management practices, as evidenced  by the fact that our ITIM framework provides for such implementation, it  is important to recognize that implementation of undefined processes will  at best produce ad hoc and inconsistent results. Accordingly, our  framework provides for both documenting how IT investment  management is to be performed through policies and procedures and for  actually implementing these policies and procedures. Unless DHS\u2019s IT  investment process guidance specifies procedures for Stage 2 activities  that cover all the elements of effective project-level investment  management, it is unlikely that key activities will be carried out  consistently and in a disciplined manner.

Taking an  agencywide perspective enables an organization to consider its  investments in a more comprehensive and integrated fashion, so that  collectively the investments optimally address the organization\u2019s missions,  strategic goals, and objectives. Managing IT investments as portfolios also  allows an organization to determine its priorities and make decisions  about which projects to begin funding and continue to fund based on  analyses of the relative organizational value and risks of all projects,  including projects that are proposed, under development, and in  operation.

However, these reviews are not conducted in a timely manner for all level  1 and 2 investments that are not the subject of congressional interest.  Officials stated that the Under Secretary for Management would likely be  issuing new guidance aimed at making the review schedule more  proactive.", "Finally, DHS officials told us that the investment boards do not effectively  track the implementation of corrective actions for underperforming  projects, primarily because they do not have a robust tool to support them  in this activity.", "This means that DHS executives do not have the information they need to  determine whether investments are meeting expectations, which increases  the risk that underperforming projects will not be identified and corrected  in a timely manner.", "Table 9 shows the ratings for each key practice required to control  investments (except for the policies and procedures, which were  discussed in the previous section) and summarizes the evidence that  supports these ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Implemented Key Practices Needed to Control Its Investment Portfolios", "paragraphs": ["The critical process associated with controlling investment portfolios  (evaluating the portfolio under Stage 3 of our ITIM framework) builds  upon the Stage 2 critical process providing investment oversight by  adding the elements of portfolio performance to an organization\u2019s  investment control capacity.

As a result, DHS officials stated that they are  performing portfolio-level control in an ad hoc manner. To begin  addressing this, they stated that an analyst was recently hired to help  develop guidance and procedures for the IT portfolios, and another staff  member is being recruited. Without documented policies and procedures  for controlling its investment portfolios, the department\u2019s efforts to  evaluate its portfolios will remain ad hoc, compounding its risk of  investing in new and existing IT systems that are not aligned with DHS\u2019s  mission and business priorities and do not meet cost, schedule, and  performance expectations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of IT to DHS\u2019s mission performance and outcomes,  it is vital for the department to adopt and employ an effective institutional  approach to IT investment management. To its credit, the department has  established aspects of such an approach and thus has a basis for achieving  greater maturity. However, its approach is missing key elements of  effective investment management, such as procedures for implementing  project-specific investment management policies, as well as policies and  procedures for portfolio-based investment management. Further, it has yet  to fully implement either project- or portfolio-level investment control  practices. All told, this means that DHS lacks the complete institutional  capability needed to ensure that it is investing in IT projects that best  support its strategic mission needs and that ongoing projects will meet  cost, schedule, and performance expectations.

We also validated and updated the results of the self- assessment through document reviews and interviews with officials. We  reviewed written policies, procedures, guidance, and other documentation  providing evidence of executed practices, including DHS\u2019s Investment  Review Process Management Directive, Capital Planning and  Investment Control Guide, Investment Management Handbook, Periodic  Reporting Manual, and various management memoranda.
