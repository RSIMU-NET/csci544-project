The cards do not certify legal residence within a country; thus, cardholders may be either legal or undocumented aliens. CID cards benefit the bearers by enabling them, in some instances, to use this form of identification to obtain driver's licenses, open bank accounts, show proof of identity to police, and gain access to other services. Mexico and Guatemala each take multiple steps to help ensure that the process for qualifying applicants seeking to obtain CID cards verifies the applicants' identities. After receiving criticism about the reliability of its CID card, Mexico took steps to improve identity verification procedures for its CID card issuance process. However, the Mexican issuance policy still relies on visual, rather than computer-based, verification of some documents used to obtain CID cards, including birth certificates that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) says may be fraudulently obtained. Both Mexico and Guatemala incorporate a variety of security features in their CID cards, such as holographic imagery. However, officials of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement warn that incorporating technical security features into identification documents such as CID cards does not guarantee their authenticity. Federal agencies hold different and, in some cases, conflicting views on the usage and acceptance of CID cards, and no executive branch guidance is yet available. A Homeland Security Council task force of executive branch agencies is reviewing identification document security but had not issued its findings at the time of GAO's review. The Department of the Treasury adopted a regulation in 2003 that, in effect, allows CID card acceptance, while an FBI official has stated that the Mexican CID card, in particular, is not a reliable form of identification and that its acceptance could support false identities. DHS expressed security concerns as well. The State Department has publicly expressed concerns about the impact restricting CID card use might have on U.S. citizens abroad, for example, if the United States had to issue its own CID cards in an emergency."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, a number of state and local government agencies and  financial institutions have begun accepting consular identification (CID)  cards issued by certain foreign governments as a service to their citizens  who, regardless of legal residence status, live in the United States.

Argentina has begun a program in Los Angeles to issue  CID cards with new security features to its citizens, while other countries,  including Peru and Bolivia, are considering issuing CID cards of their own.  Critics of CID cards have argued that acceptance of these cards facilitates  and promotes the continued unlawful stay within the country of  undocumented aliens.

An official with the Austin Police Department told us that in 2000 the  department became concerned about the rate of robberies committed  against the Hispanic immigrant community. Members of this community,  which, according to the official, includes a large number of undocumented  aliens, may not report crimes to the police for fear of deportation. After  meeting with representatives of the Hispanic community and the Mexican  consulate, the police department determined that robberies could be  reduced if community members made greater use of the U.S. banking  system rather than keeping large amounts of cash at home or on their  person. In November 2000, the Austin Police Department began contacting  area banks to determine if they would accept the Mexican CID card as  identification for opening bank accounts. According to this police  department official, one bank operating in Austin agreed to accept the  card as valid identification in early 2001.", "The Mexican embassy has reported that 160 financial institutions  nationwide now accept the Mexican CID card as proof of identity for  opening bank accounts. An official in the Guatemalan embassy told us that  that some banks are accepting the Guatemalan CID card as well. Some  reasons for financial institution acceptance of the Mexican CID, in  particular, were recently stated by a state banking association. The  association believes that bank acceptance of CID cards can aid law  enforcement, not only for assisting immigrants who may be targeted by  criminals because of their tendency to possess cash, but also for possibly  combating money\u2013laundering and terrorism. Banks, the association said,  are subject to numerous layers of federal and state regulation and  oversight that can assist federal officials in monitoring international  money transmissions. Also, banks accept the Mexican CID in order to  better serve members of the immigrant community without bank accounts,  often referred to as the \u201cunbanked.\u201d The association said that serving the  unbanked provides a new source for deposits, loans, and wire transfers,  which benefit the economy at large.", "In addition, a Treasury official said that there are no laws prohibiting  undocumented aliens from opening bank accounts in the United States  and that banks are not required to determine whether their customers are  present in the United States legally. The official also said that for purposes  of fraud or money-laundering detection, the department would prefer to  have as many people as possible active in the U.S. banking system,  because their financial activities could be closely monitored.", "Subsequent to the acceptance of the Mexican CID card by the bank in  Austin, the Austin Police Department itself decided to recognize the card  as a valid form of identification. In addition, the city of Austin also began  accepting the card to help Mexican citizens living in the community gain  access to community courts and obtain other documents, such as library  cards and copies of locally maintained medical records. A representative  of the Dallas, Texas, Police Department told us that the department began  accepting the CID cards primarily as a means to allow officers to properly  identify all people that they came in contact with who may lack other  forms of identification.

The  San Francisco Office of the Mayor, in a press release, declared that this  acceptance would help members of the Mexican immigrant community,  who may otherwise be jailed or deported for minor offenses if they do not  possess an accepted form of identification. Use of the CID card as a  recognized form of identification would, in turn, help reduce police  processing time spent handling these offenses. The release also cited a  benefit expressed by the Austin police, that extending official acceptance  to the CID card might allow immigrants to be less fearful in reporting  crimes to police, since they would now possess acceptable identification.", "Some cities and counties have begun accepting the Mexican CID card as  valid identification for obtaining city or county services.

In  discussing this decision, an official with the North Carolina Division of  Motor Vehicles (DMV) stated that the DMV had heard concerns through  the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) that  the FBI and DHS did not support public acceptance of the Mexican CID  card. In addition, this official informed us that some state residents had  expressed concerns over and opposition to Mexican CID card acceptance  to the Office of the Governor and DMV. Among these concerns, some  residents felt that CID acceptance might help people not legally present in  the United States to circumvent immigration laws.

This process  raised concerns for the FBI, which stated in congressional testimony in  June 2003 that the Mexican CID card was not a reliable form of  identification. An FBI agent cited Mexico\u2019s lack of a centralized database  to prevent multiple cards being issued to one individual and the inability of  consular field offices in the United States to share information about an  applicant\u2019s identity through a database. The FBI agent cited the Mexican  birth certificate, in particular, as a document that could easily be  fraudulently obtained and used as proof of identity.

Specifically, members of AAMVA were concerned  about the lack of (1) standardized issuance procedures, (2) uniform  security features on all valid CID cards, and (3) access to a secure  database to verify documents. In May 2003, AAMVA issued a resolution  stating that it was premature to recommend the use of foreign-issued CID  cards for identification purposes and that more information was needed to  assess the verifiability of the documents.", "Mexican consular officials told us they wanted to strengthen the CID card  issuance process, in part to provide more assurance to institutions  accepting the card and to federal law enforcement agencies that the  cardholder\u2019s identity was valid.

Mexican consulates can now  search a centralized CID card database containing the records of  approximately 2.6 million persons registered with the 45 Mexican  consulates in the United States. Mexican passport information is also  maintained on this system. In addition, consulates can verify the identity  of an applicant who uses a Mexican voter registration card by checking it  electronically against a voter registration database in Mexico.

As of April 2004, this database  held approximately 67 million records\u2014representing about 94 percent of  eligible Mexican voters.

They then used this card in  applying for a legitimate Washington State driver\u2019s license or identity card.  The office said that most of these individuals have done so in order to  establish a new identity to conceal a previous arrest or deportation.", "For example, in November 2003, counterfeit Mexican CID cards were  among the evidence seized by ICE agents during an authorized search at  two apartments near Seattle. In addition to seizing the CID cards, agents  seized a number of finished or partially finished counterfeit documents,  including Mexican birth certificates and driver\u2019s licenses; U.S. driver\u2019s  licenses from several states; U.S. immigration documents, such as resident  alien and permanent resident cards; and U.S. Social Security cards.

Section 326 of the act required the Secretary of the Treasury  to issue regulations requiring financial institutions to implement  procedures for verifying the identities of possible customers, maintaining  records for customers\u2019 identities, and consulting government lists of  known or suspected terrorists to ensure that customers are not on that  list. The act also required the department to issue a report to Congress  with recommendations for, among other things, determining the most  effective way for financial institutions to require identifying information  from foreign nationals.

Concerns over the issuance  process led the FBI to conclude that the document was unreliable and  could pose criminal and even terrorist threats. First, the official testified,  the Mexican CID card could be used as a breeder document, that is, a  document that would allow access to other forms of legitimate  identification, for establishing a false identity. For example, if a card were  fraudulently obtained under a false identity, it could be then used to get a  driver\u2019s license in some states. A criminal, according to the FBI, could then  establish several false identities that would greatly facilitate such crimes  as money laundering or check fraud. Second, CID card unreliability can  make alien smuggling easier. The FBI official testified that federal officials  have arrested alien smugglers with several CID cards in their possession.  The FBI has said that these would not only help conceal the smugglers\u2019  identities, but also further entice aliens to entrust their transport to these  smugglers.", "The FBI has also cited the threat of falsely obtained CID cards being used  by terrorists to move about in the United States. The FBI official testified  that individuals of various national origins have been discovered in  possession of CID cards. If foreign nationals were able to create fictitious  identities in the United States, they could move about the country without  triggering identification from any name-based terrorist watch lists. The  FBI official said that one individual from Iran was arrested in Texas in  February 2003 in possession of a Mexican CID card. He obtained the card  in California by using a counterfeit Mexican birth certificate and was able  to obtain a California State ID card.", "In testimony given during the same hearing, an official from DHS\u2019s Border  and Transportation Security Directorate said that in light of the increased  demand for CID cards and heightened security concerns in a post- September 11 environment, it also had concerns about the use and  acceptance of CID cards. DHS believed that some individuals had obtained  multiple cards under different identities. DHS also echoed the FBI\u2019s  concerns over use of a CID card as a breeder document for obtaining other  forms of identification, which in turn may be used for criminal purposes.", "The State Department has not adopted a policy on foreign-issued  identification documents or CID cards. However, in June 2003, a State  Department official testified during the same hearing about the  department\u2019s involvement and interests in any CID card acceptance policy  being developed. The official said that any policy developed must consider  the impact on the department\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities  regarding consular affairs, both domestically and abroad. According to the  department, under the VCCR, a foreign national arrested or detained in the  United States must be advised of his or her right to request that the  appropriate consular officials be notified of the detention without delay.  Because a foreign CID may serve to identify an individual as a foreign  national, an individual in possession of this card can alert federal, state,  and municipal law enforcement authorities of the need to provide consular  notification to contact consular officials from his or her nation for  assistance. The State Department views CID cards as a tool that law  enforcement officials may use to help facilitate observance of this  obligation under the VCCR.", "In addition, the State Department believes that any policy developed that  prohibits foreign-issued CID card acceptance within the United States  could foreclose U.S. options to assist Americans overseas. The State  Department may occasionally issue nonpassport identity cards or travel  documents to U.S. citizens abroad in times of emergency and under other  special circumstances. A State Department official told us that the United  States should keep its options open for any future document issuance  needs that may arise. This official said that the department has discussed  the possibility of issuing special ID cards for U.S. citizens who live near  the borders of Mexico or Canada and cross these borders often. It would  be difficult to ask these nations to accept such a form of identification if  the United States refused to accept CID cards, the official said."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Under international treaty, foreign governments are allowed to issue  identification documents to their citizens living in the United States, but  federal agencies, state and local governments, and financial institutions  must determine the advisability of accepting such documents as a basis for  providing services to the document holder. Thus, for all of these  institutions, acceptance of CID cards is discretionary; there is no federal  guidance in place to assist state and local governments and others in  determining whether a CID card presented for identification purpose is  authentic; that is, that it belongs to the individual presenting the document  or that it has not been fraudulently obtained. Consistent federal guidance  could provide state and local governments and other entities with a basis  for assessing the authenticity of CID cards, which in turn would assist  them in determining whether, for what purpose, and for what duration  they should accept these cards. The absence of consistent federal  guidance could result in inconsistent acceptance of these cards by such  institutions and consequent uncertainty on the part of aliens trying to use  the cards to obtain services, as well as a heightened risk that CID cards be  used to support false identities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the Homeland Security Council direct its task  force, in consultation with key federal agencies, to complete its efforts to  develop policies and implement consistent guidance that would reconcile  potential conflicts among federal agencies and enable state and local  governments, financial institutions, and others to assess the authenticity of  CID cards issued by foreign governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Homeland Security Council, the  Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, and Homeland Security for their  review and comment.

DHS said that  developing appropriate standards for identity documents is a critical next  step to reducing security vulnerabilities associated with such documents.  DHS also noted that the department does not recognize CID cards as valid  travel documents and does not accept them for entry into this country.", "DHS also said that CID cards should not be considered of greater concern  than other identity documents used in the United States and that the  administration\u2019s position on CID cards is clear: they are not acceptable as  proof of legal presence in the United States. We agree on both points. We  focused our review on CID cards and made no judgment on the relative  susceptibility to misuse of other identification documents. However, in  discussing the results of a DHS investigation, we listed a number of other  counterfeit documents that DHS agents had recovered, including driver\u2019s  licenses, U.S. immigration documents, and social security cards\u2014all of  which could be used to help establish a fraudulent identity.", "We also agree that the position of the United States, as well as that of the  other nations whose officials we interviewed, is clear and consistent that  CID cards issued by foreign countries do not establish or indicate lawful  U.S. immigration status. Our report prominently states this position.  However, the position of the United States on what constitutes prudent  acceptance of CID cards for other than immigration purposes by federal,  state, local, and private institutions does not appear to be so clear and  consistent. Officials of some federal agencies support the continued  acceptance of CID cards for some purposes, while others have expressed  serious concerns about the dangers of accepting them. Individual states  and local jurisdictions have developed conflicting policies regarding the  acceptance of CID cards. As officials of DHS and other agencies told us,  the Homeland Security Council has formed a working group to review the  status and acceptable uses of CIDs in the United States, but has not yet  issued its findings. For this reason, we have recommended that, as part of  its review, the working group develop consistent guidance to help public  and private institutions assess the authenticity of CID cards.", "DHS also suggested that we provide greater context for the customary and  historical use of CID cards. We believe that our discussion of the legal  basis for CID card issuance under international treaty; the history of CID  card use, particularly Mexico\u2019s 133-year history of CID card issuance; and  the accepted and legitimate uses of CID cards sufficiently addresses this  issue.

We contacted the embassies of eight countries (Bolivia, El  Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, and Poland) to  learn their plans for issuing CID cards and determined that Mexico and  Guatemala were issuing CID cards in the United States. We selected these  countries because they were among those cited as currently issuing CID  cards in the United States, or considering doing so, by federal, state, or  local officials we interviewed, or who testified on the subject at  congressional hearings in June 2003. We interviewed Mexican and  Guatemalan embassy officials and obtained documents regarding their  CID card program. We also interviewed officials from police departments  in Austin and Dallas, Texas, and reviewed documents from the city of San  Francisco. We contacted officials at the Office of the Mayor in the city of  Lake Worth, Florida; the American Bankers Association; the American  Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators; the Department of Housing  and Community Affairs in Montgomery County, Maryland; and six  independent advocacy and research groups to discuss their views on CID  acceptance. Additionally, we reviewed testimony by the Texas Bankers  Association before the Texas Legislature regarding their position on  financial institutions\u2019 acceptance of CID cards. To identify states that have  recently rescinded acceptance of CID cards for driver\u2019s license issuance or  other state services, we researched the Lexis Nexis database for state  legislation from 2002 through 2003 that has been passed or proposed  concerning CID acceptance. From this information, we noted any states  that had repealed CID acceptance. We interviewed officials in North  Carolina regarding their administrative decision to revoke CID acceptance  as proof of identification in driver\u2019s license issuance.", "To determine steps Mexico and Guatemala have taken to verify the  identities of CID card applicants and incorporate security features in CID  cards, we interviewed officials from the Mexican and Guatemalan  embassies and consulate offices to obtain information and documentation  about their CID card programs. We also observed the Mexican consulate\u2019s  issuance of CID cards at an off\u2013site facility. Additionally, we interviewed  and obtained documentation related to issuance procedures and security  features from the company that manufactures and maintains the  Guatemalan CID card, passport, and consular registry programs. We did  not perform an evaluation of the Mexican and Guatemalan CID card  programs. We relied exclusively on information and data provided by  embassy and consulate officials in describing the issuance systems and  card security features utilized in their CID card programs. We also  interviewed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents responsible  for investigating the production of fraudulent identity documents,  including Mexican CID cards, in Lynnwood, Washington. We interviewed  officials with DHS\u2019s Forensic Document Laboratory regarding general  security standards for identity documents. To determine the positions and  policies of federal agencies regarding the usage and acceptance of CID  cards, we interviewed officials from the Department of the Treasury, DHS,  the Department of Justice, and the Department of State, and reviewed  testimony by the latter three agencies.
