Ships that are no longer needed are screened for other uses, including transfer to another country under proper legal authority, use by another federal agency, and donation to a state or private recipient for appropriate public use. Ships may also be sunk as part of naval training exercises. Ships not used for any of these purposes are considered available for scrapping.", "According to a July 1997 MARAD study, ship scrapping is a labor-intensive industry with extremely high risks with respect to environmental and worker safety issues. Ships typically contain environmentally hazardous materials such as asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), lead, mercury, and cadmium. A ship is normally dismantled from the top down and from one end to the other with torches that cut away large parts of the ship. Pieces of the ship are lifted by crane to the ground where they are cut into the shapes and sizes required by the foundry or smelter to which the scrap is to be shipped. Remediation of hazardous materials takes place prior to, as well as during, the dismantling process. If done improperly, ship scrapping can pollute the land and water surrounding the scrapping site and jeopardize the health and safety of the people involved in the scrapping process.", "Ship scrapping is subject to federal, state, and local government rules and regulations on the protection of the environment and worker safety. These rules and regulations implement pertinent laws in these areas. In the environmental area, these laws include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. In the worker safety area, the primary law is the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Various federal and state regulatory agencies work to enforce these laws. (See app. I for more information about these laws.)", "Historically, government-owned surplus ships have been scrapped both domestically and overseas. As shown in table 1, MARAD has relied primarily on overseas scrapping, while the Navy has relied primarily on the domestic industry to scrap its ships. From 1983 through 1994, MARAD sold almost all of its ships for overseas scrapping. Since 1982, the Navy has not directly sold any ships for overseas scrapping.", "Federal agencies report that there are about 200 ships awaiting disposal or scrapping and that they are stored at various locations throughout the United States. As shown in table 2, the Navy and MARAD have the majority of ships to be scrapped, but the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also have some. The Navy reports that, as of August 1, 1998, it had 127 surplus ships available to be sold for scrap. Seventy-two of these ships are expected to be sold though the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS). The remaining 55 ships are expected to be transferred to MARAD for sale. MARAD, which is the U.S. government\u2019s disposal agent for surplus merchant-type ships of 1,500 tons or more, reports that it had 63 ships available for scrapping. By law, MARAD is required to dispose of all obsolete ships by September 30, 2001. The combined tonnage of Navy and MARAD surplus ships amounts to about 1 million tons\u2014about 600,000 tons for the Navy and 400,000 tons for MARAD.", "Navy and MARAD officials have estimated that it will cost them at least $58 million (in fiscal year 1997 dollars) for storage, maintenance, and security of surplus ships between fiscal year 1999 and 2003 if they are not scrapped. Some ships are in such poor condition that they may need dry-docking for repairs to keep them afloat until they can be scrapped. MARAD estimates that its dry-docking and repair costs could be as high as $800,000 per ship."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Contributing to the Backlog of Ships", "paragraphs": ["A number of factors have caused the current backlog of federal surplus ships awaiting scrapping. They include (1) reductions in the Navy\u2019s force structure following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact; (2) unavailability of overseas scrapping; (3) difficulties experienced by some domestic scrappers in complying with environmental, worker safety, and other contract performance provisions; and (4) a shortage of qualified domestic bidders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Navy Force Structure Reductions", "paragraphs": ["Navy force structure reductions following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have resulted in an increased number of ships to be scrapped. Since 1990, the Navy has reduced its active fleet from 570 ships to 333 ships. The Navy\u2019s inactive fleet has increased by 82 percent since 1990 and the number of ships to be scrapped increased from about 25 in 1991 to 127 as of August 1, 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unavailability of Overseas Scrapping", "paragraphs": ["Overseas scrapping by MARAD was suspended in 1994 in response to an April 1993 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) letter advising the agency that the export for disposal of PCB materials with concentrations of 50 parts per million or greater was prohibited. In accordance with the Toxic Substances Control Act, EPA regulates all aspects of the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of PCBs. In 1980, EPA banned the export of PCBs for disposal. In 1989, the Navy became aware of the presence of PCBs in solid materials on board some of its older ships and sought EPA\u2019s advice on how to properly handle and dispose of these materials. Subsequently, EPA confirmed that surplus ships could not be exported for scrapping if they contained solid materials with concentrations of PCBs at 50 parts per million or greater.", "In 1997, the Navy and MARAD, each negotiated an agreement with EPA to allow for the export of ships for scrapping provided (1) all liquid PCBs are removed prior to export, (2) items containing solid PCBs that are readily removable and do not affect the structural integrity of the ship are also removed, and (3) countries to which the ships may be exported for scrapping are notified so that they have the opportunity to refuse to accept the ships if they so choose. The Navy and MARAD sought these agreements principally because they recognized a need to reduce their backlogs of surplus ships and the limitations of domestic scrapping efforts.", "Despite the agreement with EPA, Navy officials decided in December 1997 to temporarily suspend any export of ships for scrapping due to (1) continuing concerns regarding environmental pollution and worker safety in foreign ship scrapping countries and (2) potential impacts on the domestic ship scrapping industry. In January 1998, MARAD also suspended the export of ships. As of August 1998, the voluntary suspension on exports was still in effect.", "Specific environmental concerns revolve around the export of PCBs and other hazardous materials that could be dumped along the shorelines of developing nations and about the health and safety of foreign workers. For example, domestic industry representatives have stated that foreign ship scrapping operations would not be in compliance with the strict U.S. safety and environmental regulations. U.S. government officials have also stated that many of the major overseas ship scrapping countries have less stringent laws and regulations regarding environmental and worker safety issues than exist in the United States.", "Domestic industry concerns are related to the history of foreign scrappers bidding significantly higher prices to scrap ships overseas. This is due, in part, to a greater demand and higher selling price for scrap metal in foreign countries and lower costs of overseas operations because of the less restrictive environmental and worker safety regulations and lower labor rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Domestic Industry Performance Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["Between 1991 and 1996, the Navy repossessed 20 of the 62 ships it had sold to domestic firms for scrapping due to environmental pollution and safety compliance problems and other contractor performance issues. For example, the former aircraft carrier, U.S.S. Oriskany, and five other ships located at a contractor\u2019s facility in the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, were repossessed by the Navy due to the contractor\u2019s not obtaining the necessary environmental permits and the dissolution of the contractor\u2019s partnership. Some of these repossessions were costly. For example, according to a Navy official, it had to spend about $2 million to tow 14 ships back to federal storage facilities in Philadelphia from North Carolina and Rhode Island when a ship scrapping contract was terminated due to contractor noncompliance with environmental and safety regulations. Also, the Navy and DRMS incurred additional costs for maintaining, storing, and reselling these ships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortage of Qualified Bidders", "paragraphs": ["The domestic ship scrapping industry has historically been small. During the 1970s, when hundreds of ships were scrapped domestically, the industry was comprised of about 30 firms. However, given the small number of ships available for domestic scrapping since then, many of the firms exited the industry. Currently, there are four private ship scrappers in the United States actively scrapping federal surplus ships. In addition, for national security reasons, one naval shipyard is scrapping nuclear submarines. The typical U.S. private sector ship scrapping site is located in an urban industrial area coincident with other industrial and maritime related facilities. The facilities area is generally small, fewer than 10 acres, and most of the firms, until recently, worked on only one ship at a time. According to a July 1997 MARAD study, ship scrapping companies tend to be thinly capitalized. The study concluded that the industry is a risky, highly speculative business.", "Following the Navy\u2019s experience with high rates of ship repossessions between 1991 and 1996, both the Navy and MARAD considered fewer firms to be technically and financially acceptable. For example, in response to MARAD\u2019s 1996 solicitation for scrapping eight ships, the agency received only five positive bids, and only one of these was considered technically acceptable by the agency. MARAD awarded the bidder only two ships, in part, because of the bidder\u2019s limited scrapping capacity. Similarly, Navy/DRMS solicitations in 1996 and 1997, for a total of 11 ships, resulted in only two technically acceptable proposals for each solicitation and the award of only two ships. Both the MARAD and Navy awards were made to the same firm.", "Recent testimony to Congress and statements made by domestic industry officials raise doubts about the willingness of new firms to enter the industry and current firms to substantially expand their operations under current conditions. Some domestic industry representatives stated that the profits from ship scrapping have not been commensurate with the financial risks and environmental liabilities associated with it, and one representative stated that his firm was no longer willing to assume such risks. However, other industry representatives believed that they could make a profit scrapping ships, as long as they could get enough ships to justify large scale and continuous production. As discussed later, the agencies have (1) taken action to sell ships in lots and (2) recognized that steps are needed to minimize environmental and worker safety risks associated with ship scrapping to make ship scrapping more financially attractive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Efforts to Address the Backlog", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the Navy and MARAD identified and began implementing a number of initiatives to address domestic ship scrapping performance problems.

For example, prior to January 1996, DRMS (1) accepted all technical proposals with the invitation for bid, (2) relied on the high bid without seeking an independent review of the company\u2019s business or financial background, and (3) performed only minimal contract oversight and on-site progress reviews. In an effort to correct these problems, the Navy and DRMS began taking several actions to improve their scrapping practices, as well as to make other improvements in the ship scrapping program. While sufficient experience with the actions taken is not yet available because only two Navy ships have been scrapped since 1996, the actions appear to be reasonable approaches to help address past contractor performance problems. Approaches adopted since 1996 to improve the ship scrapping practices include the following:", "Developing a two-step bid process requiring contractors to submit a technical proposal for approval before they can be considered viable candidates to place a financial bid for the surplus ships. The technical proposals are to consist of an environmental compliance plan, an operations plan, a business plan, and a safety and health plan. A technical evaluation team is to evaluate each plan, and those contractors found to have acceptable technical proposals will be asked to submit a financial bid. Implementing quarterly progress reviews at each scrapping site to assess the contractor\u2019s progress and compliance with contract provisions, including environmental and safety requirements.", "Awarding contracts designed to (1) provide daily on-site surveillance of ship scrappers, (2) conduct environmental/safety site assessments, and (3) evaluate ship scrapping operations.", "Developing a contractor rating system for use in deciding on how closely to provide contract surveillance.", "Actions taken to improve the general management of the ship scrapping program and to address contractor concerns about the profitability of ship scrapping included advertising and selling ships by lot and allowing contractors to remove the ships from government storage as they are ready to be scrapped, holding periodic industry workshops to inform contractors of what is expected of them in the scrapping of federal surplus ships and obtain feedback from the contractors on their concerns and desires, evaluating the potential for removing more of the hazardous materials before the ships are advertised for sale, and notifying state and local regulators where the ship scrapping will be performed after contracts are awarded.", "The Navy and DRMS have also adopted, and are considering, other options for disposing of ships. For example, they obtained legislative authority to negotiate contracts for ship scrapping to obtain the most advantageous contract for the government rather than awarding the contract based solely on the highest bid.", "MARAD also developed and adopted a number of new approaches similar to those of the Navy/DRMS. For example, MARAD has begun using contracting procedures that include the requirement for a technical proposal from bidders on how they would scrap ships.

This panel was tasked to review Navy and MARAD programs to scrap ships and to recommend ways to ensure that federal ships are scrapped in the most effective and efficient manner while protecting the environment and worker safety. While the 1996 initiatives and 1998 interagency panel recommendations, if implemented, offer the potential to address previously experienced problems, some domestic and foreign scrapping issues remain unresolved. They relate to whether the government should promote the expansion of the domestic industry and whether ships should be scrapped overseas. The actions most often discussed for addressing these issues have much different potential results. For example, federal agencies could generate higher revenues by scrapping ships overseas, but such scrapping may involve greater environmental and worker safety risks as well as adversely affect the domestic scrapping industry. Similarly, relying solely on the domestic industry for ship scrapping would avoid overseas scrapping concerns but would require a more prolonged approach to reducing the backlog or greater financial incentives to achieve domestic industry expansion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Panel Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["The panel made numerous recommendations to the various agencies participating in the panel on issues related to both domestic and overseas ship scrapping.

The agencies to whom the recommendations are made are responsible for deciding what actions, if any, to take. As of August 6, 1998, the agencies were still reviewing the extent to which they will implement the panel\u2019s recommendations. Further, the process for deciding whether to accept and ultimately implement the recommendations is informal.

Also, once the recommendation review process is complete, lead responsibilities, tracking systems, and milestones for implementing the individual recommendations will be needed.", "The panel\u2019s April 20, 1998, report concluded that the Navy and MARAD had recognized the problems identified with past contracting and monitoring practices and taken steps to address many of them. The report also stated that more could be done to (1) improve the ship scrapping contracting process, (2) encourage the development of a viable domestic industry to handle a significant portion of the backlog, and (3) make the use of foreign scrapping to augment the domestic industry a more acceptable option. More specifically, the panel recommended that the Navy/DRMS and MARAD establish consistent ship scrapping contracting procedures. For example, the Navy/DRMS and MARAD should develop standardized performance bonds to make them equally attractive to bidders.", "To encourage development of the domestic industry, the panel concluded that the industry needed to improve its knowledge and understanding of the ship scrapping contracting process. To accomplish this, the panel recommended that EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in coordination with the Navy/DRMS and MARAD, continue to educate the industry through seminars and workshops and should develop an environmental and worker safety compliance manual for industry use. The panel asserted that the industry needed additional knowledge on the techniques for scrapping large ships and the range, types, and locations of hazardous materials to ensure that ships are scrapped in an environmental, safe, and economical manner. To accomplish this, the panel endorsed the Navy\u2019s plan to establish a pilot project that would quantify the scope and major costs associated with ship scrapping.", "The panel indicated that the U.S. government could do more to promote better environmental and worker safety controls in foreign ship scrapping countries. To that end, the panel recommended, among other things, that (1) the Navy, MARAD, and EPA expand the notification to foreign countries of the materials commonly found on specific types of ships so that the countries could object to the import of a ship with unacceptable environmental risks and (2) the Navy, MARAD, EPA, the Departments of State and Labor, and the Agency for International Development evaluate how meaningful technical assistance could be provided to interested importing countries, including whether current statutory authorities and funding are adequate for this purpose. Another recommendation was for DRMS and MARAD to examine the use of enforceable contract terms that promote environmental protection and worker safety measures overseas, including requirements that foreign bidders submit technical plans to demonstrate how they intend to comply with applicable local rules and regulations, obtain information from the State Department on the qualifications and past performance of foreign scrappers, and require a performance bond as an incentive for foreign scrappers to comply with contractual requirements. The panel recognized, however, that environmental and worker safety issues would have to be balanced against the economic realities of the countries doing the scrapping.", "The panel also recommended to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology that it or a similar panel be reconvened 1 year after the report\u2019s issuance to evaluate the results of implementing the recommendations and to consider whether any additional modifications should be made."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The interagency panel\u2019s specific recommendations generally represent steps directed toward correcting previously experienced problems.
