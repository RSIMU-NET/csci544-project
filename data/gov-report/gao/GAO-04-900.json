Under this Plan, the two services will perform their missions using fewer units of more capable aircraft and reducing total program aircraft procurement costs by $28 billion over the next 18 years. Operationally, the Navy and Marine Corps will increase the extent to which their tactical aviation units are used as a combined force to accomplish both services' missions. The Plan also reduces the services' tactical aviation force structure by decommissioning five squadrons, thus decreasing the number of Navy and Marine Corps squadrons to 59, and reduces the total number of aircraft they plan to buy from 1,637 to 1,140. The Department of the Navy based its conclusion that it could meet the Navy and Marine Corps' operational requirements with a smaller force primarily on the findings of a contractor study that evaluated the relative capability of different tactical aviation force structures. GAO's review of the contractor's methodology and assumptions about force structure, budget resources, and management efficiencies suggests that much of the analysis appears reasonable. However, GAO noted some limitations--including the lack of analytical support for reducing the number of backup aircraft--increase the risk that the smaller force will be less effective than expected. The Navy and Marine Corps each followed a different process in selecting a reserve squadron to decommission. The Marine Corps made a clear and well-documented analysis of the operational, fiscal, logistical, and personnel impacts of different options that appears to provide decision makers with a reasonable basis for selecting the Reserve unit to decommission. By contrast, the Navy selected its reserve squadron without clear criteria or a documented, comprehensive analysis, and thus with less transparency in its process. Two other factors that might affect successful implementation of the Plan are the potential unavailability of readiness funding and delays in fielding the new force. Although the contractor recommended that the Navy identify future readiness-funding requirements, to date, the Navy has not conducted this analysis. In addition, the Department of the Navy is experiencing engineering and weight problems in developing the Joint Strike Fighter that will cause it to be delayed until 2013, at least 1 year later than had been projected, and other high risks to the program remain. Because these delays will cause the Navy to operate legacy aircraft longer than expected, they might also increase operations and maintenance costs, making an analysis of future readiness funding requirements even more important."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Navy formerly planned to spend almost $92 billion  by fiscal year 2021 to replace legacy F/A-18C/D, F-14, and AV-8 aircraft  with newer F/A-18E/Fs and the future Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.  Concerned that it could not afford to purchase as many of these aircraft as  originally planned, however, in fiscal year 2002 the Department of the  Navy announced a new Tactical Aviation Integration Plan, whereby the  Navy and Marine Corps concluded that they would be able to achieve their  missions with fewer aircraft and units by operating as a combined force.", "Out of concern about how the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 future plans for  their tactical aviation forces would affect mission capability, Congress  mandated that GAO examine the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 Tactical Aviation  Integration Plan. In the Fiscal Year 2004 Defense Appropriations Act,  Congress directed GAO to assess Navy and Marine Corps requirements for  tactical aviation and the role of Navy and Marine Corps Reserve assets in  meeting such requirements. In addition, the Senate Report for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 directed GAO to  analyze the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 Plan to determine the validity of the  assumptions made in formulating the Plan, the expected impact of the  Plan on Navy and Marine Corps force structure, and the ability of the  smaller force structure to meet operational requirements.

How would Navy and Marine Corps operational concepts, force  structure, and procurement costs change under the Plan?  2.  What methodology and assumptions did the Navy and Marine Corps  use to analyze the potential for integrating tactical aviation assets, and  what, if any, limitations affect the services\u2019 analysis?  3.  To what extent did the Navy and Marine Corps use a thorough and  well-documented process to assess which reserve squadrons should be  decommissioned in fiscal year 2004 to implement the Plan?  4.  What other factors might affect the implementation of the Plan?", "To accomplish these objectives, we analyzed the contractor study that  supports the Plan by reviewing its methodology, major assumptions, and  modeling input and approach. We also obtained information from officials  at Navy and Marine Corps Headquarters, Navy and Marine Corps Reserve  Headquarters, Joint Forces Command, Atlantic and Pacific Naval Air  Forces Headquarters, and Marine Forces Atlantic Headquarters in order to  verify and assess both the information contained in the study and the  resulting decisions about force structure, procurement plans, and  operational impacts. We assessed the reliability of the services\u2019 data by  reviewing the methodology and pertinent contractor and service  information used for the study and the Plan.

Specifically, Navy officials were  concerned that the projected procurement budget would not be sufficient  to buy as many F/A-18E/Fs and Joint Strike Fighter aircraft as originally  planned. The difference between the funding needed to support the Navy\u2019s  original plan for procuring tactical aircraft and the Navy\u2019s projected  procurement budget is shown in figure 1.", "Figure 1 shows that, starting in fiscal year 2005, the Navy\u2019s typical aviation  allocation of $3,200 million per year would not be sufficient to support the  previous procurement plan for F/A-18E/F and Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.", "In December 2001, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of  the Marine Corps jointly commissioned a contractor to study the feasibility  of integrating Naval tactical aviation.

In 2003 the Marine Corps began to  provide the Navy with the first of six additional dedicated squadrons to  augment four squadrons already integrated into carrier air wings during  the 1990s. As a result, each of the Navy\u2019s 10 active carrier air wings would  ultimately include one Marine Corps squadron by 2012. Concurrently, the  Navy would integrate three dedicated squadrons into Marine Aircraft  Wings by 2008, primarily to support the Marine Corps Unit Deployment  Program rotations to Japan. The first Navy squadron to deploy in support  of Marine Corps operations would occur in late fiscal year 2004, with other  squadrons to follow in fiscal years 2007 and 2008.", "As part of the new operating concept, the Department of the Navy would  satisfy both Navy and Marine Corps missions using either Navy or Marine  Corps squadrons. Traditionally, the primary mission of Navy tactical  aviation has been to provide long-range striking power from a carrier,  while Marine Corps tactical aviation provided air support for ground  forces. Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation squadrons will retain their  primary mission responsibilities, but units that integrate would  additionally be responsible to train as well as perform required mission  responsibilities of the other service. For example, if a Navy squadron were  assigned to the Marine Corps Unit Deployment Program, its pilots would  receive more emphasis on training for close air support missions, and,  similarly, Marine Corps pilots would place more emphasis on long-range  strike missions before deploying with a carrier air wing. Moreover, Navy  and Marine Corps officers would exchange Command positions to further  develop a more unified culture. For instance, a Marine Corps colonel  would command a carrier air wing, while a Navy captain would command  a Marine Corps Aircraft Group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Expected to Reduce Total Number of Squadrons, Aircraft per Squadron, and Backup Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["As indicated in table 1, the Department of the Navy would create a smaller  tactical aviation force structure consisting of fewer squadrons, reduced  numbers of aircraft per squadron, and fewer backup aircraft. The number  of tactical aviation squadrons would decrease from 68 under the previous  plan to 59 by 2012. To achieve this reduction of nine squadrons, the  department would    cancel plans to reestablish four active Navy squadrons as anticipated  under its prior procurement plan,    decommission one Marine Corps Reserve squadron as well as one Navy  Reserve squadron in 2004, and    decommission three active Navy squadrons. The first active squadron is  scheduled to be decommissioned in fiscal year 2006; two other  squadrons are to be decommissioned from fiscal year 2010 through  fiscal year 2012.", "Under the Plan, the number of aircraft assigned to some tactical aviation  squadrons would be reduced. All Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18C  squadrons that transition to the future Joint Strike Fighter aircraft would  be reduced from 12 to 10 aircraft. In addition, Navy F/A-18F squadrons will  be reduced from 14 to 12 aircraft. Furthermore, by 2006, aircraft assigned  to the remaining two Navy and three Marine Corps Reserve squadrons  would be reduced from 12 to 10. By reducing the aircraft assigned to  squadrons, the size of Navy air wings will transition from 46 to 44 aircraft  in 2004, as the Navy procures new aircraft. A notional air wing in the  Navy\u2019s current force is made up of 46 aircraft comprising a combination of  F/A-18C and F-14 squadrons.

Backup aircraft consist of those  aircraft that are not primarily assigned to active or reserve squadrons.  Specifically, backup aircraft are necessary to meet a variety of needs  such as  training new pilots;  replacing aircraft that are either awaiting or undergoing depot-level  repair;    meeting research, development, and test and evaluation needs;    attrition during peacetime or wartime operations; and    meeting miscellaneous requirements, such as adversary training and  the Blue Angels demonstration team."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Expected to Reduce Procurement of Tactical Fighters and Save Procurement Costs", "paragraphs": ["In implementing the Plan, the Department of the Navy expects to reduce  the number of tactical aviation aircraft it will purchase by 497\u2014from 1,637  to 1,140.

It has been previously used by the  Joint Strike Fighter Program Office to assess the effectiveness of a joint  strike force in terms of phases of a warfight; geographical location of  combat forces; the characteristics of targets, such as type and hardness;  and whether targets are mobile. During the forward presence phase of the  contractor\u2019s modeling scenario, one carrier battle group and one  amphibious readiness group were deployed, and aircraft operated at a  maximum distance of 400 nautical miles from the carrier. In the buildup  phase, three carrier battle groups and three amphibious groups were  deployed in one theater, and aircraft operated at a maximum distance of  150 nautical miles. During the mature phase, eight carrier battle groups,  eight amphibious readiness groups, and 75 percent of all other assets were  deployed to land-based sites, and aircraft operated at a maximum distance  of 150 nautical miles from the carrier.", "To measure combat effectiveness levels, the contractor methodically  compared the estimated capabilities of the current force, the previously  planned force, and the recommended force to hit targets and perform  close air support. To determine the relative capabilities of each aircraft  comprising these forces, the contractor convened a panel of experts who  were familiar with planned capability and used official aircraft  performance data to score the offensive and defensive capabilities of  different aircraft across a range of missions performed during the three  stages of the warfight. As indicated in figure 2, the experts determined that  the Joint Strike Fighter, which is still in development, will be the most  capable aircraft and assigned it a baseline score of 1 compared with the  other aircraft.", "Figure 2 also shows that based on the capability scores assigned other  aircraft, the Joint Strike Fighter is expected to be approximately nine  times more capable than the AV-8B Harrier aircraft, about five times more  capable than the F-14D and F/A-18 A+/C/D aircraft, three times more  capable than the first version of the F/A-18 E/F aircraft, and 50 percent  more capable than the second version of the F/A-18E/F.

Furthermore, the new smaller force was  just as effective in most instances as the previously planned force because  the smaller force had enough aircraft to fully populate aircraft carrier  flight decks and therefore did not cause a reduction in the number of  targets that could be hit. However, the analysis showed that beginning in  2015, there would be a 10 percent reduction in effectiveness in close air  support during the mature phase of a warfight because fewer squadrons  and aircraft would be available to deploy to land bases.

The 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review  validated this naval force structure and judged that this force structure  presented moderate operational risk in implementing the defense strategy.  Second, it assumed that the Navy and Marine Corps\u2019 tactical aviation  procurement budget would continue to be about $3.2 billion in fiscal year  2002 dollars annually through 2020.

However, the Marine Corps plans to operate only the Short Takeoff and  Vertical Landing version of the aircraft, which is projected to be  significantly less capable than the carrier version in terms of range and  payload (number of weapons it can carry). The Marine Corps believes this  version is needed to satisfy its requirement to operate from austere land  bases or amphibious ships in order to quickly support ground forces when  needed.

By contrast,  during Operation Iraqi Freedom, many of the targets struck from carriers  would have been outside the range of the Short Takeoff and Vertical  Landing version of the aircraft unless in-flight refueling was performed,  thereby reducing its effectiveness. The study noted that because of the  differences in performance, substitution of the Short Takeoff and Vertical  Landing version for the carrier version would result in decreased  effectiveness when the Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing version\u2019s  performance parameters are exceeded. However, the study did not  conduct additional analyses to quantify the impact of using Short Takeoff  and Vertical Landing aircraft aboard carriers. Therefore, if the Plan is  implemented whereby the Marine Corps operates the Short Takeoff and  Vertical Landing version of the aircraft exclusively as one of four tactical  aviation squadrons aboard each carrier, under a different scenario  featuring a greater range to targets, the overall effectiveness of the tactical  fighter group could be less than what the contractor\u2019s study predicted.

According to the  contractor, it recommended the reduction based on limited analysis of the  potential to reduce the number of attrition and maintenance pipeline  aircraft.

So far, the Navy has not conducted this  analysis, nor has it addressed how it will ensure that the readiness  accounts will be fully funded because Navy officials noted that they  consider future budget estimates to be adequate. However, a recent  Congressional Research Service evaluation of the Plan noted that  operations and maintenance costs have been growing in recent years for  old aircraft and that new aircraft have sometimes, if not often, proved  more expensive to maintain than planned. Furthermore, our analysis of  budget data for fiscal years 2001-3 indicates that the Department of the  Navy\u2019s operations and maintenance costs averaged about $388 million  more than what was requested for tactical aviation and other flight  operations.

As a  result of engineering and weight problems in the development of the Joint  Strike Fighter, there will be at least a 1-year delay in when the Navy and  Marine Corps had expected to begin receiving the Joint Strike Fighter  aircraft. As noted in the Department of the Navy\u2019s most recent acquisition  reports to Congress, the Navy has delayed the Short Takeoff and Vertical  Landing version from 2010 to 2012 and the Navy\u2019s carrier version from  2012 to 2013. Furthermore, in March 2004 we reported that numerous  program risks and possible schedule variances could cause additional  delays.", "Recent Joint Strike Fighter program cost increases could also delay the  fielding of the aircraft. In DOD\u2019s December 31, 2003, procurement plan, the  average unit cost of the aircraft increased from $69 million to $82 million.  Assuming that the Department of the Navy procures the 680 Joint Strike  Fighter aircraft as proposed under the Plan, the total procurement cost  will be approximately $9 billion higher. This increase in cost, when  considered within the limits of the expected $3.2 billion annual  procurement budget, will likely prevent the Department of the Navy from  fielding the smaller but more effective tactical aviation force as early as  expected. Additionally, these delays will oblige the Department of the  Navy to operate legacy aircraft longer than expected, which could result in  increased operations and maintenance costs. A potential increase in  operations and maintenance costs makes it even more important for the  Department of the Navy to conduct an analysis to determine its future  readiness funding requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The contractor\u2019s study results provided the Department of the Navy with a  reasonable basis for concluding that it could afford to buy a smaller but  more capable force that would meet its future operating requirements by  using fewer Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation squadrons of more  capable aircraft as a combined force and achieving efficiencies that allow  it to reduce the number of backup aircraft needed. However, there are  known management and funding risks to realizing the new smaller forces\u2019  affordability and effectiveness. Until Navy management assesses the  likelihood of future lower attrition rates and aircraft maintenance, test and  evaluation, and training requirements, the Navy runs the risk that the  number of backup aircraft it plans to procure will not be adequate to  support the smaller tactical aviation force and add concern to the Plan\u2019s  affordability. Furthermore, in the absence of clear DOD guidance citing  consistent criteria and documentation requirements for supporting  decisions that affect units, such as which Navy and Marine Corps Reserve  squadrons to decommission, we remain concerned about the transparency  of the process for reducing the force to those with oversight responsibility.  The inconsistency in the Marine Corps\u2019 and Navy\u2019s approaches and  supporting documentation confirms the value of such guidance to ensure  clear consideration of the best alternative. Finally, until the Department of  the Navy knows the readiness funding requirements for operating the new  smaller force, it cannot be certain that it can maintain the readiness levels  required to meet operational demands. Such an assessment of these  requirements would provide a sound basis for seeking proper funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the potential that the future Navy and Marine Corps integrated  tactical aviation force will meet the mission needs of both services and  ensure more transparency when making future decommissioning  decisions, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  three actions:    direct the Secretary of the Navy to thoroughly assess all of the factors  that provide the basis for the number of backup aircraft needed to  support a smaller tactical aviation force under the plan to integrate  Navy and Marine Corps tactical aviation forces,    develop guidance that (1) identifies the criteria and methodology for  analyzing future decisions about which units to decommission and  (2) establishes requirements for documenting the process used and  analysis conducted, and    direct the Secretary of the Navy to analyze future readiness funding  requirements to support the tactical aviation integration plan and  include required funding in future budget requests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Director, Defense  Systems, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, stated that the  department generally agreed with our recommendations and cited actions  that it is taking.

However, we were  not able to evaluate the Navy\u2019s study because Navy officials have since  told us that it will not be completed until late September or early October  2004.", "With regard to our second recommendation to develop guidance that  would identify criteria and a methodology for analyzing future  decommissioning decisions and require documenting the process, DOD  stated that it would change Directive 5410.10, which covers the  notification of inactivation or decommission of forces, and require it to  contain the criteria and methodology used to make the force structure  decision. While we agree that the new guidance, if followed, would  disclose these aspects of the decision-making process, it does not appear  sufficient to meet the need we identified for consistency and  documentation to support force structure decisions. Therefore, we believe  that DOD should take additional steps to meet the intent of our  recommendation by developing consistent criteria and requiring  documentation to ensure transparency for those providing oversight of  such decisions in the future.", "In partially concurring with our third recommendation related to future  readiness funding requirements, the Department of Defense stated that the  Department of the Navy is currently developing analytical metrics that  would provide a better understanding of how to fund readiness accounts  to achieve a target readiness level.
