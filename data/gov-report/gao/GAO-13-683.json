Specifically, DHS reviewed such records to identify national security and public safety threats, but unmatched arrival records--those without corresponding departure records--remain in DHS's system. GAO had previously reported that, as of January 2011, DHS had a backlog of 1.6 million unmatched arrival records that had not been reviewed through automated or manual processes. DHS tracks arrivals and departures and closes records for individuals with matching arrival and departure records. Unmatched arrival records indicate that the individual is a potential overstay. In 2011, DHS reviewed this backlog of 1.6 million records, closed about 863,000 records, and removed them from the backlog. As new unmatched arrival records have accrued, DHS has continued to review all of these new records for national security and public safety concerns. As of June 2013, DHS's unmatched arrival records totaled more than 1 million.", "DHS has actions completed and under way to improve data on potential overstays and report overstay rates, but the effect of these improvements is not yet known. Further, DHS continues to face challenges in reporting reliable overstay rates. DHS has streamlined connections among databases used to identify potential overstays. However, these improvements do not address some underlying data quality issues, such as missing land departure data. Federal law requires DHS to report overstay estimates, but DHS or its predecessor has not regularly done so since 1994. In April 2011, GAO reported that DHS officials said that they have not reported overstay rates because DHS has not had sufficient confidence in the quality of its overstay data. In February 2013, the Secretary of Homeland Security testified that DHS plans to report overstay rates by December 2013. However, DHS has not assessed or documented improvements in the reliability of data used to develop overstay estimates, in accordance with federal internal control standards. Without such a documented assessment to ensure the reliability of these data, decision makers would not have the information needed to use these data for policy-making purposes.", "Developing and implementing a biometric exit capability to collect biometric data, such as fingerprints, which is required by federal law, has been a long-standing challenge for DHS. In May 2012, DHS internally reported recommendations to support the planning for a biometric exit capability at airports--DHS's priority for biometric exit capabilities--that could also be implemented at seaports in the future; however, as of June 2013, DHS's planning did not address a biometric exit capability at land ports of entry. DHS officials stated that the department's goal is to develop information and report to Congress about the benefits and costs of biometric air exit options before the fiscal year 2016 budget cycle. Standard practices for project management state that time frames should be documented as part of the planning process; however, DHS has a high-level plan for a biometric air exit capability, and it does not clearly define the steps, time frames, and milestones needed to develop and implement an evaluation framework, as recommended in DHS's May 2012 report.

In April 2011, we found that DHS\u2019s efforts to identify  and report on overstays were hindered by unreliable data, and we  identified various challenges to DHS\u2019s efforts to identify potential  overstays, including the incomplete collection of departure data from  nonimmigrants at ports of entry, particularly land ports of entry, and the  lack of mechanisms for assessing the quality of leads sent to HSI field  offices for investigation. Since that time, DHS has taken action to  strengthen its processes for reviewing records to identify potential  overstays, including (1) streamlining connections among DHS databases  used to identify potential overstays and (2) collecting information from the  Canadian government about those exiting the United States and entering  Canada through northern land ports of entry.", "First, DHS has taken steps to improve connections among its component  agencies\u2019 databases used to identify potential overstays and reduce the  need for manual exchanges of data. For example:  In August 2012, DHS enhanced data sharing between ADIS and a  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services database, the Computer- Linked Application Information Management System 3 (CLAIMS), to  enable automatic transfers of immigration status or benefits  information from CLAIMS to ADIS. For example, this enhancement  has enabled CLAIMS to automatically provide data to ADIS when an  individual files a work authorization application form with U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services, and CLAIMS also provides data  to ADIS daily on whether an application is pending, approved, or  denied.  In August 2012, DHS enhanced data sharing between ADIS and  IDENT. This improved connection provides additional data to ADIS to  improve the matching process based on fingerprint identification. For  example, when an individual provides a fingerprint as part of an  application for immigration benefits from U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services or a visa from the State Department, or when  apprehended by law enforcement, IDENT now sends identity  information, including a fingerprint identification number, for that  individual to ADIS. This additional source of data is intended to help  allow ADIS to more effectively match the individual\u2019s entry record with  a change of status, thereby closing out more unmatched arrival  records.", "Beginning in April 2013, ICE\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor  Information System (SEVIS) began automatically sending data to  ADIS on a daily basis, allowing ADIS to review SEVIS records against  departure records and determine whether student visa holders who  have ended their course of study departed in accordance with the  terms of their stay. Prior to this date, DHS manually transferred data  from SEVIS to ADIS on a weekly basis. According to DHS officials,  these exchanges were unreliable because they did not consistently  include all SEVIS data\u2014particularly data on \u201cno show\u201d students who  failed to begin their approved course of study within 30 days of being  admitted into the United States.", "Also in April 2013, DHS automated the exchange of records of  potential overstays between ADIS and CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting  System (ATS), a CBP system used to improve the collection, use,  analysis, and dissemination of information on terrorism and other  violations of United States laws. This exchange is intended to allow  DHS to more efficiently (1) transfer data between the systems for the  purpose of identifying national security and public safety concerns,  and (2) use matching algorithms in ATS that differ from those in ADIS  to close additional records for individuals who departed.", "Second, DHS is implementing the Beyond the Border initiative to collect  additional data to strengthen the identification of potential overstays. In  October 2012, DHS and the Canada Border Services Agency began  exchanging entry data on travelers crossing the border at selected land  ports of entry. Because an entry into Canada constitutes a departure from  the United States, DHS will be able to use Canadian entry data as proxies  for U.S. departure records. We found in April 2011 that DHS faced  challenges in its ability to identify overstays because of unreliable  collection of departure data at land ports of entry. The Beyond the  Border Initiative would help address those challenges by providing a new  source of data on travelers departing the United States at land ports on  the northern border. In the pilot phase, DHS exchanged data with the  Canada Border Services Agency on third-country nationals at four of the  five largest ports of entry on the northern border.entries from September 30, 2012, through January 15, 2013. DHS\u2019s  analysis of the 413,222 records received through the pilot showed that  DHS was able to match 97.4 percent of Canadian entry records to a U.S.  entry record in ADIS. DHS was able to use Canadian entry records to  verify the departure of approximately 11,400 subjects prior to the end of  their authorized period of admission who would otherwise have been  thought to be potential overstays. DHS determined that roughly 4,300  subjects with indeterminate status (meaning that DHS lacked exit records  for those individuals) had left the United States after their authorized  period of admission, meaning that they had overstayed while in the  United States and are now considered out-of-country overstays.", "DHS plans to expand this effort to collect data from additional ports of  entry and to share data on additional types of travelers. Specifically,  according to DHS officials, as of June 30, 2013, DHS began exchanging  data for third-country nationals at all automated ports of entry along the  northern border. During this phase of the initiative, in accordance with  the agreement between the United States and Canada, DHS also plans  to begin using these data for operational purposes (e.g., taking  enforcement action against overstays, such as working with the State  Department to have their visas revoked or imposing bars on readmission  to the country based on the length of time they remained in the country  unlawfully).travelers, including U.S. and Canadian citizens, at all automated ports of  entry along the northern border.

Mexican entry procedures differ from those in Canada. For example,  according to DHS officials, at some border crossings, Mexican officials  may not collect entry data until travelers reach a station located miles  past the border. Therefore, Mexican border authorities may not collect  information on every traveler entering Mexico. In addition, according to  DHS officials, Mexican information technology systems may be less  compatible with U.S. systems than are the Canadian systems. DHS is  conducting informal outreach to the Mexican government regarding the  potential to share entry data in the future, but according to DHS officials,  such a program would be years away."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Continues to Face Limitations in Reporting Reliable Overstay Rates and Has Not Assessed and Documented Improvements in Reliability", "paragraphs": ["Since 1994, neither DHS nor its predecessor has regularly reported  annual overstay rates to Congress because of concerns about the  reliability of the department\u2019s overstay data. According to statute, DHS is  to submit an annual report to Congress providing numerical estimates of  the number of aliens from each country in each nonimmigrant  classification who overstayed an authorized period of admission that  expired during the fiscal year prior to the year for which the report is  made. Overstay rates are among the statutory criteria that determine a  participant\u2019s termination from the Visa Waiver Program. Therefore, we  have previously concluded that reliable and valid estimates of the number  of overstays are important to manage the program. In April 2011, we  reported that DHS officials stated that the department had not reported  overstay estimates because it had not had sufficient confidence in the  quality of its overstay data. DHS officials stated at the time that, as a  result, the department could not reliably report overstay estimates in  accordance with the statute.", "See testimony of Janet Napolitano, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, before  the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, Washington, D.C.: February 13,  2013.", "2012 and the first half of fiscal year 2013 for all travelers and classes of  admission at all air, land and sea ports of entry. DHS has also calculated  overstay rates by country for these time periods by determining the  number of overstays (in-country plus out-of-country) divided by the total  number of confirmed nonimmigrants arrivals (who were expected to  depart during the identified period). However, the department is still in the  process of determining what methodology it will use to generate the data  it plans to report by the end of the year. In addition, DHS officials stated  that the department has not yet determined whether to report data from  fiscal year 2012 or fiscal year 2013, and whether to report certain  overstay data publicly.", "Moreover, DHS continues to face challenges in ensuring the reliability of  its overstay data. In September 2008, we reported on limitations in  overstay data that affect the reliability of overstay rates, such as  weaknesses in departure data. We recommended that the Secretary of  Homeland Security explore cost-effective actions necessary to further  improve, validate, and test the reliability of overstay data. DHS  concurred with this recommendation and has explored actions to improve  overstay data, as discussed above, but has not yet validated or tested  their reliability. According to DHS Office of Policy officials, the department  is better positioned than in the past to describe the limitations in the  overstay data. However, challenges to reporting reliable overstay  estimates remain. Although DHS has improved connections among its  various databases used to help identify potential overstays, these  improvements do not address some of the underlying data quality and  reliability issues we previously identified. For example, in April 2011, we  found that DHS faced challenges in collecting accurate and complete  information from nonimmigrants departing the United States through land  ports of entry. The Beyond the Border initiative is intended to help  address this issue by collecting proxy data on individuals exiting from the  United States at northern border ports of entry; however, DHS has not yet  identified mechanisms for collecting data on individuals exiting through  southern border ports of entry.", "Further, inaccuracies in passenger data provided by air carriers may lead  to incorrect records of potential overstays if passengers\u2019 departures are  not accurately recorded. For example, according to CBP officials, CBP  learned in early 2011 that some carriers were inadvertently transmitting  passenger data without properly recording the passengers\u2019 departure  after DHS noticed an increase in the number of potential overstays.  According to these officials, the issue was resolved in April 2011, but  because of the errors in the data, an unknown number of those  passengers were incorrectly identified as potential overstays. Moreover,  DHS Office of Policy and ICE officials stated that, prior to the April 2013  improvements between ADIS and SEVIS, ADIS was receiving limited  information on foreign students; therefore, the overstay estimates prior to  April 2013 do not fully account for the extent to which foreign students in  the United States were in legal status in the country. These limitations in  overstay data may affect DHS\u2019s ability to report reliable overstay  estimates unless resolved. Estimates of in-country overstays are based  on ADIS\u2019s identification of unmatched arrival records for individuals who  were expected to depart during a given year. As discussed earlier in this  report, DHS does not manually review all unmatched arrival records in  ADIS because many do not meet ICE\u2019s enforcement priorities. Therefore,  the reliability of data in ADIS may affect the accuracy of year-end  overstay statistics.", "DHS has documented the results of receiving new departure data in the  pilot phase of the Beyond the Border initiative to demonstrate how DHS  may be able to close out more records of potential overstays in the future.  However, DHS has not assessed and documented how its changes to  database connections have improved the reliability of its data for the  purposes of reporting overstay rate calculations and has not analyzed the  incremental improvements that database changes have made in data  quality. According to DHS Office of Policy and ICE officials, DHS has not  conducted such an analysis because it is difficult to pull such data from  ADIS. DHS has not maintained a separate, mirrored system of ADIS and  must therefore pull data directly from the live ADIS system\u2014a resource- intensive process that can take several months. However, there may be  other cost-effective ways to assess data improvements, such as  conducting quantitative analyses of the number of records closed as a  result of the improvements in connections among databases.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  program managers need operational data to determine whether they are  meeting their goals for accountability for effective and efficient use of  resources.

In 2004, the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act required DHS to  develop a plan to accelerate full implementation of an automated  biometric entry and exit system at air, sea, and land ports of entry.  However, development and implementation of a biometric exit capability  has been a long-standing challenge for DHS. With regard to an exit  capability at airports, in an October 2010 memo, DHS identified three  primary reasons why it has been unable to determine how and when to  implement a biometric solution: (1) the methods of collecting biometric  data could disrupt the flow of travelers through air terminals; (2) air  carriers and airport authorities had not allowed DHS to examine  mechanisms through which DHS could incorporate biometric data  collection into passenger processing at the departure gate; and (3)  challenges existed in capturing biometric data at the point of departure,  including determining what personnel should be responsible for the  capture of biometric information at airports. With regard to an exit  capability at land ports of entry, in 2006, we reported that according to  DHS officials, for various reasons, a biometric exit capability could not be  implemented without incurring a major impact on land facilities. As a  result, as of April 2013, according to DHS officials, the department\u2019s  planning efforts focus on developing a biometric exit capability for  airports, with the potential for a similar solution to be implemented at  seaports, and DHS\u2019s planning documents, as of June 2013, do not  address plans for a biometric exit capability at land ports of entry.", "According to DHS officials, the challenges DHS identified in October 2010  continue to affect the department\u2019s ability to implement a biometric air exit  system. For example, in 2009, DHS conducted pilot programs for  biometric air exit capabilities in airport scenarios. In August 2010, we  found that there were limitations with the pilot programs\u2014for example, the  pilot programs did not operationally test about 30 percent of the air exit  requirements identified in the evaluation plan for the pilot programs\u2014that  hindered DHS\u2019s ability to inform decision making for a long-term air exit  solution and pointed to the need for additional sources of information on  air exit\u2019s operational impacts. According to DHS officials, the  department\u2019s approach to planning for biometric air exit since that time  has been partly in response to our recommendation that DHS identify  additional sources for the operational impacts of air exit not addressed in  the pilot programs\u2019 evaluation and to incorporate these sources into its air  exit decision making and planning.

However, DHS officials stated that  there may be challenges to leveraging new technologies to the extent that  U.S. airports and airlines rely on older, proprietary systems that may be  difficult to update to incorporate new technologies. Furthermore, DHS  reported in May 2012 that significant questions remained regarding (1)  the effectiveness of current biographic air exit processes and the error  rates in collecting or matching data, (2) methods of cost-effectively  integrating biometrics into the air departure processes (e.g., collecting  biometric scans as passengers enter the jetway to board a plane), (3) the  additional value biometric air exit would provide compared with the  current biographic air exit process, and (4) the overall value and cost of a  biometric air exit capability. The report included nine recommendations to  help inform DHS\u2019s planning for biometric air exit, such as directing DHS to  develop explicit goals and objectives for biometric air exit and an  evaluation framework that would, among other things, assess the value of  collecting biometric data in addition to biographic data and determine  whether biometric air exit is economically justified.", "DHS reported in May 2012 that it planned to take steps to address these  recommendations by May 2014; however, according to DHS Office of  Policy and S&T officials, the department does not expect to fully address  these recommendations by then. In particular, DHS officials stated that it  has been difficult coordinating with airlines and airports, which have  expressed reluctance about biometric air exit because of concerns over  its effect on operations and potential costs. To address these concerns,  DHS is conducting outreach and soliciting information from airlines and  airports regarding their operations. In addition, DHS officials stated that  the department\u2019s efforts to date have been hindered by insufficient  funding. However, in fiscal year 2012, DHS requested that Congress  release funds allocated to the biometric exit program and funds being  withheld pending the full implementation of a biometric exit system so that  these funds could be applied to DHS\u2019s efforts to enhance the biographic  exit system. In its fiscal year 2014 budget request for S&T, DHS  requested funding for a joint S&T-CBP Air Entry/Exit Re-Engineering  Apex project. Apex projects are crosscutting, multidisciplinary efforts  requested by DHS components that are high-priority projects intended to  solve problems of strategic operational importance. According to DHS\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 budget justification, the Air Entry/Exit Re-Engineering  Apex project will develop tools to model and simulate air entry and exit  operational processes. Using these tools, DHS intends to develop, test,  pilot, and evaluate candidate solutions.

However, DHS has not yet  developed an evaluation framework, as recommended in its May 2012  report, to determine how the department will evaluate the benefits and  costs of a biometric air exit system and compare it with a biographic exit  system. According to DHS officials, the department needs to finalize  goals and objectives for biometric air exit before it can develop such a  framework, and in April 2013 these officials told us that the department  plans to finalize these elements in the near future. However, DHS does  not have time frames for when it will subsequently be able to develop and  implement an evaluation framework to support the assessment it plans to  provide to Congress.", "According to A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge,  which provides standards for project managers, specific goals and  objectives should be conceptualized, defined, and documented in the  planning process, along with the appropriate steps, time frames, and  milestones needed to achieve those results. In fall 2012, DHS  developed a high-level plan for its biometric air exit efforts, which it  updated in May 2013, but this plan does not clearly identify the tasks  needed to develop and implement an evaluation framework. For example,  the plan does not include a step for developing the methodology for  comparing the costs and benefits of biometric data against those for  collecting biographic data, as recommended in DHS\u2019s May 2012 report.  Furthermore, the time frames in this plan are not accurate as of June  2013 because DHS is behind schedule on some of the tasks and has not  updated the time frames in the plan accordingly. For example, DHS had  planned to begin scenario-based testing for biometric air exit options in  August 2013; however, according to DHS officials, the department now  plans to begin such testing in early 2014. A senior official from DHS\u2019s  Office of Policy told us that DHS has not kept the plan up to date because  of the transition of responsibilities within DHS; specifically, in March 2013,  pursuant to the explanatory statement for DHS\u2019s 2013 appropriation, DHS  established an office within CBP that is responsible for coordinating  DHS\u2019s entry and exit policies and operations. This transition was in  process as of June 2013, and CBP plans to establish an integrated  project team in July 2013 that will be responsible for more detailed  planning for the department\u2019s biometric air exit efforts.
