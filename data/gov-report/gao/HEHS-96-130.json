In recent years, the act has drawn controversy, with critics charging that it artificially inflates federal construction costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for fiscal year 1996, the federal government will contract about $42 billion in construction projects throughout the nation. Given the magnitude of these expenditures, inaccurate wage determinations could lead either to excessive government construction costs or to large numbers of workers receiving wages and fringe benefits that are lower than required by the law.", "In early 1995, allegations of the use of inaccurate and fraudulent wage data to determine the prevailing wages paid on federally funded construction projects in one geographic area precipitated a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice that is still ongoing. On the basis of its own review, Labor concluded that data weaknesses warranted a redetermination of the area\u2019s prevailing wage rates, which it issued in April 1996.", "Because of your concern about whether Labor\u2019s procedures under the Davis-Bacon Act allow the use of data that could result in inaccurate wage determinations throughout the nation, you asked us to identify the steps used by Labor to collect data and determine and report the prevailing wages to be paid on federally funded construction projects, determine whether specific weaknesses exist in the wage determination process that could have resulted in the use of inaccurate or fraudulent data, and assess the extent to which Labor is addressing any identified process weaknesses.", "To respond to your request, we collected information from Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (WHD); interviewed Labor officials and staff in Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and Philadelphia; surveyed staff in Labor\u2019s six regions; and obtained the views of representatives of individual employers, construction unions, and industry associations. We focused on the policies and procedures that Labor had in place to prevent the use of inaccurate or fraudulent wage data. We did not verify the accuracy of the wage determination data Labor used or explore the adequacy of Labor\u2019s survey response rates or its calculation of prevailing wages. We conducted our review from October 1995 to April 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The act covers every contract to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration, or repair of public buildings or public works. The $2,000 threshold for projects covered by the Davis-Bacon Act has not changed since 1935.", "WHD, within Labor\u2019s Employment Standards Administration (ESA), has responsibility for administering the Davis-Bacon Act through approximately 50 staff in the Washington, D.C., headquarters and in its six regional offices. Its duties include the collection of wage and fringe benefits data on construction projects for the calculation of local prevailing wage rates. For fiscal year 1996, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that $42 billion will be spent on the construction of federal projects.", "Labor\u2019s Administrative Review Board hears appeals of prevailing wage determinations issued under the Davis-Bacon Act and upheld by the WHD Administrator. The Office of the Solicitor provides legal advice and assistance to Labor personnel relative to the administration and enforcement of the Davis-Bacon Act and represents WHD in Davis-Bacon wage determination cases before the Administrative Review Board.", "Labor collects wage and fringe benefit data through voluntary participation in a wage survey. Although the survey form does not explicitly so inform participants, failure to supply truthful answers can have serious consequences. It is a crime under federal law (18 U.S.C. 1001) to knowingly submit false data to the government, and it is a crime under federal law (18 U.S.C. 1341) to use the U.S. mail for fraudulent purposes.", "In previous reviews of the Davis-Bacon Act, we raised concerns about the accuracy of Labor\u2019s wage determinations. In 1979, we pointed out that the act appeared to be impractical to administer due to the magnitude of the task of producing an estimated 12,400 accurate and timely prevailing wage determinations. Since then, Labor has implemented regulatory changes that have addressed some of our specific concerns about the process used to determine prevailing wages. For example, rules were changed to generally prohibit (1) including federal contracts in the area wage surveys and (2) mixing prevailing wage data from surveys of urban and rural areas. An additional change has likely resulted in more wage determinations being based on the average wage of an area rather than on the wage specified in area collective bargaining agreements. Technological improvements have also improved Labor\u2019s ability to administer the Davis-Bacon wage determination process. Despite these changes, in 1994, we found continuing verification problems with the data that Labor uses to make prevailing wage determinations.", "The Congress is currently considering separate bills that would either repeal or reform the Davis-Bacon Act. Two bills (S. 141 and H.R. 500) would repeal the Davis-Bacon Act. Two other bills (H.R. 2472 and S. 1183) would reform the act. The two latter bills would change the way that Labor determines and enforces wage decisions in the construction industry. These reform bills include provisions that would (l) increase the $2,000 threshold for construction projects covered by Labor\u2019s wage surveys and (2) expand Labor\u2019s enforcement authority.", "Thirty-two states have \u201clittle Davis-Bacon\u201d laws requiring the payment of prevailing wages on certain state-funded construction projects. Of these, 15 states conduct their own wage surveys as part of their prevailing wage rate determination process. Three of the remaining 17 states\u2014 Connecticut, Kentucky, and Oklahoma\u2014have recently used the federal wage determinations as the basis for the prevailing rates on state construction projects, while the others generally base their wage rates on the union rate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Events Resurface Concerns With Labor\u2019s Process", "paragraphs": ["In January 1995, federal Labor and Oklahoma state labor officials received reports about possible inaccuracies in the results of a recent survey conducted by Labor that set prevailing wages for work on certain types of construction projects in the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas. Based on this information, Labor directed an audit of the wage data used in the Oklahoma City survey. Labor\u2019s review found that inaccuracies did exist in the wage determinations issued for some heavy construction and building construction job classifications in the Oklahoma City area. In March 1995, Labor issued a revised determination for certain heavy construction job classifications for the Oklahoma City area. Labor also reviewed the wage survey data of the remaining heavy construction job classifications for the Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas and issued revised wage rates in May 1995.", "During this period, believing the initial survey rates to be incorrect, Oklahoma state labor officials independently directed a review of the third-party data used in the contested survey. This investigation detected several occurrences of potentially inaccurate and fraudulent wage and fringe benefit information reported by third parties, which served to increase the federal prevailing wage rate for certain construction job classifications. In July 1995, Labor received the Oklahoma state Labor Commissioner\u2019s report alleging that fraudulent data were submitted and used in the original wage determinations. This report however, did not challenge the revised wage determinations for heavy construction that Labor had issued in March and May 1995.", "In July 1995, Labor then initiated a review of the building construction wage surveys for Oklahoma that had been collected at the same time as the initial heavy construction wage survey data. Based on a determination that potential data verification problems existed in the building construction survey, Labor withdrew its wage determinations for all Oklahoma City building construction job classifications in August 1995.", "In April 1996, Labor issued new wage determinations for heavy construction based on completely new survey data and for building construction based on complete verification and analysis of previously conducted building construction survey data. The new determinations established prevailing rates that were higher in some instances and lower in others than the wage determinations in place in January 1995. As of mid-May 1996, these new determinations had not been contested.", "Labor\u2019s Office of the Inspector General is currently surveying the extent to which fraudulent or inaccurate wage data were used by Labor in 1995 to determine prevailing wages under the Davis-Bacon Act in several of Labor\u2019s regions.

This information is collected through the voluntary submission of data from employers and third parties on construction projects surveyed for each wage determination. Labor\u2019s wage determination process consists of four basic stages: planning and scheduling surveys, conducting the surveys, clarifying and analyzing respondents\u2019 wage data, and issuing the wage determinations. In addition, any employer or interested party who wishes to contest or appeal Labor\u2019s final wage determination can do so.", "Labor encourages the submission of wage information from all employers and third parties, including employee unions and industry associations that are not directly involved with the surveyed projects. In fiscal year 1995, Labor completed about 100 prevailing wage surveys, gathering wage and fringe benefit data from over 37,000 employers and third parties.", "Labor surveys wages and fringe benefits paid to workers in different job classifications for four basic types of construction (building, residential, heavy, and highway) covering more than 3,000 counties or groups of counties within the United States. Given the large number of prevailing wage determinations and Labor\u2019s limited resources, Labor develops an annual plan to identify those geographic areas or counties for which wage determinations are most in need of revision. (See app. II for a detailed description of Labor\u2019s prevailing wage determination and appeal procedures.) For each area designated for survey, Labor identifies the counties for which the wage determination should be conducted and determines what construction projects will be surveyed.", "Labor places primary responsibility for the collection and compilation of the relevant wage data on about 30 staff distributed among six Labor regional offices. The survey is distributed to the participant population, which includes the general contractor for each construction project identified as comparable and within the survey\u2019s geographic area. In surveying the general contractors, Labor requests information on subcontractors to solicit their participation. Labor also surveys interested third parties, such as local unions and construction industry associations that are located or active in the survey area.", "Once the data submissions are returned, the analysts review and analyze the returned wage survey forms\u2014WD-10 wage reporting forms. They follow up with the employer or third parties to clarify any information that seems discrepant, inaccurate, or confusing. The analysts then use this information to create computer-generated recommended prevailing wages for key construction job classifications.", "These recommended prevailing wages are reviewed and approved by Labor\u2019s National Office in Washington, D.C. Labor publishes the Davis-Bacon final wage determinations in printed reports and on its electronic bulletin board, allowing updates to be rapidly communicated to contracting and assisting agencies. Modifications to wage determinations are published in the Federal Register.

Labor\u2019s failure to prevent the use of fraudulent or inaccurate data may result in wages and fringe benefits being paid to construction workers that are lower than those prevailing.

Staff in Labor\u2019s regional offices that have Davis-Bacon operations reported that most of their verifications of data submissions\u2014clarifications concerning accuracy, appropriateness, or inclusion\u2014were conducted by telephone. Labor\u2019s procedures also do not require and Labor staff rarely request supporting documentation\u2014for example, payroll records\u2014that supplement the WD-10 wage reporting forms submitted by employers. Labor officials and staff told us that if an employer insists that the wages reported are accurate, Labor\u2019s wage analysts generally accepted what was communicated verbally by telephone.", "Analysts conduct telephone verification with the employer on all third-party data that appear to be inaccurate. For example, when employers and third parties submit wage information on the same project, verification is conducted by contacting the employer in the event of a discrepancy between data received from the employer and a third party.However, Labor officials and staff told us that, before August 1995, there was no requirement to contact the employer regarding the verification of third-party data. Typically, if there was some question regarding third-party data, staff generally resolved the matter by contacting the third party only, rather than verifying the information with the employer.", "Labor headquarters officials also said that because of resource constraints, regional staff do not conduct on-site inspections or reviews of employer payroll records to verify wage survey data. In recent years, Labor has reduced the number of staff allocated to Davis-Bacon wage-setting activities. For example, the number of staff in Labor\u2019s regional offices assigned to the Davis-Bacon wage determination process\u2014who have primary responsibility for the wage survey process\u2014decreased from a total of 36 staff in fiscal year 1992 to 27 staff in fiscal year 1995, and Labor officials in one region also told us that staff had only received two training courses in the last 6 years.

They said that Labor staff depend on past experience and eyeballing the wage data for accuracy and consistency. For example, Labor offices do not have computer software that could detect grossly inaccurate data reported in Labor\u2019s surveys. Regional staff reported only one computer edit feature in the current system that could eliminate duplicate entry of data received in the wage surveys. As a result, several review functions that could be performed by computers are conducted by visual reviews by one or more wage analysts or supervisory wage analysts in Labor\u2019s regional offices.", "Labor\u2019s ability to review wage survey data is also hindered by a lack of up-to-date computer hardware. For example, in the Atlanta and Philadelphia regional offices, most of the computer hardware is old and outdated. In these offices, because of the computers\u2019 limited memory capabilities, Labor staff told us that they are unable to store historical data on prior wage determinations that would allow wage analysts to compare current with prior recommendations for wage determinations in a given locality.", "These limitations could be significant given the large number of survey forms received and the frequency of errors on the WD-10 reporting forms. In 1995, Labor received wage data from over 37,000 employers and third parties, and Labor staff reported that submissions with some form of data error were quite common. The frequency of errors could be caused in part by employer confusion in completing the wage reporting forms.", "Depending on the employer\u2019s size and level of automation, completing the WD-10 reporting forms could be somewhat difficult and time consuming. For example, the employer must not only compute the hourly wages paid to each worker who was employed on the particular project in a certain job classification but must also determine the time period when the most workers were employed in each particular job classification.Representatives of an employer association, a union, and state labor officials also told us that many smaller, nonunion employers do not have the capability to easily report information on the WD-10 wage reporting forms.", "Although Labor staff reported that wage surveys with data errors are fairly common, agency officials believe that it is very unlikely that erroneous wage data went undetected and were used in the prevailing wage determination. They said that a key responsibility of Labor\u2019s wage analysts is to closely scrutinize the WD-10 wage reporting forms and contact employers as necessary for clarification. Labor officials contended that, over time, this interaction with employers and third parties permitted Labor staff to develop considerable knowledge of and expertise in the construction industry in their geographic areas and to easily detect wage survey data that are inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistent.", "Although Labor officials also acknowledged that additional staff, enhanced computer capabilities, and the provision of more training and outreach to employers and third parties on how to participate in the surveys could improve their review of wage survey data and reduce errors, they said that all these options require additional resources that are currently unavailable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Awareness of the Appeals Process May Limit Its Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["Labor\u2019s regulations provide any interested party, such as an employee, employer or contractor, or representatives of associations or unions, the opportunity to request a reconsideration of Labor\u2019s prevailing wage determinations. A formal request for reconsideration must be in writing and accompanied by a full statement of the interested party\u2019s views and any supporting wage data or other pertinent information. Instead of formally requesting a reconsideration, an interested party may make informal inquiries by telephone or in writing for quick resolution of questions about wage determinations. Labor\u2019s regional officials handle informal inquiries about wage determinations, with WHD\u2019s National Office staff getting involved only in the formal reconsiderations. Labor reported that most inquiries on its wage determinations are informal and are generally resolved quickly over the telephone at the regional offices.", "If an informal inquiry is not resolved to the satisfaction of the interested party, he or she may submit a formal request for reconsideration to either the regional or National Office. On formal requests for reconsideration, regional offices may or may not make recommendations before referring them to the National Office for a decision. A successful request for reconsideration typically results in Labor modifying an existing determination or conducting a new wage survey. An interested party may appeal an unsuccessful request to Labor\u2019s Administrative Review Board for adjudication. Labor officials said it is extremely rare for anyone to make formal requests for reconsideration of a determination, reporting that there had been only one such case in the last 5 years. Labor officials interpreted this record as a vindication of complaints about the accuracy and fairness of the prevailing wage determinations issued.", "The small number of formal appeals could also be evidence of interested parties\u2019 lack of awareness of their rights and the difficulty they faced in collecting the evidence necessary to sustain a case. Representatives of construction unions and industry trade associations told us that employers were generally unaware of their rights to appeal Labor\u2019s final wage determinations. In addition, officials with the Oklahoma Department of Labor told us that even if an interested party wanted to appeal a wage determination to the National Office and the Administrative Review Board, the length of time it takes to independently verify wage data submissions could discourage such an action. For example, for their 1995 study of wage rates in Oklahoma City, an intra-agency team took 1 month to fully investigate and verify the information for only three construction projects. A private employer or organization wishing to appeal a determination on the basis that the wage information used was inaccurate might experience similar difficulties.", "Labor officials reported that for an interested party to contest a new wage determination successfully, it must present evidence demonstrating that the survey wage rates do not reflect the pattern of wages paid in a particular area. The amount of evidence to warrant a new survey will vary according to a variety of factors, including the quality of the evidence and the amount of construction activity in an area. Labor officials contended that collecting information to contest a wage survey is not difficult for most interested parties who inquire. They said that most inquiries originate either from contractors who have access to wage rates on their own projects; unions who have access to collective bargaining rates; or project grantees, such as local governments, who have access to the wage rates paid on their other projects. However, Labor officials acknowledged that it could be difficult for an interested party to challenge a wage determination on the basis that the wage data submitted by employers were inaccurate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Wage Determinations Based on Erroneous Data", "paragraphs": ["Wage determinations based on erroneous data could result in wages and fringe benefits paid to workers that are higher or lower than would otherwise be prevailing on federal construction projects. For example, although they considered it unlikely, Labor officials acknowledged that there could be an incentive for third parties, particularly union contractors, to report higher wages than those being paid on a particular construction project. The reporting of higher wages could influence the prevailing wages in a local area toward the typically higher union rate or at least minimize any wage differential between the unionized wage rate and the prevailing wage to be paid on Davis-Bacon construction projects.", "The use of inaccurate data could also lead to lower wages for construction workers on federal projects than would otherwise be prevailing. Industry association members and officials told us that in several parts of the country, employers, especially nonunion contractors, paid wages on their private projects below the prevailing wage levels specified by the Davis-Bacon Act in their areas. These officials told us that this differential sometimes proved problematic for contractors in retaining their skilled labor force. For example, an official of an employer association told us that an employer who successfully bid on a Davis-Bacon contract but who typically paid wages below the prevailing rate would be required to pay the workers employed on the new project at the higher Davis-Bacon wage rates. Depending on the local labor market conditions, when the project was completed, these workers typically received their pre-Davis-Bacon, lower wages and fringe benefits on any future work. In such cases, some employees became disgruntled, believing that they were being cheated, or suffered lower morale that sometimes led to increased staff turnover. Given these conditions, Labor officials acknowledged that an employer in a largely nonunion area who had been paying lower than average wages would have an incentive to \u201cchisel\u201d or report wages and fringe benefits levels somewhat lower than what he or she was actually paying, in an attempt to lower the Davis-Bacon rate.", "To the extent that the submission of fraudulent or inaccurate data is perceived by the construction industry to be a widespread problem, it could also erode survey participation support among the interested parties. Officials from one industry association reported that despite training classes and other assistance it provides, it was difficult for the association to foster employer survey participation, especially among the nonunion contractors. To the extent that participants\u2019 beliefs about erroneous data being used as the basis for Labor\u2019s wage determinations became widespread, the number of survey respondents would likely decrease."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Labor\u2019s Short- and Long-Term Initiatives to Improve Wage Determination Process", "paragraphs": ["At least partially in response to the problems detected in the Oklahoma wage surveys, Labor has proposed both short- and long-term initiatives to improve the accuracy of the data used in prevailing wage determinations. In August 1995, Labor implemented a procedural change requiring its regional wage analysts to conduct telephone verifications with the employer on all third-party data that appear to be inaccurate or discrepant. In addition, the new policy requires analysts to verify with the employers at least a 10-percent sample of third-party data that appear to be accurate.", "Under this requirement, Labor staff first attempt to verify this information by telephone with the employer. If Labor staff are unable to contact the employer, they will then contact the third party to request supporting documentation verifying the submitted wage information on the specific construction project. This new requirement was linked with training for all regional office staff that reemphasized agency procedures for analyzing and verifying employer and third-party data received in its wage surveys. Although the new procedures may improve the accuracy of data received from third parties, Labor\u2019s change does not include enhanced verification of the majority of the data used in most wage determinations; that is, data directly received from employers. In addition, the new procedures do not move toward encouraging the use of Labor\u2019s appeals process.", "Labor has proposed placing a statement on the WD-10 survey reporting form that would inform respondents that they could be prosecuted if they willfully falsify data in the Davis-Bacon wage surveys. Labor officials solicited comments on this proposal in the Federal Register in February 1996, with the comment period ending in May 1996.", "Labor has also proposed a long-term strategy to review the entire Davis-Bacon wage determination process. In late 1995, Labor established an ongoing task group to identify various strategies for improving the process it uses to determine prevailing wages. Labor officials held meetings with contractors knowledgeable about the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage determination process. These continuing discussions have led to the identification of various weaknesses in the wage determination process and steps Labor might take to address them.", "Labor has acknowledged the weaknesses identified by the task group; for example, the system\u2019s vulnerability to manipulation through the submission of false data that can erode the accuracy of some of its wage determinations. In response, in its fiscal year 1997 budget request, Labor asked for about $4 million to develop, evaluate, and implement alternative reliable methodologies or procedures that will yield accurate and timely wage determinations at reasonable cost. These alternatives would include exploring the feasibility of replacing the current labor-intensive wage survey process with the development of econometric models from which occupational wage rates could be extrapolated from existing sources of wage data and privatizing the wage survey process using alternative technologies that would derive prevailing wage rates from a sample design rather than from a universe survey as is currently used.", "If such alternatives are not feasible for all localities and occupational job classifications, Labor would focus on enhancing the existing survey process, including the improvement of data verification procedures, the fostering of employer participation, and the expansion of the geographic scope of the Davis-Bacon surveys. Labor anticipates completing its evaluation of the wage determination process in late 1996 and it expects to consider any recommendations that may result from the Office of the Inspector General study, which should be completed about the same time.", "In the interim, absent any additional action, Labor\u2019s procedures will still contain many of the weaknesses that we have identified.

In the meanwhile, Labor would continue to issue new wage determinations and enforce compliance with existing ones that may be based on fraudulent or inaccurate data. Such data can lead to the payment of wages that are either lower than what workers should receive by law or else higher than the actual prevailing wages, which would inflate federal construction costs at the taxpayer\u2019s expense. Although we have not established the extent to which such data have been used, the system\u2019s long-standing vulnerabilities and a lack of confidence by some critics in the accuracy of the wage determinations suggest that immediate changes are in order.", "We believe that Labor needs to improve its verification of wage data submitted by employers\u2014similar to the change it made in verification of third-party submissions. More specifically, Labor should apply to employer submissions a comparable approach of selecting a sample for more intensive review. When a submission is selected for review, Labor should ask the employer to provide additional documentation supporting the wage data. Although Labor has indicated that it is unable to do more intensive verification because of limited staff resources, Labor does not appear to have explored proposals to target its scarce resources more effectively toward verification efforts.", "Labor also needs to revisit its procedures to appeal wage determinations to improve their accessibility. At a minimum, it needs to publicize the availability of the appeals process to all interested parties and the rights of those parties to obtain information on the data used to develop the wage determinations believed to be questionable. For example, Labor could place a statement either with its issuance of each wage determination, on its wage survey forms, or in some other manner, informing interested parties of their rights to request summary information on a wage determination (that is, the WD-22a construction project wage summary report) and of the procedures for initiating an appeal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["While Labor continues in the long term to evaluate the Davis-Bacon wage determination process, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor require the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards to request a sample of participating employers to submit appropriate documentation on their data submissions or to conduct a limited number of on-site inspection reviews of employer wage data.", "Because Labor\u2019s appeals process can serve as an additional internal control to guard against the use of fraudulent or inaccurate data in the wage determination process, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor require the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards to inform employers, unions, and other interested parties of their rights to request summary information on a wage determination and of the agency\u2019s procedures for initiating an appeal of a wage determination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor concurs with our recommendations and stated that it is developing an action plan, consistent with available resources, to implement the recommendations while it continues to evaluate longer-term revisions to the Davis-Bacon wage determination process.

Labor has designated the county as the basic geographic unit for data collection, although Labor also conducts some surveys setting prevailing wage rates for groups of counties. Wage rates are issued for a series of job classifications in the four basic types of construction, so each wage determination requires the calculation of prevailing wages for many different trades, such as electrician, plumber, carpenter, and drywall installer. For example, the prevailing wage rates for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area include wage rates for 143 different construction trade occupations. Because there are over 3,000 counties, more than 12,000 surveys could be conducted each year if every county in the United States was surveyed. In fiscal year 1995, Labor completed about 100 prevailing wage surveys, gathering wage and fringe benefit data from over 37,000 employers and interested parties. As shown in figure II.1, Labor\u2019s wage determination process consists of four basic stages: planning and scheduling surveys of employers\u2019 wages and fringe benefits in similar job classifications on comparable construction projects; conducting surveys of employers and third parties, such as representatives of unions or industry associations, on construction projects; clarifying and analyzing respondents\u2019 data; and issuing the wage determinations.", "In addition, an interested party, such as a contractor; labor union; or federal, state, or local agency, may seek review and reconsideration of Labor\u2019s final wage determinations through an appeals process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stage 1: Planning and Scheduling Survey Activity", "paragraphs": ["Labor annually identifies the geographic areas that it plans to survey.
