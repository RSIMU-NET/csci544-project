As health information exchange officials in states with  strong privacy protections consider exchanging health information with  organizations in other states, they will need to determine the extent to  which they could share health information with organizations in states that  have less stringent or no state-level laws and policies. For example, an  official with one health information exchange organization described its  state\u2019s privacy laws as being much more stringent than federal  requirements, while a health information exchange official in another state  told us that HIPAA\u2019s privacy requirements are the only laws that apply to  the information exchanged by its organization. In this case, according to  the official with the first organization, it would share more health  information with providers in its own state than it would with providers in  the other state because the other state\u2019s less stringent privacy protection  laws would not provide a sufficient level of protection. HHS recognized  that sharing health information among entities in states with varying laws  introduces challenges and intends to identify variations in state laws that  affect privacy and security practices through the privacy and security  solutions contract that it awarded in 2005.", "Organizations also described another challenge associated with  understanding and resolving legal and policy requirements for protecting  electronic health information exchanged among multiple and diverse  organizations. Differing interpretations and applications of the HIPAA  privacy and security rules by providers and health information exchange  organizations can result in disagreement about the data that can be  exchanged and with whom the data can be shared. An official with one  health information exchange described differing applications of HIPAA\u2019s  security requirements that affect the way systems are administered and  hinder the exchange of health information. For example, to protect  individuals\u2019 information from inappropriate disclosure, the organization  requires that the systems\u2019 list of users be forwarded to managers so that  they can review roles and access rights at least annually. HIPAA\u2019s  requirements do not specify protections at this level of granularity, so other  organizations may not require this level of activity. This can create  disagreements between organizations about the data that can be  exchanged and with whom data can be shared if one organization does not  administer access rights as strictly as another.", "Health information exchange organizations described difficulties with  determining liability and enforcing sanctions in cases of confidentiality  breaches. As the number of health information exchange organizations  increases and information is shared on a widespread basis, determination  of liability for improper disclosure of information will become more  important but also more difficult. For example, the Markle Foundation  described problems with tracing the source of a privacy violation and  determining the responsible entity. Without such information, it becomes  very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce sanctions for violations and  breaches of confidentiality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring Appropriate Disclosure", "paragraphs": ["Several organizations described issues associated with ensuring  appropriate disclosure, such as determining the minimum data necessary  that can be disclosed in order for requesters to accomplish the intended  purposes for the use of the health information. For example, dieticians and  health claims processors do not need access to complete health records,  whereas treating physicians generally do. According to VA officials, the  agency\u2019s ability to ensure appropriate disclosure is further complicated by  the fact that the Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act prevents disclosure of certain  information, such as information related to HIV infection, sickle cell  anemia, and substance abuse, which must be removed from individuals\u2019  health records before the requested information is disclosed. Additionally,  VA\u2019s current manual process for determining the legal authority for  disclosures and the minimum amount of information authorized to be  disclosed is difficult to automate because of the complexity of various  privacy laws and regulations.", "Organizations also described issues with obtaining individuals\u2019  authorization and consent for uses and disclosures of personal health  information. For example, health information exchange organizations may  provide individuals with the ability to either opt in or opt out of electronic  health information exchange. The opt-in approach requires that health care  providers obtain the explicit permission of individuals before allowing their  information to be shared with other providers. Without this permission, an  individual\u2019s personal health information would not be accessible. The opt- out approach presumes that an individual\u2019s personal health information is  available to authorized persons, but any individual may elect to not  participate. Another approach taken by health information organizations  simply notifies individuals that their information will be exchanged with  providers throughout the organization\u2019s network.", "Several organizations described difficulties with determining the best way  to allow individuals to participate in and consent to electronic health  information exchange. While the opt-in approach increases individual  autonomy, it is more administratively burdensome than the opt-out  approach and may result in fewer individuals participating in health  information exchange. The opt-out approach is easier, less costly, and may  result in greater participation in health information exchange, but does not  provide the autonomy that the opt-in approach does. The notification  approach is the simplest to administer but provides individuals no choice  regarding participation in the organization\u2019s data exchange. In June 2006,  NCVHS recommended to the Secretary of HHS that the department  monitor the development of opt-in and opt-out approaches; consider local,  regional, and provider variations of consent options; collect evidence on  the health, economic, social, and other implications of opt-in and opt-out  approaches; and continue an open, transparent, and public process to  evaluate whether a national policy on opting in or opting out is appropriate.", "Organizations also described the need to effectively educate consumers so  that they understand the extent to which their consent or authorization to  use and disclose health information applies. For example, one organization  stated that a request made to limit use and disclosure at one facility in a  network may not apply to other facilities within the same network, but  consumers may assume the limitations do apply to all facilities and not take  steps to limit disclosure in those other facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring Individuals\u2019 Rights to Request Access and Amendments to Health Information", "paragraphs": ["As the exchange of personal health information expands to include  multiple providers and as individuals\u2019 health records include increasing  amounts of information from many sources, keeping track of the origin of  specific data and ensuring that incorrect information is corrected and  removed from future health information exchange could become  increasingly difficult. Several organizations described challenges with  ensuring that individuals have access to and the ability to amend their own  health information and with ensuring that amendments are made and  tracked throughout their information exchange organizations.", "Officials with HHS\u2019s Indian Health Service described a challenge with  ensuring that individuals\u2019 amendments to their own health information are  properly made and tracked. Additionally, as individuals amend their health  information, HIPAA requires that covered entities make reasonable efforts  to notify or alert and send the corrected information to certain providers  and other persons that previously received the individuals\u2019 information.  Meeting this requirement was described as a challenge by officials with VA,  and it is expected to become more prevalent as the numbers of  organizations exchanging health information increases.", "Officials with DOD described difficulties with ensuring that individuals\u2019  amendments to health information are distributed across multiple facilities  within its network of medical facilities. The department is addressing this  problem through the implementation of electronic health records and  information management tools that track requests for amendments and  their status.

For example, health information exchange organizations described  difficulties with determining and implementing adequate techniques for  authenticating requesters of health information, such as the use of  passwords and security tokens. User authentication will become more  difficult as health information exchange expands across multiple  organizations that employ different techniques. The AHIC Confidentiality,  Privacy, and Security Workgroup recognized this difficulty and identified  user authentication as one of its initial work areas for protecting  confidentiality and security.", "Implementing proper access controls, particularly role-based access  controls, was also cited as a challenge to determining the information to  which requesters may have access. Several organizations stated that  maintaining adequate audit trails for monitoring access to health  information is difficult but is necessary to ensure that information is  adequately protected.", "Organizations described problems introduced by the need to protect health  information stored on portable devices and data transmitted between  business partners. The use of laptops and other portable media by health  information exchange employees presents a challenge to organizations  since the data stored on these media should be encrypted to be secure. The  VA is also faced with limitations related to the need to encrypt electronic  health information shared with its business partners. According to VA  officials, the agency and its business partners\u2019 solutions must be  compatible in order to share the encrypted data, and VA\u2019s deployment of  encryption solutions is limited.

However, an overall approach for integrating  the department\u2019s various privacy-related initiatives has not been fully  defined and implemented. We acknowledge in our report that HHS has  established a strategic objective to protect consumer privacy along with  two specific strategies for meeting this objective: (1) support the  development and implementation of appropriate privacy and security  policies, practices, and standards for electronic health information  exchange, and (2) develop and support policies to protect against  discrimination from health information. Our report also acknowledges the  key efforts that HHS has initiated to address this objective, and HHS\u2019s  comments describe these and additional state and federal efforts. HHS  stated that the department has made significant progress in integrating  these efforts. While progress has been made initiating these efforts, much  work remains before they are completed and the outcomes of the various  efforts are integrated. Thus, we recommended that HHS define and  implement a comprehensive privacy approach that includes milestones for  integration, identifies the entity responsible for integrating the outcomes of  its privacy-related initiatives, addresses key privacy principles, and ensures  that challenges are addressed in order to meet the department\u2019s objective  to protect the privacy of health information exchanged within a nationwide  health information network.", "HHS specifically disagreed with the need to identify milestones and stated  that tightly scripted milestones would impede HHS\u2019s processes and  preclude stakeholder dialogue on the direction of important policy matters.  We disagree and believe that milestones are important for setting targets  for implementation and informing stakeholders of HHS\u2019s plans and goals  for protecting personal health information as part of its efforts to achieve  nationwide implementation of health IT. Milestones are especially  important considering the need for HHS to integrate and coordinate the  many deliverables of its numerous ongoing and remaining activities. We  agree that it is important for HHS to continue to actively involve both  public and private sector health care stakeholders in its processes. HHS did  not comment on the need to identify an entity responsible for the  integration of the department\u2019s privacy-related initiatives, nor did it provide  information regarding any effort to assign responsibility for this important  activity. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed that its approach should address  privacy principles and challenges, but stated that the department plans to  continue to work toward addressing privacy principles in HIPAA and that  our report appropriately highlights efforts to address challenges  encountered during electronic health information exchange.

We selected these organizations by  conducting literature research and consulting with HHS and recognized  health IT professional associations to identify existing health information  exchange organizations. We initially identified more than 40 organizations  and then conducted screening interviews to narrow the universe to 7 state- level health information exchange organizations that were actively  exchanging health information electronically. To ensure that we identified  challenges introduced by both federal privacy protection requirements and  requirements that are more stringent than existing federal protections, we  included states that do not have state laws that supersede federal  requirements and states with privacy laws that are more stringent than  federal laws. We selected state-level health information organizations from  California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and  Utah. We also included a telehealth network from Nebraska and a  community health center network from Florida to ensure that we identified  any privacy-related challenges unique to their health care IT environments.
