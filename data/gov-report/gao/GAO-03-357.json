Low salaries, in particular, hinder agencies' ability to attract potential child welfare workers and to retain those already in the profession. Additionally, caseworkers GAO interviewed in all four of the states GAO visited cited high caseloads and related administrative burdens, which they said took from 50 to 80 percent of their time; a lack of supervisory support; and insufficient time to take training as issues impacting both their ability to work effectively and their decision to stay in the child welfare profession. Most of these issues also surfaced in GAO's analysis of 585 exit interviews completed by child welfare staff across the country who voluntarily severed their employment. According to caseworkers GAO interviewed, high turnover rates and staffing shortages leave remaining staff with insufficient time to establish relationships with children and families and make the necessary decisions to ensure safe and stable permanent placements. GAO's analysis of HHS's state child welfare agency reviews in 27 states corroborated caseworker accounts, showing that large caseloads and worker turnover delay the timeliness of investigations and limit the frequency of worker visits with children, hampering agencies' attainment of some key federal safety and permanency outcomes. Child welfare agencies have implemented various workforce practices to improve recruitment and retention--including engaging in university-agency training partnerships and obtaining agency accreditation, a goal achieved in part by reducing caseloads and enhancing supervision--but few of these initiatives have been rigorously evaluated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With more than 800,000 children estimated to spend some time in foster  care each year, the federal government allocates approximately $7 billion  each year to states to investigate abuse and neglect, provide placements to  children outside their homes, and deliver services to help keep families  together. In addition to this funding, most of which is used by states and  counties to implement child welfare programs, the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) monitors states\u2019 compliance with key federal  goals, specified in part by the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA) of  1997, to keep children safe and ensure their placement in stable and  permanent homes. Through its formal review process, known as the Child  and Family Services Review (CFSR), HHS uses specific assessment  measures, such as agencies\u2019 ability to conduct timely abuse and neglect  investigations and regularly visit children in their homes, to assess the  performance of states\u2019 child welfare systems. HHS also provides guidance  and technical assistance through its 10 national resource centers and  funds training and research activities to improve child welfare services  nationwide.", "A stable and highly skilled child welfare workforce is necessary to  effectively provide child welfare services that meet federal goals. Many  child welfare caseworkers have professional degrees in social work;  however, this credential is not always required and many practicing in  child welfare have undergraduate degrees in seemingly unrelated fields.  Although the federal government has not set national workforce  standards, independent organizations such as the Child Welfare League of  America (CWLA) have developed guidelines concerning staff qualifications  and optimal caseload levels, which agencies may voluntarily adopt.  Agencies may also seek accreditation\u2014a voluntary review and 4-year  certification process by the Council on Accreditation for Children and  Family Services (COA)\u2014to help improve the delivery of child welfare  services.", "You asked us to identify (1) the challenges these agencies face in  recruiting and retaining child welfare workers and supervisors, (2) what is  known about how recruitment and retention challenges have affected  children\u2019s safety and permanency outcomes, and (3) workforce practices  that public and private child welfare agencies have implemented to  confront these challenges.", "To conduct our work, we obtained nearly 600 exit interview documents  completed by staff who severed their employment from 17 state,   40 county, and 19 private child welfare agencies and categorized the  reasons these former caseworkers provided for leaving their jobs.  Although the results of our exit interview analysis are informative, we  cannot generalize the results nationwide. We also examined the available  27 Child and Family Services Reviews and a variety of child welfare  workforce studies to determine the severity and scope of recruitment and  retention challenges across the country. To complement these analyses,  we interviewed child welfare experts and officials across the nation and  conducted multiple site visits to public and private child welfare agencies  in four states\u2014California, Illinois, Kentucky, and Texas\u2014to obtain first  hand information on workforce issues and their effect on children\u2019s safety  and permanency outcomes. We selected these states to represent a range  of urban and rural settings, county and state-administered systems, and  varying degrees of reliance on private child welfare agencies to deliver  services under contract. We also chose these states for the variety of  practices they have implemented to address their recruitment and  retention challenges. Furthermore, we contacted regional and  headquarters officials at HHS to identify and obtain any information they  had collected or disseminated on this topic and the impact of federal  funding to support child welfare staff development. We conducted this  work between March 2002 and January 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

The role and level of  assistance that private child welfare agencies provide varies by state,  though in Illinois for example, approximately 80 percent of child welfare  services is reported to be provided through the private sector. Although  public and private child welfare agencies face different financial  constraints and use different personnel guidelines, national survey data  confirm that both state and private child welfare agencies are  experiencing similar challenges recruiting and retaining qualified  caseworkers. For instance, turnover of child welfare staff\u2014which affects  both recruitment and retention efforts\u2014has been estimated at between   30 percent and 40 percent annually nationwide, with the average tenure  for child welfare workers being less than 2 years.", "Evidence from a national child welfare workforce study indicates that  fewer than 15 percent of child welfare agencies require caseworkers to  hold either bachelors or masters degrees in social work, despite several  studies finding that Bachelor\u2019s of Social Work (BSW) and Master\u2019s of  Social Work (MSW) degrees correlate with higher job performance and  lower turnover rates among caseworkers. Further evidence suggests that  the majority of credentialed social workers are not employed in child or  family service professions; instead, they choose professions in mental  health, substance abuse prevention, rehabilitation, and gerontology.", "Nevertheless, child welfare caseworkers, assisted by their supervisors, are  at the core of the child welfare system, investigating reports of abuse and  neglect; coordinating substance abuse, mental health, or supplemental  services to keep families intact and prevent the need for foster care; and  arranging permanent or adoptive placements when children must be  removed from their homes. In some agencies, caseworkers perform  multiple functions from intake to placement on any given case; in others,  they are specialized in areas such as investigations, reunification/family  preservation, and adoptions. The primary role of supervisors is to help  caseworkers perform these functions, thereby meeting the needs of  families and carrying out the agency\u2019s mission. Some functions of the child  welfare supervisor include assigning cases, monitoring caseworkers\u2019  progress in achieving desired outcomes, providing feedback to  caseworkers in order to help develop their skills, supporting the emotional  needs of caseworkers, analyzing and addressing problems, and making  decisions about cases. In addition, given the challenges agencies face in  recruiting and retaining child welfare workers, some supervisors provide  direct assistance to caseworkers by taking on some of their cases.", "The federal government\u2019s primary connection to the child welfare  workforce has been through its funding of child welfare training programs  as they relate to the provision of child welfare services.  ACF at HHS is  responsible for the administration and oversight of the approximately   $7 billion in federal funding allocated to states for child welfare services.  As part of this allocation, ACF provides matching funds for the training  and development of child welfare caseworkers through Title IV-E of the  Social Security Act. Title IV-E authorizes partial federal reimbursement\u2014 75 percent\u2014of states\u2019 training funds to implement training programs for  current child welfare staff and to enhance the child welfare curriculum of  undergraduate and graduate social work programs to better educate and  prepare potential caseworkers. This funding may also be used for  curriculum development, materials and books, support for current  workers to obtain a social work degree, and incentives to induce entry to  the child welfare field. During fiscal year 2001, 49 states received   $276 million in Title IV-E training reimbursements. These reimbursements  ranged from a low of approximately $1,400 in Wyoming to a high of more  than $59 million in California, with the median reimbursement  approximating $3.1 million.", "In addition, ACF\u2019s Children\u2019s Bureau manages six discretionary grant  programs through which it funds various activities related to  improvements in the child welfare system. Each of these programs  receives a separate annual appropriation from the Congress.  One of these  programs\u2014the Child Welfare Training Program, authorized by Section 426  of Title IV of the Social Security Act\u2014awards grants to public and private  nonprofit institutions of higher learning to develop and improve the  education, training, and resources available for child welfare service  providers. This is the only program of the six with a specific emphasis on  staff training; however, in fiscal year 2002, it received the second smallest  share\u20149 percent\u2014of the Children\u2019s Bureau\u2019s total discretionary funds  (see fig. 1).", "In 2000, ACF began a new federal review system to monitor states\u2019  compliance with federal child welfare laws. Under this system, ACF  conducts CFSRs, assessing states\u2019 performance in achieving the goals of  safety, permanency, and child and family well-being\u2014three goals  emphasized in ASFA. The CFSR process involves a state self-assessment  and an on-site review by a joint team of federal and state officials to assess  states\u2019 performance on assessment measures such as timely investigations  of maltreatment and caseworker visits with families. States that have not  met the standards are required to develop a program improvement plan  (PIP) and can face the withholding of federal funds should they fail to  develop a plan or fail to take the specified corrective actions. As of  December 1, 2002, ACF had completed and documented its reviews for   27 states.", "In addition to these reviews, ACF provides assistance to states via its   10 resource centers, all of which have different areas of expertise, such as  organizational improvement, legal and judicial guidance, and child welfare  information technology. The primary goal of these centers is to help states  implement federal legislation intended to ensure the safety, well-being,  and permanency of children who enter the child welfare system, to  support statutorily mandated programs, and to provide services to  discretionary grant recipients. These centers conduct needs assessments,  sponsor national conference calls with states, collaborate with other  resource centers and agencies, and provide on-site technical assistance  and training to states. States may request specific assistance from the  centers; however, ACF sets the centers\u2019 areas of focus and priorities, and  no one center focuses specifically on recruitment and retention issues at  this time.", "Figure 2 shows the major channels through which federal dollars can be  used for staff development.", "Members of the current and previous Congress have introduced proposals  to expand federal funding to combat the recruitment and retention  challenges that child welfare agencies face.  As of March 26, 2003, the  Congress was considering H.R. 14 and S. 342, each named the \u201cKeeping  Children and Families Safe Act of 2003,\u201d which contain provisions to  improve the training of supervisory and nonsupervisory workers; improve  public education relating to the role and responsibilities of the child  protective system; and provide procedures for improving the training,  retention, and supervision of caseworkers.  The Congress is also  currently considering S. 409 and H.R. 734, bills that would provide federal  loan forgiveness to social workers who work for child protective agencies  and have obtained their bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees in social work.  As  a tool to increase retention, both of these bills tie education loan  repayment to tenure, such that the longer the caseworker remains with the  agency, the greater the share of the loan that is repaid.

According to these  officials, they lose both current workers and potential hires to these fields,  which pay higher wages and offer safer and more predictable work  environments. National salary data, though somewhat broad in how it  defines certain occupations, confirm that child and family caseworkers  earn less than educators. Specifically, one county official in Texas said  that teachers now earn starting salaries of about $37,000 while entry-level  caseworkers earn about $28,000 annually, a difference of about 32 percent.  Caseworkers we interviewed in each state also cited administrative  burdens, such as increased paperwork requirements for each child in a  case; a lack of supervisory support; and insufficient time to participate in  training as issues impacting both their ability to work effectively and their  decision to stay in the child welfare profession. These issues were  mentioned by both public and private agency staff in all four states, where  some caseworkers handled double the number of cases recommended by  independent child welfare organizations. Former child welfare workers  also identified these issues in exit interview documents we reviewed. In  addition to retirement and other personal reasons staff chose to leave their  positions, low salaries and high caseloads were among the factors  affecting child welfare workers\u2019 decisions to sever their employment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Low Salaries Hinder Agencies\u2019 Ability to Maintain a Stable Workforce", "paragraphs": ["Public and private agencies we visited in all four states struggled to  provide salaries competitive with those in comparable occupations and  encountered difficulty retaining staff due to salary gaps within the  profession of child welfare. According to our analysis of 585 exit  interviews completed by staff who severed their employment, 81 cited low  pay as one of their reasons for leaving. In addition, according to agency  officials in all four states, they consistently lose both current workers and  potential hires to higher-paying professions, such as teaching. The  Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 national wages survey reports that elementary  and middle school teachers earn, on average, about $42,000 annually while  social workers earn about $33,000. Furthermore, one California private  agency reported that foster care caseworkers with MSWs who worked in  group residential care facilities, which provide structured living  arrangements and treatment services for children with complex needs,  earned from $5,000 to $30,000 less than school counselors, nurses, and  medical and public health social workers. Other states also report  significant wage disparities within the child welfare profession. One study  in South Carolina found that salaries for public agency caseworkers were  almost double those of direct care workers in private agency residential  programs. Additionally, according to labor union representatives in  Illinois, public agency caseworkers there earn considerably more than  staff in private child welfare agencies, and union officials at the national  level attribute this wage gap to their lobbying efforts.", "In addition, low salaries\u2014because they often contribute to limited  applicant pools\u2014can make it particularly difficult for agencies to recruit  child welfare staff in certain geographical areas and to serve bilingual  clients. For example, a New York State study of turnover among  caseworkers from January to December 2001 shows that small counties  near cities, in particular, have more difficulty recruiting staff because of  higher salaries in surrounding areas. Additionally, in Texas for example,  officials said that counties in rural areas with larger Spanish-speaking and  Native American populations do not pay adequate salaries to successfully  recruit qualified bilingual staff or staff who are sensitive to local cultures.  State officials in Illinois and California echoed these concerns.", "Furthermore, according to public agency caseworkers in Texas, their  salaries do not reflect the risks to personal safety they face as part of their  work. These caseworkers told us that given the safety risks they are  exposed to daily, they should be given hazardous duty pay similar to  workers in other high-risk professions. According to a national study by  the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees  (AFSCME), a union representing primarily government employees  including child welfare caseworkers throughout the country, caseworkers  routinely deal with high levels of risk. Specifically, AFSCME researchers  found that more than 70 percent of front-line caseworkers had been  victims of violence or threats of violence in the line of duty. In addition, in  a peer exit interview process conducted in one state we visited, 90 percent  of its child protective services employees reported that they had  experienced verbal threats; 30 percent experienced physical attacks; and  13 percent were threatened with weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Caseloads, Administrative Burdens, Limited Supervision, and Insufficient Training Reduce the Appeal of Child Welfare Work", "paragraphs": ["Although many of the caseworkers and supervisors we interviewed in  each state told us they were motivated by their desire to help people,  protect children, work with families, and potentially save lives, they also  told us that workplace issues such as high caseloads, administrative  burdens, limited supervision, and insufficient time to participate in  training reduce the appeal of child welfare work, making it difficult for  staff to stay in their positions. In each of the four states we visited, the  agency\u2019s inability to retain staff has contributed to existing unmanageable  caseloads. CWLA suggests a caseload ratio of 12 to 15 children per  caseworker, and COA suggests that caseloads not exceed 18 children per  caseworker. However, in its May 2001 report, the American Public Human  Services Association (APHSA) reported that caseloads for individual child  welfare workers ranged from 10 to 110 children, with workers handling  an average of about 24 to 31 children each (see fig. 3). Managers we  interviewed in California confirmed this, stating that caseworkers often  handle double the recommended number of cases.", "Furthermore, caseworkers and supervisors we interviewed in the four  states we visited told us that heavy workloads encourage workers to leave  for other careers that they perceive as requiring less time and energy. For  instance, caseworkers in Texas told us that former co-workers left the  field to go into teaching, in part, because of the more appealing work  schedule, including seemingly shorter hours and holidays and summers  off. Also, caseworkers in all states we visited emphasized concerns about  the increasing complexity of cases\u2014more cases involve drug and alcohol  abuse and special needs children, in particular. In the exit interview  documents we reviewed, 86 out of 585 child welfare workers identified  high caseloads as a factor influencing their decision to leave. One former  private agency caseworker in Delaware reported in an exit interview that,  although caseloads were manageable, the complexity of each case was a  problem. In addition, one former county worker in California said that  cases are becoming increasingly difficult, and caseworkers are no longer  able to do \u201csocial work.\u201d This caseworker also said that the amount of  work and stress is endless and limits the amount of time she has to  perform her job well.", "Furthermore, caseworkers and supervisors in the four states we visited  told us that overwhelming administrative burdens, such as paperwork,  take up a large portion of their time, with some estimating between   50 percent and 80 percent. Some also said that these administrative  burdens were factors influencing their decisions to seek other types of  employment. According to two labor union representatives in California,  caseworkers often have to work overtime to complete their paperwork,  but instead of being compensated in salary for their overtime, they are  given days off. The representatives said, however, that many caseworkers  could not afford to take time off because paperwork continues to mount in  their absence. Caseworkers in Illinois, for example, told us that they are  required to complete more than 150 forms per child in their caseload. Such  requirements are multiplied as caseloads increase. One study of the child  welfare system reported that part of the administrative burden child  welfare workers face also stems from the time they must spend in court as  a result of requirements of ASFA. The authors said that child welfare  workers frequently mentioned that the earlier and more frequent court  hearings that ASFA requires mean additional responsibilities for them.  Furthermore, in exit interview documentation we reviewed, workers  expressed frustration with these burdens, with some saying that they  spent insufficient amounts of time with families due to paperwork, in  particular, and that more clerical staff is needed to assist with  documentation. One caseworker in a California county indicated that  more than 80 percent of her job was administrative and that it was  impossible to meet all administrative requirements and do a quality job at  the same time.", "Officials and caseworkers in all of the states we visited also expressed  concerns about the quality of supervision, with most indicating that  supervisory support either motivated caseworkers to stay despite the  stress and frustration of the job or that lack of supervisory support was a  critical factor in their decision to leave. Although challenging, two critical  functions of child welfare supervisors are to recognize and respond to the  needs and concerns of caseworkers and to provide them with direction  and guidance. However, caseworkers we visited said that their supervisors  are often too busy to provide the level of supervision needed. In Kentucky,  workers told us that the inaccessibility of their supervisors negatively  impacted their effectiveness and morale. Furthermore, one Texas state  official told us that because of high turnover, caseworkers with only   3 years of experience are commonly promoted to supervisory positions.  According to tenured supervisors there, this advanced promotion track  has caused additional problems. Some newly promoted supervisors have  requested demotions because they feel unprepared for the job  requirements, and the caseworkers they supervise have complained of  poor management and insufficient support.", "Our analysis of exit interview documents revealed that inadequate  supervision was not among the top five reasons caseworkers gave for  leaving, but some caseworkers (about 7 percent) cited it as an area of  concern. One former county caseworker in Pennsylvania, who had been  with the agency for 3 years, reported that her supervisor lacked both  leadership qualities and experience. Additionally, one private agency  caseworker in Wisconsin, who had left the agency after just 6 months,  reported in her exit interview that mentors were good when they were  available, but they were often unavailable due to work demands. She also  reported that mentorship becomes even more difficult when a group of  new caseworkers completes training at the same time, suggesting a lack of  tenured staff interested or available to provide such on-the-job guidance.  Furthermore, a former caseworker in Arizona reported that  communications with her supervisor were mainly through electronic  mail\u2014seldom in person. Finally, a former private agency caseworker in  Maine said that most interactions with her supervisor seemed punitive  rather than educational or supportive in nature.", "Agency and supervisory support can mitigate the stress of the job and the  workload, according to some studies. For example, one California  county\u2019s workforce analysis stated that competent and supportive  supervision was critical to reducing staff turnover. Another California  study\u2014in a county where most caseworkers indicated that they were  satisfied with their jobs\u2014reported that these caseworkers rated their  relationship with supervisors as one of the most satisfying factors of their  work, giving supervisors very high ratings for their effectiveness, personal  skills, and ability to help workers collaborate.", "In addition to their concerns about supervision, caseworkers and  supervisors in all four states consistently told us that insufficient training  poses a recruitment and retention challenge to their agencies. Specifically,  they told us that training opportunities were often inadequate to ensure a  smooth transition for new recruits into the agency. Despite the fact that  public agencies in all four states had both minimum requirements for  training new hires and ongoing training for senior workers, some  caseworkers said that basic training does not provide new staff with the  skills they need to do their jobs. Additionally, they told us that with high  caseloads and work priorities, neither supervisors nor tenured staff are  able to conduct on-the-job training to compensate. In one urban Texas  region, for example, caseworkers told us that new hires are typically  assigned between 40 and 60 cases within their first 3 months on the job.  According to caseworkers there, high caseloads and the limited time new  hires spend in training are often responsible for caseworker turnover.  Furthermore, by their supervisors\u2019 estimation, about half of new trainees  leave their jobs before completing 1 year. According to these supervisors,  many leave, in part, because they are not sufficiently trained and  supported to do their jobs.", "Participation in ongoing training for staff at all levels also appears  problematic\u2014caseworkers in each state told us either that available  training did not meet their needs or that they did not have time to  participate in classes. For example, in Illinois, caseworkers said training  was often too time-consuming and irrelevant. They added that, given the  administrative burdens of paperwork, they most need training on  paperwork management. Furthermore, university Title IV-E program  officials in Kentucky said that Title IV-E funds, which support caseworker  training and development, cannot be used to provide courses specifically  on substance abuse or mental health training, which they noted would be  particularly relevant to service delivery. Additionally, caseworkers in all  states we visited said that, when training was available, high caseloads and  work priorities hindered their attendance. In Kentucky, for example,  caseworkers told us that, unless training is required, they do not attend  because casework accumulates, discounting the value of the training  received. In addition, caseworkers in California said that one program  designed to allow part-time work while they pursue an MSW is not  practical because caseloads are not reduced and performance  expectations do not change.", "Challenges in training child welfare workers also exist for public agencies  that contract with private agencies to provide services. The federal  government reimburses states 75 percent for training public agency staff  and 50 percent for training private agency employees. In Illinois, where  about 80 percent of child welfare services are provided under contract  with private agencies, training reimbursement has become a major issue  for workforce development. One program director said that many workers  have left private child welfare agencies in Illinois because they did not  believe that existing training programs adequately prepared them to do  their jobs. However, Illinois recently took steps towards addressing these  issues by pursuing a waiver from HHS to obtain additional reimbursement  for training expenses. According to HHS officials, Illinois is the only state,  to date, that has requested and received this spending authority. From  Illinois\u2019 officials\u2019 perspectives, however, states that have opted to privatize  child welfare services should not be penalized or compelled to apply for a  waiver in order to ensure that all service providers are adequately trained."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some Evidence Suggests How Recruitment and Retention Challenges Affect Children\u2019s Safety and Permanency, but the Magnitude of the Effect Is Unknown", "paragraphs": ["Caseworkers we interviewed in all four states and our analysis of HHS\u2019s  CFSRs indicate that recruitment and retention challenges affect children\u2019s  safety and permanency by producing staffing shortages that increase the  workloads of remaining staff.

They told us that gathering information to develop and manage a  child\u2019s case requires trust between the child and the caseworker. Due to  turnover, this trust is disrupted, making it more difficult for caseworkers  who assume these cases to elicit from the child the type of information  necessary to ensure appropriate care. For example, when staff change,  caseworkers may have to reestablish information to update the case  record, frustrating all parties involved. Caseworkers noted that families  become hesitant to work with unfamiliar caseworkers, making it difficult  to learn the history of the case. The negative effects of turnover can be  particularly pronounced in group residential care facilities. According to  several residential care caseworkers in California and Illinois, worker  turnover compounds children\u2019s feelings of neglect and often results in  behavior changes that affect their therapeutic treatment plans. These  workers said that children channel their feelings of abandonment towards  remaining staff, become resistant to therapy, and act violently and  aggressively towards other children in the residential facility.", "In every state we visited, caseworkers said that staffing shortages and high  caseloads have had detrimental effects on their abilities to make well- supported and timely decisions regarding children\u2019s safety. Many said that  high caseloads require them to limit the number and quality of the home  visits they conduct, forcing them to focus only on the most serious  circumstances of abuse and neglect. One caseworker in Texas noted that  when she does make a home visit, the visit is quick and does not enable  her to identify subtle or potential risks to the child\u2019s well-being.", "Other caseworkers in all four states said that when they assume  responsibility for cases as a result of worker turnover, their own caseloads  increase and their ability to ensure the safety of the children whose cases  they assume is limited. For example, a Texas caseworker told us that,  when a former colleague left the agency, he was assigned a case in which  the initial investigation had not been done. According to the caseworker,  because his own caseload was high before assuming responsibility for the  new case, the investigation of the abuse allegation and home visit were  delayed by 3 months. As a result of the delay, the claim could no longer be  substantiated\u2014the evidence of alleged abuse had healed, no one could  corroborate the claim, and the case was closed. By his estimation, if the  case initially had been handled more quickly, or if high caseloads were not  driving attrition, caseworkers might be better able to identify, mitigate,  and/or prevent future situations that could possibly jeopardize children\u2019s  safety.", "Additionally, all of the caseworkers we interviewed told us that  transitioning cases to remaining staff takes time and can result in delays or  changes to permanency decisions. Caseworkers in Kentucky noted that  this is particularly true when they assume responsibility for a case with  inadequate documentation. Given their high caseloads and ASFA\u2019s  requirements to file for termination of parental rights (TPR) if the child  has been in care 15 of the last 22 months, caseworkers have little time to  supplement a child\u2019s file with additional investigations and site visits. As a  result, they sometimes make permanency decisions without thoroughly  evaluating the adequacy and appropriateness of available options.  According to private agency officials in Illinois, this type of unsupported  decision making is believed to result in placement disruptions, foster care  re-entry, or continued abuse and neglect. In addition, supervisors in Texas  told us that caseworkers often determine that filing a TPR under the 15-of  22-month provision is not in the best interests of the child when sufficient  evidence is not available to support the TPR.

Since that time, all private agencies that  contract with the state agency are reported to have also received  accreditation. According to the state\u2019s child welfare director, the pursuit of  accreditation stemmed from a court order mandating smaller caseloads  for staff and the fact that the agency was confronting receivership and  facing increased media scrutiny. According to several Illinois supervisors,  accreditation changed the operations of the agency\u2014they now operate  with reduced caseloads, improved internal communication, and increased  public confidence in the system. Furthermore, to prepare for  reaccreditation, staff engage in a routine practice called \u201cpeer review\u201d to  determine how their caseload management contributes to the state\u2019s  safety and permanency outcomes measures.

These officials also said that accreditation has  strengthened recruitment and improved retention because the agency is  focused on hiring qualified people who know what to expect on the job.  According to Kentucky supervisors and staff, accreditation was also the  driving force behind the creation of the agency\u2019s new MSW stipend  program, its push towards continuous service quality improvement for  children and families, and higher expectations for staff performance.", "To obtain these benefits, accreditation requires sustained financial and  organizational commitment. Even before applying, agencies devote  significant dollars to make their services and practices compliant with  COA eligibility standards. This process can entail reforming personnel  policies, hiring more staff, or upgrading communication and data systems.  Furthermore, the costs associated with 4-year accreditation can range  from $5,700 to more than $500,000, depending on an agency\u2019s annual  budget. Once accredited, filling vacancies to maintain rigorous caseload  standards, for example, becomes a constant and expensive demand on  agencies\u2019 resources. According to an HHS Inspector General report on the  topic, while many agencies that receive accreditation may be performing  well already, accreditation status does not guarantee high-quality service.  Caseworkers in Illinois and Kentucky also mentioned this, telling us that  they continue to cut corners by limiting home visits or falling behind on  their documentation in order to manage both the volume and the  complexity of their caseloads. Furthermore, some agencies\u2019 staffing  shortages are so severe that implementing COA\u2019s educational  requirements might further restrict the pool of qualified applicants.
