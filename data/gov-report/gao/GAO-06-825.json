The U.S. government has not yet established an effective mechanism for estimating the number of victims or for conducting ongoing analysis of trafficking related data that resides within government entities. While federal agencies have undertaken antitrafficking activities, the U.S. government has not developed a coordinated strategy for combating trafficking abroad or developed a way to gauge results and target its overall assistance. The U.S. government has established coordination mechanisms, but they do not include a systematic way for agencies to clearly delineate roles and responsibilities in relation to each other, identify needs, or leverage activities to achieve greater results. Further, the U.S. government has not established performance measures or conducted evaluations to gauge the overall impact of antitrafficking programs abroad, thus preventing the U.S. government from determining the effectiveness of its efforts or adjusting its assistance to better meet needs. The Department of State assesses foreign governments' compliance with minimum standards to eliminate trafficking in persons; but the explanations for ranking decisions in its annual Trafficking in Persons Report are incomplete, and the report is not used consistently to develop antitrafficking programs. It has increased global awareness, encouraged government action, and raised the risk of sanctions against governments who did not make significant efforts to comply with the standards. However, State does not comprehensively describe compliance with the standards, lessening the report's credibility and usefulness as a diplomatic tool.

In addition to the tremendous personal  damage suffered by individual trafficking victims, this global crime has  broad societal repercussions.

Although their circumstances vary, fraud, force, or  coercion typically distinguishes trafficking victims from people who are  smuggled. Moreover, most trafficking cases follow the same pattern:  people are abducted or recruited in the country of origin, transferred  through transit regions, and then exploited in the destination country.  People may also be trafficked internally, that is, within the borders of their  own country. Trafficking victims include agricultural workers who are  brought into the United States, held in crowded unsanitary conditions,  threatened with violence if they attempt to leave, and kept under constant  surveillance; child camel jockeys in Dubai who are starved to keep their  weight down; Indonesian women who may be drawn to a domestic service  job in another country, are not paid for their work and are without the  resources to return home; child victims of commercial sexual exploitation  in Thailand; and child soldiers in Uganda.", "During the 1990s, the U.S. government began drawing attention to the  problem of human trafficking before various international forums and  gatherings. In 1998, a presidential memorandum called on U.S.  government agencies to combat the problem through prevention of  trafficking, victim assistance and protection, and enforcement. This  approach came to be known as \u201cthe three p\u2019s\u201d\u2014prevention, protection, and  prosecution.", "In 2000, Congress enacted TVPA and reauthorized and amended the act  twice. The act defines victims of severe forms of trafficking as those  persons subject to (1) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is  induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to  perform such acts is under age 18 or (2) the recruitment, harboring,  transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services,  through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, for the purpose of subjection  to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. The TVPA does  not specify movement across international boundaries as a condition of  trafficking; it does not require the transportation of victims from one locale  to another. Under the TVPA, an alien, who is identified as a victim of a  severe form of trafficking in the United States and meets additional  conditions, is eligible for special benefits and services.", "The TVPA, as amended, provides a framework for current U.S.  antitrafficking efforts. It addresses the prevention of trafficking, protection  and assistance for victims of trafficking, and the prosecution and  punishment of traffickers. The TVPA also laid out minimum standards for  eliminating trafficking to be used in the Secretary of State\u2019s annual  assessment of foreign governments\u2019 antitrafficking efforts. It authorized  U.S. foreign assistance for efforts designed to meet these standards and  established sanctions\u2014withholding nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related  assistance\u2014that could be applied against governments of countries not in  compliance with the standards and not making significant efforts to bring  themselves into compliance.", "Responsibility for implementing U.S. government antitrafficking efforts  domestically and abroad is shared by the Departments of State, Justice,  Labor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), and  the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Each agency  addresses one or more of the three prongs of the U.S. antitrafficking  approach. Some agencies have more responsibility for implementing  international trafficking efforts than others. Figure 1 shows agencies and  task forces with responsibilities for antitrafficking efforts.", "The government has also created several coordinating mechanisms for  these antitrafficking efforts, as shown in figure 1. The TVPA directed the  President to establish the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking in Persons, comprised of various agency heads and chaired by  the Secretary of State, to coordinate the implementation of the act, among  other activities. Furthermore, the TVPA authorized the Secretary of State to  create the Department of State\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking  in Persons (Trafficking Office) to provide assistance to the task force.  Subsequently, TVPA 2003 established the Senior Policy Operating Group,  which addresses interagency policy, program, and planning issues  regarding TVPA implementation. The TVPA 2003 directed the Director of  the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to serve as chair  of the group. In addition, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention  Act of 2004, passed in December 2004, established the Human Smuggling  and Trafficking Center to be jointly run by the Departments of State,  Justice and DHS. This center houses several agency data systems to collect  and disseminate information to build a comprehensive picture of certain  transnational issues, including, among other things, human trafficking.", "Since 2001, the U.S. government has obligated approximately $375 million  for international projects to combat trafficking in persons.

The U.S. government and ILO estimate the number of victims  worldwide, IOM collects data on victims it assists in the countries where it  has a presence, and UNODC traces the major international trafficking  routes of the victims. The databases provide information on different  aspects of human trafficking since each organization analyzes the problem  based on its own mandate. For example, IOM looks at trafficking from a  migration and rights point of view and ILO from the point of view of  forced labor.", "Despite the fact that the databases use different methodologies for data  collection and analysis and have various limitations, some common themes  emerge. For example, the largest percentage of estimated victims is  trafficked for sexual exploitation. In addition, women constitute the  majority of estimated victims. However, the estimated percentage of  victims that are children ranges from 13 to 50 percent. Table 2 describes the  victim profiles that emerge from the data.", "Methodological weaknesses and limitations cast doubt on the U.S. estimate  of global trafficking flows. We identified several important limitations:  Estimate not entirely replicable. The U.S. government agency that  prepares the trafficking estimate is part of the intelligence community,  which makes its estimation methodology opaque and inaccessible.  During a trafficking workshop in November 2005, the government  agency provided a one-page overview of its methodology, which allowed  for only a very limited peer review by the workshop participants. In  addition, the U.S. government\u2019s methodology involves interpreting,  classifying, and analyzing data, which was performed by one person  who did not document all of his work. Thus the estimate may not be  replicable, which raises doubts about its reliability.", "Estimate based on unreliable estimates of others. The biggest  methodological challenge in calculating an accurate number of global  trafficking victims is how to transition from reported to unreported  victims. The U.S. government does not directly estimate the number of  unreported victims but relies on the estimates of others, adjusting them  through a complex statistical process. It essentially averages the various  aggregate estimates of reported and unreported trafficking victims  published by NGOs, governments, and international organizations,  estimates that themselves are not reliable or comparable due to  different definitions, methodologies, data sources, and data validation  procedures. Moreover, the methodologies used to develop these  estimates are generally not published and available for professional  scrutiny.", "Internal trafficking data not included. The U.S. government does not  collect data on internal trafficking, which could be a significant problem  in countries such as India, where forced labor is reportedly widespread.  According to the 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report, many nations may  be overlooking internal trafficking or forms of labor trafficking in their  national legislations. In particular, what is often absent is involuntary  servitude, a form of severe trafficking. The report also noted that the  TVPA specifically includes involuntary servitude in the U.S. definition of  severe forms of trafficking. Nonetheless, the U.S. government estimate  does not account for it, because it only collects data on offenses that  cross national borders.", "Estimate not suitable for analysis over time. The U.S. government  methodology provides an estimate of trafficking flows for a 1-year  period and cannot be used to analyze trafficking over time to determine  whether it is increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. Therefore, the  estimate cannot help in targeting resources and evaluating program  effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Data", "paragraphs": ["Methodological weaknesses also raise questions about the accuracy of  trafficking information from international organizations. For example,  UNODC\u2019s methodology attempts to identify global trafficking flows across  international borders. It tracks and totals the number of different source  institutions that have reported a country having a trafficking incident.  However, whether the trafficking incident involved 5 or 500 victims is  irrelevant for UNODC\u2019s methodology. In addition, by classifying countries  in five categories based on the frequency of reporting, UNODC might rank  a country very high as, say, a destination country, due to the country\u2019s  heightened public awareness, transparency and recognition of trafficking  as a serious crime. Alternatively, ILO\u2019s methodology provides a global  estimate of trafficking victims. However, it attempts to overcome the gap  between reported and unreported victims using an extrapolation that is  based on assumptions and observations that have not been rigorously  tested and validated. Moreover, global databases are based on data sources  drawn from reports from a limited number of countries or restricted  geographically to specific countries. For example, IOM\u2019s data only come  from countries where IOM has a presence, which are primarily countries of  origin, and the organization is constrained by issues related to the  confidentiality of victim assistance.  Finally, although the three  organizations are trying to collaborate in the area of data collection and  research, they are having difficulty in mobilizing the necessary resources  for their efforts. Therefore, this fragmentary approach prevents the  development of a comprehensive and accurate view of global trafficking.

Table 3 summarizes the main limitations of  trafficking data, identified in our review of literature on human trafficking.", "The availability of data is limited by several factors. Trafficking victims are  a hidden population because trafficking is a clandestine activity, similar to  illegal migration and labor exploitation. This limits the amount of data  available on victims and makes it difficult to estimate the number of  unreported victims. Trafficking victims are often in a precarious position  and may be unwilling or unable to report to, or seek help from, relevant  authorities. Moreover, HHS reported that victims live daily with inhumane  treatment, physical and mental abuse, and threats to themselves or their  families back home. Victims of human trafficking may fear or distrust the  government and police because they are afraid of being deported or  because they come from countries where law enforcement is corrupt and  feared. In such circumstances, reporting to the police or seeking help  elsewhere requires courage and knowledge of local conditions, which the  victims simply might not have.", "In addition, some governments give low priority to human trafficking  violations and do not systematically collect data on victims. In most  countries where trafficking data are gathered, women and children are  seen as victims of trafficking, and men are predominantly seen as migrant  workers, reflecting a gender bias in existing information. Men are also  perceived as victims of labor exploitation that may not be seen as a crime  but rather as an issue for trade unions and labor regulators. Thus, data  collection and applied research often miss the broader dimensions of  trafficking for labor exploitation. For example, the demand for cheap labor,  domestic service, slavery, and child labor have not been sufficiently  investigated as factors affecting the scale of human trafficking.", "The reliability of existing data is also questionable. In developing countries,  which are usually countries of origin, capacity for data collection and  analysis is often inadequate. In countries of destination, human trafficking  convictions are often based on victim testimony. Moreover, estimates of  trafficking are extrapolated from samples of reported cases, which are not  random. Therefore, it is difficult to determine how representative those  cases are of the general population of all human trafficking victims and  what biases have been introduced.", "Data quality is further constrained by limited data comparability. Countries  and organizations define trafficking differently. A practice that is  considered trafficking in one country may be considered culturally and  historically acceptable in another country. For example, in West African  countries, people, in particular children, commonly move within and  across borders in search of work and are placed in homes as domestic  servants or on farms and plantations as laborers. Due to economic  deprivation and an abundant supply of children from poor families, a child  may be sold by his or her parents based on promises for job training and  good education or may be placed with a creditor as reimbursement.", "The incompatibility of definitions for data collection is exacerbated by the  intermingling of trafficking, smuggling, and illegal migration in official  statistics. Countries have used different definitions regarding the scope and  means of trafficking; the activities involved, such as recruitment,  harboring, transportation and receipt of victims; the purpose; the need for  movement across borders; and the consent of victims. For example, there  are discrepancies in the collection of data on sex trafficking. Under the  TVPA, participation of children under the age of 18 in commercial sex is a  severe form of trafficking. However, some countries define children as  people under the age of 16 and, according to U.S. government officials, this  difference has implications for how countries collect data on children  engaged in commercial sex.", "Finally, data are often program and institution specific and focus on the  needs of individual agencies. Estimates may be developed for the purpose  of advocacy. For example, some NGOs record all victims based on the first  contact made with them regardless of whether they subsequently meet the  criteria for receiving assistance such as legal counsel, shelter, financial  support, or support during a trial, while others record only those who  receive assistance. Data are also collected for operational purposes within  criminal justice systems, and individual authorities use their own  definitions and classifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significant Difference Exists between Numbers of Estimated and Observed Victims", "paragraphs": ["There is significant discrepancy between the number of estimated victims  and the number of observed victims, which include officially reported,  certified, registered and assisted victims. For example, the U.S.  government estimated that the number of people trafficked into the United  States ranged from 14,500 to 17,500 in 2003. Despite concerted U.S.  government efforts to locate and protect victims, the government certified  fewer than 900 victims in the United States during the 4 \u00bd years between  March 2001 and September 2005. The June 2006 Attorney General's  Annual Report to Congress on U.S. Government Activities to Combat  Trafficking in Persons for Fiscal Year 2005 indicates that the 14,500 to  17,500 figure may be overstated because it was an early attempt to quantify  a hidden problem. The number of certified victims may not reflect the total  number of victims identified. For example, some alien victims need not  seek certification because they can remain in the United States through  family connections. The Justice Department indicates that further research  is under way to determine a more accurate figure based on more advanced  methodologies and a more complete understanding of the nature of  trafficking. Similarly, the U.S. government estimated that a total of 600,000  to 800,000 people were trafficked across transnational borders worldwide  annually. Yet, since 1999, fewer than 8,000 victims in 26 countries have  received IOM assistance.", "Organizations may also publish estimates that incorrectly characterize the  data reported by others. For example, in a 2001 report a Cambodian  nongovernmental organization states that there were 80,000 to 100,000  trafficked women and children nationwide. However, this statement is  based on a report which discusses 80,000 to 100,000 sex workers in the  country, who may or may not be trafficking victims. Moreover, the latter  report uses two other sources that did not corroborate this estimate.", "Several factors could explain the differences between the numbers of  observed and estimated victims, but it is unclear the extent to which any  single factor accounts for the differences. For example, the 2005  Trafficking in Persons Report cited cases in which victims reported by law  enforcement were deported before they reached an assistance agency. In  addition, agencies may not make sufficient efforts in identifying and  helping victims or may have constraints imposed by certain assistance  requirements. Victims assisted by IOM missions are those willing to go  back to their country of origin. However, if there are other opportunities  available in the country of destination, such as receiving a residence  permit, victims may not be willing to accept IOM assistance. In the United  States, one requirement of receiving official certification is that victims of  human trafficking must be willing to assist with the investigation and  prosecution of trafficking cases. According to an HHS official, this  requirement may work to limit the number of recorded victims. Given the  weaknesses in data and methods, it also cannot be dismissed that the  estimates may overstate the magnitude of human trafficking."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Trafficking Data Collection in the United States Is Fragmented While IOM\u2019s Is Systematic", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has not yet established an effective mechanism for  estimating the number of victims or for conducting ongoing analysis of  trafficking related data that resides within various government agencies.

Since 2005, the U.S. government  has funded a project to develop a transparent methodology for estimating  the number of men, women, and children trafficked into the United States  for purposes of sex or labor trafficking.

The Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center  collects trafficking information from U.S government agencies and sends  this information to other agencies that have an interest in it for law  enforcement purposes. Center officials stated that they receive and collate  trafficking information from federal government agencies. However,  officials stated that they do not systematically analyze the trafficking  information they receive and lack the human and financial resources to do  so. In addition, we identified eight entities within the federal government  that possess some information related to domestic and international  trafficking. The Justice Department alone has four different offices that  possess domestic trafficking information. None of the federal agencies  systematically shares their international data with the others, and no  agency analyzes the existing data to help inform international program and  resource allocation decisions. (See app. III for information on the type of  trafficking data available within agencies.)", "Furthermore, based upon our analysis of agency data sets, we found that  federal agencies do not have data collection programs that could share  information or include common data fields. As a result, it is difficult to use  existing agency trafficking data to compile a profile of trafficking victims.  In previous work, we have reported that it is good practice for agencies to  establish compatible policies, procedures, standards, and data systems to  enable them to operate across agency boundaries. Although some  information exists, agencies were unable to provide an account of the age,  gender, type of exploitation suffered, and origin and destination of  trafficking victims into the United States. Moreover, some agencies with  law enforcement missions were generally unwilling to share demographic  trafficking data with us and would release statistics for law enforcement  purposes only. The U.S. National Central Bureau was able to extract limited  profile information from its case management system.", "While the information on trafficking victims collected by U.S. agencies is  fragmented, the database created by IOM allows for the development of a  useful, in-depth profile of traffickers and their victims across 26 countries.  Although IOM\u2019s data are limited to countries where IOM provides direct  assistance to trafficking victims, has a short history of about 7 years, and  may not be easily generalizable, it is the only one of the four databases that  contains data directly obtained from victims.

Moreover, the database tracks victims from the time they first requested  IOM assistance, through their receipt of assistance, to their subsequent  return home. Importantly, it also tracks whether victims were subsequently  retrafficked. These factors provide information that could assist U.S.  efforts to compile better data on trafficking victims.", "As shown in figure 2, the victims IOM assisted often were enticed by  traffickers\u2019 promise of a job, most believed they would be working in  various legitimate professions, and were subjected to physical violence.", "In addition, based on cases with available data on the duration of the  trafficking episode, the average duration of stay in the destination country  before seeking help from IOM is more than 2 years.  Most of the sexual  exploitation victims worked 7 days a week and retained a small fraction of  their earnings. Moreover, about 54 percent of the victims paid a debt to the  recruiter, transporter and/or other exploiters, and about 52 percent knew  they were sold to other traffickers at some stage of the trafficking process.", "The database also contains information about the recruiters\u2019 and  traffickers\u2019 networks, nationality, and relationship to victims. It thus  provides insights into the traffickers and the mechanisms traffickers used  to identify and manipulate their victims. For example, in 77 percent of the  cases, contact with the recruiter was initiated based on a personal  relationship. Moreover, the correlation between the nationality of the  recruiter and that of the victim was very high (0.92). Trafficking networks  may have a complex organization, with the recruiter being only one part of  the whole system. The organization may involve investors, transporters,  corrupt public officials, informers, guides, debt collectors, and money  launderers.

Although the project-level  documentation that we reviewed from agencies, such as USAID and the  Department of Labor, included measures to track activities on specific  projects, officials stated that USAID\u2019s agency-level aggregate indicators are  intended as a way of communicating agency outputs, not as a means of  evaluating the effectiveness of programs. In addition, according to the 2005  State Department Inspector General report, State\u2019s Trafficking Office needs  to better identify relevant, objective, and clear performance indicators to  compare progress in combating trafficking from year to year.  Officials  from State\u2019s Trafficking Office recognized the need to establish  mechanisms to evaluate grant effectiveness. However, officials stated that  the office lacks the personnel to monitor and evaluate programs in the field  and that it relies on U.S. embassy personnel to assist in project monitoring.   In early 2006, the Trafficking Office adopted a monitoring and evaluation  tool to assist embassy personnel in monitoring its antitrafficking programs,  but it is too soon to assess its impact.", "Our review of the Department of State documentation and discussions with  agency officials found little evidence of the impact of various  antitrafficking efforts. For example, the 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report  asserts that legalized or tolerated prostitution nearly always increases the  number of women and children trafficked into commercial sex slavery, but  does not cite any supporting evidence. However, apart from a 2005  European Parliament sponsored study on the link between national  legislation on prostitution and the trafficking of women and children, we  found few studies that comprehensively addressed this issue. In addition,  the State Inspector General report noted that some embassies and  academics questioned the credentials of the organizations and findings of  the research that the Trafficking Office funded. The Inspector General  recommended that the Trafficking Office submit research proposals and  reports to a rigorous peer review to improve oversight of research efforts.  In addition, according to agency officials in Washington, D.C. and in the  field, there is little or no evidence to indicate the extent to which different  types of efforts\u2014such as prosecuting traffickers, abolishing prostitution,  increasing viable economic opportunities, or sheltering and reintegrating  victims\u2014impact the level of trafficking or the extent to which rescued  victims are being retrafficked."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department of State\u2019s Annual Report Ranks Foreign Governments\u2019 Antitrafficking Efforts but Has Limited Credibility and Does Not Consistently Influence Antitrafficking Programs", "paragraphs": ["As required by the TVPA, the Department of State issues an annual report  that analyzes and ranks foreign governments\u2019 compliance with minimum  standards to eliminate trafficking in persons.

These standards reflect the U.S.  government\u2019s antitrafficking strategy of prosecuting traffickers, protecting  victims, and preventing trafficking. The first three standards deal with  countries\u2019 efforts to prohibit severe forms of trafficking and prescribe  penalties for trafficking crimes, while the fourth standard relates to  government efforts to eliminate trafficking. The TVPA instructed the  Secretary of State to place countries that are origin, transit, or destination  countries for a significant number of victims of severe forms of trafficking  in one of three tiers.

It highlighted weaknesses in Japan\u2019s law enforcement efforts.  For example, the lack of scrutiny of Japan\u2019s entertainer visas reportedly  allowed traffickers to use them to bring victims into the country.

Since 2001,  State has used a threshold of 100 victims to determine whether or not to  include a country in the Trafficking in Persons Report. However, as  discussed earlier in this report, reliable estimates of the number of  trafficking victims are generally not available. For example, according to  State officials, one country was included in the report because a junior  political officer stated that at least 300 trafficking victims were in the  country and that the government\u2019s efforts to combat trafficking should be  assessed. According to these officials, this statement was based on the  political officer\u2019s informal survey of brothels in that country. Since then,  other embassy officials, including the ambassador, have argued that the  country does not have a significant number of victims, but it continues to  appear in the report. In addition, State officials cited Estonia as a country  that was included in the report based on an IOM official\u2019s informal estimate  of more than 100 victims. State officials said that a subsequent  embassy-funded study of trafficking in Estonia found that the country had  around 100 confirmed victims in a 4-year period, but internal discussions  have not led to the removal of Estonia from the Trafficking in Persons  Report.

For example, the country narratives for Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and  Singapore described cases in which human smugglers abandoned people,  domestic workers were abused by their employers, and foreign women  engaged in prostitution. The narratives either did not clearly establish  whether the situation involved victims of severe forms of trafficking or  failed to provide enough information about the magnitude of the problem  to convey the sense that the number of victims had reached 100 people.  According to State officials, inclusion of human rights abuses or labor  issues in the description of foreign countries\u2019 human trafficking problem  can damage the report\u2019s credibility with foreign governments.

This standard requires that prescribed penalties for severe forms  of trafficking be sufficiently stringent to deter such trafficking and that they  reflect the heinous nature of the offense. The Trafficking Office has not  defined a threshold for what constitutes \u201csufficiently stringent\u201d  punishment.

Furthermore, the narrative also discussed the French  government\u2019s failure to comply with the criterion on protecting trafficking  victims, one of the key objectives of U.S. antitrafficking legislation. The  narrative discusses a French law, which harmed trafficking victims by  arresting, jailing, and fining them. Senior officials at the Trafficking Office  are concerned about France\u2019s lack of compliance with the victim  protection criterion. The narrative, however, did not balance the discussion  of these deficiencies by explaining how the government\u2019s compliance with  the other core criteria allowed it to meet the fourth minimum standard and  thus be placed in tier 1.", "Similarly, the country narratives for two tier 1 countries stated that the  governments were not taking steps to combat official corruption, which the  2004 report highlights as a major impediment to antitrafficking efforts.

With this  probability sample, each narrative in the 2005 report had a nonzero  probability of being included and that probability could be computed for  any member. Each sample element was subsequently weighted in the  analysis to account statistically for all the narratives in the 2005 report,  including those not selected. Because we followed a probability procedure  based on a random selection of tier 2 countries, our sample is only one of a  large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence  interval (e.g., plus or minus 5 percentage points). This is the interval that  would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we  could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the  intervals in this report will include the true values in the study population.  All percentage estimates from the narrative review have margins of error of  plus or minus 7 percentage points or less, unless otherwise noted.", "In addition, we systematically compared the country narratives describing  these governments\u2019 antitrafficking efforts with the minimum standards and  five core criteria in the legislation and determined whether or not the  country narrative mentioned each standard or criteria. If the country  narrative did not mention a standard or criteria, we coded that as \u201cnot  mentioned.\u201d If the country narrative did mention a standard or criteria, we  determined whether the narrative showed that the government complied or  did not comply with the standard or criteria. If we determined that the  narrative showed that the government complied with the standard or  criteria, we coded that as \u201cyes.\u201d If we determined that the narrative showed  that the government did not comply with the standard or criteria, we coded  that as \u201cno.\u201d In some cases, the narrative mentioned a standard or criteria,  but we could not determine conclusively whether or not the narrative  demonstrated the government\u2019s compliance. We coded those cases as \u201cnot  clear.\u201d Finally, elements of some criteria were not applicable to certain  countries. For example, if the report described a country as a source of  trafficking victims rather than as a destination for victims, the criterion  regarding provision of victims with legal alternatives to deportation would  not apply. We coded these cases as \u201cnot applicable.\u201d We then tallied the  number of responses in each category.", "Finally, to ensure analytical validity and reliability, our analysis involved  multiple phases of checking and review of analytical procedures,  categories, and results. Two GAO analysts reviewed a selection of country  narratives, independently coded them, and agreed on the basis for the  coding decisions. Next, one GAO analyst performed the coding for the  remaining country narratives. A second GAO analyst reviewed a number of  these coding decisions and both analysts discussed them. Finally, a third  GAO analyst performed a review of all coding decisions and tabulations. In  addition, to ensure the reliability of the funding data used, we reviewed the  information collected by the State Department on each agency\u2019s funding  obligations. We then checked with each individual agency to verify that the  amounts State reported were correct.", "We conducted our review from September 2005 to May 2006 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodologies Used by Four Organizations to Collect Data on Human Trafficking", "paragraphs": ["This appendix describes the data sources, data validation, methodology,  and key assumptions used by the U.S. government, ILO, UNODC, and IOM  to collect data on and/or estimate the extent of human trafficking as well as  the limitations of these databases.

State agreed that more research would help in the fight against human  trafficking. State said that its Trafficking in Persons office (G/TIP)  continues to pursue better estimates of the scope of trafficking; that the  Senior Policy Operating Group (the Group) has established a  subcommittee on trafficking research to, among other things, ensure  regular interagency communication on research and close the most  important data gaps; that G/TIP plans to set aside a substantial portion  of its program budget for trafficking research; and that G/TIP funds  IOM\u2019s database.  We recognize two ongoing projects to develop better  estimates of trafficking and note that it is too early to assess the results  of these projects. The Group subcommittee began meeting within the  past year and, at the time of our review, had not established research  priorities.  During our review, G/TIP staff expressed concern about the  limited amount of funding available for research, including continued  funding for IOM\u2019s database, which G/TIP partially funds.   2. State said that a better global estimate of the number of trafficking  victims should not be the primary focus of additional research  initiatives.  State said a more valuable approach would be information  on the comparative severity of trafficking in particular regions,  countries, or localities; on the methods used by traffickers; and the  effectiveness of antitrafficking programs.  We believe our  recommendation is consistent with State\u2019s comments.  We agree that  additional research on these areas is valuable as discussed in the  report.  We report that reliable and comparable country data do not  exist.  We also report that U.S. agencies collect information on  traffickers and their victims but do not share their information or  analyze the information to identify trends and compile a profile of  victims.  We also describe the value of IOM\u2019s database in providing  information on traffickers\u2019 routes and nationalities and the mechanisms  they use to identify and manipulate their victims.  We also agree that  more information on the effectiveness of antitrafficking programs is  needed, and we note that little or no evidence is currently available to  indicate the extent to which different types of efforts impact the level  of trafficking.  Our recommendation calls upon the Secretary of State,  in her capacity as Chair of the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and  Combat Trafficking in Persons, to consider assigning a trafficking data  and research unit but does not call for setting up a new unit as State\u2019s  comments suggest. 3. State agreed with the need for better performance measures, said that  the Group is looking at how to reconcile the different agency grants  processes so as to achieve an earlier exchange of information, and said  that State will address enhanced interagency coordination in its  upcoming G/TIP office strategy.  State said that roles and  responsibilities of government agencies in combating trafficking in  persons have been established.  We have clarified our recommendation  to state that agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities should be delineated in  relation to each other, consistent with our report findings.  State also  said that the Group creates an active forum where interagency  representatives work together to identify strengths and weaknesses of  of the Group\u2019s the U.S. approach to combat trafficking in real time.   State also said that the Attorney General\u2019s annual report and several of  the Group\u2019s subcommittees focus on improving efforts to combat  trafficking in persons.  We reported findings from the Attorney  General\u2019s report.  We also reported that the Group, through the work of  its various subcommittees, served as a forum for agency officials to  discuss trafficking policy and programs.  However, based on  information from the other Group members, we believe that our report  remains accurate in also stating that the Group has not developed or  implemented a systematic way for agencies to identify priorities and  target efforts abroad to complement each others\u2019 activities to achieve  greater results than if the agencies were acting alone.  4. The Department of State agrees with our finding that its annual  Trafficking in Persons Report could provide more comprehensive and  clearer explanations for the tier ranking decisions. The Department of  State said that the 2006 report offers a greater and more consistent  examination of the minimum standards as they apply to each country.   We conducted a selective review of 26 tier 1 country narratives in the  2006 report and found that many of the concerns we cited in our report  remain.  For example, none of the tier 1 country narratives clearly  explained how the government complied with the second minimum  standard established in the TVPA, which, among other things, calls for  governments to prescribe punishment for sex trafficking involving  force, fraud, or coercion that is commensurate with that for grave  crimes such as forcible sexual assault.  Also, as in the 2005 report, our  review found that some tier 1 country narratives in the 2006 report  described governments\u2019 failure to comply with certain core criteria, but  the narratives did not explain how the governments\u2019 success in meeting  the other core criteria outweighed these deficiencies and justified their  placement in tier 1.  We acknowledge in our report that the Department  of State is not legislatively mandated to include country narratives in  the annual Trafficking in Persons Report.  However, the 2006  Trafficking in Persons Report and reports from previous years  characterize the country narratives as \u201can assessment of the  government\u2019s compliance with the minimum standards \u2026 as laid out in  the TVPA of 2000, as amended.\u201d  According to the report, the narratives  are also intended to explain the basis for the tier ranking decisions.  5. State said that under G/TIP\u2019s current guidelines to keep narratives  short, readable, and focused on deficiencies, the Trafficking in  Persons Report does not provide (and the law does not require) an  exhaustive examination of compliance with all of the minimum  standards\u2019 criteria. According to State, such an approach would create  lengthy country narratives that would lose their readability,  effectiveness, and policy relevance and would significantly increase the  size of the report.  As described in our report, we did not assess  whether the 2005 report\u2019s country narratives considered all 10 criteria  for the fourth minimum standard, and we do not criticize the  Department of State for failing to provide an exhaustive examination of  governments\u2019 compliance with all 10 of these criteria.  Instead, our  analysis focused on the four minimum standards required by the TVPA;  and for the fourth standard, we looked only at whether the narratives  explained governments\u2019 compliance with the five core criteria  identified by the Trafficking Office.  We believe these issues can be  discussed while maintaining a concise reporting format.  6. State said the TVPA requires the Trafficking in Persons Report to  include countries with a \u201csignificant number of victims of severe forms  of trafficking.\u201d  As a matter of policy the minimum \u201csignificant number  of victims\u201d has been defined as 100. As discussed in our report, our  interviews with State officials as well as our review of the 2005 report\u2019s  country narratives indicated that some countries\u2019 inclusion in the  report was questionable.  State acknowledges that many countries have  not analyzed their crime statistics through the prism of trafficking in  persons, making the available data unreliable.   7. State said the law does not clearly define what constitutes a sufficient  sentence to deter, or that adequately reflects the heinous nature of the  offense. The department has defined \u201csufficiently stringent\u201d  punishment to mean time in jail, preferably at least several years in jail.", "We recognize the subjectivity of the third minimum standard in our  report.  Even though some narratives indicate that countries prescribe  jail time, State\u2019s report does not explicitly state the department\u2019s  definition that sufficiently stringent means some jail time nor did some  of the narratives state that the punishment was sufficiently stringent.   Thus, it is unclear how the government complied with this minimum  standard."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Cheryl Goodman, Assistant Director; Suzanne Dove; Christina Werth;  Gergana Danailova-Trainor; Bruce Kutnick; Barbara Stolz; and Patrick  Dickriede made key contributions to this report.
