Growth over the past few decades brought innovations to improve flight safety that contributed to a dramatic lowering of the accident rate by the mid-1970s. Further reductions in the accident rate have, however, remained elusive. Unless the current accident rate can be reduced, the number of fatal accidents is likely to increase as aviation operations continue to grow. During the 1990s, FAA, the aviation industry, and the Congress all acknowledged and studied this potential danger. They set ambitious targets for reducing the accident rate, made over a thousand recommendations for improving aviation safety, and implemented a number of safety initiatives. In spite of these efforts, the accident rate, which is already low, has remained fairly steady. The FAA Administrator, White House and congressional task forces, and aviation industry groups have concluded that FAA and the aviation industry must coordinate their efforts to prioritize safety recommendations and focus resources on those with the most potential to decrease the accident rate. In 1998, the FAA Administrator announced the Safer Skies initiative, a joint government- industry effort to identify and address the greatest threats to aviation safety in order to reduce the fatal accident rate by 80 percent by the year 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA Expects Continued Growth in Aviation", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several decades, aviation has grown substantially in the United States, and FAA expects this growth to continue into the next century. Commercial aviation has grown consistently since 1982, while growth in general aviation has been less consistent. One key measure of aviation activity shows that the number of flight hours for commercial aircraft more than doubled from 8 million hours in 1982 to nearly 18 million hours in 1999. In contrast, general aviation activity dropped fairly steadily from the early 1980s until 1995. While general aviation has grown since 1995, it has not yet returned to 1990 levels. The number of general aviation flight hours decreased by nearly 9 percent from 32.6 million hours in 1982 to 29.9 million hours in 1999. (See fig. 1.)", "FAA has forecast continued growth for commercial aviation as well as for general aviation into the next century. The number of planes will increase, and these aircraft will fly more miles, spend more hours in the air, and carry more people. For example, FAA estimates that commercial aviation flight hours will grow to 24 million hours in 2007\u2014an increase of 37 percent from 1999. In commercial aviation, FAA projects that the use of large air carriers will grow at an annual rate of 4 percent, while the use of commuter air carriers will grow at 3 percent per year. Although growth has been more erratic in general aviation than in commercial aviation, FAA projects an annual growth rate of 2.2 percent for general aviation into the next century.

Table 2 shows the distribution of accidents and deaths for commercial aviation, which includes large and commuter air carriers, and general aviation, which includes on-demand air taxis. General aviation accounted for the largest number of fatal accidents and deaths in 1988-97. The initiative addresses both commercial and general aviation, but increased attention is focused on further improving the safety of commercial aviation because large and commuter air carriers are the primary forms of air transportation for most Americans. While fatal commercial aviation accidents are rare, large airplane accidents can cause more deaths in an instant than most events, other than wars or natural disasters. They consequently raise concerns with both the public and the media, and commercial aviation is held to a higher standard of safety than other forms of transportation. With commercial aviation expected to grow steadily into the next century, aviation accidents will occur with a frequency that will be unacceptable to the public unless steps are taken to decrease the fatal accident rate. While such accidents remain rare, FAA recognizes that the public demands a high standard of safety and expects continued improvement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Fatal Accident Rates Are Calculated", "paragraphs": ["FAA tracks the number of passenger fatalities for various types of aviation operations and calculates accident rates. Basically, the rates are calculated by dividing the number of accidents with one or more fatalities by one of the various measures of aviation activity. For example, the fatal accident rate for commercial aviation for 1988-97 is 0.058 per 100,000 flight hours, which was calculated by dividing the number of fatal accidents (85)by the number of flight hours (151 million). This translates into about one fatal accident for every 2 million hours flown. The three activity measures generally used to calculate fatal accident rates are the number of individual flights (referred to as departures), aircraft miles flown, and aircraft hours flown. Each activity measure reflects different exposures to the risks associated with flying. For example, most commercial aviation accidents occur during takeoff or landing, rather than during the cruise phase, which constitutes the largest part of the total mileage and hours flown. For this reason, we believe that departures are usually the best measure of exposure to risk.", "For large and commuter air carriers, all three fatal accident rates are tracked. But for general aviation, the only measure of exposure is the number of flight hours estimated from survey data. Thus, fatal accident rates for commercial aviation (large and commuter air carriers) are generally expressed in terms of the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 departures, while fatal accident rates for general aviation are expressed as the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours as estimated by FAA\u2019s annual survey.General aviation flight hours are not sufficiently reliable for use in calculating a fatal accident rate for general aviation because they are estimated from a voluntary survey, according to FAA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fatal Accident Rates Have Decreased", "paragraphs": ["Over the past few decades, the annual rate of fatal aviation accidents has decreased significantly for both commercial and general aviation. While the accident rates are low, they have shown little improvement recently. For large commercial air carriers, the U.S. accident rate was 26 fatal accidents per million departures in 1959. Following the advent of large jet aircraft in the 1960s, the rate fell to one or fewer fatal accidents per million departures and has remained fairly steady for three decades. The fatal accident rate for commuter aircraft has also fallen over the last several decades. The accident rate for commuter air carriers fell from about 2 fatal accidents per million departures in 1982 to 3 per 10 million departures in 1996. While there were no fatal commuter accidents in 1998, the five fatal accidents in 1999 resulted in a fatal accident rate of nine per million departures. This increase in the fatal accident rate reflects a 1997 narrowing in the definition of commuter air carrier to include only small aircraft with nine or fewer seats.Similarly, the accident rate for general aviation aircraft has dropped since 1960. The fatal accident rate of six per 100,000 flight hours in 1960 fell to less than two by the early 1980s. The fatal accident rate for general aviation continued to decrease fairly steadily through the 1980s, increased slightly in the early 1990s, and has dropped steadily since 1995. In 1999, the fatal accident rate for general aviation was 1.2 fatal accidents per 100,000 flight hours. (See fig. 2.)", "The reductions in the fatal accident rates resulted from a combination of technological advances that improved safety. In commercial aviation, these advances included the replacement of large, piston-engine aircraft with jet aircraft with far more reliable engines, the development of navigational equipment to warn pilots of impending crashes, better ground navigation aids, improved aircraft instrumentation, and increased air traffic radar coverage. Some of these improvements have also benefited smaller commuter and general aviation aircraft. As commuter air carriers switched from small aircraft to sophisticated turboprop aircraft, the accident rate among the larger commuter aircraft became comparable to that of large air carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "If Greater Numbers of Fatalities Are to Be Avoided, the Fatal Accident Rate Must Be Reduced", "paragraphs": ["If the current fatal accident rate holds steady and aviation activity grows as FAA has projected, the increased air traffic will result in greater numbers of crashes and fatalities.

Similarly, the fatal accidents for general aviation will probably mount from an average of 380 in 1996-98 to 484 in 2007.Table 3 shows our projections of the number of fatal accidents in 2007 calculated from FAA\u2019s growth estimates and the current fatal accident rate for each type of aviation operation.", "The prospect of more accidents and deaths is unacceptable to the public, FAA, and the aviation industry. Avoiding that outcome means reducing the fatal accident rate significantly.

Many of the reports that resulted from these efforts set specific goals and included recommendations for decreasing aviation accidents. Although FAA and the aviation industry acted on some of these recommendations, the fatal accident rate has remained fairly stable but low.", "The effectiveness of previous efforts to reduce the fatal accident rate is believed to have been undercut by their limited scope and a lack of coordination between government and industry groups. Many of the studies issued during the 1990s were under the leadership of either FAA or a particular segment of the aviation industry. For example, FAA, on its own, studied controlled flight into terrain (CFIT)accidents and runway incursions. Separately, the Flight Safety Foundation brought together participants from many segments of the aviation industry to study CFIT and approach and landing but initially had only limited FAA involvement. The Aerospace Industries Association initiated an extensive study on the causes of safety-related problems in aircraft engines, including uncontained engine failure.(For a list of key aviation studies and our related reports, see app. II.) According to FAA and industry officials we interviewed, efforts to address specific safety issues were generally unsuccessful when one group failed to coordinate its work with that of other groups that had important roles in aviation safety.", "Many of these reports issued during the 1990s set specific goals for reducing the overall fatal accident rate or for addressing specific aviation safety problems that result most often in fatalities.

In commercial aviation, eliminating the six safety problems to be addressed by the initiative would approach the 80-percent goal. Other FAA initiatives are addressing additional safety problems in commercial aviation, which should complement efforts under the Safer Skies initiative. In general aviation, the initiative will address six problems that appear to be among the most common causes of fatal accidents for this type of operation, according to available accident data. While the initiative has adopted the 80-percent goal in commercial aviation, which transports most passengers who fly in the United States, the initiative adopted a less aggressive goal for general aviation, which accounted for the vast majority of the fatal aviation accidents. The goal in general aviation is to reduce the number of fatal accidents to 350 in 2007, which represents about a 20-percent reduction. Finally, the initiative addressed four problems in cabin safety. Improving cabin safety will have little impact on lowering the fatal accident rate because cabin safety accounted for only two U.S. fatalities in commercial aviation in 1988-97. No quantitative goal was set for safety improvements in cabin safety. To date, safety improvement efforts by FAA and the Safer Skies initiative have focused on past accidents and incidents, which may not be entirely predictive of future ones. Studying growth and technological changes in the aviation industry can help anticipate and prevent the safety problems and accidents that are likely to arise from such changes.

Three of these safety problems were major ones both worldwide and in the United States: pilots\u2019 losing control of their aircraft, pilots\u2019 flying otherwise controllable aircraft into the ground or water (CFIT), and accidents during approach and landing. These three safety problems accounted for 58 of the 85 fatal accidents in U.S. commercial aviation during this period. The commercial aviation teams are examining 34 of these accidents, which involved larger aircraft. The commercial aviation steering committee referred the remaining 24 fatal accidents to the general aviation steering committee for review because they involved small commuter aircraft with nine or fewer seats that operated scheduled commercial service. This was done because (1) the aircraft involved are more similar to general aviation aircraft than to larger commercial aircraft, (2) the types of operating environments and safety problems that caused the accidents more closely resemble those of general aviation than those of commercial aviation, and (3) the interventions to address safety problems in general aviation are more likely to correct these safety problems than interventions designed for large commercial aircraft. We reviewed the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s (NTSB) reports for the 24 small commuter accidents and found that most of the accidents happened in Alaska when pilots flew into mountains after deteriorating weather reduced visibility. On the basis of our review, we concur with the commercial aviation steering committee\u2019s assessment that these accidents more closely resemble general aviation accidents and would likely benefit from the interventions that emerge to address these safety problems in general aviation aircraft.", "The potential for improving safety in these smaller commuter aircraft exists with a number of the interventions proposed by the general aviation teams working on weather and CFIT. It is unclear whether the initiative or FAA has mechanisms in place to ensure that small commuter operators will benefit from the interventions developed. For example, many of the interventions involve providing additional training to pilots on weather conditions and assessing the risk factors associated with each flight. Because the initiative plans to deliver much of this training jointly with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, it is essential that notification about this training also be provided to small commuter operators and pilots who could benefit from this training but may not be members. Although members of several other organizations participate in the general aviation steering committee and study teams,neither the initiative nor FAA has made specific provisions to ensure that such interventions are also directed at small commuter aircraft operators and pilots, as well as at general aviation pilots. Because small commuter accidents accounted for 28 percent of the 85 fatal accidents in commercial aviation in 1988-97, reducing the fatal accident rate by 80 percent depends on addressing these safety problems in small commuter aircraft, as well as in large commercial aircraft.", "To further reduce the fatal accident rate for commercial aviation, the initiative will address three additional safety problems that have resulted in fewer fatal accidents in the United States from 1988 through 1997. The steering committee chose runway incursions, uncontained engine failure, and weather, each of which resulted in from two to four fatal accidents. These three safety problems accounted for an additional 9 accidents, or 11 percent of the 85 fatal accidents. The committee selected these problems because they caused past fatal accidents or serious incidents that could have cost many lives. These areas were also included because each occurred with greater frequency in the United States than worldwide and because FAA or the aviation industry had already begun work on these safety problems. (See fig. 3.)", "Our analysis of aviation data and review of safety reports confirmed that the initiative is addressing three major safety problems that caused fatal accidents in commercial aviation, as well three other safety problems that have the potential to cause accidents with large numbers of fatalities. Reducing or eliminating safety problems resulting from CFIT, loss of control, approach and landing, runway incursions, weather, and uncontained engine failure should help lower the fatal accident rate. Safer Skies participants, FAA officials, and industry aviation experts whom we interviewed also believe that the initiative is addressing the most important aviation safety problems. Most of these aviation experts indicated strong support for addressing such major safety concerns as CFIT, approach and landing, and loss of control. Furthermore, because of the increasingly global nature of commercial aviation, addressing these safety problems means that many of the interventions recommended by the initiative might have applicability worldwide, as well as in the United States. Many aviation experts we interviewed also supported the inclusion of safety problems with fewer fatalities but with a high potential for fatalities, such as runway incursions and uncontained engine failure.

For example, FAA\u2019s Capstone Project focuses on improving general aviation safety in Alaska by providing additional navigational aids but also has potential application for addressing the safety problems of small commuter aircraft used elsewhere. FAA also has ongoing initiatives to address the causes of 4 of the 18 commercial aviation accidents not being addressed by Safer Skies teams.

Most of these accidents occurred near the boarding gate or ramp. For example, several employees were fatally injured when struck by an aircraft\u2019s propeller or nose gear during the course of their work. Of the on-ground fatalities, two resulted from individuals gaining unauthorized access to airport areas that should have been secured, nine involved various airline or airport employees who sustained injuries in the workplace, and one involved a passenger who fell out of an aircraft catering door and onto the ground. Because on-ground accidents accounted for 14 percent of the 85 fatal accidents in commercial aviation in 1988-97, reducing the fatal accident rate by 80 percent by 2007 will be difficult if these safety problems are not addressed.", "FAA has initiatives to address some of the safety problems that caused on- ground fatalities, but it is unclear how systematically these problems are being addressed. Specifically, FAA\u2019s Office of Civil Aviation Security oversees airline and airport programs to limit access to secure areas to authorized individuals. The status of FAA\u2019s efforts to address workplace safety issues that resulted in on-ground fatalities is less clear. FAA is responsible for regulating the safety and health aspects of the work environment of aircraft crew members when the aircraft is in operation. However, FAA has not promulgated specific regulations that address all employee safety and health issues associated with working conditions on aircraft. FAA held a public meeting in December 1999 to gather information on issues associated with working conditions on and around aircraft and to determine whether additional regulations should be proposed. However, FAA does not currently have a group addressing workplace safety issues and could not identify any regulations, guidance, or other initiatives that have been developed to address the types of workplace safety problems that caused most of the on-ground fatalities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Commercial Aviation Safety Involves Considering More Than Reducing the Fatal Accident Rate", "paragraphs": ["Looking at the number of fatalities associated with various safety problems, as well as their contribution to the fatal accident rate, provides additional perspective on Safer Skies\u2019 commercial aviation agenda. Reductions in the fatal accident rate are closely linked to reductions in the number of fatal accidents. Following this logic, the greatest reductions in the fatal accident rate can be achieved by eliminating the safety problems that caused the greatest number of accidents with one or more fatalities. However, strict adherence to the goal of reducing the fatal accident rate could result in focusing attention and resources on the causes of accidents that resulted in single fatalities, rather than on those causes that result in multiple fatalities, as well as multiple accidents. In choosing which safety problems to address, the commercial aviation steering committee selected safety problems that will help reduce fatalities, as well as the fatal accident rate.", "The fatal accident rate in commercial aviation can most quickly be reduced by addressing the three safety problems that form the core of the Safer Skies agenda in commercial aviation: CFIT, loss of control, and approach and landing. These three safety problems accounted for 34 fatal accidents involving larger aircraft that commercial aviation teams are handling and 24 additional small commuter accidents that general aviation teams are handling. (See table 5.) If the initiative is successful in developing and implementing interventions to eliminate these three safety problems for both large aircraft and small commuter aircraft, it would make progress toward preventing the kinds of safety problems that caused 68 percent of the fatal accidents in 1988-97. If the initiative could successfully eliminate all six safety problems on its agenda for commercial aviation, it would approach the goal of an 80-percent reduction in the fatal accident rate. However, other safety problems actually resulted in more fatal accidents and thus could reduce the fatal accident rate more quickly if eliminated.", "The initiative could approach the 80-percent goal more quickly by eliminating on-ground accidents, which caused more fatal accidents in commercial aviation than all other safety problems except loss of control and CFIT. On-ground accidents caused 12 fatal accidents in commercial aviation\u201414 percent of the total. While the safety problems that caused on- ground accidents merit addressing, the safety problems that Safer Skies\u2019 commercial aviation team has chosen to address resulted in multiple fatal accidents and many more fatalities. For this reason, the initiative will probably have more impact on improving the safety of air transportation for the majority of the nation\u2019s passengers than addressing other safety problems, such as on-ground accidents, whose elimination could reduce the fatal accident rate more but would save fewer lives.", "While focusing on reducing the fatal accident rate by addressing the safety problems that caused the most commercial aviation accidents, the approach taken by the initiative also resulted in choices that recognized where the greatest number of fatalities have occurred or could occur. The three major problems addressed by the initiative\u2019s commercial aviation teams (CFIT, loss of control, and approach and landing) accounted for 57 percent of the 1,756 fatalities in 1988-97. This rises to 66 percent when all six safety problems on the commercial aviation agenda are considered. The additional small commuter accidents that are to be addressed by general aviation teams account for another 5 percent of the total fatalities. The only other safety problems that resulted in hundreds of fatalities were sabotage and fuel tank explosions. The initiative did not focus on these problems for two reasons. First, only one fatal accident resulted from each of these safety problems in 1988-97. Second, FAA already has initiatives under way to address both sabotage and fuel tank explosions. The initiative did include two safety problems on its commercial aviation agenda that each accounted for only about 1 percent of the fatalities in U. S. commercial aviation during this period. However, the initiative recognized the potential of runway incursions, which accounted for 25 U.S. fatalities, to result in hundreds of fatalities. While weather resulted in few commercial aviation accidents and 16 fatalities, the commercial aviation steering committee members felt that the problems of turbulence and icing merited attention. In contrast, the 12 on-ground accidents each resulted in a single fatality that together accounted for fewer than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s commercial aviation fatalities. Eliminating the safety problems that caused on-ground fatalities could reduce the fatal accident rate more quickly than eliminating either CFIT or approach and landing accidents that involved large commercial aircraft. The commercial aviation steering committee has selected safety problems that will help reduce fatalities, as well as the fatal accident rate.

The meaning of this goal can be more readily understood by considering the current number of fatal commercial aviation accidents and the number of accidents projected for 2007 if further safety improvements are not undertaken. In 1994-96, the United States averaged six fatal commercial aviation accidents each year. Given the projected growth of commercial aviation, we estimate that this number could increase to nine in 2007 if safety is not improved. If the initiative achieves the goal of an 80-percent reduction in the fatal accident rate for commercial aviation, we estimate that the number of fatal accidents expected in 2007 would drop to two.

The six safety problems chosen were controlled flight into terrain, loss of control, aeronautical decision-making, runway incursions, weather, and survivability. Steering committee members told us that they selected these safety problems after reviewing the available data on general aviation accidents and past industry and government-sponsored safety reports on general aviation. They said that the NTSB accident reports were challenging to analyze because many lacked the detail needed to determine the root causes of accidents. They noted, for example, that most general aviation aircraft are not equipped with such key equipment as flight data recorders that would help identify the safety problems that caused the accidents. To meet these additional challenges, FAA developed a training course tailored to the needs of those responsible for analyzing general aviation accidents. Both FAA and industry members attended this course before starting the analysis phase. The general aviation analysis reports on CFIT and weather also included recommendations to address problems with the quality of the data on general aviation accidents. In response to these recommendations, the general aviation steering committee chartered a team in April 2000 to develop strategies to (1) provide increased detail about factors that have contributed to or caused general aviation accidents and incidents and (2) improve the quality and timeliness of estimates of general aviation activity. Members of the steering committee told us that, in cases where the safety problems that caused the fatal accidents were unclear, they used their experience as either pilots or experts in general aviation to determine the possible causal factors involved in the accidents.", "Members of the steering committee also examined past industry and government reports on the causes of general aviation accidents. One key report was the Nall Report, a report on general aviation accident trends and factors published annually by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association\u2019s Air Safety Foundation. According to the 1998 Nall Report, the major causes of fatal general aviation accidents were weather, loss of control or other errors during flights in which the pilot was maneuvering the plane, and accidents on approach to the airport. Another key report was FAA\u2019s study of the causes of general aviation CFIT accidents.FAA\u2019s study concluded that CFIT accidents accounted for 17 percent of the general aviation fatalities and 32 percent of general aviation accidents in weather conditions requiring pilots to have instrument ratings to fly.", "Steering committee members also told us that several reports indicated growing problems with runway incursions involving general aviation aircraft. For example, a study by DOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General showed that general aviation pilots caused the majority of runway incursions attributable to pilot error in 1990-96.Members of the steering committee told us that they also decided to address survivability in an effort to decrease the number of fatalities among those who survive the impact of a crash but ultimately die from their injuries.", "Although the data available on general aviation accidents are less detailed than those available on commercial aviation accidents, the general aviation problems the initiative plans to address represent reasonable choices. Most of the safety problems chosen have been identified in past safety reports and NTSB accident reports as major causes of fatal accidents in general aviation. These include weather, loss of control, CFIT, and runway incursions. Aeronautical decision-making has also been cited repeatedly as a factor in such safety problems as weather, when pilots exercise judgment about whether to depart or turn back when faced with potential danger. In addition, aeronautical decision-making includes those decisions made relating to aircraft maintenance. Most of the Safer Skies participants, FAA officials, and aviation experts we interviewed concurred that the six general aviation safety problems to be addressed by the initiative are reasonable ones that will help to reduce the fatal accident rate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Safer Skies Initiative Adopted a Goal of Reducing Fatal Accidents in General Aviation to 350 in 2007", "paragraphs": ["Although both the White House and congressional commissions on aviation safety called for an 80-percent reduction in the nation\u2019s fatal accident rate, FAA and the Safer Skies initiative applied this goal only to commercial aviation and adopted a less aggressive accident reduction goal for general aviation. The goal is to reduce the number of fatal general aviation accidents to 350 in 2007. This represents a 20-percent reduction in the number of fatal accidents that would likely result from projected growth in general aviation. Because general aviation accounted for 98 percent of U.S. fatal accidents in 1988-97, the goal of an 80-percent reduction in the nation\u2019s fatal accident rate set forth by the two major aviation commissions is unreachable if these fatal accidents are not greatly reduced. The congressionally mandated commission on aviation safety discussed the fatal accident rates for all kinds of aviation operations, including general aviation. Because this commission did not explicitly apply the 80-percent goal to general aviation, it remains unclear whether it intended the goal to apply to general aviation as well as commercial aviation. The goal adopted\u2014350 fatal accidents\u2014contrasts sharply with the 97 fatal accidents that would likely result if the 80-percent goal were achieved. (See table 6.)", "The steering committee did not adopt the 80-percent goal for general aviation because of strong objections from the general aviation community. Representatives of the general aviation community argued that, given the varied experience levels of its pilots, reducing fatal accidents by 80 percent would be impossible without grounding the fleet. One general aviation representative said that there was a prevailing concern in the general aviation community that any agreement on a solid goal would lead to more regulation and less growth. In addition, these representatives objected to establishing a goal that involved a fatal accident rate. The fatal accident rate for general aviation is calculated by dividing the number of fatal accidents by the number of flight hours. Data on general aviation flight hours are estimated using an annual survey of general aviation operators conducted by FAA. Response to the survey is voluntary. Because the flight hours are estimated on the basis of this survey, representatives of the general aviation community questioned the reliability of these data and expressed concern about using flight hours to calculate past and future fatal accident rates. As a result, the Safer Skies steering committee for general aviation agreed not to use the survey data on flight hours to calculate a fatal accident rate until the data are more reliable. Instead, the accident reduction goal for general aviation was expressed in terms of the number of fatal accidents, rather than the fatal accident rate.", "To set its goal of reducing fatal accidents to 350, the general aviation steering committee reviewed available data on fatal accidents. The steering committee found the number had declined fairly steadily since 1990 in response to past initiatives to improve safety. The data used by the steering committee showed that, in 1996-98, an average of 379 fatal general aviation accidents occurred each year.The steering committee used this average and the 1.6-percent annual growth expected in general aviation to project that 437 accidents would occur in 2007 if additional safety initiatives were not undertaken. They agreed that a reduction to 350 fatal accidents would be achievable. This represents a 20-percent reduction in the number of fatal accidents that they estimated would occur without additional safety initiatives (437). According to projections by the steering committee and the general aviation community, a reduction of this magnitude would prevent 363 accidents from 2000 through 2007.", "The goal of reducing the number of fatal accidents to 350 in 2007 is probably achievable, but this goal is not likely to push the general aviation community toward more safety improvement as aggressively as it could.", "We believe that this goal is achievable for two reasons. First, although the level of general aviation activity has increased, the number of fatal accidents decreased to 354 in 1999, a decrease of 17 percent since 1994. Both FAA and industry officials attributed this decrease in part to ongoing safety initiatives. The goal of 379 accidents established for each of the next 3 years represents a 7-percent growth in the current number of fatal accidents. Second, the goal of 350 accidents set for 2007 is only 4 fewer fatal accidents than occurred last year. Hence, the long-term goal is achievable if the general aviation community is able to hold its number of fatal accidents steady as its air traffic grows by an expected 2.2 percent per year in the coming decade.", "We recognize that an 80-percent reduction in fatal accidents is probably not achievable in general aviation at this time because of the diversity in pilots\u2019 experience levels, aircraft types, and operating environments.

In contrast to the safety problems addressed by the commercial and general aviation steering committees, the safety problems addressed by the cabin safety steering committee have not resulted in numerous fatalities, and few data are available on any injuries that result from these problems. The Safer Skies initiative identified only two fatalities in U.S. commercial aviation in 1988-97 related to cabin safety problems.While passengers and crew have been injured in the cabin environment, few data exist on these incidents because air carriers are not required to report such incidents unless they involve a serious injury or fatality. The study of cabin safety problems thus relies more on information shared by flight attendants and air carriers than on analysis of the limited data available. Because cabin safety resulted in few fatalities and affords few data for analysis, it is arguable whether it was appropriate to include cabin safety issues in an initiative directed at reducing the fatal accident rate through a data-driven analysis of safety problems.", "Although not appropriate for Safer Skies\u2019 focus on the safety problems that caused fatal aviation accidents, cabin safety issues are an appropriate topic for FAA to address jointly with the aviation industry. NTSB and flight crews have raised concerns about the potential for injuries and fatalities in the cabin. FAA and industry were jointly studying cabin safety problems before the initiative was announced. The safety problems under study included those involving child restraint systems, passenger seatbelt use, passenger interference with crew, and carry-on baggage. Concerns about these safety problems are not new. For example, NTSB has long advocated FAA\u2019s requiring the use of child restraints for passengers under the age of 2. NTSB was concerned enough about the use of child restraints to launch a campaign aimed at making parents aware of the benefit of putting children in approved child restraint systems and to declare 1999 as the \u201cyear of child transportation safety.\u201d Similarly, representatives of air carrier crews have expressed concern that the incidents of passengers interfering with crew members are increasing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Work on Future Hazards Could Help Anticipate and Prevent Fatal Accidents", "paragraphs": ["In December 1997, the congressionally mandated commission on aviation safety recommended that FAA and the aviation industry jointly develop a strategic plan to improve aviation safety and that the process \u201cbegin with analysis of both previous and potential failures to meet safety expectations.\u201d These failures include accidents, incidents, insight from flight operational data, and aviation system changes. The analysis of the causes of past accidents provides insights into safety problems that exist within the current aviation system, while the analysis of aviation system changes can help anticipate future hazards that may arise from such changes as growth and technological advances (e.g., vertical takeoff and landing by aircraft). The approaches to the analysis of past safety problems and future hazards are distinct. A data-driven approach is particularly useful for analyzing the safety problems that caused past fatal accidents. Data on nonfatal accidents and incidents can also be used to identify and address safety problems that did not result in fatalities but could have. The data-driven approach is based on the assumption that identifying a problem is possible where historical data are available. While this approach can be used to address the safety problems in the current operating environment, other types of analyses may be more useful for anticipating and preventing the safety problems that could result in new types of fatal accidents. For example, the anticipated growth in air traffic will lead to more congestion around airports, increasing the possibility of runway incursions and midair collisions near airports. Anticipating how changes in the aviation industry may increase existing safety problems or bring about new ones can better position both FAA and the aviation industry to prevent accidents.", "While FAA, Safer Skies, and industry groups have made progress in the analysis of the causes of past accidents and incidents, efforts to analyze and anticipate future hazards are more preliminary. The Joint Safety Strategy Initiative in Europehas formed a work group to develop a method for examining future hazards. A number of FAA staff participate in this work group, which should facilitate the cooperative exchange of ideas and information on this topic. As of April 2000, the Safer Skies initiative had not established a process for analyzing future hazards. A systematic analysis of the changes occurring in the aviation industry could enhance Safer Skies\u2019 ongoing efforts to reduce the fatal accident rate. Several of the aviation experts interviewed suggested that the initiative could benefit from going beyond the analysis of data on past accidents to consider safety problems that may arise from rapid changes in the aviation operating environment. Participants on Safer Skies\u2019 commercial aviation steering committee also indicated that while data-driven approaches are helpful, it is also important to consider future hazards. FAA\u2019s Director of the Aircraft Certification Servicesaid that the initiative\u2019s first priority was to understand and eliminate the safety problems that caused past accidents but that the commercial aviation steering committee also plans to address future hazards and recently added this topic to its agenda for consideration. Because work on future hazards could help anticipate and prevent fatal accidents, this topic is important for the Safer Skies steering committees to address, especially as it applies to commercial aviation.

While the Safer Skies initiative has made significant strides, it has not yet carried out this mandate as fully as it could. The six safety problems that the initiative is addressing accounted for almost 80 percent of the fatal accidents in commercial aviation in 1988-97. Our review showed that the initiative and FAA have work under way to address these and other safety problems in commercial aviation. However, the initiative has not challenged all sectors of the aviation community to push aggressively for safety improvements. Although the initiative has adopted the challenging goal of reducing the fatal accident rate for commercial aviation by 80 percent by 2007, general aviation is not being asked to set a similarly challenging goal. While an 80-percent reduction in fatal accidents is probably not achievable in general aviation at this time, the goal adopted by the initiative does not push the general aviation community toward implementing the kinds of interventions that could substantially lower the fatal accident rate. A more rigorous goal would encourage greater efforts by general aviation operators, manufacturers, associations, and FAA to make needed safety improvements. In addition, many of the interventions developed to improve general aviation safety could also benefit small commuter operators and pilots, but this benefit will not be realized without a systematic way of ensuring that training and other interventions are also directed at small commercial aviation operations. Finally, the Safer Skies initiative and most aviation safety studies to date have focused on the causes of past accidents. While analyses of accident data are useful for determining the causes of past accidents, reducing fatal accidents during a period of rapid growth in aviation will probably require the analysis of the changing aviation environment to anticipate future safety problems.

That process is reasonable and has allowed FAA and industry groups to reach consensus on how to address safety problems identified under the initiative. This process was not used to address cabin safety problems because the cabin safety steering committee had already begun its work before the process was developed.

According to PICS team members, FAA identified these problems before assigning them as tasks to the team in January 1998. Team members discussed such additional issues as in-flight medical emergencies and cabin air quality but settled on the four that were eventually included. Unlike the commercial and general aviation teams, the PICS team limited the possible interventions to ones that did not require that FAA create new regulations, a process that was viewed by some participants as too slow and unlikely to result in consensus among various industry and government participants.

First, the cabin safety problems resulted in only two fatalities in U.S. commercial aviation from 1988 through 1997, both involving passengers not using their seat belts when the aircraft encountered turbulence. In contrast, during the same period of time, there were more than 9,800 fatalities in all commercial and general aviation accidents. Second, air carriers are not required to maintain or submit data on cabin safety incidents unless they involve fatalities or serious injuries.

FAA participants on the Safer Skies commercial aviation steering committee told us that beginning with previously studied safety problems helped team members make progress in developing the team\u2019s two-part process for analyzing data and identifying interventions and become comfortable with the analysis and selection process before moving onto more complex issues that may involve original research and analysis. However, this approach meant that work on another area that is important for reducing the fatal accident rate in commercial aviation did not start work until September 1999\u201417 months after the initiative\u2019s announcement. FAA identified loss of control as the single largest cause of fatal commercial aviation accidents involving U.S. operators.", "To date, the implementation of interventions has concentrated mostly in areas for which analysis and implementation were well under way or complete when the initiative began. The first of the interventions to be implemented addressed uncontained engine failure: FAA issued a series of airworthiness directives requiring enhanced inspections of high-speed rotating parts in certain jet engines.The directives require industry maintenance personnel to perform additional, more detailed inspections to check for cracks and other signs of irregularities whenever an engine is disassembled for overhaul or maintenance. According to staff at FAA\u2019s Engine and Propeller Directorate, these directives affect more than 90 percent of the jet engines that U.S. airlines currently use. FAA and the industry are also taking steps to implement an intervention endorsed by the commercial aviation team examining CFIT. The team has recommended that enhanced navigational equipment be installed on new and existing aircraft to warn pilots of impending crashes. Air carriers began installing the enhanced navigational equipment to prevent CFIT accidents in their aircraft before FAA issued the final rule requiring that the equipment be installed in the commercial fleet. Specifically, air carriers began installing the enhanced navigational equipment to prevent CFIT accidents in their aircraft before FAA issued its final rule in March 2000 and before the commercial aviation team working on CFIT issued its final report in June 2000. This equipment is now being included on some new aircraft, and airlines had equipped about 4,000 aircraft already in service with the new technology by December 31, 1999.", "The timetable for analysis and implementation teams addressing the problems included under the initiative has changed since the initiative was announced in April 1998. According to the chairs of the Safer Skies steering committees, some of these schedule changes occurred because the analysis process took longer than anticipated. In other cases, changes to the analysis approach required rescheduling Safer Skies\u2019 efforts. For example, FAA officials explained that the final report date for the commercial aviation CFIT implementation team was rescheduled after the steering committee decided that combining the CFIT and approach and landing teams for the implementation analysis made sense because of overlap in the interventions they had identified. Several high-priority interventions to address CFIT accidents in commercial aviation were, however, forwarded to the steering committee for final approval and implementation without waiting for the implementation team\u2019s final report. An FAA co-chair of the general aviation steering committee told us that they changed the start dates for several of the general aviation teams because general aviation accidents are more numerous than commercial aviation accidents and analyzing them proved more time-consuming than anticipated. This FAA official also said that some general aviation groups participating in the initiative do not have enough people or resources to serve on multiple teams simultaneously. While we believe that these decisions were justified, they also effectively mean that the interventions to resolve some key safety problems will not be identified or implemented until later than originally anticipated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Experience Indicates That Future Problems Will Require More Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Additional analysis will be needed to identify interventions to address current and future safety problems for which few or no previous studies exist. Safer Skies teams relied initially on a limited number of case study analyses to identify the causes of accidents and incidents, as well as the interventions that could prevent them in the future. The teams compared the results of these case studies with the causes and interventions identified by previous studies to determine whether they are consistent. For example, the team working on CFIT in commercial aviation completed detailed event sequences for 10 accidents and found that the causes identified and the interventions it recommended were similar to those of prior studies. Safer Skies teams working on approach and landing accidents in commercial aviation and weather-related accidents in general aviation also compared the results of their analyses with those of prior studies.", "Along with other changes as the Safer Skies initiative has evolved, this approach has been modified as teams addressed additional safety problems. For example, the runway incursion analysis team expanded its case studies to include incidents because there were so few fatal accidents involving runway incursions. Similarly, the analysis team now working on loss of control in commercial aviation has selected a larger number of case studies because this safety problem has not been the subject of extensive prior analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Implementation Is Critical Next Step in Making Progress Toward the Goals Set for Reducing Fatal Accidents", "paragraphs": ["The Safer Skies initiative has identified the major safety problems to be addressed, has made progress in identifying their root causes, and has developed interventions to address some of them.

Actually resolving these problems has proven difficult in the past and remains very challenging. Similar interventions have been recommended, but the desired reductions in fatal accident rates have not been achieved. For example, extensive prior studies of CFIT and approach and landing accidents in commercial aviation recommended many of the same interventions that are now being implemented by the Safer Skies commercial aviation steering committee. Furthermore, reaching the 80-percent goal in commercial aviation will depend heavily on the successful implementation of interventions to address the safety problems that caused the most fatal accidents: loss of control, CFIT, and approach and landing. To reach the goal in commercial aviation, interventions must be effectively implemented for both small commuter aircraft and large commercial air carriers. Even after safety interventions have been identified, implementing them has proven challenging.", "As DOT\u2019s Inspector General and we have reported previously, FAA does not consistently follow through on implementing safety recommendations. Our review showed that FAA usually agreed with the recommendations on aviation safety made by GAO, NTSB, and DOT\u2019s Inspector General. FAA had implemented 64 percent of the 256 recommendations that we reviewed; however, FAA had not completed actions to implement the remaining 36 percent of the recommendations.We found that FAA sometimes did not establish time frames for implementing the recommendations or did not meet established times for implementing them. Similarly, DOT\u2019s Inspector General found that of the 23 near-term actions FAA planned for addressing runway incursions in its 1998 Action Plan, 15 had not been completed on time.We found that even safety recommendations that received specialized attention, intensive follow-up, and heightened awareness among industry, the Congress, and the public have not been fully implemented. For example, NTSB considered runway incursions so serious that it repeatedly placed this safety problem on its lists of critical safety recommendations in the early 1990s. Although FAA concurred with NTSB\u2019s recommendations, our review found that several of the corrective actions needed had not been implemented, including actions to improve (1) visibility at airports; (2) runway lighting, signage, and surface markings; and (3) radar and related equipment to alert air traffic controllers to impending runway incursions. FAA developed several plans in the 1990s to decrease runway incursions. In spite of these programs, the actual number of runway incursions has increased. DOT\u2019s Inspector General noted in 1999 that the number of runway incursions had increased from 292 in 1997 to 325 in 1998, in part because FAA had not set aside the funds needed to support the initiatives and projects in the runway incursion action plan.As a result, FAA has made limited progress in implementing its plan, and milestones have been missed and extended. DOT\u2019s latest performance report for fiscal year 1999 shows continuing problems in this area. The actual number of runway incursions (321) was 19 percent higher than the goal of 270 established in DOT\u2019s performance plan.", "Industry participants in the Safer Skies initiative have voiced concern that some interventions may not be implemented promptly or at all. Some of the same Safer Skies participants questioned whether enough resources would be available to complete the implementation of the selected interventions. Without assurance of adequate resources, it is likely that the choice of interventions by Safer Skies teams will be constrained by cost considerations and the implementation of recommended interventions will be incomplete.

While moving forward on important safety initiatives makes sense, ensuring their successful implementation depends on effective tracking. Interventions have been implemented in both commercial aviation and cabin safety with no tracking process in place. The general aviation steering committee is moving toward approval of interventions for CFIT and weather but has not yet developed a tracking process.

In addition, the commission directed FAA to report periodically on where initiatives stand, why any delays are occurring, and whether and why changes are being made to the plan. These recommendations are in accordance with sound internal controls for program management.", "The Safer Skies initiative, which was announced in April 1998, implemented a number of interventions without first developing a process for tracking their progress. In some cases, these were interventions that were developed by teams whose work was incorporated into the Safer Skies effort. In commercial aviation, for example, FAA, relying on the work of the uncontained engine failure team, published airworthiness directives beginning in April 1999 to require more extensive inspections of aircraft engines. The commercial aviation team working on CFIT also implemented several interventions in or before September 1999. These included interventions to verify the operational status of radar equipment to provide minimum safe altitude warnings to pilots and to develop a template for standard operating procedures to be used by airlines in training their pilots in techniques to avoid CFIT accidents.", "In September 1999, the commercial aviation steering committee recognized the need for the systematic tracking of interventions and directed a work group to develop a proposal. At the commercial aviation steering committee\u2019s meeting in January 2000, the work group presented its proposal for a Joint Implementation Measurement Team. The team designed the tracking process to provide a high-level report on whether each intervention is being implemented as planned. Specifically, this team\u2019s responsibilities will include tracking whether the implementation of approved interventions complies with the implementation plans and their milestones; helping to predict the potential effectiveness of the proposed interventions; and identifying ways of measuring whether the intervention is achieving the desired risk reduction. The team will also provide a brief explanation of what is causing noncompliance with the plan and whether a solution has been found to resolve the problem. As conceived, the tracking report is to be a high-level progress report that does not intrude on the internal planning of the organizations responsible for carrying out the interventions. The tracking report thus does not provide detailed information on interim and long-term milestones or identify individuals responsible for implementing the plan and preparing progress reports for the tracking committee. Without more detailed information than is currently provided in the proposed tracking report, it may be difficult for the steering committee to assess progress in implementing interventions. For example, the tracking team\u2019s January report notes that FAA has completed a plan for implementing two programs critical to gaining access to safety dataand that other industry and government groups have plans in development. However, the tracking report provides no information about the milestones established by FAA\u2019s plan for establishing these key programs, both of which have experienced delays in the past. After we identified concerns about the tracking system, the commercial aviation steering committee agreed that improvements are needed, and it is working on revisions. A draft version provided for our review in June 2000 still lacked key information about major commitments, deliverables, and milestones.", "Tracking implementation is even more critical for the more complex initiatives whose success depends on coordinated efforts by both FAA and the aviation industry.

The cabin safety steering committee, which completed the development of passenger education materials before it disbanded in January 1999, carried out most of its interventions with no Safer Skies tracking process in place. However, we found that educational materials related to passenger interference with crew had not been distributed or made available on FAA\u2019s Web page as of April 2000. Furthermore, according to a member of the cabin safety steering committee, the distribution of other cabin safety brochures was, in some instances, never completed. The absence of a systematic process for tracking Safer Skies interventions may have contributed to inaccuracies in reporting on the status of cabin safety interventions. Specifically, the DOT FY 2001 Performance Plan and FY 1999 Performance Report states that all initiatives relating to cabin safety were completed as planned. However, planned actions to include material on passenger interference with crew had not been completed as of April 2000.", "Finally, although the general aviation steering committee is reviewing draft implementation team reports that recommend interventions to address CFIT and weather, it has no process in place to track the implementation of interventions once they are approved.

Without coordinated, detailed implementation plans that assign responsibilities, FAA and the Safer Skies steering committees will not be able to ensure that all parties complete their portion of the plan and that implementation occurs on time. In addition, as part of the Safer Skies process, FAA and the general aviation community identified efforts that could be accomplished in the short term or were already under way to address the safety areas to be addressed by the initiative.

We agree that the Safer Skies initiative has taken steps to improve its tracking system for commercial aviation and to work toward the development of a similar system for general aviation. However, the revised tracking system provided for our review in June 2000 did not clearly identify and include time frames for major commitments and deliverables for each of the interventions approved by the commercial aviation steering committee. We agree that individual FAA and industry organizations responsible for implementing Safer Skies interventions would logically have far more detailed systems for tracking implementation than the steering committees.

The Safer Skies initiative incorporates the idea of establishing performance measures to evaluate progress toward safety goals. As a result, the Safer Skies teams that recommend interventions are tasked with developing the performance measures for those interventions approved by the steering committees.", "For a performance measure to be useful, a baseline must be established against which to measure the effect of the intervention. Good evaluation criteria include (1) definitions of baseline information on the extent of the safety problem over a particular period prior to the implementation of the intervention and (2) timeframes for evaluating changes using the performance measure. Goals and time frames must also be established to determine what the program is expected to achieve and by when.

Fatal aviation accidents occur so infrequently that their usefulness is limited as a measure of the success of Safer Skies\u2019 interventions. This is especially true for commercial aviation, which had a total of 85 fatal accidents in the United States from 1988 through 1997. The fact that a particular type of accident has not occurred for several years does not mean that the underlying safety problem has been successfully addressed. Furthermore, for several reasons it may be difficult or impossible to match a specific implementation plan to a numerical reduction in fatal accidents overall or attributable to a specific safety problem. For example, in general aviation the lack of detail in accident reporting makes it difficult to determine specific accident causes; the lack of pilot profiles makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of pilot training strategies; and it is hard to predict how many aircraft owners will install new safety equipment in the future. Thus, to determine to what extent an intervention is reducing fatal accidents attributed to a specific safety problem, teams will need to develop additional performance measures. The commercial aviation steering committee recognized early on this need to develop interim measures to evaluate the unique effect of individual interventions.", "Even if a team identifies suitable performance measures for a specific safety problem, it may be difficult to determine whether a particular intervention, cluster of interventions, or other outside factors influenced changes in the performance being measured. This is especially true for situations in which teams choose numerous interventions to address a safety problem. While the uncontained engine failure team developed a single primary intervention, the team working on CFIT in commercial aviation has already initiated several interventions and is contemplating dozens more. Similarly, the general aviation team working on weather recommended 17 interventions.

Precursors are events that, although they typically precede a particular type of fatal accident, often occur without culminating in a crash. For example, approach and landing accidents are almost always preceded by unstable approaches to the airport, but many unstable approaches may culminate in a hard or late landing that does not result in injuries or a crash. Performance measures based on precursors have been developed to evaluate initiatives for one of the safety problems the initiative is addressing, uncontained engine failure.

But well-established trend data show that the safety problem occurs much more frequently, resulting not in fatal accidents but in incidents with severe or serious consequences on an average of about 1.5 times a year.The team chose the rate of these incidents as the primary performance measure for its recommended intervention. The team also chose another accident precursor as a second performance measure: the number of cracks detected in engine disks when engines are overhauled.Data analysis identified cracked disks as the primary cause of uncontained engine failure. According to staff at FAA\u2019s Engine and Propeller Directorate, each crack detected during inspections probably avoids an uncontained engine failure that could have had severe or serious consequences.", "Both accident precursors chosen\u2014the rate of uncontained engine failure with severe or serious consequences and the detection of cracks in engine disks\u2014have some of the attributes of a good performance measure. Both can be counted, and reporting mechanisms are in place for collecting the key data needed for both measures. Hence, it will be possible to evaluate whether the more extensive engine inspections lead to the detection of more cracks and fewer instances of uncontained engine failure with severe or serious consequences. However, good performance measures track events that occur often enough between evaluations to show whether progress is being made. Uncontained engine failure with severe or serious consequences occurs from one to three times a year, according to data from 1992-98, while cracks in engine disks are likely to be discovered about once in 25,000 inspections, according to staff at FAA\u2019s Engine and Propeller Directorate. Hence, 2 to 5 years may elapse before the effectiveness of the more extensive engine inspections can be judged. Nonetheless, tracking both measures should provide sufficient data for reasonable interim and final performance measures, and the enhanced inspections provide an opportunity to avert potentially catastrophic accidents.", "The uncontained engine failure team established much of the information needed to use its performance measures to evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced engine inspections. During our review, we worked with FAA staff on the team to develop additional information to provide a more complete context for how that intervention relates to the overall Safer Skies effort and to the fatal accident rate in commercial aviation. We then developed a template for this information that can serve as a model for other Safer Skies implementation teams. (See table 8.) The template displays the data critical for understanding the extent of the safety problem and the baseline for measuring progress in addressing it, including the frequency of the problem\u2019s occurrence in 1988-97 and projections of its occurrence with and without the recommended intervention by 2007, the target year for Safer Skies to achieve an 80-percent reduction in the overall fatal accident rate.

For example, the CFIT team recommended developing criteria for standardizing the marking of wires, towers, and support structures to help decrease the number of CFIT accidents that occur when pilots of low-flying aircraft, such as helicopters and small planes, fly into these obstacles. As one measure of effectiveness, the team chose a decrease in the number of CFIT accidents involving wires or towers. However, the team did not provide any baseline information about the number of past CFIT accidents that involved wires or towers or the types of aircraft involved.

The rest had either no performance measures or performance measures that were not quantified or specific. Some of the interventions for which no performance measures were established involve research that is still ongoing to develop the technology suggested in the intervention. For example, NASA has the lead in developing equipment to sense turbulence and warn flight crews so that they can avoid or reduce the dangers associated with turbulence. Because research on this technology is preliminary, the performance measures are described broadly as reducing fatalities and injuries. It is likely too early to establish performance measures for these interventions. The performance measures included for many other subinterventions were too broad to allow actual evaluation of their effectiveness. The performance measure for most of these was a \u201cdecrease in the number of weather-related accidents.\u201d These performance measures are neither quantified nor linked in any specific way to the interventions, which makes it impossible to determine what portion of the reduction, if any, is attributable to individual interventions or clusters of interventions. Of the performance measures developed, several measure progress in implementing training interventions, rather than the effectiveness of the training in reducing safety threats. For example, one intervention involves training Flight Service Station specialists and supervisors on in-depth weather analysis and interpretation to improve the weather briefings given to general aviation pilots. The associated performance measure involves training all of these FAA staff by 2002, rather than measuring the effectiveness of that training. In other cases, the team did not include a performance measure when one could have been developed. For example, one intervention involves conducting a refresher clinic for flight instructors to update them about current weather information and provide appropriate training materials for them to use with general aviation pilots. No performance goal was specified for this intervention. To measure how well this intervention has been implemented, it is possible to determine the number of flight instructors, to establish a goal for how many attend this training each year, and to have them provide information on how many pilots they subsequently train using the information. To determine whether the intervention is effective, the pilots who receive the training could later be surveyed to determine whether they had used the weather information provided or their safety records could be compared with the records of pilots who did not have the training. The link between accident reduction and such training is more tenuous than the link between crack detection and the prevention of uncontained engine failure, but it is possible to gain at least some information about the effectiveness of the training. Without such feedback, it is difficult to determine whether the training is effective and should be continued.", "Without more specific baseline information on these performance measures prior to the implementation of the interventions and interim and long-term goals for progress, the initiative will not be able to evaluate the impact of these interventions. In responding to our draft report, FAA noted that the implementation teams for CFIT and weather relied on the expertise of team members, following analysis of the root causes of accidents, to determine the probable effectiveness of the interventions. Safer Skies analysis and implementation reports described problems with the quantity, quality, and type of data currently available about general aviation. These problems include shortcomings in the data for the types and numbers of operations and in the level of detail of the actual accident investigations. FAA concluded that the problems with general aviation data make it difficult to measure the effectiveness of individual intervention strategies by the traditional approach of how they affect accident rates. While we acknowledge the need to improve general aviation data, we also believe that such data can provide some indication of the relative frequency and importance of the causes of fatal accidents. Such information is also important for making decisions about which interventions to fund and expedite, considering their potential effectiveness and the number of fatal accidents that their use might prevent. While it may not be possible to develop quantitative performance measures for all interventions proposed by the implementation teams, good performance measures depend on having measurable events, a way to collect data on those events, and an event that occurs with sufficient frequency between evaluations for progress to be measurable. The performance measures for both general aviation weather and CFIT could be improved where possible by identifying and quantifying baseline information, ensuring that a means exists for collecting data on the performance measure, and setting interim and long-term goals against which to measure progress in implementing the intervention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Safer Skies Initiative Did Not Develop a Strategy for Evaluating Cabin Safety Interventions", "paragraphs": ["The Safer Skies cabin safety steering committee completed work on four safety problems and implemented most interventions without developing any strategy for evaluating the interventions.

Because runway incursion incidents are increasing in the United States and have the potential to lead to fatal accidents, FAA\u2019s Performance Plan for FY 2000 has used these incidents to establish a performance measure for a series of safety recommendations designed to reduce accidents caused by runway incursions.

Logistical barriers include (1) the limited information tracked by older flight data recorders still in use and (2) differences in the ways that air carriers have programmed flight data recorders to track key information. Because of these differences, the kinds of data items needed to track unstable approaches are not being captured with enough consistency for this measure to be a good indication of performance throughout commercial aviation.", "Other potential barriers also prevent the use of unstable approaches as a performance measure.

Numerous major aviation safety reports in this decade have advocated a program that would gather and analyze information from flight data recorders about routine flights. FAA has for years promised to establish such a program.However, the inability of FAA, the aviation industry, and other federal agencies to reach consensus on key aspects of this program has delayed its finalization.

The commercial aviation steering committee has documented its process for approving interventions, which involves members\u2019 gaining the approval of their respective organizations for both implementation and funding. This approval comes in two stages. First, steering committee members brief their respective organizations on the general concept of each intervention under consideration and seek preliminary approval of each intervention. Changes and modifications may be suggested by the organizations. For organizations that will be involved in the implementation of an intervention, the preliminary approval also involves a tentative commitment to fund the cost of implementing any interventions for which they are responsible. Once members grant preliminary approval, the steering committee asks the team to draw up detailed implementation plans for each intervention. These implementation plans are then submitted to the steering committee for the next level of approval. Members subsequently seek final approval of these plans from the organizations they represent, including firm resource and funding commitments if appropriate. When participating organizations concur with the detailed implementation plans, the steering committee grants final approval. To date, most of the commercial aviation teams have forwarded a few interventions at a time for final approval by the steering committee, rather than complete lists of interventions to address multiple aspects of complex safety problems, such as CFIT. Thus, when the commercial aviation steering committee has given its final approval for an intervention, members interviewed told us they assumed that the intervention had a high priority and that implementation would take place because the organizations responsible for implementation had already committed both the staff and funding needed.", "In contrast, the general aviation steering committee had not documented its process for approving interventions at the time of our review, although it recently developed draft procedures, according to FAA\u2019s response to our draft report.Furthermore, commitment to provide resources for them is still pending, although some members of both FAA and industry who serve on the steering committee understood that final approval had been given to the interventions chosen to address CFIT and weather. Once these two implementation teams submitted their draft reports to the general aviation steering committee, the steering committee asked members to have their organizations review and comment on each intervention. This process resulted in preliminary approval or disapproval of the concept of each intervention, in some cases after the intervention was modified. Organizations responsible for the implementation of interventions also were expected to give a tentative commitment to fund the cost of their implementation. The steering committee then asked the teams to develop detailed implementation plans for each intervention and to submit those for its final approval. These two teams recommended and developed plans for a total of 17 interventions, many of which involve subinterventions and will require substantial resources either in the form of staff or funding from FAA. Because of the number and potential cost of interventions contained in the two general aviation reports, FAA requested that the general aviation steering committee prioritize the interventions. The general aviation steering committee prioritized the interventions in the letter that transmitted the final CFIT and weather reports to the FAA Administrator in March 2000.

The letter and accompanying reports identified high-priority interventions for immediate implementation. These participants were concerned because FAA was still undecided which interventions would actually be implemented and funded. In contrast, FAA\u2019s informal written comments in response to our draft report state that final approval has not been given to either implementation report and depends on the completion of detailed implementation plans by the FAA offices responsible for carrying out the implementation.

Like the other organizations participating in the initiative, FAA must commit its own resources to the interventions that it is responsible for implementing. In October 1999, FAA formed an executive council to help coordinate the implementation of the agency\u2019s safety agenda, including how to provide funding and staff resources for Safer Skies interventions. The executive council includes the heads of each of FAA\u2019s major program offices, its general counsel, and a regional administrator. The executive council has not yet documented its process for approving and funding interventions, however, and it remains unclear at what point FAA is committing resources to implement Safer Skies interventions.

These differences have resulted in a clear indication of funding for commercial aviation interventions before that steering committee\u2019s final approval is given, while the general aviation steering committee\u2019s final approval was given on a series of weather and CFIT interventions that have yet to be approved and funded by FAA. When proposed Safer Skies interventions are under serious consideration by the steering committees, they are also presented to the executive council for discussion of their possible impact on workload and budget, according to FAA staff who serve as co-chairs of the two steering committees. The executive council provides feedback to the steering committees before interventions are approved. FAA staff serving on Safer Skies committees presented conflicting views, however, of when FAA commits to funding interventions. Several of the FAA staff interviewed said that FAA\u2019s commitment of staffing and funding to commercial aviation interventions occurs before that steering committee gives its final approval to interventions.", "However, the Director of FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service, who serves as co-chair of the commercial aviation steering committee, described the executive council\u2019s role as having more room for interpretation of the intervention and a subsequent determination of whether funding is available. She said that, once the intervention is approved, the executive council again discusses it, determines whether to accept it as stated or to modify it, assigns it to an FAA office for implementation, and determines how it fits in with the office\u2019s existing priorities. The program office then reviews the intervention, can suggest modifications that will achieve the same goal, and determines whether the intervention can be accomplished with existing resources or requires a request for additional funding. She said that the executive council could also request that the steering committee modify or prioritize interventions. For example, she said that FAA agreed to implement the commercial aviation CFIT team\u2019s recommendation to develop precisionlike airport approaches,concluded that the agency\u2019s resources would not permit the completion of approaches for all airports in the time frame envisioned by the intervention, and is now working with the steering committee to identify which airports present the greatest risks and should be completed first. Similarly, she said that the council asked that the general aviation steering committee approve a different way to accomplish one intervention without hiring additional staff and prioritize its list of CFIT and weather interventions according to which ones will have the most impact on improving safety and reducing fatalities. Because the executive council\u2019s role is new and its procedures remain undocumented, confusion persists about when FAA commits its resources to implementing the safety interventions approved by the steering committees. For example, although FAA\u2019s executive safety council had agreed in principle to the highest priority interventions to address general aviation safety problems caused by weather and CFIT, FAA\u2019s response to our draft report indicated that final approval and funding depend on the completion of detailed implementation plans. As a consequence, several Safer Skies participants from FAA and industry, especially those working on general aviation issues, expressed some concern about whether the recommended interventions would be funded or implemented.", "These concerns stem partly from FAA\u2019s past record for implementing safety recommendations. FAA\u2019s budget does not specifically identify and commit resources to implementing Safer Skies interventions. For example, FAA has no funds set aside in its budgets for fiscal years 2000 or 2001 for general aviation interventions. However, FAA\u2019s Deputy Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification said that the agency\u2019s approach to budgeting is to retain flexibility by not identifying specific budget amounts for such efforts as the Safer Skies initiative. While we do not advocate including specific Safer Skies line items in FAA\u2019s budget, the uncertainty about funding and implementation also exists because FAA has either not fully funded or not implemented some safety recommendations in the past. Several industry participants in the initiative specifically mentioned concerns about FAA\u2019s lack of follow through on safety recommendations to decrease the number of runway incursions. Although FAA has received many recommendations for reducing runway incursions, continuing problems in this area have been partially attributable to insufficient funding of the safety plans FAA developed, according to DOT\u2019s Inspector General.Additionally, after initially planning to fund the agency\u2019s new inspection system,FAA has still not provided funding to hire analysts to review inspection data on the nation\u2019s 10 major airlines for possible safety concerns. While FAA has implemented many safety recommendations over the years, concerns still persist about the agency\u2019s ability to fund new safety initiatives. Greater assurance about the implementation of Safer Skies interventions could be provided in two ways. First, as mentioned in chapter 3, stronger mechanisms for tracking the implementation of interventions from all three steering committees need to be established. Second, clarifying FAA\u2019s process for committing resources for implementing interventions would provide greater assurance of their implementation. Both of these steps would improve coordination between FAA and other Safer Skies participants.", "Thus far, the interventions approved by steering committees have not required a major commitment of time and resources by either FAA or industry groups. But future interventions may require substantial resources not included in FAA\u2019s current budget, and choices may have to be made about which interventions to fund. Furthermore, FAA addresses and funds many issues beyond those on the Safer Skies agenda, including security issues and improvements to the air traffic control and airport infrastructure. FAA\u2019s executive council provides a forum for agency managers to discuss and prioritize program and resource needs. However, without clear priorities and a unified aviation safety agenda that also takes such issues into account, FAA will continue to address aviation piecemeal, rather than as an integrated system.

For example, the general aviation weather team considered numerous possible safety interventions and eventually developed a list of 17 that it presented in order of priority. The steering committees have also prioritized interventions. For example, the commercial aviation steering committee has moved quickly on several interventions that the CFIT implementation team considered as having a high priority and potential for effectiveness.

They disagreed with our recommendation that FAA\u2019s executive council should develop a process for reprioritizing interventions if funding is limited. The officials said that such reprioritization falls under the agency\u2019s normal processes for reprogramming funding. However, the role of the executive council is to help coordinate the implementation of the agency\u2019s safety agenda\u2014including how to provide funding and staff resources for Safer Skies interventions. We believe that it would be useful for the executive council to establish some basic criteria and processes for evaluating and comparing the potential impact of existing and emerging safety interventions.
