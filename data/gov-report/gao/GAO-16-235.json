ATF tracks its activities but has not established performance targets for them, without which it is difficult to measure the success of its efforts. Two of the five activities GAO reviewed that established metrics and targets are ongoing and are meeting their goals, while three other activities were completed and met or partially met their goals, according to Department of State (State) and implementer reports. For activities it funds, State requires implementers to include a discussion of key challenges and strategies to address those challenges in quarterly reports.

For example, from 2007 to 2014, there were more than 70,000 homicides  related to criminal violence in Mexico. Similarly, fighting among criminal  organizations over contested trafficking routes in Central America has  fueled violence in Guatemala and Belize, which, according to the United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, had two of the highest homicide rates  in the world in 2012, the last year for which comprehensive data are  available.

We interviewed U.S. officials  and officials from the Organization of American States (OAS) in  Washington, D.C., and U.S. and Mexican officials in Mexico. Additionally,  we conducted interviews with Guatemalan and Belizean officials. We  compiled a list of activities that included combatting firearms trafficking as  at least one goal, but because other activities may also indirectly touch on  firearms trafficking, the list may not be comprehensive. To determine the  extent to which U.S. agencies considered key factors in selecting  capacity-building activities, we analyzed Presidential Policy Directive 23  (PPD 23), a directive on security sector assistance, and identified the key  factors it instructs agencies to consider when planning security sector  activities.

According to data from ATF\u2019s web-based firearms  tracing system, eTrace, the majority of the guns seized and traced in  Mexico\u2014about 70 percent from 2010 through 2014\u2014have origins in the  United States.", "As we also reported in 2009, the Mexican government initiated a new  national security strategy in 2006 to combat the growing power of criminal  organizations and curb their ability to operate with impunity in certain  areas of Mexico. The organizations countered government pressure with  increased violence against law enforcement entities and the  government\u2019s efforts also appeared to result in increasing conflicts among  criminal organizations over lucrative drug trafficking routes. The United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has noted that the Mexican  government\u2019s shift in strategy also affected trafficking routes in Central  America. As it became more hazardous for traffickers to ship drugs,  particularly cocaine, directly to Mexico via air and waterways, an  increasing share of the drug trade began to move overland through  Central America. Those routes entered Mexico through its shared  southern land border with Guatemala and, to a lesser extent, Belize.", "According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, this change  in trafficking patterns resulted in increased competition for territorial  control among local organized crime groups. Over time, Mexican criminal  organizations also increasingly moved south into Central America to gain  control of trafficking routes. As a result, violence increased substantially in  countries throughout Central America. In recent years, the people of  Central America and Mexico have cited violent crime as one of the most  important issues facing their countries. Many of the criminal organizations  involved in the drug trade also traffic firearms across the region.", "Although most of the firearms seized and traced in Mexico transited  across its northern border with the United States, firearms also travel in  both directions across Mexico\u2019s southern border. It is difficult to ascertain  the volume of firearms trafficked across Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala  and Belize; however, according to the Mexican government, firearm  seizure rates in Mexico\u2019s southern border states are low in comparison to  those of northern border states and the rest of the country. According to a  binational assessment conducted by U.S. and Mexican officials, many  Central American countries lack the capability to trace firearms  independently, which makes it difficult to determine the percentage of  weapons seized and traced in Mexico that have an origin in Central  America. Also, according to ATF officials, unlike Mexico, both Guatemala  and Belize allow for the commercial sale and purchase of firearms, so the  availability of legal firearms differs considerably across the three  countries. Guatemala and Belize are much smaller countries than Mexico,  and ATF data on seized and traced firearms indicate that the volume of  firearms seized and traced in these countries is also much smaller than  that in Mexico. For example, from 2010 to 2014, Mexico seized and  traced about 83,000 firearms, while Guatemala seized and traced about  7,000 firearms and Belize seized and traced about 300 firearms.", "A number of U.S. agencies provide capacity-building assistance in the  three countries to help address concerns associated with firearms  trafficking, among other things.", "State: State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement  Affairs (INL) manages most of the funding for the Merida Initiative and  CARSI, the two primary initiatives through which the U.S. government  funds and manages activities to help address the problem of  increasing crime and violence in Mexico and Central America,  respectively.

However, ATF has not established targets  for these activities, such as the number or type of courses it plans to  hold in a year. Doing so could help ATF leverage the existing  feedback it collects, such as requests for longer courses or that ATF  offer a second, more in-depth course on a given topic. Targets could  also help to ensure that ATF is providing enough of the specific types  of courses that it and partner countries determine to be most  important for countering firearms trafficking activities. eTrace support and training (ATF): ATF tracks the number of  seized weapons traced through eTrace in each country, as well as the  number of eTrace training courses conducted. ATF also tracks  referrals that result from traces performed with eTrace. According to  ATF officials, referrals are firearms traces that lead to investigations in  the United States. In the past, ATF and State established targets for  expanding the use of Spanish-language eTrace in Mexico in country- wide strategic planning documents. However, ATF officials noted that  these targets were specific to the years following the rollout of  Spanish eTrace and are no longer used. ATF currently does not have  any targets related to the use of eTrace in Mexico or Central America.  State officials noted that without information against which it can  measure progress, it can be difficult to determine whether the  investment in promoting the use of eTrace in Central America is  worthwhile. ATF officials stated that it can be difficult to set targets for  eTrace referrals because it relies on host country officials inputting  these data. However, this does not preclude it from establishing other  targets related to eTrace, such as targets for expanding or  consistently using eTrace. Tracking data against performance targets  could potentially help ATF and State better understand the value of  these efforts.", "Physical security and stockpile management (State): In 2012, in  response to a weapons pilferage incident, the Department of  Defense\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency reviewed the condition  of Belize\u2019s munitions storage facilities and made a number of  equipment recommendations to bolster security. PM/WRA provided  $300,000 in obligated NADR funds to the U.S. Embassy in Belize to  implement these recommendations. As of September 2015, less than  one-third of the $300,000 award had been expended and not all  recommended equipment had been purchased. PM/WRA officials  stated that they typically require implementers to develop  performance measures and targets but could not provide evidence of  whether targets were developed in this case. Officials stated that  some of the funds were obligated but not expended because staff at  the embassy were unclear about the remaining availability of funds  following the initial procurement in 2012. The embassy developed a  plan for expending the remainder of the funds in summer 2015 to  avoid deobligation of the funds. The plan includes a clear target of  procuring and installing a new storage container at one Belizean  military site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Ongoing Activities Are Meeting Their Goals, and Three Completed Activities Met or Partially Met Their Goals, According to Agency and Implementer Reports", "paragraphs": ["As of the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, agency reports show that  implementing agencies and organizations of the five activities that  established performance targets had met or partially met their targets for  all measures.

The overall objective  of the project is to achieve international accreditation for the PGR  forensic laboratory in five core disciplines, including ballistics. One of  the main goals for the firearms and tool marks component is  compliance with international standards for testing laboratories. As of  December 2015, according to ICITAP officials, ICITAP was preparing  for an accreditation audit and projected that this component would be  in compliance with international standards early in 2016.

The goals of the project included creating a regional study of  firearms marking laws and practices, distributing at least one firearm  marking machine to every participating country, organizing a regional  workshop on firearms marking, and organizing a roundtable on  firearms marking. Guatemala was provided five marking machines\u2014 more than any other country in Central America\u2014and Belize was  provided one machine. According to State officials, Guatemala was  provided more machines because of the high number of weapons in  that country. In June 2014, the OAS reported that it had met all of the  project\u2019s goals.", "Stockpile Destruction (OAS): An OAS-implemented stockpile  destruction program in Guatemala achieved one of its two goals.

By December 2011,  about 269 tons of ammunition had been destroyed, exceeding the  goal. In February 2012, the Guatemalan government announced its  plans to create two new military brigades to counter illegal drug  cartels, shifting the plans of the Ministry of Defense in relation to  stockpile destruction and rendering the second objective unattainable.

According to State officials, an implementer may also communicate  significant challenges to the State official overseeing its activity via  conversations, meetings, and correspondence. For example, in Central  America, agencies meet weekly to discuss program activities, which may  include a discussion of any challenges. As a result, State officials noted  that implementers may not include challenges in quarterly reports if they  have been discussed in another venue. However, challenges and  potential solutions should also be articulated in quarterly reports,  according to State officials.", "We found that implementers\u2019 progress reports on the key counter- firearms trafficking activities we reviewed were inconsistent in identifying  key challenges or presenting strategies to address these challenges. For  example, a quarterly report for the OAS-managed firearms destruction  effort in Guatemala discussed a shift in host government priorities that  resulted in the delay of the destruction of firearms belonging to one  government agency. In response, implementing officials modified their  focus to instead destroy weapons managed by another branch of the  Guatemalan government.

Although State  assessed the firearms and tool marks component of this program as  meeting its targets, it also noted that other components of the program  were below target. However, the quarterly report did not discuss any  challenges or reasons why these components were not on target.  Additionally, a State assessment of the nonintrusive inspection equipment  training effort indicated that the biggest challenge to the program\u2019s  success was securing support from host government agencies to  continue to allow the program\u2019s trainees to train host country officials as a  group and to assess whether Mexican agencies would incorporate the  training into their internal curricula. CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2014 fourth quarter  report mentioned a challenge associated with interagency  communication; however, it did not identify concerns about the host  country integrating the training into its curricula as a challenge.", "According to State officials, agency quarterly reports are important for  understanding the progress of an activity toward meeting its goals. They  noted that including a discussion of challenges in quarterly reports helps  to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are aware of potential issues.  State officials noted that balancing resources across competing priorities  can be difficult and also said they use implementers\u2019 quarterly progress  reports to inform resource allocation decisions. For example, if an activity  is not meeting its goals, State may look to end the program and allocate  resources to a different priority. Alternatively, if an activity is particularly  successful, State may look for opportunities to expand it.
