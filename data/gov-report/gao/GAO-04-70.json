Many taxpayers told us they believed they would have great difficulty filling out their own tax forms because they do not understand their filing requirements. At the same time, some taxpayers are poorly served when paid preparers make mistakes, causing taxpayers to over-or underpay their taxes or pay for services, such as short-term loans called Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs), without understanding their costs and benefits. The evidence available does not allow a precise estimate of the extent of problems caused by paid preparers, but nothing suggests that the percentage of taxpayers affected is large. Nevertheless, even a small percentage of the over 72 million taxpayers who used paid preparers in 2001 translates into millions of taxpayers who are potentially adversely affected. IRS has several offices responsible for taking action against problem paid preparers, including the newly formed Office of Professional Responsibility. These offices sanction preparers for violating standards of conduct; assess monetary penalties for violating tax laws when preparing returns; monitor and, if justified, sanction problem preparers offering electronic filing and RALs; and investigate fraudulent preparer behavior. However, balancing resources devoted to such efforts against those devoted to other IRS priorities is a challenge. In addition to IRS, other federal agencies, state and local governments, and professional organizations have a role in regulating paid preparers. At least two proposals exist to expand IRS's oversight of paid preparers. Consideration of such proposals is complicated by the difficulty of developing reliable estimates of the number of taxpayers affected by problem preparers or the effectiveness of the actions taken against them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Filing a correct tax return can be a daunting task for taxpayers.

Preparers  work for a variety of enterprises including accounting firms, large tax  preparation services, and law firms. Some are self-employed. IRS estimates  that in 1999 there were 1.2 million paid preparers, although the actual  number is unknown because some paid preparers do not sign the returns  they prepare.

These data suggest that paid tax preparers are providing  needed services to taxpayers.", "The results of our taxpayer survey must be interpreted carefully\u2014it is  based on taxpayer perceptions, and taxpayers may not understand the tax  laws well enough to evaluate the performance of their paid preparers. For  example, most of the taxpayers we talked to in-depth said they used a paid  preparer because they found IRS tax forms and documents too  complicated or they were confronting an unusually complicated tax  situation. If taxpayers lack the technical expertise needed to identify  preparer errors, their survey responses may underestimate the extent of  problems caused by paid preparers.", "With that caveat in mind, taxpayers in our nationwide survey said that their  preparers did sufficient probing or took other steps to ensure an accurate  return. We estimate that about 91 percent of taxpayers believe their  preparers had enough information about their personal circumstances to  accurately prepare their tax returns. We also estimate that 88 percent of  taxpayers using paid preparers were asked for supporting documentation.  Most of the preparers we talked to said they ask their clients to provide  documentation to support claimed income, deductions, and credits, such  as W-2 forms from employers or 1099 forms from financial institutions, to  ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information reported on  returns. In addition, paid preparers are required by law to take certain steps  when filling out returns for their clients, including signing the return and  giving their clients copies of the completed returns. We estimate that the  vast majority of taxpayers who used a paid preparer in 2002 were provided  a signed copy of their return, as shown in figure 3.", "Taxpayers choose to use paid preparers for a variety of reasons. As already  noted, many of the taxpayers we interviewed in-depth told us they used a  paid preparer because they did not understand the tax laws. According to  the National Taxpayer Advocate, many taxpayers rely upon the expertise of  a paid preparer to complete their returns since they are faced with a  complex set of tax laws and a multitude of requirements for deductions,  exemptions, and credits. One taxpayer, for example, said she began using a  paid preparer 9 years ago to help her with estate tax issues following the  death of her father because she needed help from a tax professional in  dealing with complicated estate tax issues. Other taxpayers said they  lacked the time or patience to complete their returns on their own. For  example, a mother of four who operates her own business part-time and is  finishing her degree at night said she simply does not have the time to do  her own taxes. Other taxpayers stated that they paid someone to prepare  their taxes in hopes of obtaining a larger and/or quicker refund.", "Some of the paid preparers we spoke to agreed that educating taxpayers  about the tax laws is an important component of their practice. For  example, one preparer who works primarily with immigrants said he and  his staff spend considerable time explaining to their clients that paying  taxes is part of the civic responsibilities they assumed in immigrating to  this country. Other preparers told us they often have to educate taxpayers  on more complex concepts, such as computing the basis (the investment  made in a property) to determine how much of a real estate sale would be  taxable. Another preparer told us he found that a taxpayer had overpaid his  taxes by more than $6,200 over a 3-year period because the taxpayer had  overlooked earned income and child tax credits. Still another preparer told  us how he helped a taxpayer receive a refund in excess of $19,000 when he  found out that the taxpayer, who had moved twice in less than 2 years, had  missed out on deductions for moving expenses due to job relocations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Taxpayers Are Poorly Served by Paid Preparers", "paragraphs": ["When paid preparers make mistakes or exhibit other problematic behavior,  the consequences for taxpayers may be significant. Examples provided by  low-income tax clinicrepresentatives and paid preparers include:", "A taxpayer who overpaid his taxes over a period of years by roughly  $3,500 to $5,000. The taxpayer had received notices for several years  from IRS stating that he may be eligible for the Earned Income Credit  (EIC). Each year, he took the notices to his preparer, but the preparer  took no action.", "One preparer told his elderly client to provide him with the checks to  make her quarterly estimated payments. Although he claimed these  payments on the client\u2019s tax return, he never gave the checks to IRS\u2014he  kept them for himself. After receiving notices from IRS, the taxpayer  visited the paid preparer who told her that IRS must have made a  mistake. The preparer was sent to jail.", "Another preparer incorrectly advised a married couple with two  children to each file separately as head of household so that they could  claim two EICs. The couple ended up owing taxes, interest, and  penalties.", "A paid preparer let a taxpayer file for the EIC for 2 years although the  taxpayer lacked the appropriate documentation and was ineligible for  the credit. The taxpayer received a tax refund he was not entitled to  receive, resulting in a tax liability of $3,300.", "As with all anecdotal evidence, these examples are not necessarily  representative of the kinds of problems taxpayers encounter when dealing  with problematic paid preparers. Also, taxpayers may have contributed to  these problems by either providing incomplete information to their  preparers or being actively complicit in avoiding taxes that are legitimately  owed.", "In addition to over- or underpaying their taxes, IRS officials and others told  us that sometimes taxpayers are poorly served by paying for services that  accelerate the receipt of refunds, including RALs. The primary benefit of  RALs is that they allow clients to receive funds quickly, sometimes in just a  few minutes, rather than the 10 days it typically takes taxpayers who file  electronically to receive their tax refunds. The ability to quickly receive  funds makes RALs appealing to low-income taxpayers who often want or  need their refund quickly. In addition, as the National Taxpayer Advocate  pointed out in the fiscal year 2002 Annual Report to Congress, many low- income clients who lack bank accounts find that RALs are the only way to  electronically file a return and receive their refunds quickly. For these and  other reasons, RALs are becoming more popular. Based on IRS data, the  National Consumer Law Center estimates that 12.1 million RALs were  taken out in 2001, up from 10.8 million in 2000.", "Although this suggests that many taxpayers find value in using RALs, IRS  officials and others have raised concerns about whether taxpayers are fully  aware of the costs involved and their tax filing alternatives. For example, a  recent New York City investigation found that some paid preparers fail to  disclose the costs of RALs and the availability of alternatives to the loans.The investigation found that only 27 of the 43 preparers visited mentioned  the annual percentage rate and other fees associated with RALs. New York  City\u2019s investigation also found that electronic filing was not strongly  publicized as an alternative way for clients to receive their tax refunds  quickly. According to a low-income tax clinic director, many paid preparers  fail to fully explain to taxpayers that accepting a RAL carries a certain  risk\u2014if refunds are delayed or denied, taxpayers may be liable for  additional charges and fees. Without clear information about the costs and  risks, taxpayers cannot always weigh the costs against the benefits that  they might receive.", "Also, based on information we gathered, fees for RALs and other services  that accelerate the receipt of refunds vary widely. For example, while some  preparers charge nothing for electronic filing services, one preparer we  spoke to (while we were posing as a potential client) said he would charge  us between $210 and $250 to file electronically. Another preparer said he  would charge $174 for a RAL on a $700 refund, which equates to an annual  interest rate of over 900 percent, assuming a loan period of 10 days, while  another preparer quoted us a RAL fee of $130 on a $1,200 refund, which  equates to an annual interest rate of about 400 percent, assuming the same  loan period. These examples are not necessarily representative of all  preparer fees; the exact amounts of preparer fees for accelerated refunds  depend on various individual circumstances, such as the financial  institution the preparer uses to finance the loan and the amount of refund  due.", "The RAL fees, when combined with tax preparation fees, may considerably  reduce a taxpayer\u2019s refund. For example, the preparer mentioned above  who quoted a RAL fee of $130 on a $1,200 refund also quoted a tax  preparation fee of $190 in addition to the RAL fee. As shown in figure 4  below, the fees would have reduced the refund by more than 25 percent.", "In another example, a low-income tax clinic director informed us of a  disabled taxpayer who was due a refund of $1,230 on a simple return. After  paying various fees, such as return preparation and a RAL, she received a  check from her preparer for $414\u2014about 34 percent of her expected  refund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little Authoritative Evidence Regarding Problematic Paid Preparers", "paragraphs": ["A variety of evidence, including the above examples and our nationwide  survey, shows that some taxpayers are poorly served by their paid  preparers.

However, even a small percentage of the  more than 72 million taxpayers who used paid preparers in 2001 can  translate into millions of affected taxpayers.", "Taxpayer surveys show that some taxpayers had problems with the quality  of the service provided by their paid preparer. Based on the results of our  nationwide survey, we estimate that 5 percent of paid preparer users had  no confidence that they had not overpaid their taxes, and another 7 percent  had little confidence, as shown in figure 2. We also estimate that 3 percent  of paid preparer users did not believe that their preparer had enough  information to accurately complete their return, as shown in figure 2. Our  survey results are similar to a 1997 Consumer Reports nonrandom survey  of 26,000 of its readers, in which 6 percent said they discovered an error  made by their preparers. As discussed earlier, taxpayer survey results need  to be interpreted carefully because they reflect taxpayer perceptions and  may misstate the extent of the problem.", "Studies of filed returns also suggest that some paid preparers do not  exercise due diligence in filing returns.

Similarly, a recent report  by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration estimated that  there were approximately 230,000 returns filed by paid preparers where  taxpayers appeared eligible for but did not claim the Additional Child Tax  Credit. In addition, a 2002 IRS study of the EIC for tax year 1999 returns  estimated that some taxpayers claimed about $11 billion more than they  were entitled to while others claimed $710 million less than they were  entitled to.The IRS reported that paid preparers filed more than 65  percent of all EIC returns. None of these studies tried to determine how  many errors were the fault of the preparer and how many were the fault of  the taxpayer. However, based on our earlier examples of paid preparer  performance, it seems likely that preparers bear responsibility for at least  some of the over- or underpayments.

For example, IRS  reorganized the office, renaming it OPR, and has started to implement  several other changes. As an initial step, OPR contacted various tax  professional organizations in January 2003 and laid out the following  priorities for the balance of 2003: enhance the visibility of OPR internally as well as externally,  increase the capacity and capability of OPR, process the workload in a shorter time frame, ensure that Circular 230 sanctions are applied fairly and consistently,  identify and implement organizational performance measures, and establish and maintain an effective working alliance with the tax  professional organization community.", "While IRS has already made some improvements, according to the OPR  Director, the following efforts are on-going: hiring and training a significantly expanded staff of attorneys and  improving and documenting operational practices and procedures; communicating the OPR mission and progress internally and externally  through speaking engagements, newsletters, and Web sites; working with IRS Chief Counsel and Treasury Department Tax Policy  personnel to make beneficial amendments to Circular 230; and maintaining an open door policy with respect to the practitioner  community in order to learn of their concerns and their suggestions.", "Also, the OPR director said it is going to take some time to make all the  needed changes.

The  representative stated that their priorities include abusive tax schemes, and  they cannot afford to make these low dollar paid preparer cases a priority  given their responsibility for addressing billions of dollars in uncollected  taxes.

According to  the Internal Revenue Manual, penalty assertion is the key enforcement  vehicle for noncompliant preparers. As mentioned earlier, IRS has no data  on the extent of the problems with paid preparers or how effective its  enforcement efforts are in deterring problematic preparer behavior. In  assessing but not collecting these penalties, IRS may be sending preparers  a mixed message about whether poor performance by preparers will be  tolerated. For example, several paid preparers and low-income tax clinic  officials we interviewed said that IRS was not providing enough paid  preparer oversight and that it should be increased. IRS has made changes  to its fiscal year 2003 compliance program guidance to place a higher  priority on assessing penalties against problem preparers.

One investigation resulted in  a preparer pleading guilty for assisting in the preparation of false tax  returns and sentenced to 38 months in prison and assessed a $10,000 fine.  The preparer owned and operated a tax preparation business and among  her criminal activities regularly advised clients to claim fraudulent tax  credits for dependents and child care, even though the clients had no  dependents.

The  proposal would also require all preparers to abide by the rules of conduct  that currently govern practitioners and contains provisions aimed at  discouraging the use of RALs, including regulating the fees charged for  RALs.", "The National Taxpayer Advocate recommended a similar proposal  requiring the registration of paid preparers in her 2002 Annual Report to  Congress. The proposal would require paid preparers to be registered with  IRS, pass a certification examination, and maintain annual educational  requirements. In a previous report to the Congress, the National Taxpayer  Advocate stated that while paid preparers are subject to monetary  penalties if they prepare returns negligently, many preparers are not  subject to standards of conduct, licensed by any state regulatory agency, or  required to participate in continuing education programs. Thus, according  to the Advocate, the only course of action that can be taken to enjoin a paid  preparer is the initiation of a civil action by the Secretary of the Treasury  against the preparer in A District Court of the United States. According to  the Advocate, such action is costly, time consuming, and leaves  questionable income tax preparers free to remain in business and  potentially harm taxpayers if they continue to prepare income tax returns  during the legal process of the civil action.", "Some of the paid preparers and officials from low-income tax clinics and  professional organizations we interviewed said that IRS could provide  additional oversight of paid preparers, although several said that it would  be difficult for IRS to undertake such efforts. Several of the preparers we  interviewed said that IRS\u2019s current oversight of paid preparers needed  improvement and most of the paid preparers, low-income tax clinics, and  professional organizations we interviewed told us they supported the  licensing or registration of paid preparers as a way to provide additional  oversight of paid preparers. For example, one preparer said he felt paid  preparer oversight was not in IRS\u2019s order of priorities and that paid  preparers should be licensed so that IRS could enforce education and  conduct standards. Others told us that IRS should impose a registration or  licensing requirement on paid preparers although some expressed  reservations. For example, a representative from the National Society of  Accountants said that it would be an arduous task for IRS to create a  system to license hundreds of thousands of people and then set up the  mechanisms to discipline them. Officials from a low-income tax clinic also  expressed concerns, saying that such a proposal may increase the cost of  tax preparation by reducing the supply of available preparers.", "Any consideration of whether to change IRS\u2019s responsibilities for  overseeing paid preparers would likely take into account several factors.  One, obviously, is the benefits and costs to taxpayers who use paid  preparers. However, as highlighted in this report, data are lacking about the  extent of problematic paid preparer behavior and the effectiveness of  existing IRS actions, which makes it difficult to assess the tradeoff between  benefits and costs. Another factor is that regulating the paid preparer  industry, a private sector industry, is a form of consumer protection. IRS\u2019s  major functions, which include processing tax returns, responding to  taxpayer questions, and enforcing compliance with the tax laws, give it  little experience in providing consumer protection. Still another factor is  the implication for IRS resources. Recently we have reported on declines in  IRS\u2019s enforcement programs, including declines in resources allocated to  those programs. We have also reported that needs in other IRS programs  have often been met at the expense of resources devoted to enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Is Not Alone in Providing Some Preparer Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Any consideration of whether to increase IRS paid preparer oversight or  consumer protection must also recognize that IRS is not alone in providing  such oversight. Other federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC), state and local governments, and professional  organizations engage in efforts to prevent, detect, and take action against  problem paid preparers. For example, FTC has taken action against paid  preparers pursuant to its authority to enforce the provisions of the Federal  Trade Commission Act. FTC\u2019s primary mission is to protect consumers by  enforcing federal consumer protection laws that prevent fraud, deception,  and unfair business practices. This protection extends to taxpayers using  paid preparers for tax preparation and other related services.", "In addition, at least six states and one city have laws that provide paid  preparer oversight or consumer protection regarding RALs. These laws  range from requiring registering or licensing of paid preparers to requiring  disclosure statements for RALs. For example, the City of New York  requires a separate disclosure statement for RAL agreements that must be  provided in English or Spanish. New York City\u2019s law also requires paid  preparers to provide an oral explanation of the law\u2019s required written  disclosure in language understood by the taxpayer. In addition to  government entities, professional organizations, such as the American  Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the American Bar  Association, also impose general standards of conduct on the actions of  their members, including those representing taxpayers before the IRS and  preparing tax returns. We did not attempt to identify all federal, state, and  local governments or professional organizations that have a paid preparer  or RAL oversight role in addition to IRS. Table 3 shows examples of some  tax preparation and RAL oversight in addition to that provided by IRS.", "Three of these seven oversight efforts shown in the table above were  passed or enacted within the past year. To date, none of the state or local  governments responsible for the efforts has evaluated the effectiveness of  these efforts. The absence of such data further complicates any  consideration about changing IRS\u2019s role. Without data, IRS management  cannot determine how much these other government entities will provide  paid preparer oversight or consumer protection."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Paid tax preparers are critical to the functioning of our tax system. Many  taxpayers do not understand their filing requirements and would have great  difficulty filling out their tax forms without the assistance of paid  preparers.", "While most taxpayers may receive quality services from their preparers,  problematic behavior by some preparers raises the question of whether IRS  should be more active in overseeing paid preparers. Since paid tax  preparation is a private sector industry, this can be viewed as a question  about the extent to which the nation\u2019s tax administrator ought to be  involved in consumer protection. On the one hand, the complexity of the  tax code is at least partly responsible for the existence of the paid tax  preparation industry. As a consequence, IRS might be viewed as properly  having some responsibility for oversight of the industry. On the other hand,  IRS\u2019s mission is tax administration and the agency may not have the  expertise or the regulatory culture for successfully carrying out consumer  protection responsibilities. In addition, unless given a budget increase IRS  would have to divert resources from other priorities in order to carry out  expanded industry oversight responsibilities. In recent years IRS has often  met such resource needs by decreasing staffing of its enforcement  activities.", "At least two proposals exist for legislative action, one from the Taxpayer  Advocate and the other, the Low Income Taxpayer Protection Act of 2003,  S. 685, proposed in the108th Congress. Unfortunately, there is not much  reliable information about the tradeoffs associated with changing IRS\u2019s  role. Examples of problematic preparer behavior are easy to find but  reliable estimates of the number of taxpayers affected by the problems do  not exist and would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to develop. Such data  would be needed to properly evaluate proposals for changing IRS\u2019s role.  While the federal government and some state and local governments have  taken actions intended to address problematic preparer behavior, the  effectiveness of the actions is not known. Because making decisions about  IRS\u2019s role is a policy matter and because data are not available to determine  the efficacy of IRS\u2019s current oversight efforts, whether to expand IRS\u2019s role  in ensuring taxpayers receive quality service from paid preparers is a  judgment that Congress and IRS management must make. We are not  making recommendations in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Commissioner of Internal Revenue provided written comments on a  draft of this report in an October 28, 2003, letter, which is reprinted in  appendix III. The Commissioner agreed with the information presented in  our report and noted that IRS will continue its efforts to provide oversight  of paid tax preparers and is developing new initiatives to ensure the ethical  responsibility of preparers. These efforts include continuing to develop the  Office of Professional Responsibility, considering changes to Circular 230,  coordinating with professional tax associations, increasing compliance  efforts, forming a multifunctional work group to improve communications  within IRS, and developing a national paid preparer strategy.", "The Commissioner said that, based on the information in our report, IRS  will undertake an analysis of whether IRS can take additional steps to  increase the impact of its efforts to assess penalties against paid tax  preparers. In response to our observation that penalties assessed against  paid preparers are not a collection priority, the Commissioner noted, and  we agree that preparer penalty cases are included in IRS\u2019s collection  priority system. Our point is that they are not a collection priority because  of their relatively low dollar value and we noted that IRS collected only 12  percent of the penalties assessed in calendar years 2001 and 2002. The  Commissioner commented that it might be a better reflection of IRS\u2019s  collection efforts to point out that during this period, the agency collected  all or some portion of penalties from 44 percent of the SB/SE preparers  who were assessed a penalty and we changed our draft to show the  percentage collected. We were aware that some paid preparers voluntarily  pay the penalties assessed against them but, as indicated by the  Commissioners\u2019 response, more than half of paid preparers paid nothing.  Since uncollected preparer penalties represent about 88 percent of the  value of penalty assessments, we said that IRS may be sending the paid  preparer community a mixed message about whether poor performance by  preparers will be tolerated. At the same time, we recognize that collecting  paid preparer penalties has not been a priority due to other higher priority  work, such as abusive tax schemes.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date.

Survey Sampling International (SSI) of Fairfield,  Connecticut provided the probability sample of telephone numbers. These  were drawn from active telephone blocks of telephone exchanges with  listed numbers and excluded numbers that SSI identified as being business  numbers or not in service (e.g., disconnected). At least eight calls were  made to each telephone number to attempt to identify a respondent.", "A member within each household was initially randomly chosen by  selecting the individual whose birthday most recently preceded the date of  the telephone contact. Once the selection of a household member was  made, two attempts were made to complete the interview with that  individual. If, after two contacts, including scheduled appointments, the  selected member could not be reached or refused to complete the survey, a  second adult member of the household was asked to participate.

The effects of nonsampling errors,  such as nonresponse and errors in measurement, may be of greater or  lesser significance but cannot be quantified on the basis of the available  data.", "Sampling errors arise because we used a sample of individuals to draw  conclusions about the much larger population. The study\u2019s sample of  telephone numbers is based on a probability selection procedure. As a  result, the sample was only one of a large number of samples that might  have been drawn from the total telephone exchanges from throughout the  country. If a different sample had been taken, the results might have been  different. To recognize the possibility that other samples might have  yielded other results, we express our confidence in the precision of our  particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. For all the  percentages presented in this report, we are 95 percent confident that  when only sampling errors are considered the results we obtained are  within +/- 5 percentage points or less of what we would have obtained if we  had surveyed the entire study population. In addition to the reported  sampling errors, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey  introduce other types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors. For example, questions may be misinterpreted, some types of  people may be more likely to be excluded from the study, errors could be  made in recording the questionnaire responses into the computer-assisted  telephone interview software, and the respondents\u2019 answers may differ  from those who did not respond.", "To test the understanding of the questions, we pretested the survey by  conducting 57 interviews. To ensure that responses were correctly  recorded in the computer-assisted telephone interview software, trained  interviewers were used who had been specifically briefed on the study, and  interviewer supervisors regularly monitored, evaluated, and provided  feedback to the interviewing staff who worked from a centralized  telephone facility.", "For this survey, the 46 percent response rate is a potential source of  nonsampling error; we do not know if the respondents\u2019 answers are  different from the 54 percent who did not respond. Both GAO and Marist  took steps to maximize the response rate\u2014the questionnaire was carefully  designed, at least eight telephone calls were made at different times of day  on different days of the week to try to contact each telephone number, the  interview period extended over 20 days, respondents were informed that  their responses were anonymous, suspended interviews and refusals were  recontacted at least once, and respondents were provided with a toll-free  number to either call back at a more convenient time or to obtain further  information about the survey.", "Because we did not have information on those taxpayers who chose not to  participate in our survey, we could not estimate the impact of the  nonresponse on our results. Our findings will be biased to the extent that  the people at the 54 percent of the telephone numbers that did not yield an  interview have different experiences with paid tax preparers than did the  46 percent of our sample who responded. Knowing that the survey would  concern tax issues could not have created large biases because only about  1.6 percent of the eligible households in the sample (31 individuals) refused  after the interview began (i.e., after they could have known the interview  would address tax issues.) The remaining nonresponding units (about 52  percent of the sample) did not know that the interview would address tax  issues. The 52 percent is comprised of about 18 percent (356) who refused  before the interview could be started, about 14 percent (274) where an  eligible respondent was identified in the household, and about 21 percent  (estimated 418) where no one was contacted at the telephone number but  the household was assumed to be eligible.
