For fiscal year 1995, Education was appropriated $32.4 billion and authorized 5,131 FTE positions to administer and carry out its 240 educational assistance programs, including aid to distressed schools through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, support for technical training through the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, support for special education programs for the disabled, and support for higher education through subsidized and unsubsidized loans and grant programs.", "Although Education only became a department in 1980, its field structure dates back to 1940 when the Office of Education had its own representatives in federal regional offices to assist in administering federal education laws. Historically, the major function of these offices has been to help local administrators understand federal education legislation and obtain available federal funds for education purposes.", "The Department of Labor\u2019s mission is to foster, promote, and develop the welfare of U.S. wage earners; improve their working conditions; and advance their opportunities for profitable employment. In carrying out this mission, Labor\u2014established as a department in 1913\u2014administers and enforces a variety of federal labor laws guaranteeing workers\u2019 rights to work places free from safety and health hazards, a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation, and freedom from employment discrimination.", "Labor also protects workers\u2019 pension rights; provides for job training programs; helps workers find jobs; and tracks changes in employment, prices, and other national economic measurements. Although Labor seeks to assist all Americans who need and want to work, special efforts are made to meet the unique job market needs of older workers, economically disadvantaged and dislocated workers, youth, women, the disabled, and other groups.

Concentrations of offices are found in the 10 federal region cities, where a total of 279 Education and Labor field offices are located, with a total of 5,987 staff (see table 1).

The concentration of Education\u2019s field offices in the federal region cities is a reflection of the role of Education\u2019s field structure, which is principally to ensure the integrity of grant and loan programs and to ensure that federal programs are equitably accessible. For example, the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) formulates policy and oversees the student loan program and other sources of federal support for postsecondary students and schools. The OPE field offices carry out technical assistance, debt collection, and monitoring activities that affect students, institutions, contractors, lenders, and guaranty agencies.

This will essentially involve redefining the duties of about 10 district offices to provide more frontline services and fewer management-related activities.
