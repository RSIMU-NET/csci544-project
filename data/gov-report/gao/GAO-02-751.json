Little information is available to Congress on the relative effectiveness of title IV grants, loans, and the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits in promoting postsecondary attendance, choice, and completion or on the impact of these programs on college costs.

Title IV of the Higher Education Act (HEA), first adopted in 1965, authorizes federal grant and loan programs, providing a total of $53 billion in assistance to 8.1 million students in fiscal year 1999. In the past decade, the federal government has increasingly relied upon another tool: the tax code. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed eligible taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by receiving up to a $1,500 HOPE or $1,000 Lifetime Learning tax credit for tuition and course-related fees paid. The 2001 Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act created a new tax deduction for tuition expenses, and expanded many existing higher education tax provisions. For example, the law excluded the earnings of state-sponsored college savings and prepaid tuition plans from federal income taxation, providing they are used to meet tuition and other educational expenses, and it increased the annual contribution limit for Coverdell Education Savings Accounts. The federal investment in providing student assistance through the tax code has risen sharply, from an estimated $0.0056 billion in 1996 to $7.6 billion in 2002, more than 80 percent of which is comprised of HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax expenditures.

Our review focused on three questions: (1) What assistance do HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits provide, and how do credit benefits compare to the tuition and fees that students are charged, and to title IV aid they receive? (2) To what extent do available policy and instructions provide clear guidance about the impact of tax provisions on eligibility for title IV financial aid? (3) To what extent is information available to Congress about the relative effectiveness of title IV grants and loans and the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits?", "To answer question one, we estimated the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits students received on the basis of the credits\u2019 design and on data in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). NPSAS examines how students and their families pay for education and is based on a nationally representative sample of students. Appendix I describes our estimation methodology. We also used NPSAS to estimate the title IV aid received by students considered to be financially dependent on their parents and by financially independent students. To answer question two, we reviewed the HEA, Internal Revenue Code, title IV financial aid policies and instructions developed by the Department of Education (Education), and interviewed Education officials. To answer question three, we reviewed studies of the effectiveness of title IV aid and the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits. We focused on their effects on college attendance and choice, completion, and costs. These outcomes were chosen because they have been the focus of congressional concern, as expressed in committee reports, statutorily established study commissions, and requests for our work from Congress. We also interviewed Education and Department of Treasury (Treasury) officials about their research and evaluation concerning title IV aid and tax credits.

Title IV programs include Pell grants for low-income students, parent loans known as PLUS loans, and Stafford loans. Stafford loans may be either subsidized or unsubsidized. The federal government pays the interest cost on subsidized loans while the student is in school. The terms and conditions of unsubsidized loans are the same as those for subsidized loans, but the federal government does not pay the interest costs on the loan while the student is in school; rather, students are responsible for all interest costs. Title IV also authorizes programs funded by the federal government and administered by participating higher education institutions, commonly known as campus-based aid\u2014Supplemental Educational Opportunity grants (SEOG), Perkins loans, and federal work-study aid. In academic year 1999-2000, Education awarded approximately $53 billion to students through the title IV programs.", "In order to receive title IV aid, a student must apply using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Information from the FAFSA is used to determine the amount of money\u2014called the expected family contribution (EFC)\u2014that the student and/or the family is expected to contribute to the student\u2019s education. Statutory definitions establish the criteria that students must meet to be considered independent of or dependent on their parents for purposes of financial aid, and statutory formulas establish the share of income and assets that are expected to be available for the student\u2019s education. Once the EFC is established, it is compared to the cost of attendance at the institution chosen by the student. If the EFC is greater than the cost of attendance, the student is not considered to have financial need for federal title IV aid programs. If the cost of attendance is greater than the EFC, then the student is considered to have financial need. Financial aid administrators at the student\u2019s school then create a federal financial aid package that may include grants, loans, and work-study. As part of the financial aid package students may also receive state, institutional, or private aid.", "In 1999-2000, about one in four undergraduates (23 percent) received federal Pell or SEOG grant aid.

As a result, those who wish to use these provisions are faced with uncertainty about how using them affects title IV aid eligibility. Although Education has established policies about the ownership of these assets for the purpose of calculating the EFC, these policies have not been clearly communicated to aid applicants.  Specifically, families who choose to use state savings plans, Coverdell accounts, and Series EE Savings Bonds receive unclear instructions on the FAFSA form about who should claim these assets, the student or parent(s). As a result, they may err when reporting these assets, and their eligibility for aid may be miscalculated.", "For many of the higher education tax provisions that we reviewed, the HEA or Education\u2019s guidance make clear how their use affects aid eligibility. The HEA prohibits including HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits as income or assets in the computation of EFC. In contrast, the act specifies that assets in a tuition prepayment plan do reduce students\u2019 eligibility for title IV aid because they reduce students\u2019 cost of attendance.In specifying how federal taxation affects the EFC, the HEA also accounts for the effects of two other tax provisions: the student loan interest deduction and the higher education tax deduction. Under the rules of the federal financial aid methodology, aid applicants reduce their reported income by federal income and payroll taxes, and by an allowance for state taxes. The use of these tax provisions lowers an applicant\u2019s tax liability and their adjusted gross income, reducing their EFC and increasing their aid eligibility. The HEA also specifies that interest on tax-free bonds, including Savings Bonds, must be reported as part of the untaxed income included in the EFC. As a result, the HEA makes clear that the use of Series EE Savings Bonds increases an aid applicant\u2019s EFC, and reduces their aid eligibility.", "In a few instances, neither the HEA\u2019s financial aid methodology nor Education\u2019s policies establish how parents\u2019 and students\u2019 use of certain tax provisions\u2014state savings plans, prepaid tuition plans, and Coverdell accounts\u2014affects their eligibility for title IV aid. Before January 2002, the earnings portion of prepaid tuition and state savings plans was taxable upon distribution. As part of the student\u2019s taxable income, it was reported on the FAFSA form and included in the calculation of the EFC. After January 2002, in accordance with the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, the earnings of these plans were no longer subject to federal taxation.  Education has not yet determined whether interest earned on prepaid tuition plans, savings plans, or Coverdell accounts should be reported on the FAFSA form and included in the calculation of EFC as a type of untaxed income. As a result, those who use either tax provision cannot predict whether interest earnings from these plans will increase the income that they report on the FAFSA, thereby increasing their EFC and reducing eligibility for most title IV aid.", "For state savings plans and Coverdell accounts, as well as Series EE Saving Bonds, the FAFSA form does not provide clear instructions for reporting to whom these assets belong, the student or parent. The FAFSA has a single set of instructions directing parents and students to report their assets, including state savings plan assets, bonds, and Coverdell accounts. However, the instructions do not indicate who should claim which assets. As a result, parents may claim assets that should be reported as student assets, or vice versa. A mistake of this type has consequences because the HEA specifies that a larger share of student assets is to be included in the EFC than parental assets.

Credit amounts for each student in NPSAS were computed by calculating a completed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form 8863, the form used by tax filers to claim the credits, for each student in the NPSAS sample. We determined a student\u2019s eligibility for the HOPE credit on the basis of enrollment status and year in school. We subsequently assumed that all students not eligible for the HOPE credit were potentially eligible for the Lifetime Learning credit.", "After establishing eligibility for students in the database, we determined the maximum tax credit each student could receive using the formulas contained in the IRS form 8863, applying the income eligibility requirements associated with these credits. Form 8863 uses adjusted gross income (AGI) for these measures, which is all income minus exclusions from income such as student-loan interest and IRA contributions. For one-half of students in the NPSAS database who filed a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), NPSAS reports the adjusted gross income for the student (and spouse) if they are independent, or the parents (if the student is a dependent). For the other half of students, income is based on a computer-assisted telephone interview, and/or stochastic imputation.", "In addition to income, the amount of credit allowed is limited by the amount of tax liability reduced by amounts of dependent care and the elderly and disabled credits claimed. Generally speaking, tax liability is tax owed on a filer\u2019s taxable income, which is their AGI minus personal exemptions and either the standard deduction or the sum of itemized deductions such as mortgage interest or property taxes. Without tax data we had no means of estimating potential itemized deductions, so we assumed that all tax filers used the standard deduction. We calculated the amount of liability owed using the standard tax tables provided by the IRS. There is no information in NPSAS about the amount claimed for dependent care and the elderly and disabled tax credits. We therefore assumed that these returns only had education tax credits.", "The steps above allowed us to calculate a tax credit for every student in the NPSAS sample. We estimated that approximately 90 percent of the students in the NPSAS sample who were eligible to claim the credits did so. We had no reliable evidence about different rates of tax credit use across family income or student type; therefore, we randomly selected a 90 percent sample of those students who had a non-zero credit to be the population of credit recipients used to calculate our tax credit estimates.", "The results of our estimation were compared to data on credits claimed and allowed, computed from the Statistics of Income (SOI) and provided to us by the IRS. Our estimate of the net value of HOPE and Lifetime credits allowed was 94 percent of the SOI estimate. Our estimates of HOPE credits claimed was significantly lower than the SOI estimate, while our estimate of Lifetime Learning credits claimed was significantly higher than the SOI estimate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations of Our Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Some aspects of our methodology tend to overstate the credit amounts claimed, while others aspects of the methodology have the opposite effect. Tax filers who had more than one family member enrolled in postsecondary education were able to apply the qualified education expenses of each to the Lifetime Learning tax credit, up to a $5,000 per household limit. NPSAS data do not allow individual student records to be linked into households. Therefore, we were unable to adjust our estimates of students\u2019 qualified educational expenses to reflect this feature of the credit. Our estimates of total Lifetime Learning credit amounts were larger than those estimated from the SOI; some of this overestimation may have resulted from this limitation.", "Tax filers using either the HOPE or Lifetime Learning credit may find that they are unable to obtain the full value of the credit because they lack sufficient tax liability to do so. Our methodology assigns the tax liability of each family to one student, regardless of the number of family members actually enrolled. For those families that had more than one student enrolled, our methodology may overestimate the tax liability available to the student and thus overestimate the credit received.", "We assumed that all tax filers used the standard deduction. Our estimates of pre-credit tax liability among those with adjusted gross incomes of $20-30,000 were 17 percent lower than SOI\u2019s, and 8 percent lower for tax filers with adjusted gross incomes of $30-$40,000. Our estimates of tax liability were slightly higher than those of SOI at AGIs above $75,000. This may result in an underestimation of the credits claimed by tax filers with adjusted gross incomes below $40,000.", "Some individuals who are eligible to claim the credit may not do so. There are no reliable data on the rate at which eligible tax filers claim the HOPE and Lifetime Learning credits. Our methodology estimated that 90 percent of the students in the NPSAS sample who were eligible to claim the credits did so. We first calculated a credit amount for all students. Lacking any empirical basis for establishing different rates of credit usage among students, we randomly selected a 90 percent sample of students who had a non-zero credit to be the population of credit recipients used to calculate our tax credit estimates. To the extent that the rate of usage varies across student populations by income or dependency status, our estimates of credit amounts will be too small for some populations, and too large for others.", "Data limitations may also affect the quality of tax credit estimates. Our estimates of tax credits may be lower than those obtained from the SOI because SOI data represent pre-audited amounts, and tax filers may have over claimed the credits. While income data for those students who did apply for federal financial aid is reported by NPSAS to be very precise, for the other half of students the income information is acknowledged by NPSAS to be much less reliable. This lack of reliability in the measurement of income may result in imprecise estimates of credit usage and credit amounts received.", "Because our estimates come from a sample of the larger population, NPSAS, there is some sampling error associated with them. Moreover, taking a 90 percent sample of those data introduces additional sampling errors. In calculating sampling errors and confidence intervals, we took into account this complex sample design. Sampling errors are often represented as a 95 percent confidence interval: an interval that 95 times out of a 100 will contain the true population value. The upper and lower bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals for each estimate are presented in the following tables."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Research on the Effects of Grants, Loans, and Tax Credits", "paragraphs": ["To identify available information on the relative effectiveness of title IV aid and the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits, we reviewed studies of the factors that affect college attendance and choice, completion, and costs.

We examined studies that appeared in books, refereed journals, working papers, dissertations, or government reports. Some of these studies were excluded from further assessment because they did not undertake original data analysis that could identify the effectiveness of federal financial aid programs. Studies that provided an original empirical analysis (or, in the case of tax credits, a simulation methodology) were subsequently assessed according to professional standards of econometric analysis for their methodological rigor. Some of these studies explicitly estimated the effects of federal aid programs. Others estimated how sensitive student attendance, completion, or choice decisions are to changes in the net cost of college. The studies are listed in the bibliography.
