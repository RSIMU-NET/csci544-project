The Congress required  agencies in the federal government to establish a chief human capital  officer in legislation creating the Department of Homeland Security  enacted in November 2002. One of the officer\u2019s functions is to align the  agency\u2019s human capital policies and programs with organizational mission,  strategic goals, and performance outcomes.  We have reported that some  U.S. agencies have begun to take steps to more closely integrate their  human capital and strategic planning processes and hold both human  capital professionals and operational managers accountable for  accomplishing organizational missions and program goals. More recently,  the Office of Management and Budget revised Circular A-11 to require that  federal agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2005 budget submissions as well as their  annual performance plans prepared under the Government Performance  and Results Act identify specific activities such as training, development,  and staffing that agencies plan to take to ensure leadership continuity.  In  addition, as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to implement the  President\u2019s Management Agenda, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) set the goal that continuity of leadership and knowledge is assured  through succession planning and professional development programs in  25 percent of all federal agencies by July 2004.  OPM also identified the  need for agencies to reduce any current or future skill gaps in mission  critical occupations and leadership positions.", "We previously reported that other countries have faced challenges in  managing their human capital and, in particular, managing individual  performance. In addition, other countries face a variety of succession- related challenges.  For example, Canada faces a public service workforce  with about 80 percent of both its executives and executive feeder groups  eligible to retire by the end of the decade.  The United Kingdom faces the  challenge of increasing the representation of ethnic minorities among its  senior executives and has established a goal of doubling the percentage of  minority representation from 1.6 percent in 1998 to 3.2 percent by 2005.  New Zealand found that past arrangements for the governmentwide  development of its senior leaders have not worked, resulting in a shortage  of fully prepared candidates for public service leadership positions.  To  address this shortage, the government has recently launched a new  strategic senior leadership and management development initiative.  Finally, Australia\u2019s central federal human capital agency recently reported  on the changing career expectations among employees and the possible  attrition of experienced high-potential employees as two succession- related challenges to government performance in the future.", "At your request, this report identifies how agencies in four countries\u2014  Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom\u2014and the  Canadian Province of Ontario are adopting a more strategic approach to  managing the succession of senior executives and other public sector  employees with critical skills.  To identify these practices, we reviewed the  literature associated with succession planning and management; found  examples illustrating these practices through the results of a screening  survey; analyzed written documentation; and interviewed cognizant  officials about the identified examples.  See appendix I for additional  information on our objective, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Many federal agencies have yet to adopt succession planning and  management initiatives.  In 1997, the National Academy of Public  Administration reported that of the 27 agencies responding to its survey,  2 agencies had a succession planning program or process in place; 2  agencies were planning to have one in the coming year; and 4 agencies  were planning one in the next 2 years. In 1999, a joint OPM and Senior  Executive Association survey reported that more than 50 percent of all  career members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) said that their  agencies did not have a formal succession planning program for the SES,  and almost 75 percent said that their agencies did not have such a program  for managers. Of those who reported that their agencies did have  succession planning programs for either executives or managers, 54  percent of the career senior executives said that they had not participated  in the executive-level programs and 65 percent said they had not  participated at the manager level.  On the basis of this survey and anecdotal  evidence, OPM officials told us in 2000 that they found that most agencies  would not likely have a formal, comprehensive succession plan.", "Further, we have reported that a lack of succession planning has  contributed to two specific human capital challenges currently facing the  federal government.  The first challenge is the large percentage of career  senior executives who will reach regular retirement eligibility over the next  several years.  In 2000, we reported that 71 percent of the SES members  employed as of October 1998 would reach regular retirement eligibility by  the end of fiscal year 2005. More recently, we estimated that more than  half of the SES members in federal service as of October 2000 will have left  the government by October 2007. We concluded that without careful  planning, these separations pose the threat of an eventual loss in  institutional knowledge, expertise, and leadership continuity.", "The second challenge facing federal agencies impacted by a lack of  succession planning is the amount of diversity in their executive and  managerial ranks.  As the demographics of the public served by the federal  government change, a diverse executive corps can provide agencies with  an increasingly important organizational advantage that can help them to  achieve results.  We have reported that, as of 2000, minority men and  women made up about 14 percent of the career SES.  If current promotion  and hiring trends continue, the proportions of minority men and women  among senior executives will likely remain virtually unchanged over the  next 4 years.", "The literature shows that public and private sector organizations use a  range of approaches when planning for, and managing, succession-related  challenges.  These approaches span a continuum from the \u201creplacement\u201d  approach, which focuses on identifying particular individuals as possible  successors for specific top ranking positions, to the \u201cintegrated\u201d  succession planning and management approach.  Under the integrated  approach, succession planning and management is a strategic, systematic  effort that works to ensure a suitable supply of potential successors for a  variety of leadership and other key positions.  These two approaches  essentially reflect a shift in emphasis of succession planning from a risk  management tool, focused on the near-term, operational need to ensure  backup people are identified in case a top position becomes vacant, to a  strategic planning tool, which identifies and develops high-potential  individuals with the aim of filling leadership and other key roles in the  future.", "GAO, similar to other federal agencies, faces an array of succession  planning challenges.  The succession planning and management approach  we are using to respond to our internal challenges is consistent with the  practices we identified in other countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Countries\u2019 Selected Practices to Manage Succession", "paragraphs": ["To manage the succession of their executives and other key employees,  agencies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are  implementing succession planning and management practices that work to  protect and enhance organizational capacity.  Collectively, these agencies\u2019  succession planning and management initiatives receive active support of top leadership;  link to strategic planning;  identify talent from multiple organizational levels, early in careers, or  with critical skills; emphasize developmental assignments in addition to formal training; address specific human capital challenges, such as diversity, leadership  capacity, and retention; and facilitate broader transformation efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Receive Active Support of Top Leadership", "paragraphs": ["Effective succession planning and management programs have the support  and commitment of their organizations\u2019 top leadership.  Our past work has  shown that the demonstrated commitment of top leaders is perhaps the  single most important element of successful management. In other  governments and agencies, to demonstrate its support of succession  planning and management, top leadership (1) actively participates in the  initiatives, (2) regularly uses these programs to develop, place, and  promote individuals, and (3) ensures that these programs receive sufficient  financial and staff resources, and are maintained over time.", "For example, each year, the Secretary of the Cabinet, Ontario Public  Service\u2019s (OPS) top civil servant, convenes and actively participates in an  annual 2-day succession planning and management retreat with the heads  of every government ministry.  At this retreat, they discuss the anticipated  leadership needs across the government as well as the individual status of  about 200 high-potential executives who may be able to meet those needs  over the next year or two.  Similarly, in New Zealand, the State Services  Commissioner\u2014an official whose wide-ranging human capital  responsibilities include the appointment and review of public service chief  executives\u2014developed, with the assistance of a group of six agency chief  executives who met regularly over a period of 2 years, a new  governmentwide senior leadership and management development  initiative.  This effort culminated in the July 2003 roll out of the Executive  Leadership Programme and the creation of a new central Leadership  Development Centre.", "The Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s (RCMP) senior executive committee  regularly uses the agency\u2019s succession planning and management programs  when making decisions to develop, place, and promote its top 500-600  employees, both officers and civilians.  RCMP\u2019s executive committee,  consisting of the agency\u2019s chief executive, the chief human capital officer,  and six other top officials, meets quarterly to discuss the organization\u2019s  succession needs and to make the specific decisions concerning individual  staff necessary to address those needs.  In 2001-2002, this process resulted  in 72 promotions and 220 lateral transfers.", "Top leaders also demonstrate support by ensuring that their agency\u2019s or  government\u2019s succession planning and management initiatives receive  sufficient funding and staff resources necessary to operate effectively and  are maintained over time.  Such commitment is critical since these  initiatives can be expensive because of the emphasis they place on  participant development.  For example, a senior human capital manager  told us that the Chief Executive of the Family Court of Australia (FCA)  pledged to earmark funds when he established a multiyear succession  planning and management program in 2002 despite predictions of possible  budget cuts facing FCA.  Although human capital training and development  programs are sometimes among the first programs to be cut back during  periods of retrenchment, FCA\u2019s Chief Executive has repeatedly stated to  both internal and external stakeholders that this will not happen.", "Similarly, at Statistics Canada\u2014the Canadian federal government\u2019s central  statistics agency\u2014the Chief Statistician of Canada has set aside a  percentage, in this case over 3 percent, of the total agency budget to  training and development, thus making resources available for the  operation of the agency\u2019s four leadership and management development  programs.  According to a human capital official, this strong support has  enabled the level of funding to remain fairly consistent over the past 10  years.  Finally, the government of New Zealand has committed  NZ$19.6 million (about U.S.$11.2 million in July 2003) over four years,  representing both central government and agency contributions, for the  implementation of its new governmentwide senior leadership and  management development strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Link to Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations use succession planning and management as a  strategic planning tool that focuses on current and future needs and  develops pools of high-potential staff in order to meet the organization\u2019s  mission over the long term.  That is, succession planning and management  is used to help the organization become what it needs to be, rather than  simply to recreate the existing organization.  We have previously reported  on the importance of linking succession planning and management with the  forward-looking process of strategic and program planning.In Canada,  succession planning and management initiatives focus on long-term goals,  are closely integrated with their strategic plans, and provide a broader  perspective.", "For example, at Statistics Canada, committees composed of line and senior  managers and human capital specialists consider the human capital  required to achieve its strategic goals and objectives.  During the 2001  strategic planning process, the agency\u2019s planning committees received  projections showing that a majority of the senior executives then in place  would retire by 2010, and the number of qualified assistant directors in the  executive development pool was insufficient to replace them.  In response,  the agency increased the size of the pool and introduced a development  program of training, rotation, and mentoring to expedite the development  of those already in the pool.  According to a Statistics Canada human  capital official, these actions, linked with the agency\u2019s strategic planning  process, have helped to ensure that an adequate number of assistant  directors will be sufficiently prepared to succeed departing senior  executives.", "In Ontario, succession planning and management has been a required  component of the government\u2019s human capital planning framework since  1997.  OPS requires that the head of each ministry develop a succession  plan that (1) anticipates the ministry\u2019s needs over the next couple of years,  (2) establishes a process to identify a pool of high-potential senior  managers, and (3) links the selection of possible successors to both  ministry and governmentwide opportunities and business plans.  These  plans, which are updated annually at the deputy ministers retreat, form the  basis for Ontario\u2019s governmentwide succession planning and management  process.  While OPS has not conducted a formal evaluation of the impact of  this process, a senior human capital official told us that succession  planning and management has received a much greater level of attention  from top leadership and now plays a critical role in OPS\u2019 broader planning  and staffing efforts.", "For RCMP, succession planning and management is an integral part of the  agency\u2019s multiyear human capital plan and directly supports its strategic  needs, and it also uses this process to provide top leadership with an  agencywide perspective.  RCMP is responsible for a wide range of police  functions on the federal, provincial, and local levels, such as illegal drug  and border enforcement, international peacekeeping services, and road  and highway safety.  In addition, RCMP provides services in 10 provinces  and three territories covering an area larger than the United States.  Its  succession planning and management system provides the RCMP  Commissioner and his executive committee with an organizationwide  picture of current and developing leadership capacity across the  organization\u2019s many functional and geographic lines.", "To achieve this, RCMP constructed a \u201csuccession room\u201d\u2014a dedicated  room with a graphic representation of current and potential job positions  for the organization\u2019s top 500-600 employees covering its walls\u2014where the  Commissioner and his top executives meet at least four times a year to  discuss succession planning and management for the entire organization.  For each of RCMP\u2019s executive and senior manager-level positions in  headquarters and the regions, the incumbent and one or more potential  successors are depicted on individual movable cards that display relevant  background information (see fig. 1).  An electronic database provides  access to more detailed information for each incumbent and potential  successors, including skills, training, and past job experience that the  executive committee considers when deciding on assignments and  transfers.  In addition, high-potential individuals as well as employees  currently on developmental assignments outside RCMP are displayed.", "According to a senior human capital official, because the succession room  actually surrounds the RCMP\u2019s top leadership with an accessible depiction  of their complex and wide-ranging organization, it provides a powerful tool  to help them take a broader, organizationwide approach to staffing and  management decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identify Talent from Multiple Organizational Levels, Early in Careers, or with Critical Skills", "paragraphs": ["Effective succession planning and management initiatives identify high- performing employees from multiple levels in the organization and still  early in their careers.  In addition, leading organizations use succession  planning and management to identify and develop knowledge and skills  that are critical in the workplace.", "RCMP has three separate development programs that identify and develop  high-potential employees at several organizational levels.  For example,  beginning at entry level, the Full Potential Program reaches as far down as  the front-line constable and identifies and develops individuals, both  civilians and officers, who demonstrate the potential to take on a future  management role.  For more experienced staff, RCMP\u2019s Officer Candidate  Development Program identifies and prepares individuals for increased  leadership and managerial responsibilities and to successfully compete for  admission to the officer candidate pool.  Finally, RCMP\u2019s Senior Executive  Development Process helps to identify successors for the organization\u2019s  senior executive corps by selecting and developing promising officers for  potential promotion to the senior executive levels.", "The United Kingdom\u2019s Fast Stream program targets high-potential  individuals early in their civil service careers as well as recent college  graduates.  The program places participants in a series of jobs designed to  provide experiences such as developing policy, supporting ministers, and  managing people and projects\u2014each of which is linked to strengthening  specific competencies required for admission to the Senior Civil Service.  According to a senior program official, program participants are typically  promoted quickly, attaining mid-level management in an average of  3.5 years, and the Senior Civil Service in about 7 years after that.", "Other agencies use their succession planning and management initiatives  to identify and develop successors for employees with critical knowledge  and skills.  For example, Transport Canada estimated that 69 percent of its  safety and security regulatory employees, including inspectors, are eligible  for retirement by 2008.  Faced with the urgent need to capture and pass on  the inspectors\u2019 expertise, judgment, and insights before they retire, the  agency embarked on a major knowledge management initiative in 1999 as  part of its succession planning and management activities.  To identify the  inspectors whose leaving would most severely affect the agency\u2019s ability to  carry out its mandate, Transport Canada used criteria that assessed  whether the inspectors (1) possessed highly specialized knowledge, skills,  or expertise, (2) held one-of-a-kind positions, (3) were regarded as the \u201cgo- to\u201d people in critical situations, and/or (4) held vital corporate memory.", "Next, inspectors were asked to pass on their knowledge through  mentoring, coaching, and on-the-job training.  To assist this knowledge  transfer effort, Transport Canada encouraged these inspectors to use  human capital flexibilities including preretirement transitional leave, which  allows employees to substantially reduce their workweek without reducing  pension and benefits payments.  The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat,  a federal central management agency, found that besides providing easy  access to highly specialized knowledge, this initiative ensures a smooth  transition of knowledge from incumbents to successors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emphasize Developmental Assignments in Addition to Formal Training", "paragraphs": ["Leading succession planning and management initiatives emphasize  developmental or \u201cstretch\u201d assignments for high-potential employees in  addition to formal training.  These developmental assignments place staff  in new roles or unfamiliar job environments in order to strengthen skills  and competencies and broaden their experience.  In the United States,  training and development opportunities\u2014including developmental  assignments\u2014must be offered fairly, consistent with merit system  principles.  However, according to a 1999 survey of career SES in the  United States, 67 percent reported that they had never changed jobs by  going to a different component within their agency or department.  Moreover, 91 percent said that they never served in more than one  department or agency during their entire executive careers. Agencies in  other countries use developmental assignments, accompanied by more  formal training components and other support mechanisms, to help ensure  that individuals are capable of performing when promoted.", "Participants in RCMP\u2019s Full Potential Program must complete at least two  6- to 12-month developmental assignments intended to enhance specific  competencies identified in their personalized development plans.  These  assignments provide participants with the opportunity to learn new skills  and apply existing skills in different situations and experience an increased  level of authority, responsibility, and accountability.  For example, a civilian  from technical operations and a police officer were given a 1-year  assignment to create balanced scorecards that are linked to RCMP\u2019s goals.  Another program assignment involved placing a line officer, previously in  charge of a single RCMP unit, in the position of acting district commander  responsible for the command of multiple units during a period of resource  and financial constraint.  To reinforce the learning that comes from the  developmental assignments, participants attend a 6-week educational  program provided by Canada\u2019s Centre for Management and Development  that covers the personal, interpersonal, managerial, and organizational  dimensions of leadership.  Each participant also benefits from the support  and professional expertise of a senior-level mentor.  Staff who complete  this program will be required to continue their formal development as  RCMP officer candidates.", "In Canada\u2019s Accelerated Executive Development Program (AEXDP),  developmental assignments form the cornerstone of efforts to prepare  senior executives for top leadership roles in the public service.  Canada  created AEXDP in 1997 to strategically manage the development of senior  executives who have the potential to become assistant deputy ministers  within 2 to 6 years.  AEXDP prepares individuals for these senior  leadership positions through the support of coaches and mentors, formal  learning events, and placements in a series of challenging developmental  assignments.  These stretch assignments help enhance executive  competencies by having participants perform work in areas that are  unfamiliar or challenging to them in any of a large number of agencies  throughout the Canadian Public Service.  For example, a participant with a  background in policy could develop his or her managerial competencies  through an assignment to manage a direct service delivery program in a  different agency.  Central to the benefit of such assignments is that they  provide staff with the opportunity to practice new skills in a real-time  setting.  Further, each assignment lasts approximately 2 years, which  allows time for participants to maximize their learning experience while  providing agencies with sufficient opportunity to gain a real benefit from  the participants\u2019 contributions.", "AEXDP reinforces the learning provided by the developmental assignments  with activities such as \u201caction learning groups\u201d where small groups of five  or six program participants meet periodically to collectively reflect on and  address actual work situations or challenges facing individual participants.  A senior official involved in the program told us that the developmental  placements help participants obtain in-depth experience in how other  organizations make decisions and solve problems, while simultaneously  developing a governmentwide network of contacts that they can call on for  expertise and advice in the future.", "One challenge sometimes encountered with developmental assignments in  general is that executives and managers resist letting their high-potential  staff leave their current positions to move to another organization.  Agencies in other countries have developed several approaches to respond  to this challenge.  For example, once individuals are accepted into Canada\u2019s  AEXDP, they are employees of, and paid by, the Public Service  Commission, a central agency.  Officials affiliated with AEXDP told us that  not having to pay participants\u2019 salaries makes executives more willing to  allow talented staff to leave for developmental assignments and it fosters a  governmentwide, rather than an agency-specific, culture among the  AEXDP participants.", "In New Zealand, a senior official at the State Services Commission, the  central agency responsible for ensuring that agencies develop public  service leadership capability, told us that the Commission has  recommended legislation that would require that agency chief executives  work in partnership with the State Services Commissioner to find ways to  release talented people for external developmental assignments.  In  addition, the government has appropriated NZ$600,000 (about U.S.$344,000  in July 2003) over the next 4 years to help the Commissioner assist agency  chief executives who might like to release an individual for a  developmental assignment but are inhibited from doing so because of  financial constraints, including those associated with finding a  replacement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Address Specific Human Capital Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Leading organizations stay alert to human capital challenges and respond  accordingly.

Leading organizations recognize  that diversity can be an organizational strength that contributes to  achieving results.

This program is intended to achieve a governmentwide goal to  double the representation of ethnic minorities in the Senior Civil Service  from 1.6 percent in 1998 to 3.2 percent by 2005.  Pathways provides  executive coaching, skills training, and the chance for participants to  demonstrate their potential and talent through a variety of developmental  activities such as projects and short-term work placements.  A Cabinet  Office official told us that the program is actively marketed through a series  of nationwide informational meetings held in locations with large ethnic  minority populations.  In addition, program information is sent to  government agency chief executives and human capital directors, and the  top 600 senior executives across the civil service, and executives are  encouraged to supplement the self-nominating process by nominating  potential candidates.  This official noted that although the first Pathways  class will not graduate until November 2003, 2 out of the 20 participants  have already been promoted to the Senior Civil Service.", "Rather than a specific program, Canada uses AEXDP, an essential  component of their succession planning and management process for  senior executives, as a tool to help achieve a governmentwide diversity  target.  For example, the government has set a goal that by 2003, certain  minorities will represent 20 percent of participants in all management  development programs.  After conducting a survey of minorities, who  showed a considerable level of interest in the program, officials from  AEXDP devoted 1 year\u2019s recruitment efforts to identify and select qualified  minorities.  The program reported that, in the three prior AEXDP classes,  such minorities represented 4.5 percent of the total number of participants;  however, by March 2002, AEXDP achieved the goal of 20 percent minority  participation.  In addition, an independent evaluation by an outside  consulting firm found that the percentage of these minorities participating  in AEXDP is more than three times the percentage in the general senior  executive population.", "Maintain Leadership Capacity.  Both at home and abroad, a large  percentage of senior executives will be eligible to retire over the next  several years.  In the United States, for example, the federal government  faces an estimated loss of more than half of the career SES by October  2007.Other countries that face the same demographic trend use  succession planning and management to maintain leadership capacity in  anticipation of the turnover of their senior executive corps due to expected  retirements.  Canada is using AEXDP to address impending retirements of  assistant deputy ministers\u2014one of the most senior executive-level  positions in its civil service.  As of February 2003, for example, 76 percent  of this group are over 50, and approximately 75 percent are eligible to retire  between now and 2008.  A recent independent evaluation of AEXDP by an  outside consulting firm found the program to be successful and concluded  that AEXDP participants are promoted in greater numbers than, and at a  significantly accelerated rate over, their nonprogram counterparts.  Specifically, of the participants who joined the program at the entry level,  39 percent had been promoted one level and another 7 percent had been  promoted two levels within 1 year compared to only 9 percent and 1  percent for nonparticipants during the same period.

Beginning in 2000, the United Kingdom\u2019s Cabinet Office  started on a process that continues today of restructuring the content of its  leadership and management development programs to reflect this new  emphasis on service delivery.  For example, the Top Management  Programme supports senior executives in developing behaviors and skills  for effective and responsive service delivery, and provides the opportunity  to discuss and receive expert guidance in topics, tools, and issues  associated with the delivery and reform agenda.  These programs typically  focus on specific areas that have traditionally not been emphasized for  executives such as partnerships with the private sector and risk  assessment and management.  A senior Cabinet Office official responsible  for executive development told us that mastering such skills is key to an  executive\u2019s ability to deliver the results intended in the government\u2019s  agenda.", "The United Kingdom\u2019s Department of Health has embarked on a major  reform effort involving a 10-year plan to modernize the National Health  Service by, among other things, devolving power from the government to  the local health services that perform well for their patients, and breaking  down occupational boundaries to give staff greater flexibility to provide  care.  A National Health Service official told us that the service recognizes  the key contribution that succession planning and management programs  can have and, therefore, selects and places executives who will champion  its reform and healthcare service delivery improvement efforts.  For  example, the Service\u2019s National Primary Care Development Team created a  leadership development program specifically tailored for clinicians with  the expectation that they will, in turn, champion new clinical approaches  and help manage the professional and organizational change taking place  within the health service.", "At the FCA, preparing future leaders who could help the organization  successfully adapt to recent changes in how it delivers services is one of  the objectives of the agency\u2019s Leadership, Excellence, Achievement,  Progression program, established in 2002.  Specifically, over the last few  years FCA has placed an increased emphasis on the needs of external  stakeholders.  This new emphasis is reflected in the leadership capabilities  FCA uses when selecting and developing program participants.  For  example, one of these capabilities, \u201cnurturing internal and external  relationships,\u201d emphasizes the importance of taking all stakeholders into  account when making decisions, in contrast to the FCA\u2019s traditional  internally focused culture.  In addition, according to a senior human capital  manager, individuals selected to participate in the FCA\u2019s leadership  development program are expected to function as \u201cnational drivers of  change within the Court.\u201d  To this end, the program provides participants  with a combination of developmental assignments and formal training  opportunities that place an emphasis on areas such as project and people  management, leadership, and effective change management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As governmental agencies around the world anticipate the need for leaders  and other key employees with the necessary competencies to successfully meet the complex challenges of the 21st century, they are choosing  succession planning and management initiatives that go beyond simply  replacing individuals in order to recreate the existing organization, to  initiatives that strategically position the organization for the future.  Collectively, the experiences of agencies in Australia, Canada, New  Zealand, and the United Kingdom demonstrate how governments are using  succession planning and management initiatives that receive the active  support of top leadership, link to strategic planning, identify talent  throughout the organization, emphasize developmental assignments in  addition to formal training, address specific human capital challenges, and  facilitate broader transformation efforts.  Taken together, these practices  give agencies a potentially powerful set of tools with which to strategically  manage their most important asset\u2014their human capital.", "While there is no one right way for organizations to manage the succession  of their leaders and other key employees, the experiences of agencies in  these four countries provide insights into how other governments are  adopting succession practices that protect and enhance organizational  capacity.

We reviewed the  public management and human capital literature and spoke with subject  matter experts to obtain additional context and analysis regarding  succession planning and management.
