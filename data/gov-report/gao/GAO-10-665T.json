As requested, GAO's testimony in Los Angeles (L.A.) focuses on the importance of census participation, paying particular attention to (1) the Bureau's preparedness for nonresponse follow-up in terms of workload and staffing levels, (2) why it will be critical for Angelenos and others across the country to cooperate with enumerators during nonresponse follow-up, and (3) key steps the Bureau needs to take moving forward to ensure nonresponse follow-up is timely and accurate.

On both counts, the Bureau's performance is meeting its expected goals. With respect to the mail-back response rate, the Bureau expected a level of between 59 percent and 65 percent. The actual mail-back response rate when the Bureau determined the universe of houses to visit for nonresponse follow-up on April 19, was 63.2 percent, well within its estimates. The mail-back response rate for L.A. City was 61.4 percent, and L.A. County was 64.7 percent. In terms of staffing, the Bureau met its goals both nationally as well as for L.A. Still, the Bureau could encounter pockets of challenges at the local level where mail-back response rates are less than expected. Further, the reliability of a computer system needed to administer nonresponse follow-up is an open question. Participation in the census has decade-long implications for individuals, communities, and states. For example, census data are used to apportion House seats, redraw the boundaries of congressional and local election districts, and help ensure compliance with civil rights and other laws protecting our citizens. A complete count also helps ensure that L.A. and other areas obtain their fair share of federal assistance. Indeed, a number of formula grants allocate money based at least in part on census and related population data. GAO's recent analysis found that the 10 largest federal assistance programs obligated an estimated $478 billion in fiscal year 2009 based, to some extent, on census and related population data. The grants included Medicaid, Highway Planning and Construction, Head Start, and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Local governments as well as businesses use census data for planning and investment decisions, and to better tailor the services they provide. Nationally, following up on nonresponding households is a daunting task, and L.A. presents its own challenges and opportunities. For example, data from a planning database the Bureau developed placed L.A. County first on a list of the top 50 U.S. counties with the highest number of people living in hard-to-count areas, based on data from the 2000 Census. Factors contributing to the area's hard-to-count challenges include poverty, unemployment, and language barriers. Moving forward, among other activities, it will be important for the Bureau to track various production, quality, and other indicators as planned to help ensure nonresponse follow-up stays on track. In summary, participation in the census is a quick, easy, and confidential civic act that has a lasting impact on states, cities, neighborhoods, and even individuals. But the benefits that can accrue from a complete and accurate population tally can only occur if Angelenos cooperate with enumerators when they knock on nonrespondents' doors in the weeks ahead."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today at the Center for Healthy Communities in Los  Angeles (L.A.), to discuss the importance of participating in the 2010 Census. As  you know, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) goes to great lengths to secure a  complete and accurate enumeration of the more than 300 million people that live  in our country. In fact, the decennial census is an enterprise that few, if any,  peacetime endeavors can match in terms of its size, scope, complexity, and fixed  deadlines.", "For the 2010 Census, the Bureau needed to successfully print 360 million  questionnaires, hire a million temporary employees, partner with over 200,000  public and private sector entities across the country, and align thousands of  disparate activities. The Bureau needs to do all of this and more, do it right, and  do it under an extremely tight schedule. Perhaps most importantly, however, the  Bureau cannot do it alone. To the contrary, participation in the census, just like  voting and jury duty, is a civic responsibility that helps sustain a democratic  society. What does this mean, exactly?  After all, the census is fundamentally a  head count. Does the participation of any one person really make a difference?", "For Angelenos, as with people across the country, a complete count has  implications for political representation and getting their fair share of federal  assistance. This is because data from the census\u2014a constitutionally mandated  effort\u2014are used to apportion seats in Congress, redraw congressional districts,  help allocate more than $400 billion in federal aid to state and local governments  each year, and remake local political boundaries. Census data are also used for  planning purposes by the public and private sectors. The bottom line is that  everything from House seats, to housing assistance, to investment decisions by  L.A. businesses are determined, in whole or in part, by census data.", "This afternoon\u2019s hearing is particularly timely as tomorrow the Bureau will  launch its massive follow-up effort with the roughly 48 million households that  did not mail back their census forms. As you know, the Bureau mailed out census  questionnaires to around 120 million households in mid-March and hand  delivered an additional 12 million questionnaires, mainly in rural areas, as well as  in areas along the Gulf Coast affected by recent hurricanes. Both types of forms  were to be returned by mail. On May 1, the Bureau\u2019s nonresponse follow-up  operation begins. As part of the operation, over 600,000 enumerators will fan out  across the country, personally contacting each nonresponding housing unit as  many as six times in an effort to ensure everyone is counted.", "Cooperation with census enumerators during this next phase of data collection  will be especially important. The city of L.A.\u2019s mail-back response rate as of  April 19, 2010, when the Bureau determined the nonresponse follow-up  workload, was 61.4 percent (nationally, the mail-back response rate was just  over 63 percent). During the 2000 Census, the city\u2019s mail-back response rate  when it determined its nonresponse follow-up workload was 62.8 percent (the  national mail-back response rate for the short form, at that time, was 66.4  percent). For those who did not mail back their census forms, nonresponse  follow-up will be the last opportunity to be directly counted in the census.", "As requested, my remarks today will focus on the importance of census  participation, paying particular attention to (1) the Bureau\u2019s preparedness for  nonresponse follow-up in terms of workload and staffing levels, (2) why it will  be critical for Angelenos and others across the country to cooperate with  enumerators during nonresponse follow-up, and (3) key steps the Bureau needs to  take moving forward to ensure nonresponse follow-up is timely and accurate.", "My testimony today is based on our ongoing and completed reviews of key  census-taking operations (see \u201cRelated GAO Products\u201d at the end of this  statement). In these reviews we analyzed key documents\u2014including plans,  procedures, and guidance for the selected activities\u2014and interviewed cognizant  Bureau officials at headquarters and local census offices. In addition, we made  on-site observations of certain census activities across the country. These  observations included the Bureau\u2019s nonresponse follow-up efforts during the  2000 Census in various locations across the country, among them three sections  of L.A.: Hollywood/Mid-Wilshire, L.A. Downtown, and Santa Monica. For the  2010 Census, we observed key census-taking activities in L.A., as well as in  Fresno and San Bernardino, California; plus Atlanta, Georgia; Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania; and Washington, D.C., among other locations. We selected these  cities because of their geographic and demographic diversity, among other  factors. Further, to gain greater insight into the local census operations, we  surveyed the Bureau\u2019s 494 local census office managers using a series of online  questionnaires about their experience in managing local census office activities.", "On April 19, 2010, we provided the Bureau with a statement of facts for our audit  work, and on April 22, 2010, the Bureau provided technical comments, which we  included as appropriate. We conducted our work in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau takes extraordinary measures to produce a complete and accurate  census. To date, for example, the Bureau has sent questionnaires to 120 million  housing units for occupants to complete and mail back. The Bureau also hand- delivered around 12 million questionnaires\u2014mostly in rural areas as well as in  areas along the Gulf Coast affected by recent hurricanes\u2014for residents to fill out  and return via mail. In March and April, the Bureau simultaneously launched  operations aimed at counting people in migrant worker housing, boats, tent cities,  homeless shelters, nursing homes, dormitories, prisons, and other diverse  dwellings, all in an effort to secure a complete count.", "For those individuals who do not mail back their census forms, the Bureau  attempts to include them through its nonresponse follow-up operation, which is  scheduled to run from May 1 through July 10.  During this operation, over  600,000 enumerators are to go door-to-door collecting census information from  each address from which a questionnaire was not received. Nonresponse follow- up is the most costly and labor-intensive of all census-taking operations. The  Bureau expects nonresponse follow-up will cost around $2.3 billion, or around  16 percent of the decennial\u2019s total estimated lifecycle cost of around $14.7  billion. By comparison, according to Bureau data on the 2000 nonresponse  follow-up operation, labor, mileage, and certain administrative costs alone  amounted to around $1.76 billion (in 2010 dollars), or about 22 percent of the  total $8.15 billion (in 2010 dollars) lifecycle cost of the 2000 Census.", "Importantly, nonresponse follow-up is the last opportunity for people to be  directly counted in the census. Those individuals who are missed by, or who do  not respond to, census enumerators, are included through methods that are  indirect and not as accurate. In cases of refusal, enumerators may be instructed to  try to find a proxy respondent who might know something about the occupants of  a household. If this is infeasible, data on the household are statistically imputed  based on the demographic characteristics of surrounding housing units.", "This is significant for Angelenos for two reasons. First, for 2010, the mail-back  response rate, used for determining the nonresponse follow-up workload, of 61.4  percent for the city of L.A. is lagging the national rate of 63.2 percent. Second, in  2000, minority groups, which comprise a large share of L.A.\u2019s population, tended  to return their questionnaires at a lower rate compared to other groups, and were  more likely to be missed by the census. For example, as shown in figure 1,  nationally in 2000, whites had a higher mail return rate (77.5 percent) than the  rate for all groups (74.1 percent), while nearly every other race/ethnic group had  lower return rates than the total mail return rate. The lowest mail return rates  were those of Pacific Islander (54.6 percent) and multi-racial (57.7 percent)  households. Participating in nonresponse follow-up represents an important  opportunity to improve the quality of census data.", "Despite these elaborate efforts to obtain a complete count, some amount of error  is unavoidable. However, what makes these errors particularly problematic is  their differential impact on various subgroups. Minorities, renters, and children,  for example, are more likely to be missed by the census while more affluent  groups, such as people with vacation homes, are more likely to be included more  than once."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Is Positioned to Conduct Nonresponse Follow-up but Could Encounter Local and Other Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Nationally, in terms of workload (as measured by the mail-back response rate)  and staffing levels, the Bureau appears to be well positioned to implement  nonresponse follow-up. On both counts, the Bureau\u2019s performance is meeting its  expected goals. Nevertheless, national-level data can mask challenges occurring  at the local level, and there are areas throughout the country where either the  mail-back response rate or staffing levels are lagging.", "With respect to the mail-back response rate, the Bureau expected a level of  between 59 percent and 65 percent. The actual mail-back response rate when the  Bureau determined the universe of houses to visit for nonresponse follow-up on  April 19, was just over 63 percent, well within its estimates. This translates into  a workload of around 48 million housing units. Achieving this mail-back  response rate is an important accomplishment as the nation\u2019s population is  growing steadily larger, more diverse, and according to the Bureau, increasingly  difficult to find and reluctant to participate in the census.", "High mail-back response rates are important because they save taxpayer dollars.  According to the Bureau, for every one-percentage point increase in mail  response in 2010, the Bureau saves $85 million that would otherwise have been  spent on nonresponse follow-up. According to the Bureau, it costs 42 cents to  mail back each census form in a postage-paid envelope, compared with $57 for  census takers to visit each home. Moreover, mail returns tend to have better  quality data.", "Key factors aimed at improving the mail-back response rate included the mailing  of a reminder postcard; sending a second or \u201creplacement\u201d questionnaire to  around 30 million households in census tracts that had the lowest response rates  in the 2000 Census, and 12-million replacement questionnaires to nonresponding  households in other census tracts that had low-to-moderate response rates in  2000; and an aggressive marketing and outreach program.", "The Bureau also appears to be in good shape nationally from the perspective of  enumerator staffing. In terms of recruiting, the Bureau\u2019s goal was to recruit 3.7  million applicants to fill over 600,000 enumerator and other positions by April  25. As of April 11, the Bureau had recruited 3,717,757 applicants, or 101 percent  of its target.", "While the Bureau appears to be well-positioned from a national perspective to  carry out nonresponse follow-up, the decennial is essentially a local endeavor,  where the operational environment and challenges the Bureau faces vary  markedly from one locale to another. In this regard, several locations stand out.  For example, the mail-back response rates in some large cities trail the 2010  national response rate of 63.2 percent, and/or the response rate they achieved  during the 2000 Census. They include Detroit, New Orleans, San Antonio, and  San Diego (see table 1).", "Likewise, there are three local census offices that have less than two qualified  applicants per field position--the Bureau\u2019s recruitment target. These offices  continue their recruiting efforts, and the Bureau has plans to staff operations with  recruits from neighboring local census offices, if necessary.", "With respect to L.A., as shown in table 2, L.A. City is trailing the state and  national mail-back response rates as of April 19, 2010, as well as comparable  benchmarks from the 2000 Census.", "In terms of recruiting, the L.A. region has met its recruiting goals. For example,  the Bureau\u2019s recruiting goal for the L.A. region was 266,370, and as of April 18,  2010, the Bureau had recruited 350,187 or 131 percent of its goal. Starting pay  for enumerators, which is based on local labor markets, is $17 per hour in the  L.A. area.", "Aside from workload and staffing, the reliability of the Bureau\u2019s automated  systems, and in particular an information technology (IT) system used for  managing the Bureau\u2019s field operations, is an open question. In earlier tests and  prior activities, the operational control system did not function reliably, and the  Bureau had to restrict the number of users in local census offices because of  capacity limitations. The Bureau has taken steps to mitigate the risks posed by  the unreliable IT systems, including upgrading hardware and software, but time  will tell whether they will be able to perform as needed under full operational  loads."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cooperation with Enumerators Will Help California Count in the 2010 Census", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Census Data Are Critical for Representative Democracy", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution requires a census every 10 years in order to apportion seats in  the House of Representatives.

Factors contributing to the area\u2019s hard-to- count challenges include poverty, unemployment, and language barriers.", "In our review of nonresponse follow-up during the 2000 Census, we noted that  the Bureau has historically faced the combined challenge of (1) collecting quality  data directly from household members, while (2) completing the operation on  schedule, before error rates can increase as people move or have trouble  remembering who was living at their homes on Census Day (April 1, 2010), as  well as for keeping subsequent operations on track. For methodological reasons,  the Bureau needs to complete its field data collection workload before a  subsequent accuracy check can begin.", "During the 2000 Census, finding the optimal balance between these two  objectives was sometimes a challenge for the Bureau. Indeed, to help ensure that  local census offices completed nonresponse follow-up on schedule, the Bureau  developed ambitious interim \u201cstretch\u201d goals that called on local census offices to  complete 80 percent of their nonresponse follow-up workload within the first 4  weeks of the operation and be completely finished by the end of the 8th week of  the 10-week long effort.

Of  those managers in the latter group, a common perception appeared to be that  production was emphasized more than accuracy and that the schedule required  local census offices to curtail procedures that could have improved data quality.  Further, a small number of local census offices improperly collected less  complete data and took other shortcuts (which the Bureau took steps to rectify).", "Nationally, however, our analysis of Bureau data showed that those local census  offices that completed their 2000 Census nonresponse follow-up workloads faster  than the others did not collect larger quantities of less-than-complete data, such  as partial interviews.", "For the 2010 Census, the Bureau will conduct a quality assurance procedure it  refers to as \u201coutlier reinterviews,\u201d where the Bureau is to revisit or \u201creinterview\u201d  those households where characteristics of an enumerator\u2019s work differ from other  enumerators collecting data in the same vicinity. In such cases, enumerators  could be fabricating data. Outlier reinterviews are one of several types of  reinterviews the Bureau plans to use for 2010.", "Although the Bureau had procedures for various types of reinterviews, including  a form of outlier reinterviews, for the 2000 Census, local census office managers  often decided against conducting them. Indeed, 52 local census offices\u2014about 10  percent of all local offices\u2014did not conduct any reinterviews after a random  check of enumerators\u2019 initial work. For the 2010 Census, the outlier interview  cases will be automatically selected as opposed to being controlled by clerks in  the local census offices. This could help ensure that outlier cases are investigated  per the Bureau\u2019s reinterview procedures.", "More generally, as the Bureau completes its nonresponse follow-up workload, it  will be important for it to closely track various indicators of the pace, production  levels, and quality of the operation as planned, and quickly investigate and  appropriately address any peculiarities that could be indicative of falsification or  other data quality issues. At the same time, it will be important for the Bureau to  fully leverage its partnership program\u2014an effort where specially trained Bureau  employees engage key government and community organizations to support the  census\u2014to help pave the way for nonresponse follow-up and improve  cooperation with enumerators. For example, based on our review of the 2000  Census, partnership staff could, among other activities, reach out to building  managers and community leaders to gain access to secure apartment buildings  and gated communities, and take other steps to deal with enumeration challenges.", "However, the initial results of our 2010 survey on local census office managers  suggest that there is room for improvement, in many cases, in the relationships  between the local census offices and partnership staff. For example, of the 395 of  494 local census office managers who responded to our question about their  satisfaction with the communication between the local census office and with  partnership staff, 39 percent indicated they were generally or very satisfied, 46  percent were generally or very dissatisfied, and 14 percent were neither satisfied  or dissatisfied.", "Likewise, when asked about the partnership staff\u2019s assistance with local  challenges, 39 percent of responding local census office managers were generally  or very satisfied, 43 percent were generally or very dissatisfied, while 18 percent  were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.", "The 26 local census office managers in the Bureau\u2019s L.A. region\u2014an area  extending from L.A. proper south to the Mexican border\u2014held views similar to  managers nationwide. Moving forward, it will be important for the Bureau to  take appropriate steps to ensure that the efforts of the partnership staff are aligned  with and fully supportive of the activities carried out by local census offices.
