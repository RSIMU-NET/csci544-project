This report examines (1) approaches that selected VAMCs use to facilitate HIV screening, and (2) the extent to which VHA monitors HIV screening. GAO analyzed VHA documents, including VHA directives and a nongeneralizable sample of 103 veterans' medical records, to understand how providers made decisions and documented actions related to HIV screening.

For example, for the first stage of HIV screening (providing HIV tests to consenting veterans), officials told GAO that VAMCs use information technology solutions, such as clinical reminders that prompt providers to offer HIV tests to veterans who have not been tested. These clinical reminders can also prompt providers to offer an HIV test on a repeated, rather than a one-time, basis to veterans with known higher risk factors for acquiring HIV.", "The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) monitors the first stage of HIV screening by collecting and disseminating data that VAMCs can use to calculate and, if necessary, improve facility HIV testing rates. VHA also collects data on the time frames in which results for eight types of tests are communicated to veterans; these data could indicate how timely test results are being communicated generally (stage two of HIV screening). However, VHA has not effectively communicated the availability of these data to HIV lead clinicians. In addition, VHA does not currently monitor whether VAMCs link veterans who test positive for HIV to care in a timely manner (stage three of HIV screening). VHA officials indicated that they are in the process of building the capacity to collect and disseminate to HIV lead clinicians data on the number of veterans at each VAMC who are linked to HIV care within 30 days, as recommended. However, the time frames for completing these efforts have been extended due to competing priorities, such as implementing required improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of veterans with Hepatitis C. Until VHA improves VAMC staff's access to, or provides them with, these data, it increases its risk that HIV-positive veterans do not receive timely treatment. Such treatment can improve veterans' health outcomes and prevent the transmission of the virus to others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["VA should (1) improve communication regarding the availability of data on the timeliness with which test results are communicated to veterans, and (2) disseminate data to HIV lead clinicians on the timeliness with which veterans are linked to HIV care.

Each year, VA medical centers  (VAMC) test hundreds of thousands of veterans for the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a virus that weakens a person\u2019s immune  system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection and,  when untreated, can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  (AIDS). According to VHA, in 2018, VAMCs tested approximately  240,000 veterans for HIV and provided medical care to over 31,000  veterans who tested positive for the virus, making VHA the largest single  provider of medical care to HIV infected individuals in the United States.", "Research has shown that avoiding delays in HIV screening\u2014including  delays in testing, diagnosis, and treatment\u2014is important for achieving  favorable health outcomes. Individuals who are diagnosed and treated  before the disease is far advanced can live nearly as long as an individual  who does not have HIV, and HIV treatment helps prevent transmission of  the virus to, for example, a sexual partner.", "HIV screening at VAMCs involves three stages. First, a consenting  veteran is tested for HIV. Second, the veteran\u2019s provider communicates  the test result to the veteran. And, third, the provider links the veteran to  HIV care if the result was positive and, thus, a diagnosis was made.  Responsibilities for VAMC providers, VHA program offices, and others  are established in VHA policy that pertains to HIV screening. For  example, under VHA policy, providers are required to offer tests to  veterans at least once as part of routine medical care (a \u201cone-time test\u201d)  and link diagnosed veterans to HIV care expeditiously, ideally within 14  days, but no more than 30 days if possible. VHA\u2019s HIV, Hepatitis, and  Related Conditions Programs (HHRC) within the Office of Specialty Care  Services is responsible for overseeing these aspects of HIV screening,  including collecting data on the timeliness with which providers link  veterans to HIV care. In addition, providers are required to communicate  all test results, including HIV test results, to veterans within established  time frames (e.g., generally within 7 calendar days for positive test results  and 14 calendar days for negative test results). VHA\u2019s Office of Primary  Care (OPC), within the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary for Health  Operations and Management, is responsible for VHA\u2019s policy on the  communication of all test results and collaborates with VHA\u2019s Office of  Reporting, Analytics, Performance, Improvement, and Deployment  (RAPID) to collect related data. VAMC staff who are responsible for  overseeing HIV screening must ensure that the providers at their facilities  communicate HIV test results to veterans and link HIV-positive veterans  to care within recommended time frames. VAMC staff are also directed to  use available data to make screening-related improvements as needed.", "The accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement for the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018 included a provision for GAO to review how  VAMCs have implemented VHA\u2019s HIV screening policy, which requires  that VAMCs use the most current recommended HIV test when clinically  indicated.

We reviewed their medical  records to understand how providers made decisions and documented  actions related to HIV screening. Examples provided from our review of  veterans\u2019 medical records cannot be generalized.", "We took additional steps to address each objective. To describe  approaches that VAMCs have used to facilitate each stage of HIV  screening, we interviewed HHRC officials and officials at the five selected  VAMCs\u2014including primary care providers, infectious disease providers,  and laboratory staff\u2014and their four associated VISNs to understand how  these providers determine if veterans should be offered an HIV test,  obtain veterans\u2019 consent to be tested, and order the most current  recommended test (stage one); communicate HIV test results to veterans  within established time frames (stage two); and ensure that newly  diagnosed veterans are promptly linked to HIV care (stage three).

A provider in  a primary care clinic, a specialty care setting (such as an infectious  disease clinic), or other outpatient setting (such as a women\u2019s health  clinic) offers a voluntary HIV test to an eligible veteran. In accordance  with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  recommendations, VHA policy requires providers to offer a one-time test  to all veterans; annual tests to veterans with known higher risk factors for  acquiring the virus, such as injection drug use; and tests every 3 months  to veterans with known higher risk factors who are prescribed preventive  medication known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Once a provider  obtains consent from the veteran to be tested for HIV, the provider initiates an HIV test order with the laboratory. Although VHA policy  previously required that providers document that they obtained veterans\u2019  verbal consent to be tested for HIV, as of April 2019, providers must  obtain, but no longer need to document, such consent. In addition,  under VHA policy, providers must order the most current CDC- recommended HIV test (which detects HIV antigens and antibodies) when  clinically indicated, and laboratories must follow the CDC-recommended  HIV testing algorithm (see text box).

Officials from three VAMCs in our review  told us that providers often use clinical reminders that were developed  and implemented by the VAMC or associated VISN to prompt them to  offer HIV tests to veterans. (See fig. 2.) According to these officials,  clinical reminders are used to prompt providers to offer a one-time HIV  test to veterans who have not been tested. They can also be used to  facilitate providers\u2019 identification of veterans who are at higher risk for  acquiring HIV and subsequently prompt them to offer these veterans an  HIV test on an annual, rather than a one-time, basis. For example,  officials at two of these three VAMCs indicated that the reminders include  prompts for determining if veterans are at higher risk of acquiring HIV or  fields to document identified risk factors. One of these officials told us that  the recurrence of these clinical reminders can subsequently be increased  or decreased to prompt providers to offer an HIV test to veterans who are  at higher risk of acquiring HIV on a more or less frequent basis,  depending on the risk factors identified over time.", "Obtaining veterans\u2019 verbal consent to be tested. According to officials  from the three VAMCs that discussed the use of clinical reminders, this  technology prompts providers to obtain veterans\u2019 verbal consent to be  tested for HIV before ordering tests. Further, the reminders give providers  a way to document that consent was obtained. For example, officials at  one of the three VAMCs stated that providers can access the laboratory  menu, which they use to order an HIV test, through the clinical reminder.  The officials stated that providers must either (a) document that they  obtained veterans\u2019 verbal consent within the clinical reminder before  accessing the menu, or (b) document that verbal consent was obtained  once they have accessed the menu.", "Ordering recommended HIV tests. Officials from four of the VAMCs in  our review reported that the facilities\u2019 laboratory menus are designed to  make it easier for providers to order the most current CDC-recommended  HIV test. For example, officials from two VAMCs told us that the most  current CDC-recommended HIV test is either the first result that appears  when searching for an HIV test within the laboratory menu or the first HIV  test that appears within a list of different types of HIV tests. According to  officials from another VAMC, the facility\u2019s laboratory menu includes a  prompt that explains that an HIV viral load test (a test that is primarily  used to monitor an active HIV infection) is not recommended solely to be  used for diagnostic purposes if a provider attempts to order such a test for  this purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials from Selected VAMCs Reported Contacting Veterans to Schedule Non-Routine Appointments to Communicate Positive HIV Test Results for the Second Stage of Screening", "paragraphs": ["Officials at each of the five VAMCs in our review told us that staff contact  veterans to schedule non-routine, in-person appointments within the 7  day time frame to inform them that they have tested positive for HIV.  According to officials at four VAMCs, staff first place phone calls to  veterans and request that the veterans schedule face-to-face visits with  providers. Officials at two VAMCs explained that providers attempt to  inform veterans of positive HIV test results in person given the sensitive  nature of the diagnosis, as recommended by VHA policy. If staff cannot  reach the veterans by phone, officials at these two VAMCs indicated that  they send letters to the veterans asking them to contact their providers to  obtain their test results. Further, officials at three VAMCs stated that staff  send letters to veterans to inform them of negative HIV test results within  the required 14 day time frame. Officials from all five VAMCs in our  review also reported using various, additional approaches to  communicating negative HIV test results to veterans, including notifying  them by phone, informing them of test results during face-to-face visits, or  uploading test results into veterans\u2019 personal electronic health records  (EHR).", "In addition, all five VAMCs in our review have developed protocols to  prevent delays in the communication of positive HIV test results to  veterans when the provider who ordered the test is unavailable. These  protocols are generally outlined in facility-specific policies, which we  reviewed, that require that a designee communicate positive HIV test  results to veterans in lieu of the ordering provider. According to officials  at three VAMCs, these protocols apply when the ordering provider is  unavailable for a certain number of consecutive days (typically 3 days).
