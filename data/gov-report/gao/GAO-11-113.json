To address these objectives, GAO obtained and analyzed DOD investment data, met with DOD officials and industry representatives, and attended DOD conferences aimed at facilitating power source coordination."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO determined that DOD has invested at least $2.1 billion in power sources from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2010. However, DOD lacks comprehensive, departmentwide data for its total investment in the power sources area. Availability of complete data varies across the three investment categories: science and technology (S&T), logistics support, and acquisition programs. While DOD appears to have adequate departmentwide data on S&T efforts, it does not have departmentwide data for all logistics support investments. DOD lacks sufficient data on its investments in power sources when they are developed or purchased for acquisition programs. The $2.1 billion amount includes investments in S&T and logistics support that GAO was able to identify, but not power source investments as part of acquisition programs because of the difficulty in obtaining investment data in that area. This lack of complete, departmentwide investment data hinders DOD's oversight and future planning in the power sources area, adversely affecting its ability to ensure basic accountability, anticipate future funding, and measure performance. DOD's mechanisms for coordinating power source S&T--including interagency working groups, conferences, informal networks, and information technology resources--are generally effective. However, in some of these activities participation by pertinent member agencies is voluntary and could be more complete. Agencies may be missing opportunities to coordinate activities--such as avoiding initiation of similar research projects--and leverage resources because agency participation is voluntary and the level of participation by pertinent agencies varies. In addition, DOD's strategic planning process to facilitate the allocation of S&T funds for power source technologies could be improved. The S&T planning efforts can also be complicated by external factors, such as the additions Congress makes to DOD's budget. Although DOD power source experts GAO staff spoke with agree that the department needs to increase its emphasis on power source standardization, DOD lacks departmentwide policies to help emphasize power source standardization. Existing policies have demonstrated limited effectiveness because of compliance problems and because they may only apply to specific power source applications. Although it is generally more economical to address standardization early in the acquisition process, according to DOD officials, power sources are generally not considered early in the process, potentially hindering standardization efforts. DOD has also not evaluated departmentwide opportunities for retrofitting deployed weapon systems and equipment with standard or other preferred power sources when cost effective."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To increase oversight of power source investments, GAO recommends that DOD consider how to best aggregate departmentwide investment data.

This amount will likely rise because of  growing warfighter energy and power demands as well as interest in  smaller, lighter, and more capable power sources. Power sources are a  mission-critical technology and may ultimately affect the warfighter if  DOD is unable to meet demand. For example, severe shortages of some  types of batteries during initial combat operations in Iraq threatened to  significantly degrade the operational capabilities of the United States  military. During the shortages, caused in part by industrial base  limitations and initial reliance on one supplier, the Marines reported  having less than a 2-day supply of certain mission-critical batteries rather  than the required 30-day supply.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 mandated  that GAO determine DOD\u2019s power source investments and coordination  efforts.

In consultation with congressional staff, we  limited the scope of the term power sources to include tactical power  sources used for soldier-carried equipment and vehicle applications as  well as power sources for munitions (e.g., missiles) and satellites. Our  scope excludes power sources used to support installations such as  temporary or permanent military facilities. In terms of specific  technologies, we focused on batteries, fuel cells, and capacitors. This was  based on the predominance of batteries among tactically deployed power  sources, the level of investment in fuel cells, and congressional interest in  capacitors.", "To determine DOD\u2019s total investment in power sources for S&T, logistics  support, and acquisition programs, we interviewed officials within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and across DOD component  organizations to determine an appropriate methodology for collecting the  most complete set of investment data possible. We analyzed DOD  investment data extracted from DOD research and logistics support  databases and also other data that we gathered from pertinent DOD  components. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of providing approximate or minimum investment amounts in  S&T and logistics support in this report. To assess the extent to which  DOD coordinates power source S&T investments, we interviewed officials  across the military services, other pertinent DOD components, DOE, and  the power source industry. In addition, we attended private sector and  federal government conferences related to power sources, took part in  training sessions related to DOD-wide information-sharing resources, and  collected information from the membership of a power sources industry  association. We also drew extensively on other GAO work related to  interagency coordination.

DOD\u2019s power source investment is expected to rise because  of an increased reliance on advanced weapon systems and equipment an ongoing efforts to develop new technologies that are smaller, lighter, and   Batteries are devices that convert chemical energy  more power dense. into electrical energy. The two main types of batteries are primary (non- rechargeable) and secondary (rechargeable). Primary batteries, which are  discarded after their charge has been depleted, are the most common  battery type for soldier-carried applications. A subclass of primary  d  batteries called thermal batteries is used for short-term, high-power  applications (e.g., missiles). While primary batteries typically self- discharge available energy when not in use, thermal batteries have a  longer shelf life because they remain inert until activated. Secondary  batteries, which can be reenergized after their charge has been depleted,  are less commonly used by deployed units than primary batteries.  However, the Army has undertaken educational campaigns to increase  their use in light of some cost efficiencies and operational advantages\u2014 including overall weight reduction of soldiers\u2019 equipment. Further, the  military services are interested in transitioning from non-rechargeable  batteries to secondary batteries because their use by deployed units may  decrease the number of vehicle convoys needed to supply batteries in war  zones. DOD is also interested in limiting the proliferation of battery types  to reduce the number of different battery types the soldiers have to carry  and limit soldier confusion over which battery is required to operate a  device\u2014thus simplifying operations and resupply. See figure 1 for a  sample of DOD\u2019s power source inventory.", "In general, fuel cells and capacitors are less mature technologies than  batteries with respect to defense applications. Fuel cells are  electrochemical devices that convert the chemical energy in a fuel, such as  hydrogen, into electrical energy. Fuel cells look and function very similar  to batteries. However, the available energy of a battery is stored within the  battery\u2014and its performance will decline as that energy is depleted\u2014 while a fuel cell continues to convert chemical energy to electricity as long  as it has a supply of fuel. Capacitors are passive electrical components  that store energy and may be used for a wide range of commercial and  defense applications. Although most capacitors are used for small,  primarily consumer-oriented electronic devices, they are increasingly  being developed for high-power weaponry. DOD research organizations  have ongoing S&T efforts focused on maturing fuel cell and capacitor  technologies so they can be deployed. Given the developmental nature of  these technologies\u2014as well as the predominance of batteries among  tactically deployed power sources\u2014this report principally discusses  batteries.", "DOD invests in power sources in three broad, interrelated investment  categories: (1) S&T efforts related to developing and improving power  source technologies, (2) purchasing power sources for logistics support as  part of routine warfighter resupply, and (3) developing or purchasing  power sources for integration into a weapon system or equipment as part  of an acquisition program. Ideally, technologies developed as part of S&T  efforts will ultimately be incorporated into new or existing weapon  systems or equipment. These three investment categories are described  below.  1.  S&T: DOD research, development, test and evaluation investment is  separated into seven discrete investment categories known as budget  activities. The first three categories represent basic and applied  research and technology development activities and are collectively  known as S&T activities. These can include activities such as  developing or improving upon different chemical combinations that  enhance energy storage or power output capabilities, developing  lighter components, and identifying and incorporating novel material  components. This research may be conducted by many different  entities, including DOD research centers and other government  laboratories, power sources manufacturers, and academic institutions.  According to DOD officials, these projects may be funded through a  variety of mechanisms, including a DOD component\u2019s base budget;  small business programs, such as the Small Business Innovation  Research (SBIR) program; and additions Congress makes to DOD\u2019s  budget (i.e., congressional add-ons).  2.  Logistics support: This category includes the provision of logistical  services, materiel, and transportation required to support the military  in the continental United States and worldwide. Power sources are like  any other materiel requirements of military units, such as food and  clothing, in that they are a consumable commodity that must be  reordered and resupplied according to military service needs. Power  sources for logistics support are typically purchased through the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which is the primary supplying agent  for DOD.  3.  Acquisition programs: This category includes the selection of a  military standard power source, the selection of a commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) power source, or the design, development, and  production of a program-unique power source as part of a DOD  acquisition program. This process may be managed by the program  office responsible for the weapon system or equipment acquisition, the  contractor developing the system, or both. Since virtually all weapon  systems and equipment include a power source, most acquisition  programs have to undergo this process.", "For the purpose of this report, we define coordination as any joint activity  by two or more organizations that is intended to produce more public  value than could be produced when the organizations act alone. As we  have previously reported, interagency coordination is important to avoid  carrying out programs in a fragmented, uncoordinated way in areas where  multiple agencies address a similar mission. Standardization, which is a  form of coordination, includes efforts to expand the use of common or  interchangeable parts by developing and agreeing on compatible  standards. With respect to power sources, this may include developing  standard shapes to facilitate the use of common, nonproprietary power  sources in a range of weapon systems and equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Comprehensive, Departmentwide Data on Some Power Source Investments", "paragraphs": ["DOD lacks comprehensive, departmentwide data for its total investment in  the power sources area and no single DOD office aggregates these data  across all investment categories.

We asked  some program offices if they could provide basic cost information on the  principal power sources used by their programs. Some program offices  provided this information, but others did not. Some offices that could not  provide this information provided an explanation; for example, one  program office told us that the cost for the power source was built into the  overall cost for the system and thus was not broken out as a specific  expense.

Officials from the Office of the Director of  Operational Energy Plans and Programs, an office within OSD that serves  as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and others regarding  operational energy, concurred.

They stated  that this would be a labor-intensive data collection effort given the large  number of DOD acquisition programs.", "In order to gain an understanding of how some acquisition programs  determined which power sources would be used by their programs, we  asked several Army, Navy, and Air Force acquisition program offices to  provide us with information on this process. Although these offices  provided responses with varying levels of detail, we determined that there  are several methods by which a program office may acquire power  sources. For example:    Selection of existing military standard power sources: The  program office for the V-22 Osprey, a tilt rotor aircraft developed by  the Navy in the 1980s, followed a mandatory Navy specification for  rotary aircraft that required the use of government-furnished batteries  made to DOD military standards. According to the program office, the  V-22 program tested two military standard batteries already used in  two other aircraft and determined that they met the power source  requirements of the V-22. As such, the program selected these two  batteries for use by the V-22. Because the V-22 selected preexisting  batteries, the program incurred no development costs; the combined  unit costs provided were $3,688.", "Selection of COTS power sources: Officials from the Navy\u2019s P-8A  Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft told us the program uses a COTS  battery as the principal power source for its electronics systems. The  P-8A is derived from a Boeing 737 commercial aircraft and has roles in  antisubmarine and antisurface warfare as well as intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance. The program office assessed the  suitability of the power source used by the Boeing 737 and found that  this COTS solution met their requirements and selected it for use by  the program. Because the P-8A selected a preexisting COTS battery,  the program incurred no development costs associated with program- unique power sources. The unit cost provided was $11,500.", "Development of program-unique power sources: Officials in the  Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile program office told us that they  determined that the program required the design, development, and  production of a program-unique thermal battery because of the  missile\u2019s strict design parameters in terms of internal space available  for the power source.

Additionally, both DOD and  DOE participate in several other coordinating groups together to leverage  common efforts, and in July 2010 DOD and DOE signed a memorandum of  understanding developing a framework for cooperation and partnership  on energy issues.

In addition, the charger interfaces are not  compatible, so the batteries cannot be charged using a single charger  without modification, such as through an adapter. As a result, the service  users of the two radios must manage inventories for two types of batteries  and chargers, and the soldiers in the field have to ensure that they take the  correct battery for their radio since the other battery will not be  compatible. Also, the military services are unable to competitively procure  the batteries because each is a proprietary device and the services must  rely on the sole-source supplier of each battery\u2014potentially increasing the  risk of item shortages or delays.", "Though DOD officials we spoke with in the power sources area agree that  the department needs to increase emphasis on power source  standardization early in programs, existing organizational efforts lack  authority and resources to implement any policies. For example, DOD\u2019s  Defense Standardization Program established the Joint Standardization  Board for Power Source Systems to focus specifically on power source  standardization. According to the board\u2019s charter, it serves as a standing  technical group for power source standardization efforts. Its specific role  is to participate in the development of an overarching DOD  standardization strategy for power sources and to promote commonality  of component parts or interfaces by facilitating a coordinated approach  with joint programs. However, the Chairman of the Joint Standardization  Board for Power Source Systems told us that though the board is part of  the Defense Standardization Program, it does not have the funding it needs  to function and thus has had little impact. He added that other joint  standardization boards have significant user funding because particular  acquisition program managers, or sponsors, have a vested interest in the  results of their work.", "Officials from this board also noted that while emphasizing  standardization early in acquisition programs will undoubtedly yield future  benefits, DOD lacks a comprehensive plan for creating an appropriate  level of emphasis on power source standardization and that DOD also  lacks a policy for ensuring the achievement of standardization goals.  Accordingly, these officials recommended in a Defense Standardization  Program publication that DOD establish a plan (in conjunction with power  source experts from throughout the federal government, industry, and  academia) to create an appropriate level of DOD-wide emphasis on  standardization. Further, they recommended that DOD create a policy that  addresses the use of nonstandard power sources and that might articulate  a process of senior-level review to determine if requests to use  nonstandard power sources are justified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Policy Encourages Standardization, but Other Services Lack Comparable Policies", "paragraphs": ["The most significant DOD power source standardization policy we found  related to acquisition programs is section 8.8 of Army Regulation (AR) 70- 1. Two main objectives of this policy are to decrease the number and  types of batteries the Army uses and limit the development of unique  batteries except where necessary. The regulation prioritizes use of military  or commercial standard rechargeable batteries in acquisition programs,  with a particular emphasis on using rechargeable batteries. Program  managers are supposed to coordinate system battery requirements with  Army power source subject matter experts, who we were told are  currently in the Army Power Division. For programs where military or  commercial standard rechargeable battery types are not practical,  program offices can choose from a list of military-preferred batteries. The  regulation requires that program managers obtain an Army acquisition  executive approval\u2014which we were told is the responsibility of the  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and  Technology\u2014if a program manager intends to use batteries other than  those articulated in the regulation. This approval is based on a favorable  technical evaluation by Army Power Division officials.", "Army Power Division officials stated that there are several difficulties  associated with ensuring that acquisition programs consistently follow the  regulation. They said that section 8.8 of AR 70-1 can only succeed if there  is an effective mechanism for ensuring that acquisition programs comply  with it, and they identified challenges that may compromise effective  implementation of the regulation. First, Army Power Division officials told  us that program managers might not be aware of the requirements. They  said that they do not know how many Army acquisition programs comply  with section 8.8 of AR 70-1 since they are only aware of the programs to  which they provide consulting services as part of the regulation. They  could not tell us if any programs did not comply with the regulation and  therefore did not request a technical evaluation before developing a  program-unique battery.", "Second, they said that program managers may not comply with AR 70-1  because they do not understand the potential downstream logistical issues  that can occur when battery decisions are not made early in the  acquisition process. Army Power Division officials said they prefer to get  involved with an acquisition program early in the process so they can help  identify the best battery solution before system decisions restrict potential  choices. They said that to do so they have to earn the respect and trust of  program managers so that these programs will seek technical consultation  early in the process. They added that the Army Power Division proactively  tries to establish and maintain good relationships with the different Army  program offices that might have battery needs.", "Third, the Army Power Division receives approximately half of its funding  via customer reimbursement, meaning that it receives funding from  program offices when it provides consultative services. These variables  put the Army Power Division in a difficult position when current and  potential acquisition program customers of their technical services request  a favorable technical evaluation to support use of a program-unique  battery. Army Power Division officials told us that their evaluation may be  influenced by their desire to avoid compromising existing relationships  with program offices. They added that an unfavorable evaluation may lead  the program manager to forgo consultation with the Army Power Division  in the future, meaning the Army Power Division would lose a customer  and associated funding. Further, these officials told us that if a program  were to request an evaluation of a nonstandard battery late in the weapon  system or equipment development process (such as right before the start  of production), the Army Power Division might suggest approval of the  battery to the Army acquisition executive to avoid delaying production.", "While Army officials acknowledge compliance issues, the Program  Manager-Mobile Electric Power has recently established the position  Product Director for Batteries to help facilitate central coordination to  reduce battery proliferation in the Army based on a perceived lack of  central coordination in the Army on battery issues. This position has just  been established and thus has not yet had much impact, but the Product  Director for Batteries told us that pending approval he intends to  eventually take over and update section 8.8 of AR 70-1\u2014including  enforcement and approving or denying of waiver applications\u2014as well as  any other Army battery standardization efforts. He told us that because he  is a program manager he will have more authority than the Army Power  Division to promulgate and enforce policies applicable to increasing the  emphasis on standardization.", "Aside from the Army efforts, we found limited power source  standardization efforts in the other military services. In general, they are  limited to specific applications, such as aircraft, and are not applicable to  the whole service or are not departmentwide. The Navy has several  platform-specific efforts within the Naval Air Systems Command to  develop military performance specifications for multiple battery types to  limit proliferation of aircraft battery types. The Marine Corps Systems  Command has developed an interactive computer-adaptive tool to help  acquisition personnel in selecting appropriate, existing batteries for their  programs. Also, the Marine Corps Systems Command has a topic paper on  electrical connectors\u2014including connectors for batteries\u2014that is  intended to reduce proliferation of the connectors that connect the battery  to weapon systems or equipment. However, use of these tools is voluntary.  We did not find any Air Force-wide processes for encouraging the use of  existing standard or other preferred power sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Evaluated Departmentwide Opportunities to Standardize Power Sources in Deployed Weapon Systems and Equipment", "paragraphs": ["Although it is generally more economical to address standardization early  in the acquisition process and prior to the deployment of weapon systems  or equipment to the field, opportunities may exist to increase  standardization by retrofitting weapon systems or equipment for which a  proprietary power source has already been developed. However, DOD has  not undertaken a departmentwide assessment to identify other weapon  systems or equipment that use a nonstandard power source but that could  be retrofitted with a more efficient and lower-cost standard power source  with a relatively small investment. Such efforts may provide significant  cost savings and operational benefits. For example, Army and Navy  research organizations replaced the expensive proprietary batteries used  by TALON bomb disposal robots with military standard batteries that are  already in the DLA inventory. Army officials noted that their  standardization effort for the TALON robot generated a cost savings of  about $7,000 per unit of the system. A Navy effort to retrofit TALON robots  with military standard batteries extended the robot\u2019s battery life by 23  percent. Because of the success of the standardization effort in terms of  cost and operational advantages, the Marine Corps and the Army replaced  proprietary battery packs with the retrofitted military standard batteries  for deployed units of the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standardization May Provide Benefits to Both DOD and the Industrial Base", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s lack of emphasis on power source standardization limits  opportunities to obtain potential benefits, including reduced item unit  costs and a smaller logistical footprint. According to a Defense  Standardization Program case study of an effort by the Army to  standardize batteries, standardization may enable DOD components to  offer manufacturers greater production volumes and avoid reliance on  sole-source suppliers for mission-critical items, which may result in a  healthier industrial base and improved operational readiness. In general,  the military battery industrial base in the United States is characterized by  small and midsized companies that operate in an environment with lower  sales volume compared to the commercial battery industry. One study of  the industry characterized the United States military battery industry as  struggling for survival with some companies relying solely on government  sales for income. Further, DOD demand is irregular because of  fluctuations based on periods of increased or decreased military activity.  For example, a surge in demand for some non-rechargeable batteries  related to the initiation of combat operations in Iraq exceeded the amount  that the industrial base could produce\u2014which threatened to reduce  military capability. Though representatives from a major DOD battery  supplier told us that they would prefer to develop and be the sole-source  supplier of proprietary power sources, they noted that absent this option  they would prefer a scenario where companies could compete to produce  standard power sources in order to stabilize their production volumes and  revenue. Actions that could contribute to the health of the industrial  base\u2014such as providing for greater production volumes through  increased standardization\u2014could be beneficial to DOD in ensuring the  continued availability of military battery producers and mitigating future  potential production and supply shortfalls."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The goal of any acquisition program is to provide the warfighter with the  best possible weapon system or equipment. However, in light of increasing  dependence on power sources, supporting the warfighter\u2019s power needs  with more power, longer life, and less weight\u2014as well as ease and  sufficiency of supply\u2014is also crucial. The proliferation of unique battery  types could become more pronounced and ultimately affect the warfighter  as military power demands increase. The current manner in which DOD  manages its power source investments and translates them into products  that meet warfighter needs is less than optimal. Specifically, DOD is not  able to efficiently and effectively plan future investments if it lacks  strategic investment knowledge of its total power source investment in  S&T, logistics support, and acquisition programs. Further, while DOD  mechanisms for coordinating S&T power source projects appear effective,  their success depends on voluntary participation by all pertinent agencies.  DOD agencies not fully participating in coordination mechanisms limit  opportunities to leverage common efforts. Though DOD has some  standardization efforts, decisions on what power sources will be put into  new equipment and ultimately the hands of the warfighter and the supply  system are often not made by DOD program managers and hence these  programs may unnecessarily use proprietary power sources. Improving  management and coordination of the power sources area could help DOD  achieve optimal return on its investment.

We believe that aggregating these data is important to inform  decision making and investment in the power sources area.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense determine methods to strengthen pertinent member agency  participation in interagency coordination mechanisms. DOD commented  that existing coordination mechanisms are generally effective and have  been improving since the office of the Director, Operational Energy Plans  and Programs (DOEPP) was established. DOD added that the DOEPP  office will continue to seek ways to strengthen interagency coordination.  However, DOD did not provide specific information on how it believes  coordination mechanisms have improved or what additional methods  might be used to strengthen coordination. Our review identified voluntary  attendance and varying participation in interagency groups that if  enhanced could further improve coordination.", "DOD also partially concurred with three recommendations related to  power source standardization, namely, that the Secretary of Defense   (1) identify and direct appropriate office(s) to develop a plan to optimize  use of standard power sources for weapon systems or equipment types  more amenable to standardization; (2) develop a DOD-wide policy similar  to section 8.8 of Army AR 70-1 that requires senior acquisition executive  approval before allowing acquisition programs to use a power source that  is not standard or preferred; and (3) identify opportunities to cost  effectively retrofit deployed weapons systems and equipment that use a  proprietary power source with an existing military standard or other  preferred power source. DOD indicated that ongoing activities led by the  DOEPP office are adequately addressing all these needs and no expansion  of effort is necessary. However, DOD did not provide any details related to  specific, ongoing DOEPP activities addressing these needs, and we found  no evidence of any such DOD or DOEPP actions while conducting our  review. While DOD established the DOEPP office in October 2009, it has  only had a Director since June 2010. In late August 2010, DOEPP office  officials informed us that they were still writing position descriptions and  working to gather the personnel required to support their efforts, but gave  no indication that any substantive work had been undertaken. Our review  revealed there is no DOD-wide plan or policy to emphasize power source  standardization, even though DOD officials told us that DOD needs further  emphasis in this area. Without a departmentwide plan to emphasize or  compel early consideration of standard power sources, the use of unique,  proprietary power sources will likely continue and DOD will not be able to  obtain the full benefits of standardization, such as reduced item unit costs  and a smaller logistical footprint.", "By not identifying specific actions the department has taken or plans to  take to implement our recommendations, we believe that DOD may not  have appropriately considered our recommendations, and as a result we  are concerned that in the coming months it will not seek ways to fully  implement these recommendations.", "DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Deputy Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,  and Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director, Office  of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

We excluded power sources for operational or  strategic applications, including power sources used to support  installations such as temporary or permanent military facilities, because of  the size and complexity of the tactical power sources portfolio and its  significance to the efforts of the warfighter. We focused on batteries, fuel  cells, and capacitors based on (1) language in the congressional mandate,  (2) predominance of batteries among tactically deployed power sources,  and (3) the recommendations of Department of Defense (DOD) experts.", "To determine DOD\u2019s total investment in power sources, we met with  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and across  DOD component organizations to determine an appropriate methodology  for collecting as complete a set of investment data as possible. We divided  investment into three categories generally based on the three main defense  technology life cycle areas: (1) science and technology (S&T); (2) logistics  support, or the provision of logistics, materiel, and transportation  according to military needs; and (3) power sources for DOD weapon  systems or equipment acquisition programs. Based on a review of the  budget and on discussions with OSD officials, we found that there was no  central repository for DOD investments in power source S&T. DOD  officials told us that one would have to request the data from each  pertinent S&T organization. As a result, we developed a data collection  instrument asking each research organization to provide data on all power  source projects within our scope. Specifically, we requested project-level  information, including the project name, purpose, budget activity, and  funding history from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2010. We also  requested data on projected future funding, but not all organizations were  able to provide this information. The Office of Naval Research (ONR)  compiled the data for the Navy since ONR manages all Department of the  Navy S&T funds, including those for the Marine Corps. The Army Deputy  Director for Technology from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the  Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology\u2019s Research and  Technology Division compiled the data from the Army research  organizations. The Air Force Research Laboratory compiled data for Air  Force power source S&T projects. We assessed the reliability of these S&T  data by (1) performing electronic testing of required data elements and (2)  obtaining responses from agency officials knowledgeable about the data.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  presenting an approximate total of S&T investments in this report. This  investment amount is approximate because creating an exhaustive list of  all power source S&T projects was not possible because of the lack of  centralized DOD management of this area and the fact that we had to rely  on data gathered by each research organization. Additionally, since some  organizations involved in this area are funded by other DOD customers, it  is difficult to accurately track the precise amounts of funding for specific  projects.", "We also interviewed officials from each service and its component  research organizations about S&T efforts in the power sources area.
