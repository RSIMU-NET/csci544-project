In addition, NASA has maintained recent improvements in the implementation of key product development best practices, which can help reduce risk in projects. Although NASA's overall performance has improved, GAO's preliminary results show that NASA has rebaselined a major project for each year 8 out of the last 9 years, which means the projects experienced significant cost or schedule growth. This often occurs as projects prepare to begin system assembly, integration, and test; nine projects will be in that phase of development in 2016, including the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion) and Space Launch System, which are human spaceflight programs with significant development risks.", "As NASA continues its efforts to reduce acquisition risk, GAO's ongoing and prior work highlights three areas of management challenges that, if addressed, will help the agency appropriately direct future investments:", "Implementing Management Tools. NASA has continued to implement improved project management tools to manage acquisition risks, but these efforts have not always been consistent with best practices in areas such as cost estimating or fully addressed GAO's prior recommendations.

In fiscal year 2016, NASA plans to spend over $6  billion on its 18 major projects, each with a life-cycle cost of over $250  million.

It could also have implications for acquisition management.  Acquisition management has been a long-standing challenge at NASA,  although we have reported on improvements the agency has made in  recent years. We first designated NASA\u2019s acquisition management as a  high-risk area in 1990 in view of NASA\u2019s history of persistent cost growth  and schedule slippage in the majority of its major projects. Our work has  identified a number of causal factors related to these issues, including  poor cost estimating and underestimation of risks associated with the  development of its major systems, as well as a set of best practices that  can help agencies manage development risks. NASA leadership has  made concerted efforts to address these causal factors, but our work has  found that more can be done, particularly for NASA\u2019s largest and most  critical projects.", "My statement today provides our preliminary observations on (1) the cost  and schedule performance of NASA\u2019s current portfolio of major projects  and the implementation of product development best practices on these  projects and (2) NASA\u2019s management challenges.

To assess the cost and  schedule performance, technology maturity, and design stability of  NASA\u2019s major projects, we collected information on these areas from  projects using a data collection instrument, analyzed projects\u2019 monthly  status reports, interviewed NASA project and headquarters officials, and  reviewed project documentation. There are 18 major projects in total, but  the information available depends on where a project is in its life cycle.  For the 12 projects in the implementation phase we compared current  cost and schedule estimates to their original cost and schedule baselines,  identified the number of technologies being developed and assessed their  technology maturity against GAO-identified best practices and NASA  policy, and compared the number of releasable design drawings at the  critical design review against GAO-identified best practices and analyzed  subsequent design drawings changes. We also reviewed historical data  on cost and schedule performance, technology maturity, and design  stability for major projects from our prior reports and compared it to the  performance of NASA\u2019s current portfolio of major projects.

NASA\u2019s portfolio of major  projects ranges from space satellites equipped with advanced sensors to  study the Earth to a spacecraft which plans to return a sample from an  asteroid to a telescope intended to explore the universe to spacecraft to  transport humans and cargo to and beyond low-Earth orbit.

In 2016, overall development cost growth for the portfolio of 12  development projects, excluding the James Webb Space Telescope  (JWST), fell to 1.3 percent and launch delays averaged 4 months. Both of  those measures are at or near the lowest levels we have reported since  we began our annual reviews in 2009 (see fig. 3).", "NASA has made positive changes in the past 5 years that have helped  contribute to the improved performance of its projects. Among other  things, we previously reported that NASA adopted a new policy to help  project officials with management, cost and schedule estimating, and  maintenance of adequate levels of reserves; established a management  review process to enable NASA\u2019s senior management to more effectively  monitor a project\u2019s performance, including cost, schedule, and cross- cutting technical and nontechnical issues; and has improved external  oversight by increasing transparency into project costs. Congressional  action has also helped improve visibility into NASA\u2019s cost and schedule  performance. In 2005, Congress required NASA to report cost and  schedule baselines for all programs and projects with estimated life-cycle  costs of at least $250 million that have been approved to proceed to  implementation. Congress also required NASA to report to it when  development cost growth or schedule delays exceeded certain  thresholds.", "Our ongoing work indicates that NASA\u2019s most recent improvements in its  overall cost performance have also been driven, in part, by the addition of  new, large programs to the portfolio. The cost and schedule performance  of any portfolio is affected by its composition. New projects are less likely  to have experienced cost and schedule growth than older ones, so they  generally help improve portfolio performance. Eight of the 12 major  projects in development established baselines within the last 2 years, and  cost and schedule performance collectively has improved as projects in  the portfolio have become, on average, younger. We will continue to  monitor these trends as NASA\u2019s current major projects progress through  the project life cycle to see if the improvements in the portfolio\u2019s cost and  schedule performance are sustained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Rebaselines", "paragraphs": ["Our ongoing work shows that most current NASA projects have stayed  within the cost and schedule estimates in their development baselines,  both this year and throughout their life cycles, but the portfolio continues  to experience cost and schedule growth. This growth was driven by  projects that experienced significant cost growth and exceeded their  development cost baselines. When a project exceeds its development  cost baseline by 30 percent, it is rebaselined if it is to be continued. NASA  has rebaselined a major project each year for 8 out of the last 9 years.  Table 1 shows the development cost growth for each of the rebaselined  projects.", "Our ongoing work also shows that the cost growth associated with  rebaselined projects often overwhelms the positive cost performance  within the remainder of the portfolio both on an annual and life-cycle  basis. In July 2015, NASA approved a new baseline for the Space  Network Ground Segment Sustainment (SGSS) project, which increased  its estimated development costs from $368 million to $677 million and  extended its completion date from June 2017 to September 2019. Cost  growth from the SGSS was not offset by better performing projects, such  as the Origins-Spectral Interpretation-Resource Identification-Security- Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) asteroid sampling mission. OSIRIS-REx  reported lower than expected development costs for the second  consecutive year, even though it is at a stage in the life cycle when  projects often realize cost growth. The project attributes its $78.2 million  decrease in development cost to several factors, including a mature  mission concept and rigorous risk management process.", "Our preliminary results indicate that the projects in NASA\u2019s current  portfolio with the highest development costs, including Space Launch  System and Orion, are entering the stage when most rebaselines occur.  Projects appear most likely to rebaseline between their critical design and  system integration reviews. All eight major projects that rebaselined  during the last 9 years did so after their critical design review and the  three projects in the 2016 portfolio that rebaselined did so before holding  their systems integration review. Nine projects in the current portfolio are  in this stage of development\u2014Exploration Ground Systems; Ice, Cloud,  and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2); Ionospheric Connection  (ICON); JWST; Orion; SGSS; Space Launch System; Solar Probe Plus  (SPP); and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Three  projects\u2014ICESat-2, JWST, and SGSS\u2014have already rebaselined. If a  rebaseline occurs on any of the other six projects, it could add anywhere  from almost $60 million to more than $2 billion to the development cost of  the portfolio. We will continue to examine these nine projects as part of  our annual assessments until they launch, but they also warrant the  committee\u2019s continued oversight attention.", "Our ongoing work has also found that the Space Launch System and  Orion, the two largest projects in this critical stage of development, face  cost, schedule, and technical risks. For example, the Space Launch  System program has expended significant amounts of schedule reserve  over the past year to address delays with development of the core stage,  which is the Space Launch System\u2019s propellant tank and structural  backbone. The Orion program continues to face design challenges,  including redesigning the heat shield following the determination that the  previous design used in the first flight test in December 2014 would not  meet requirements for the first uncrewed flight. The standing review  boards for each program have raised concerns about the programs\u2019  ability to remain within their cost and schedule baselines. If cost overruns  materialize on these programs, they could have a ripple effect on the  portfolio and result in the potential postponement or even force the  cancellation of projects in earlier stages of development.

The 12th project in development, Exploration Ground Systems, did not  report any critical or heritage technologies, so it was omitted from this  analysis.", "Our prior best practices work has shown that reaching a TRL 6\u2014which  indicates that a representative prototype of the technology has been  demonstrated in a relevant environment that simulates the harsh  conditions of space\u2014can minimize risks for space systems entering  product development. Projects falling short of this standard before the  preliminary design review, a milestone that generally precedes the  project\u2019s final design and fabrication phase, may experience subsequent  technical problems, which can result in cost growth and schedule delays.", "Our ongoing work indicates that NASA has also sustained improvements  it has made since 2010 in the design stability of its major projects. The  average percentage of engineering drawings released at critical design  review for NASA\u2019s 2016 portfolio of major projects was 72 percent,  roughly the same percentage as last year. This is a significant  improvement since 2010, but is still short of the GAO-identified best  practice of 90 percent (see fig. 5).

These indicators include (1) the percentage of actual  mass margin versus planned mass margin and (2) the percentage of  actual power margin versus planned power margin. NASA has updated  its project management policy and its systems engineering policy to  require projects to track these metrics.

Examples of challenges  identified in the report include managing NASA\u2019s science portfolio, space  flight operations in low earth orbit, positioning NASA for deep space  exploration, and securing NASA\u2019s information technology systems and  data. We agree with the challenges identified by the Inspector General  and our ongoing and prior work has highlighted additional areas where it  will be important for NASA to continue its efforts to reduce acquisition  risk, including implementing project management tools, demonstrating  sustained cost and schedule performance, and developing plans that will  help the agency appropriately direct future investments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Implementation of Management Tools", "paragraphs": ["As part of our ongoing work, we found that NASA is taking steps to  improve its project management tools but has not yet fully implemented  best practices.", "Earned Value Management. NASA has made progress implementing  earned value management (EVM) analysis\u2014a key project management  tool\u2014but the agency has not yet fully implemented a formal EVM  surveillance plan in accordance with best practices. EVM has been a  critical part of the agency\u2019s efforts to understand project development  needs and to reduce cost and schedule growth. When implemented well,  EVM integrates information on a project\u2019s cost, schedule, and technical  efforts for management and decision makers by measuring the value of  work accomplished in a given period and comparing it with the planned  value of work scheduled for that period and the actual cost of work  accomplished. NASA has made progress rolling out EVM at its centers  and is supporting these efforts with training, including classroom and  online training to projects at its various centers.", "In 2012, we recommended that NASA require projects to implement  formal EVM surveillance programs. NASA partially concurred, but  according to NASA officials, they have not implemented the  recommendation due to resource constraints. Proper surveillance of  EVM contractor data is a best practice in the NASA Earned Value  Management Implementation Handbook and GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. Without implementing proper surveillance, a project  may be utilizing unreliable EVM data to inform its cost and schedule  decision making. NASA has taken other steps to address the intent of our  recommendation, but we continue to find issues with the quality of EVM  data. In our December 2015 review of the James Webb Space  Telescope, we found project EVM data anomalies and recommended that  project officials require the contractors to explain and document all such  anomalies in their monthly EVM reports. A continuous surveillance  program could have identified these anomalies earlier, allowing the  project to pursue corrective action with its contractors. NASA concurred  with this recommendation and recently sent us documentation concerning  steps it has taken to address it. We are currently reviewing that  information to determine if NASA has implemented the recommendation.", "Joint Confidence Level. In 2009, in order to ensure that cost and  schedule estimates were realistic and projects thoroughly planned for  anticipated risks, NASA began requiring that programs and projects with  estimated life-cycle costs of $250 million or more develop a JCL prior to  key decision point C. However, there is no requirement for NASA  projects to update their JCLs and our prior work has found that projects  do not regularly update cost risk analyses to take into account newly  emerged risks. Our cost estimating best practices recommend that cost  estimates should be updated to reflect changes to a program or kept  current as it moves through milestones. As new risks emerge on a  project, an updated cost risk analysis can provide realistic estimates to  decision-makers, including the Congress. This is especially true for  NASA\u2019s largest projects as updated estimates may require the Congress  to consider a variety of actions.", "Schedule Development. Our best practices work stresses the  importance of a reliable schedule because not only is it a road map for  systematic project execution, but also a means by which to gauge  progress, identify and resolve potential problems, and promote  accountability.

Independent  assessors\u2014a group of technical experts within NASA who do not actively  work on a specific project or program\u2014noted that when they are  reviewing a project\u2019s JCL, one of the most common areas that projects  struggle with is developing a reliable schedule. For example, our ongoing  work found that the Orion program\u2019s standing review board raised  concerns that the program\u2019s schedule is missing activities which could  affect the program\u2019s ability to accurately identify what is driving the  schedule. Officials in NASA\u2019s Cost Analysis Division told us that various  schedule related tools have been developed and already made available  to projects and additional tools are in development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustained Cost and Schedule Performance", "paragraphs": ["A key management challenge that NASA faces is whether the  improvement in the cost and schedule performance we have seen in the  agency\u2019s overall portfolio of major projects can be translated to new, large  projects that have been recently baselined and added to the portfolio.

The concept of stability is  an important one for NASA since projects require heavy investments\u2014 both in terms of time and money\u2014and require cooperation and support  from a variety of communities, who sometimes have competing interests,  including academic institutions, partnering countries, the science  community, and industry, to name a few. We have not studied how the  act\u2019s specific provisions, including the types of leadership structures being  proposed, could affect stability for NASA\u2019s projects. However, based on  our prior work on NASA\u2019s and the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  acquisition management efforts, we would like to offer the following  observations:  If NASA were to implement a board of directors as outlined in the  proposed legislation, the board itself must be willing to hold program  managers and leadership accountable by canceling programs that do  not perform well. If programs with an unsound business case are  allowed to continue, their poor performance could have dramatic  consequences on the overall portfolio.

Further, multiyear  procurement contracts can provide stability for contractors doing  business with the government, but they also can reduce Congress\u2019s  and NASA\u2019s flexibility in making changes to programs and budgets  unless the government is willing to pay the cancellation fees  associated with doing so.", "In closing, I would like to emphasize that achieving stability through  leadership and contracting changes may offer benefits, but one of the  most important factors in achieving stability is a sound business case that  balances the necessary resources\u2014technologies, design knowledge,  funding, and time\u2014needed to transform a chosen concept into a product.  As our ongoing and prior work shows, more effort is still needed to  improve NASA\u2019s cost estimating, scheduling practices, and contractor  oversight.
