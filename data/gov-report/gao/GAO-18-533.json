GAO analyzed summary-level data on NSF's rotators; reviewed key documents; interviewed NSF officials; conducted semistructured interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of rotators and permanent federal employees selected from different scientific directorates within NSF; and compared NSF's management of the program to key principles for effective strategic workforce planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The numbers of rotators\u2014outside scientists, engineers, and educators on temporary assignment\u2014at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and their costs in proportion to other staff remained relatively stable in fiscal years 2008 through 2017. Most rotators joined NSF under its Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA) mobility program. IPA rotators comprised about 12 percent of NSF's workforce and 17 percent of staff costs on average and were not subject to a federal salary cap. They remain employees of their home institutions, with NSF reimbursing the institutions for most of their salaries and benefits. The remaining rotators are considered temporary federal employees under the Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program; their salaries could not exceed the federal maximum for their positions.", "Beginning in fiscal year 2017, NSF adopted IPA rotator program cost management strategies expected to achieve the greatest savings with the least harm to recruitment, but NSF officials said it is too soon to determine the full results. For example, for new IPA rotators who had not yet begun negotiating their assignments, NSF began requiring their home institutions to pay for 10 percent of the rotators' salary and benefits. NSF officials told GAO they expect to issue a report evaluating the strategies in December 2018.", "NSF's IPA program steering committee recommended developing a workforce strategy for balancing the agency's use of rotators with federal staff, but as of June 2018, NSF had not developed a strategy or fully evaluated the IPA and VSEE rotator programs' results, as called for by GAO's key principles for effective strategic workforce planning. NSF officials said they recognized the value of a workforce strategy but were focusing instead on other workforce planning efforts, and they had not fully evaluated program results in part because rotators are blended into the agency's permanent workforce, making a separate evaluation difficult.

NSF refers to these  individuals as rotators. Rotators generally perform the same work and  have the same responsibilities as permanent employees who fill similar  positions within the agency. NSF\u2019s rationale in using rotators is that they  bring fresh perspectives and up-to-date insights about the direction of  science and engineering and help NSF maintain a close connection to the  scientific community. However, NSF\u2019s use of rotators has also introduced  management challenges. For example, according to the agency\u2019s Human  Capital Strategic Plan, continual turnover resulting from the use of  rotators has presented challenges in ensuring seamless staffing  transitions.", "NSF recruits its rotators primarily under the Intergovernmental Personnel  Act (IPA) mobility program, which allows for details of individuals from  state and local governments, institutions of higher education, and other  organizations.

During rotators\u2019 assignments, NSF reimburses the majority of their  salaries and benefits under cost-sharing agreements with the rotators\u2019  home institutions. Rotators may occasionally take NSF-funded trips to  continue research and research-related activities at their home  institutions. NSF can negotiate IPA rotator details for an initial assignment  of up to 2 years and may extend the assignment for another 2 years\u2014for  a maximum of 4 years\u2014if NSF, the rotator, and the rotator\u2019s home  institution agree.", "NSF also recruits rotators from research or educational institutions under  its Visiting Scientist, Engineer, and Educator (VSEE) program and refers  to these individuals as VSEE rotators. Under this program, VSEE  rotators are considered temporary federal employees. They are on a  nonpaid leave of absence from their home institution and receive their  salaries directly from NSF. Assignments are usually made for up to 1 year  and may be extended for an additional year.", "The NSF Office of Inspector General has examined several management  and oversight issues associated with NSF\u2019s use of IPA rotators. For  example, the Inspector General identified the potential effect of the time  that IPA rotators spend at their home institutions on the rotators\u2019 ability to  fulfill their responsibilities at NSF. In addition, the Inspector General  reported that in fiscal year 2012, NSF spent approximately $6.7 million  more by using rotators instead of hiring permanent federal employees.  That report identified opportunities for NSF to reduce the cost of IPA  rotators. In a follow-up report, the Inspector General found that both the  number and cost of IPA rotators increased in fiscal year 2015 from fiscal  year 2012.", "The American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 directs NSF to  report to certain congressional committees on its efforts to control costs  associated with employing rotators and on its progress in responding to  the Inspector General\u2019s findings and implementing its recommendations  related to the employment of rotators.

Strategic  human capital management is a pervasive challenge the federal  government faces and is one of the areas we identified in our High Risk  List.

Data on the number of employees  included the number of permanent federal employees, temporary federal  employees, IPA rotators, and VSEE rotators; the number of each type of  employee in executive positions; and counts of the types of home  institutions that IPA rotators came from in fiscal year 2017. We collected  data on the number of employees and rotators as of the last day for each  fiscal year for fiscal years 2008 through 2017. We supplemented this  summary-level data with data on executive-level positions held by IPA  rotators or federal employees and executive-level vacancies as of  November 2017\u2014the most recent data available at the time of our review.  Cost data included NSF\u2019s actual costs for IPA rotators from fiscal years  2008 through 2017, and actual costs for federal employees from fiscal  years 2009 through 2017, and budgeted amounts for cost-sharing  agreements. To adjust costs for inflation, we converted them to constant  2017 dollars using a Gross Domestic Product price index. We focused  our review on IPA rotators and reviewed VSEE rotators to a lesser extent,  in part because NSF maintains cost data on VSEE rotators commingled  with data on other federal employees and the aggregate data we obtained  from NSF did not separate out most costs for VSEE rotators.", "We assessed the reliability of the data we collected on the number and  costs of NSF rotators and permanent and other temporary federal  employees by performing manual testing for missing data or obvious errors and conducting interviews with NSF officials knowledgeable about  the data. In particular, we discussed the data sources\u2014including NSF\u2019s  grant database, financial system, and human resources database\u2014and  methods used to provide the data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for reporting summary-level data on the number of  rotators and associated costs over time.", "For further information on NSF\u2019s use of rotators, we reviewed NSF\u2019s  personnel manual, public website, and other information provided by NSF  officials on how IPA and VSEE rotators are compensated and the types of  positions they fill. We reviewed all IPA rotator agreements made in fiscal  year 2017; those agreements included information on rotator costs and  cost-sharing amounts and the responsibilities of the positions filled by  rotators. We also reviewed reports issued by the NSF Inspector General  and the National Academy of Public Administration on NSF\u2019s use of  rotators. Finally, we reviewed regulations and policies on the IPA  program issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).", "To examine the strategies that NSF has used to manage IPA rotator  costs and the results of these efforts, we reviewed key agency  documentation, such as documents related to the establishment of cost- management strategies; NSF\u2019s January 2018 report to Congress on  NSF\u2019s efforts to manage rotator costs; and NSF\u2019s March 2018 preliminary  evaluation of its cost-sharing pilot program.

The sample included  two individuals in executive positions (an IPA rotator and a permanent  employee who followed an in-house career path) and four individuals in  program director positions (an IPA rotator, a VSEE rotator, and two  permanent employees). We selected the individuals from 5 of the 7  scientific directorates within NSF. In addition, our sample included a  former NSF employee in an executive position. Our semistructured  interviews included questions regarding the individuals\u2019 experiences and  perspectives on their work activities, the benefits and challenges of NSF\u2019s  use of rotators, and the effect of NSF\u2019s use of rotators on the in-house  career paths of permanent employees. In addition, we asked individuals  in executive positions about the effect of the NSF\u2019s use of rotators on (1)  the ability to set directions for the agency and to achieve associated goals  and objectives and (2) succession planning.

NSF\u2019s policy is to set salaries for  VSEE rotators that are generally comparable to the salaries the  rotators would receive at their home institutions. In setting  salaries, NSF also takes into account other sources of income,  such as consulting, and allows for locality pay adjustments  applicable to employees in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan  area. However, because VSEE rotators are federal employees,  NSF caps their salaries at the federal maximum for the position  they hold at NSF.", "Both IPA and VSEE rotators are eligible for certain other types of  reimbursement. In particular, rotators have the option of having NSF pay  their moving expenses to and from Washington, D.C., or receiving per  diem allowances in accordance with federal travel regulations for up to 2  years. In addition, NSF may reimburse rotators for travel-related  expenses related to their participation in NSF\u2019s Independent Research  and Development program, which enables NSF staff to maintain their  involvement with their professional research and research-related  activities at their home institutions. Table 1 shows additional information  on IPA and VSEE rotator expenses.", "Rotators are generally assigned to one of NSF\u2019s seven directorates that  support science and engineering research and education (see table 2).  Each directorate is headed by an assistant director and deputy assistant  director. Directorates are further subdivided into divisions, offices, or  sections. Each division is headed by a division director and typically a  deputy division director, and each office is headed by an office director  and typically a deputy office director. All these positions are executive  positions at NSF. At the staff level, NSF uses program directors\u2014subject  matter experts in the scientific areas they manage\u2014to conduct reviews of  proposals and recommend which projects the agency should fund.

For example, in all but one directorate, an  IPA rotator filled the assistant director position and a federal employee  filled the corresponding deputy assistant director position. Two NSF  executives we interviewed, including an IPA rotator and a federal  employee, commented positively on the pairing of IPA rotators and  federal employees at the executive level. For example, they said that  rotators maintain close ties to the research community and federal  employees may have more experience with NSF\u2019s institutional history.  One NSF executive told us that IPA rotators help keep the agency at the  forefront of science because they have deep ties with the research  community and regularly publish their own research. Additionally, a  federal program director we interviewed told us that in one previous  instance in which an IPA rotator filled an executive position without being  paired with a federal employee, the rotator\u2019s lack of institutional  knowledge of NSF and the steep learning curve for the position caused  inefficiencies during the rotator\u2019s first year at NSF. The agency, however,  does not require pairing IPA rotators and federal employees at the  executive level, according to NSF officials. For example, in November  2017, IPA rotators filled both the division director and deputy division  director positions in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Science and  Division of Undergraduate Education.", "In our interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of NSF employees and  rotators, we found mixed perceptions about the effect of NSF\u2019s use of IPA  rotators on opportunities for advancement for permanent employees. For  example, in response to a question about this effect, one permanent NSF  employee told us that she advanced to an executive position and that  opportunities exist for advancement within the agency. In contrast,  another NSF employee we interviewed told us that she did not feel there  were opportunities for advancement because, in her view, executive  vacancies created by the departure of rotators were exclusively filled with  other rotators.

Implementing this cost-management strategy, and the other strategies  that NSF adopted, was consistent with recommendations from NSF\u2019s  steering committee for oversight of IPA rotators. This cost-management  strategy targeted NSF\u2019s costs for IPA rotators\u2019 salary and fringe benefits,  which constitute the largest component of IPA rotators\u2019 costs. For  example, these costs were about $34.7 million, or about 89 percent of  IPA rotator costs in fiscal year 2017.", "Previously, according to NSF officials, the agency requested an optional  cost-share amount of 15 percent from rotators\u2019 home institutions, but it  typically received less because of variations in the amounts that home  institutions provided. According to an October 2016 report from the task  force on fiscal oversight, NSF decided on 10 percent for the cost-sharing  pilot program because, historically, few home institutions provided the full  15 percent and NSF believed a requirement of 10 percent would not  significantly affect its ability to recruit and hire IPA rotators. If a home  institution is unable to provide the full 10 percent, the institution may  request that NSF waive the cost-sharing requirement. According to NSF  officials, such requests must be signed by a senior administrator at the  rotator\u2019s home institution and include the rationale for not being able to  provide the required amount, the financial impact on the institution if it  were to provide the full 10 percent, and associated documentation,  among other things.", "Changes made in implementing this strategy, and the other strategies  that NSF adopted, applied to new IPA agreements made in fiscal year  2017.

In addition, the task force took into account  anecdotal and other evidence on how IPA rotators might react to the  strategies. Using input from the task force, NSF opted against the other  potential strategies because it either (1) expected the resulting cost  savings to be small or (2) anticipated potential negative effects from  implementing them, such as increased difficulty in hiring IPA rotators.  These potential cost-management strategies primarily related to IPA  rotator compensation, as described below.", "Capping IPA rotators\u2019 salaries. NSF decided against  establishing a salary cap for IPA rotators at various levels  between about $185,000 and $240,000 annually. The task force  found that salary caps at lower levels would have greater cost  savings because of the higher number of individuals covered by  the cap, but that the caps would also pose a significant risk to  NSF\u2019s ability to recruit IPA rotators. In particular, the task force  found that salary caps at lower levels would disproportionately  affect IPA rotators in two of its directorates\u2014the Directorate for  Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the  Directorate for Engineering\u2014because of the higher salaries of  individuals in positions associated with those fields.
