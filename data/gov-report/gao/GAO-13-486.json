Intended to provide  seamless \u201cno wrong door\u201d access to coverage options, in general,  exchanges will need to be able to determine whether individuals and  small business employees are eligible for a private health plan,  Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP)., This  means that no matter how an individual submits an application or which  program receives the application, there will be a process by which the  individual can receive an eligibility determination using the same  application, without the need to submit information to multiple programs.  Exchanges are to begin enrollment by October 1, 2013, with coverage to  commence January 1, 2014. The Congressional Budget Office has  estimated that about 7 million individuals will be enrolled in exchanges in  2014, increasing to about 26 million by 2022.", "While PPACA places some requirements on the design and function of  exchanges, states also have a number of operational decisions to make.  A state may establish the exchange itself (referred to as a state-based  exchange), cede the responsibility entirely to the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) (referred to as a federally facilitated  exchange), or enter into a partnership with HHS (referred to as a  partnership exchange). Depending on the type of exchange, states are  facing a number of critical policy and implementation decisions, subject to  HHS regulation and approval. Such decisions involve determining  individuals\u2019 eligibility and enrolling them in health insurance plans,  conducting consumer outreach and assisting potential enrollees, ensuring  qualified health plans are certified, and ensuring the exchange\u2019s long- term financial sustainability. In addition, states must develop information  technology (IT) systems that securely facilitate the movement of  information to provide enrollees with answers about their eligibility and  enhance their ability to enroll in health insurance coverage. States are  faced with unprecedented levels of data sharing and coordination  between federal agencies, private health plans, state insurance  commissioners, and state Medicaid agencies. As of March 27, 2013, the  federal government has awarded states nearly $3.7 billion in grant  funding to cover some of the states\u2019 planning and implementation costs.", "You asked us to report on the actions states are taking to establish  exchanges.

An exchange may only offer health plans that are  certified as a QHP. To be certified, a health plan must meet two  categories of requirements: (1) the health insurance issuer must be in  compliance with minimum certification requirements as defined by HHS;  and (2) the availability of the health plan through an exchange must be in  the interest of qualified individuals and employers. To meet the minimum  certification requirements, health insurance issuers must, for example, (1)  be licensed and in good standing in each state in which the insurance  coverage is offered, (2) comply with quality improvement standards, and  (3) ensure their plan networks are adequate and include essential  community health providers, where available, to provide timely access to  services for predominantly low-income, medically underserved  individuals.", "How an exchange determines whether a plan is in the interest of qualified  individuals and employers may depend on how the state organizes its  market.

These separate systems, which may be managed by  multiple entities across the state, have limited interface capabilities. For  example, similar to other states in our review, Oregon operates multiple  enrollment and eligibility systems, whereby only a limited amount of  enrollee information is accessible and reusable across multiple programs.  In addition, Oregon has multiple interfaces between these programs to  support integrated business processes, making systems complex,  inflexible, and expensive to maintain. To address these kinds of issues,  states are using enhanced federal funding, referred to as the 90 percent  match, to either upgrade or rebuild their outdated Medicaid and CHIP  eligibility and enrollment systems to meet the requirements under  PPACA.

These systems are to utilize a federal data  services hub provided by CMS, which will serve as a single source of the  federal data that are needed to determine eligibility. To use this system,  state systems are to transmit requests for data through the federal data  services hub to multiple federal agencies, such as the Department of  Homeland Security and the Internal Revenue Service. The federal data  services hub is to return the data in near real-time back to the state  systems where it can be used to verify the information the states collected  for determining applicants\u2019 eligibility.", "Two states\u2014New York and Oregon\u2014are further along in this work than  the other states in our review, as they were awarded early innovator  grants to develop an IT infrastructure that will integrate Medicaid, CHIP,  and other programs.

Specifically, they will  focus first on ensuring that new systems are capable of determining  eligibility for enrollment in QHPs, Medicaid, CHIP, and the exchange, and  will integrate other assistance programs\u2014such as SNAP and TANF\u2014 during later stages.", "While state officials reported they expect to be ready to enroll individuals  by October 1, 2013 and are moving forward with IT-related efforts,  officials in six states identified challenges they faced with developing  aspects of their systems, given compressed timeframes and a lack of  clear federal requirements related to the federal data services hub. For  example, exchange officials expressed concerns about the timeframes for  implementation, because of the complexities and large undertaking of  integrating and modernizing these systems. Further, most officials  reported that transitioning multiple programs into a streamlined and  coordinated eligibility and enrollment system could take years to fully  implement. Officials in six states told us that developing business rules for  the eligibility and enrollment system was challenging because they did not  have complete information on the requirements of the federal data  services hub. Because of implementation timelines, however, these  officials said they needed to begin IT-related activities before receiving  complete federal guidance. Most officials reported they were concerned  that this could lead to changes late in the development process. To  address this uncertainty, a few states built in flexibility in their requests for  proposals when making procurement decisions. Officials in one state also  reported that, in order to meet timeframes, modifications to the IT  systems will be completed in 2014 (after enrollment begins), based on  guidance issued late in the development process. CMS has indicated that  while the federal data services hub is still under development, CMS has  released guidance to the states on how to access or verify data through  the federal data services hub through such sources as webinars,  conferences, and other forums. Despite the challenges associated with  developing the IT systems, officials in six states reported their systems  will be ready for enrollment by October 1, 2013."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States are Developing Outreach and Assistance Programs to Help Consumers Enroll in the Exchange", "paragraphs": ["Six of the seven states included in our review are in various stages of  developing a consumer outreach and assistance program to reach out to  potential consumers and help them enroll. As a partnership state, Iowa  has not yet decided whether and to what extent it will assist HHS with  aspects of this function. Most states have contracted with or plan to  contract with vendors to design a program. The vendors will assist with  the exchanges\u2019 branding, which will be able to translate materials into  multiple languages and take into account the needs of individuals with  disabilities. The vendors will also design and implement communications  and marketing plans (for example, radio and television ads) with the goal  of enrolling the maximum number of eligible individuals into the  exchange.", "As part of the consumer outreach and assistance programs, states will  use a range of tools to provide potential consumers with information and  assist them in enrolling in an exchange. These include:  Navigators and in-person assistors. Six of the seven states in our  review plan to use navigators and assistors to provide in-person  enrollment assistance to individuals applying for health insurance, such  as assisting individuals with selecting QHPs or providing information to  individuals in a way that is culturally and linguistically appropriate. HHS  plans to assume responsibility for operating the navigator program in  Iowa, since it is a partnership state. Nearly all states told us that  assistance will need to be tailored to the unique needs of their  populations. For example, Nevada officials told us that their program must  be able to accommodate individuals who live in Nevada\u2019s remote frontier  region, where population density can be as low as two people per square  mile and which may lack infrastructure such as Internet access. New York  officials told us they will address linguistic and cultural challenges  reaching individuals in some of New York City\u2019s more diverse  communities.", "Four states\u2014the District, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island\u2014plan to  leverage state resources within existing health and human services  programs to support navigators and assistors. For example, Oregon plans  to model its navigator program after a state Medicaid program that  provides uninsured individuals with premium assistance and access to  health care information and resources. Similarly, New York, which issued  a request for application in February 2013 for in-person assistors and  navigators, will model its approach after its community assistance  programs and will provide assistance through a variety of access points in  other local areas across the state. New York officials told us that the state  plans to sign contracts with navigators and in-person assistors in the  summer of 2013 and begin training them in August or September 2013.", "Web portals and call centers. Six of the seven states in our review are  designing web portals and contact centers as part of their consumer  assistance and outreach initiatives. The seventh state, Iowa, is a  partnership state and is deferring this responsibility to HHS. State  planning documents in the remaining six states indicated that the web  portals and the contact centers will be central to assisting residents. State  officials told us that web portals, in particular, will ease comparisons  among health plans by providing standardized information about each  health plan\u2019s premium, benefit structure, and cost-sharing provisions. For  example, District officials told us that a web portal, which is being  developed in conjunction with the IT infrastructure, will be the key access  point for consumers to interface with the exchange. Similarly, Minnesota  is designing a contact center that will offer multiple modes of assistance  through such means as Internet access, telephone, mail, and in-person  assistance.

Specifically:", "Oregon will charge an administrative fee to insurance carriers  participating in the exchange. In particular, carriers will be required to  pay a percentage of the premiums (up to 5 percent) based on the  number of enrollees in the exchange. The fee is designed to decrease  as enrollment in the exchange increases. For example, if more than  300,000 individuals enroll in the exchange, the state exchange will  charge carriers up to a 3 percent fee. If enrollment is at or below  175,000, the state exchange will charge carriers up to a 5 percent fee.  Between 100,000 and 120,000 enrollees would be required for the  exchange to be self-sustaining using the maximum administrative fee  of 5 percent. Further, any excess revenues generated above the cost  of operating the exchange may be placed in a reserve fund of up to 6  months of operating expenses or returned to insurance carriers.", "Nevada plans to charge insurance carriers a per member per month  fee based on enrollment. In its financial sustainability plan, the state  estimated the fee will amount to between $7.13 and $7.78 per  member per month, which the state anticipates insurance carriers will  build into their QHP premiums. In addition, based on the state\u2019s  estimates, the state expects the fee will be paid by the advance  premium tax credit. Nevada is also considering other potential  sources of supplementary revenue, such as fees charged for stand- alone vision and dental plans.", "Minnesota plans to charge an administrative fee to insurance carriers  participating in the exchange. Specifically, insurers will be required to  pay a percentage of the premiums (about 3.5 percent) sold through  the exchange. The fee will be based on the volume of insurance  premiums for plans sold through the exchange.", "While the states in our review have developed financing options, some  state officials identified challenges with developing these options, given  uncertainties related to exchange enrollment. Specifically, financial  sustainability will be highly dependent on the size of enrollment and the  take up rate, which is the percent of individuals that are estimated to  enroll in coverage out of the entire eligible population. Some state officials  reported that, estimating enrollment patterns without the benefit of  historical data from the exchange, could impact revenue projections.  Further, according to one state, uptake estimates among various groups  are \u201cdrastically different,\u201d so that estimating enrollment could result in  significantly different per member per month carrier fees required to fund  the exchange.
