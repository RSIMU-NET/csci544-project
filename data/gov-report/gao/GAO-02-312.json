Some agencies use different policies when deciding whether to refer allegations of abuse to law enforcement. As a result, law enforcement agencies were never told of some incidents or were notified only after lengthy delays. GAO found that federal and state safeguards intended to protect nursing home residents from abuse are inadequate. No federal statute requires criminal background checks for nursing home employees. Background checks are also not required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which sets the standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. State agencies rarely recommend that sanctions be imposed on nursing homes. Although state agencies compile lists of aids who have previously abused residents, which can prevent an aide from being hired at another nursing home, GAO found that delays in making these identifications can limit the usefulness of these registries.

They often have multiple physical and  cognitive impairments that require extensive assistance in the basic  activities of daily living, such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. Many  require skilled nursing or rehabilitative care. In recent years, increased  attention has been focused on the quality of care afforded nursing home  residents. Concerns with inadequate care involving malnutrition,  dehydration, and other forms of neglect have contributed to mounting  scrutiny from state and federal authorities. There is also growing concern  that some residents are abused\u2014pushed, slapped, beaten, and otherwise  assaulted\u2014by the individuals to whom their care has been entrusted.  Accordingly, the ability to both apprehend those who have abused nursing home residents and prevent further abuse has generated considerable  interest.", "While nursing homes are expected to keep residents safe from harm, there  are a variety of federal, state, and local agencies\u2014including law  enforcement entities\u2014that typically play a part in investigating instances  of resident abuse. The federal government and the states share oversight responsibility for the almost 17,000 nursing homes in the nation. The  recently renamed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),  formerly the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)\u2014within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014is responsible for  establishing standards that nursing homes must meet to participate in the  Medicare and Medicaid programs. CMS contracts with state agencies, such  as departments of health, to conduct annual inspections\u2014called surveys\u2014  of nursing homes to certify that they are eligible for Medicare and  Medicaid payments. These state survey agencies are also responsible for  investigating complaints they receive about the care nursing homes  provide. In some instances, state survey agencies may notify state or local  law enforcement agencies to conduct criminal investigations involving  resident abuse. Depending on the policy of the survey agency, it may opt  to involve the state\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU), typically an  investigative component within the state\u2019s Office of the Attorney General,  or the appropriate local police department in investigating abuse  allegations.", "We have previously reported on deficiencies in the oversight of the quality  of care provided to nursing home residents, noting weaknesses in states\u2019  complaint investigations, annual surveys, and enforcement actions. For  example, in March 1999, we reported that inadequate state procedures and  limited HCFA guidance and oversight resulted in, among other things,  extensive delays in investigating serious complaints alleging harmful  situations. Also in March 1999, we reported that state surveys identified  deficiencies that harmed residents or placed them at risk of death or  serious injury in more than one-fourth of nursing homes nationwide.Moreover, sanctions that HCFA initiated against a majority of these homes  for noncompliance with federal standards were often not implemented  and generally did not ensure that homes maintained compliance with  standards. More recently, in September 2000, we reported that, although  HCFA had begun requiring states to investigate complaints alleging harm  within 10 working days of their receipt, states were not consistently  meeting this time frame.", "In response to your concerns with the adequacy of protections afforded  nursing home residents and the responsiveness of federal, state, and local  agencies to allegations of resident abuse, we (1) determined whether  allegations of abuse are reported promptly to local law enforcement and  state survey agencies, (2) assessed the extent to which abusers are  prosecuted and the impediments to successful prosecutions, and (3)  evaluated whether sufficient safeguards exist to protect residents from  abusive individuals.", "To address these questions we limited our work to acts of alleged physical  and sexual abuse committed by nursing home employees against nursing  home residents. We did not address other forms of abuse such as neglect  or verbal abuse nor did we examine instances of nursing home residents  abusing other residents. We interviewed CMS officials and reviewed  agency policies and procedures for overseeing nursing home care quality.  We visited three states with relatively large nursing home populations\u2014  Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. During these visits, we interviewed  state officials\u2014including those in survey agencies and MFCUs\u2014who are  responsible for responding to, and investigating, allegations of abuse. We  also reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, as well as the state  laws and regulations pertaining to these three states.", "To learn more about the manner in which abuse investigations are  conducted, we judgmentally selected and reviewed files documenting  Georgia, Illinois, and Pennsylvania state survey agency investigations of  158 physical and sexual abuse allegations, mostly from 1999 and 2000. Our  findings cannot be generalized or projected. Where the files indicated that  states had cited the nursing homes for deficiencies, we obtained  subsequent surveys conducted to determine what, if any, sanctions had  been imposed. We also determined the states\u2019 policies and procedures  concerning employees with criminal backgrounds and examined records  of survey agencies\u2019 actions related to nurse aides who had allegedly  abused residents. All three states we visited had established dedicated  telephone lines exclusively devoted to reporting complaints. We called  these lines to verify that they were working properly and to verify that  complaints of physical and sexual abuse would be accepted. We also made  similar calls to other organizations we identified in local Georgia, Illinois,  and Pennsylvania telephone books to determine whether these entities  would accept complaints regarding the abuse of nursing home residents or  make referrals to other organizations. Finally, to learn about law  enforcement\u2019s role in responding to and investigating abuse allegations,  we interviewed officials in these states who represented 19 local police  departments and 4 local prosecutors\u2019 offices.

State survey  agencies\u2014such as Georgia\u2019s Department of Human Resources, Illinois\u2019s  Department of Public Health, and Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Health\u2014  perform surveys at least every 15 months to assess nursing homes\u2019  compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. These surveys are  designed to determine whether nursing homes are complying with  Medicare and Medicaid standards. Nursing homes found to be out of  compliance are cited with deficiencies, which can result in monetary  penalties or other enforcement actions, including termination from federal  programs, depending on their severity.", "In addition to periodic surveys, state survey agencies investigate  complaints of inadequate care, including allegations of physical or sexual  abuse. CMS requires that states designate a specific telephone number for  reporting complaints and that all nursing homes publicize these numbers.", "Complaints can be submitted by residents, family members, friends,  physicians, and nursing home staff. In addition, advocates of nursing  home residents, such as long-term care ombudsmen, may file complaints.When state survey agencies receive these complaints they are responsible  for investigating all allegations, determining if abuse occurred, and  identifying appropriate corrective actions.", "CMS requires nursing home officials to notify the state survey agency of  allegations of abuse in their facilities immediately. Nursing homes are also  required to conduct their own investigations and submit their findings in  written reports to the state survey agency within 5 working days of the  incident. Depending on the severity of the circumstances, the state survey  agency may visit the nursing home to investigate the incident or wait until  the nursing home submits its report. Depending on the content of the  facility\u2019s report, the survey agency may request the home to conduct  additional work or the agency may investigate further on its own. If the  agency opts not to investigate further, it may still review the manner in  which the home conducted its investigation during the agency\u2019s next  scheduled survey of the home.", "To protect residents from potentially abusive personnel, nursing homes  must adhere to federal and state requirements concerning hiring practices.  CMS\u2019s regulations require that facilities establish policies prohibiting  employment of all individuals convicted of abusing nursing home  residents. Although there is no CMS requirement to do so, the three states  we visited require nursing homes to conduct criminal background checks  on some or all prospective employees. All nursing homes must also verify  with the relevant state board of licensing the professional credentials of  the licensed personnel, such as registered nurses (RN), they hire.", "In nursing homes, the primary caregivers are nurse aides. According to  federal law, each state must maintain a registry of all individuals who have  satisfactorily completed an approved nurse aide training and competency  evaluation program in that state. Before employing an aide, nursing homes  are required to check the registry to verify that the aide has passed a  competency evaluation.Aides whose names are not included on a state\u2019s  registry may work at a nursing home for up to 4 months to complete their  training and pass a state administered competency evaluation.", "CMS requires that if a state survey agency determines that a nurse aide is  responsible for abuse, neglect, or theft of a resident\u2019s property, this  \u201cfinding\u201d must be added to the state\u2019s nurse aide registry. The inclusion of  such a finding on a nurse aide\u2019s record constitutes a ban on nursing home  employment. As a matter of due process, nurse aides have a right to  request a hearing to rebut the allegations against them, to be represented  by an attorney, and to appeal an unfavorable outcome. State survey  agencies are not responsible for disciplining other nursing home  professionals, such as RNs, who are suspected of abuse. Such personnel  are referred to their respective state licensing boards for review and  possible disciplinary action.", "Local police departments may learn of suspected instances of resident  abuse and conduct criminal investigations. In addition, state survey  agencies may notify the state MFCU to pursue these allegations. States  were provided financial incentives to establish MFCUs as a result of the  enactment of the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments  to the Social Security Act of 1977. Although one of their primary missions  is to investigate financial fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs, MFCUs also have authority to investigate the physical and  sexual abuse of nursing home residents. MFCUs typically learn of such  allegations by receiving referrals from state survey agencies. If, after  investigating an allegation, the MFCU decides that there is sufficient  evidence to press criminal charges, it may prosecute the case itself or refer  the matter to the state\u2019s attorney general or a local prosecutor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in Reporting Abuse Preclude Immediate Response by Law Enforcement or Survey Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Most of the local police departments in the three states we visited told us  that they were seldom summoned to a nursing home following an alleged  instance of abuse.

Instead, state survey agencies were typically notified of allegations of  abuse. However, these notifications were frequently delayed. Allegations  of abuse may not be reported immediately for a variety of factors,  including reluctance to report abuse on the part of residents, family  members, nursing home employees, and administrators.

Several police  officials told us that, like any crime, police should be summoned as soon  as the incident is discovered. However, police told us that when they do  learn of an allegation of abuse involving a nursing home resident, it is  sometimes after another entity, such as the state survey agency, has begun  to investigate, thus hampering law enforcement\u2019s evidence collection and  limiting their investigations. Most of the police departments also indicated  that they did not track reports of abuse allegations involving nursing home  residents and thus did not have data on the number of such reports.", "When residents and family members do report allegations of abuse, they  may complain directly to the nursing home administrator rather than  contact police. According to one long-term care ombudsman, resident and  family members do not always view the abuse as a criminal matter.  Nursing homes are usually not compelled to notify local law enforcement  when they learn of such reports. There is no federal requirement that they  contact police, although some states\u2014including Pennsylvania\u2014have  instituted such a requirement. According to an Illinois state survey agency  official, a similar requirement will go into effect in that state in March  2002.", "Our discussions with officials from 19 local law enforcement agencies  indicate that police are rarely called to investigate allegations of the abuse  of nursing home residents.

Residents may  also be afraid to report abuse because of fear of retribution, according to  another study and two long-term care ombudsmen we met with.According to one law enforcement official, family members are sometimes  fearful that the resident will be asked to leave the home and are troubled  by the prospect of finding a new place for the resident to live. In addition,  nursing home staff and management do not always report abuse promptly,  despite requirements to do so. According to law enforcement and state  survey agency officials, staff fear losing their jobs or facing recrimination  from co-workers and nursing home management. Similarly, they also said  that nursing home management is sometimes reluctant to risk adverse  publicity or sanctions from the state.", "We saw evidence of delayed reporting by family members, staff, and  management in our file reviews, as illustrated by the following examples:", "A resident reported to a licensed practical nurse that she had been raped  in the nursing home. Although the nurse recorded this information in the  resident\u2019s chart, she did not notify nursing home management. She also  allegedly discouraged the resident from telling anyone else. Two months  later the resident was admitted to a hospital for unrelated reasons and told  hospital officials that she had been raped. It was not until hospital officials  notified police of the resident\u2019s complaint that an investigation was  conducted. Investigators then discovered that the resident had also  informed her daughter of the incident, but the daughter, apparently not  believing her mother, had dismissed it. The resident later told police that  she did not report the incident to other staff at the nursing home because  she did not want to cause trouble. The case was closed because the  resident could not describe the alleged perpetrator. However, the nurse  was counseled about the need to immediately report such incidents.", "An aide, angry with a resident for soiling his bed, threw a pitcher of cold  water on him and refused to clean him. Another aide witnessed the  incident. Instead of informing management, the witness confided in a third  employee, who reported the incident to the nursing home administrator 5  days after the abuse took place. The abusive aide was fired, and a finding  of abuse was recorded in her nurse aide registry file.", "One nursing home employee witnessed an aide slap a resident; two other  employees heard the incident. The aide denied the allegation, yet the  resident developed redness, swelling, and bruising around her eye. The  witnesses reported the matter to nursing home management, which  investigated the situation and suspended the aide the next day. The aide  was subsequently fired. However, the state survey agency was not notified  of the incident by the home until 11 days after the abuse took place.", "During our work we discovered that nursing home residents and family  members who are prepared to report abuse to the state survey agency  could encounter difficulty in identifying where to report a complaint of  abuse, which can further delay reporting. For example, telephone books  for Chicago and Peoria, Illinois, and Athens and Augusta, Georgia, did not  include complaint telephone numbers. Although telephone books in  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, contained the correct numbers  for the state survey agency\u2019s offices, they did not identify the designated  complaint number, making it difficult for an individual unfamiliar with the  agency to recognize its telephone number as an appropriate place to  report suspected abuse.", "Individuals who are not already familiar with the state survey agency\u2019s role  and its complaint telephone line may encounter a confusing array of  numbers both public and private in their local telephone directory. In the  three states we visited we reviewed the government and consumer pages  in nine telephone books and identified a wide variety of organizations,  which, by their names, appeared capable of addressing complaints.  However, many did not have the authority to do so. In this review, we  identified 42 entities that appeared to be organizations where abuse could  be reported and were not affiliated with the state survey agencies. Only six  of these entities represented organizations\u2014such as long-term care  ombudsmen\u2014that are capable of pursuing abuse allegations. The  remaining 36 entities either could not be reached or could not accept  complaints, despite having listings such as the \u201cSenior Helpline.\u201d  Sometimes these entities attempted to refer us to a more appropriate  organization, but with mixed success. For example, our calls in Georgia  resulted in four correct referrals to the state survey agency\u2019s designated  complaint telephone line but also led to five incorrect referrals. Five other  Georgia entities offered us no referrals.", "To facilitate reporting, nursing homes are required to post the telephone  numbers of complaint lines in a prominent location within the facility.  State survey agencies are expected to verify that these numbers are  properly displayed when they conduct their annual inspections and have  the option of citing homes with deficiencies if they fail to do so. However,  deficiency data compiled by CMS do not specifically identify the number  of homes cited for failure to display these numbers, and so it is not readily  apparent how often nursing homes do not comply with this specific  requirement.", "Despite its requirement that nursing homes post the complaint telephone  numbers, CMS recognized that a greater awareness of how to report abuse  was warranted and so, in 1998, it initiated an educational campaign  regarding abuse prevention and detection in nursing homes. Because  publicizing the appropriate telephone numbers for reporting abuse is  critical, a key component of the campaign was the development of a  poster to be used by nursing homes nationwide. According to a CMS  official, the poster will identify several options for reporting abuse,  including notifying nursing home management, local law enforcement,  complaint telephone numbers, and CMS. In addition to displaying these  numbers, the posters will feature removable cards\u2014which individuals may  retain\u2014listing the organizations and telephone numbers contained on the  poster.

Our review of case files  in Illinois showed that the state survey agency consistently referred all  reports of physical and sexual abuse\u2014regardless of whether they were  complaints or incident reports\u2014to the MFCU, which in turn determined  whether to open an investigation. As a result, the Illinois MFCU appeared  to play a substantial role in abuse investigations. On the other hand, the  Georgia survey agency evaluated each allegation and selectively referred  cases to its MFCU according to a mutually agreed upon procedure. In  accordance with this procedure, the survey agency screened complaints  and incident reports before making referrals to its MFCU based on an  assessment of the severity of the allegations or circumstances. Survey  agency officials also told us that, in making these assessments, they  considered the likelihood that reporting the abuse to the MFCU would  result in a criminal conviction.", "The differences in Illinois\u2019s and Georgia\u2019s referral policies yielded  dramatically different results. While the Illinois survey agency referred  approximately 300 allegations of abuse to its MFCU in 1999, Georgia only  referred 27 allegations in the same period. Although Illinois had more than  twice as many nursing home residents as Georgia\u201481,500 vs. 33,800\u2014the  discrepancy in population size does not account for the significant  difference in the number of referrals. Our review of the 50 Illinois cases  revealed that the Illinois survey agency referred cases to its MFCU earlier  than the Georgia survey agency. The Illinois cases were referred to the  MFCU, on average, 3 days after receiving a report of abuse, while Georgia  referred cases, on average, 15 days after learning about an allegation.  Illinois\u2019s policy of routinely referring all allegations to its MFCU enables  referrals to be made more quickly than Georgia\u2019s system of evaluating and  screening all allegations prior to making selective referrals.", "The state survey agencies in Illinois and Georgia referred 64 of the cases  we reviewed to the MFCUs for investigation. As indicated in table 3,  Georgia, which referred fewer cases to its MFCU, had fewer convictions.  By referring more cases to its MFCU, the Illinois survey agency presented  law enforcement with the opportunity to assess whether an abusive act  had been committed and whether it should be criminally pursued. In  addition, by referring its cases to its MFCU sooner, on average, than  Georgia, Illinois also enhanced law enforcement\u2019s ability to conduct more  timely and effective investigations. The Georgia survey agency\u2019s screening  process provided law enforcement fewer and less timely opportunities to  investigate allegedly abusive caregivers.", "In discussing Georgia\u2019s referral policy with survey agency and MFCU  officials, we learned that the agency substantially changed its MFCU  referral criteria in 2000, leading to an increased number of referrals\u2014  111\u2014that year. This change followed a new understanding between survey  agency and MFCU officials based on the MFCU\u2019s expressed willingness to  investigate instances of abuse. Previously, the survey agency typically did  not refer instances that it considered less serious\u2014such as incidents  involving nursing home employees slapping residents with no reported  visible injuries\u2014to the MFCU. According to survey agency officials, they  did not refer such allegations because they believed that these cases did  not meet the referral criteria.

Our file reviews  confirmed that residents were reluctant or unable to provide evidence  against an accused abuser in 32 of the 158 cases we reviewed, thus making  it difficult to pursue a criminal investigation. Our work also indicated that  resident testimony could be limited by mental impairments or an inability  to communicate. We noted several instances in which residents sustained  unexplained black eyes, lacerations, and fractures. However, despite the  existence of serious injuries, investigators could neither rule out  accidental injuries nor identify a perpetrator.", "Prosecutions of individuals accused of abusing nursing home residents are  often weakened by the time lapse between the incident and the trial. Law  enforcement officials and prosecutors told us that the amount of time that  elapses between an incident and a trial could ruin an otherwise successful  case because witnesses do not always remember important details about  the incident. Although it is not uncommon for the memories of witnesses  in criminal cases to fade, impaired recall is even more prevalent among  nursing home residents. Our review showed that nursing home residents  may become incapable of testifying months after they were abused. For  example, in one case, a victim\u2019s roommate witnessed the abuse and  positively identified the abuser during the investigation. However, by the  time of the trial\u2014nearly 5 months later\u2014she could no longer identify the  suspect in the courtroom, prompting the judge to dismiss the charges.  Moreover, given the age and medical condition of many nursing home  residents, many might not survive long enough to participate in a trial.

This official told us that  most of the requests the FBI receives on health care personnel are from  these 21 states. He told us that, of the remaining states, only nursing  homes in North Carolina and Ohio request such background checks  regularly.

They are less likely  to determine that an aide has been abusive if the aide\u2019s behavior appeared  to be spontaneous or the result of a \u201creflex\u201d response. Officials said they  would view an instance in which an aide struck a combative resident in  retaliation after being slapped by the resident as an unfortunate reflex  response rather than an act of abuse.", "Similarly, Pennsylvania defines abuse to include, among other things,  \u201cinfliction of injury . . . or intimidation or punishment with resulting  physical harm, pain or mental anguish.\u201d While this definition appears to be  at least as broad as the CMS definition, Pennsylvania officials told us that  they would be unlikely to annotate an aide\u2019s registry file to reflect a finding  of abuse unless the aide caused serious injury or obvious pain. Our review  of Pennsylvania files indicated that most of the aides that were found to  have been abusive had, in fact, clearly injured residents or caused them  obvious pain. However, these files also indicated that in several instances  in which residents were bumped or slapped and indicated that they were  in pain as the result of aides\u2019 actions, the survey agency decided not to  take action because the residents had no physical injuries. As in Georgia,  agency officials indicated that they needed to establish that the action was  intentional.", "In contrast, Illinois defines abuse as \u201cany physical . . . or mental injury  inflicted on a resident other than by accidental means.\u201d Incidents like  those not reported to registries in Georgia or Pennsylvania\u2014reflex actions  and those devoid of serious injury or obvious pain\u2014are added to Illinois\u2019s  registry. We saw 17 such cases in Illinois in which state survey officials did  find the aides to have been abusive. We also reviewed, in both Illinois and  Georgia, what appeared to be comparable complaints in which a nursing  home employee witnessed another staff member strike a combative  resident. Both survey agencies made preliminary determinations that the  employees had, in fact, abused residents. The Illinois survey agency not  only included its determination in the aides\u2019 registry files, it also referred  the matter to its MFCU, resulting in a criminal conviction. The Georgia  survey agency reversed its initial determination that the aide was abusive  when the aide requested that the matter be reconsidered, even though the  aide did not provide new evidence to disprove the allegation. Notes in the  case file indicated that Georgia reversed its decision because the aide\u2019s  action was reflexive. Consequently, Georgia did not annotate the aide\u2019s  registry information to reflect a finding of abuse and did not refer this  incident to its MFCU. We identified four additional instances among the 52  Georgia cases we reviewed involving nurse aides who hit or otherwise  injured combative residents after these residents had tried, sometimes  successfully, to harm them first. None of these cases resulted in  determinations that aides were abusive. The files indicated that officials  had determined that the aides did not intend to hurt the resident and were  not abusive because the residents were combative. Consequently, no  further actions were taken.", "CMS officials agreed with state survey agency officials that intent is a key  factor in assessing whether an aide abused a resident. However, they  would not necessarily find a reflex response to be unintentional. These  officials indicated that an aide who slaps a resident back could have  developed intent in an instant and thus should be considered abusive.", "Of the 158 cases of alleged physical and sexual abuse that we reviewed,  105 involved nurse aides. States notified 41 of these aides of their intent to  annotate their registry files to reflect findings of abuse, which would  prevent them from obtaining future employment in a nursing home. As  table 5 shows, 27 of these 41 aides eventually had their registry files  annotated. Consistent with Illinois\u2019s broad definition of abuse and the fact  that officials there have not narrowed its scope through its application,  most of these aides were from that state.", "We found examples of delays between the time the state survey agencies  learned that a nurse aide had allegedly abused a resident to the date of the  agencies\u2019 final determinations. Our review of the 71 case files from Illinois  and Georgia involving allegedly abusive aides, and our review of 1999  nurse aide registry records in Pennsylvania indicated that while some  determinations were made in less than 2 months, a substantial number\u2014  12\u2014took 10 months or more. Three of these 12 determinations took at  least 2 years. Such delays can put residents of other nursing homes at risk.  By the time state survey agencies have determined that some aides are  abusive, these aides may have already found employment in other homes.", "The process of determining whether an aide actually abused a resident can  be time-consuming. While CMS requires survey agencies to begin their  investigation of an allegedly abusive aide within two days of learning of an  allegation, it does not impose a deadline for completing these  investigations. State survey agency investigations can be prolonged,  particularly if law enforcement is involved.", "Nurse aides are entitled to due process, but nursing home residents may  remain vulnerable to abuse until final determinations are made. Once  officials make an initial determination that an aide abused a resident, the  aide must be informed in writing. The notification must also inform the  aide that the agency intends to update the registry to reflect this  determination, which would prevent the aide from obtaining future  employment in a nursing home in that state. Because of the severity of  these consequences, aides are entitled to hearings. Hearings must be  requested in writing within 30 days of the notification from the state  survey agency regarding its determination and its intent to include a  finding of abuse in the registry. Hearings may not be held for several  months, and hearing officers may not render their decisions immediately.  No entry may be made in an aide\u2019s registry record until a final  determination is made that the aide was abusive.

While CMS does not require criminal  background checks, some states have instituted them. However, they may  not be required for all prospective employees and may not identify  offenses committed in other states. In addition, CMS\u2019s definition of abuse  is not sufficiently detailed to ensure that all states report every incident  that CMS would consider abusive. Affording due process to nurse aides  who have allegedly abused residents is important and necessary.

These included all of the allegations of physical or sexual  abuse for which the MFCU had opened investigations in 1999 and closed  at the time of our review. We reviewed the relevant files at both agencies.  We also examined 1 month of referrals that the MFCU reviewed but  ultimately did not investigate.

These 14 cases represent all of the  allegations of physical or sexual abuse that DHR referred to the MFCU in  1999 and for which the MFCU opened and subsequently closed an  investigation. We reviewed these 14 cases at both agencies. Because DHR  does not refer all physical and sexual abuse cases to the MFCU, we  judgmentally selected and reviewed 38 additional abuse cases that DHR  had received but had not referred to the MFCU.
