Also, this report examines OPM and OMB oversight in certifying the pay systems through their statutory roles. GAO selected six agencies based on mission, structure, and number of career SES variations. GAO analyzed the agencies' policies and fiscal year 2007 aggregate SES appraisal data and OPM guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["All of the selected agencies--the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the Treasury; U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and USAID--have policies in place that require senior executives' performance expectations to be aligned with organizational results and organizational performance to be factored into appraisal decisions. While almost all of the agencies provided and communicated the importance of considering organizational performance, USAID did not provide its performance review board members (PRB) and other reviewing officials with any specific information on organizational performance to help inform their executive appraisal recommendations. All of the selected agencies have multiple rating levels in place for assessing senior executive performance. For the fiscal year 2007 appraisal cycle, senior executives were concentrated at the top two rating levels, which raises questions about the extent to which meaningful distinctions based on relative performance are being made and how OPM applies this criterion. OPM has an opportunity to strengthen its communication with agencies and executives on the importance of using a range of rating levels when assessing performance while avoiding the use of forced distributions. All of the selected agencies have safeguards, including higher level reviews of performance appraisal recommendations, PRBs, and transparency in communicating the aggregate results, although agencies varied in how they implemented such safeguards. While generally satisfied with OPM's and OMB's oversight, officials at the selected agencies said OPM could strengthen its communication with agencies and executives on how it uses the SES performance appraisal data and correlation between ratings and performance pay in determining whether agencies are making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. Further communication from OPM is important in order for agencies to have a better understanding of how they are being held accountable for these certification criteria and make the necessary improvements to their systems to maintain certification. Further, senior-level officials at the selected agencies suggested options--such as moving to an electronic submission process and lengthening the certification coverage beyond 2 years once their systems are operating at the fully certified level--to increase the efficiency of the process. Moving forward, it will be important for OPM and OMB to identify ways to improve the certification process and make it more streamlined while ensuring that agencies have the guidance, tools, and training they need to implement effective performance appraisal and pay systems for their senior executives."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To successfully respond to the array of complex challenges facing the  nation\u2014including long-term fiscal imbalance, evolving national and  homeland security threats, and turmoil in global financial markets\u2014the  federal government must build the capacity to plan more strategically,  react more expeditiously, and focus on achieving results. Strategic human  capital management is the centerpiece of federal agencies\u2019 efforts to  transform to meet these challenges. Senior executives need to lead the  way in transforming their agencies to become more results-oriented,  collaborative in nature, and customer-focused. In 2003, Congress and the  administration modernized the performance appraisal and pay systems for  members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) by requiring a clearer link  between individual performance and pay. Specifically, agencies are  allowed to raise SES basic pay and total compensation caps if the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) certifies, with the concurrence of the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), that their performance  appraisal systems, among other things, link performance for senior  executives to the organization\u2019s goals and make meaningful distinctions  based on relative performance.", "In our past work on performance management and pay issues, we have  reported that performance-based pay cannot be simply overlaid on most  organizations\u2019 existing performance management systems. Rather, as a  precondition to effective pay reform, individual expectations must be  clearly aligned with organizational results, communication on individual  contributions to annual goals must be ongoing and two-way, meaningful  distinctions in employee performance must be made, and cultural changes  must be undertaken. Most important, leading organizations have  recognized that effective performance management systems create a \u201cline  of sight\u201d showing how unit and individual performance can contribute to  overall organizational goals and can help them drive internal change and  achieve external results. Effective performance management systems that  hold executives accountable for results can help provide continuity during  times of leadership transition, such as the upcoming change in  administration, by maintaining a consistent focus on organizational  priorities.", "OPM\u2019s recently released governmentwide SES survey results found that  senior executives across the government recognize the importance of  linking pay to performance, with about 93 percent of the respondents  strongly agreeing or agreeing that pay should be based on performance. In  addition, the majority of senior executives reported that their salary  increases and bonuses were linked to their performance ratings to a very  great or great extent. However, senior executives recognized the challenge  of making meaningful distinctions in performance\u2014a key criterion for  agencies\u2019 certification of their SES appraisal systems. Specifically, less  than a third of senior executives governmentwide strongly agreed or  agreed that bonuses or pay distinctions were meaningfully different among  executives.", "At your request, this report examines selected agencies\u2019 policies and  procedures for their career SES performance appraisal and pay systems in  three key areas: (1) factoring organizational performance into senior  executive performance appraisal decisions, (2) making meaningful  distinctions in senior executive performance, and (3) building safeguards  into senior executive performance appraisal and pay systems. Collectively,  these three areas cover half of the nine criteria that are critical to  appraising and rewarding senior executive performance that agencies  must meet to be certified by OPM and OMB. In addition, this report  examines how OPM and OMB are providing oversight to the certification  of the senior executive performance-based pay system through their  statutory roles. In July 2008, we testified before the Senate Subcommittee  on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the  District of Columbia on our preliminary results of the selected agencies\u2019  policies and procedures for their SES performance-based pay systems.  This report supplements the information provided in our July 2008  testimony.", "For this review, we selected the U.S. Departments of Defense (DOD),  Energy (DOE), State, and the Treasury; the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC); and the United States Agency for International  Development (USAID) based on variations in agency mission;  organizational structure; size of their career SES workforces to reflect  agencies with a large, average, and small number of executives; and results  of their SES performance appraisal systems in terms of the percentage of  SES rated at the highest rating levels and the percentage that received  performance awards or bonuses from fiscal years 2004 to 2006, according  to OPM\u2019s governmentwide data reports. To meet our objectives, we  analyzed these agencies\u2019 SES performance management documents;  analyzed OPM\u2019s guidance; interviewed cognizant senior-level agency  officials regarding their SES performance-based pay systems and their  views on OPM\u2019s and OMB\u2019s oversight of the certification process;  interviewed senior-level OPM and OMB officials who oversee the  certification review process on their oversight of the SES performance- based pay system and certification process; and analyzed aggregate SES  performance appraisal and compensation data as provided by the agencies  and comparable governmentwide data as reported by OPM for fiscal year  2007. Appendix I contains a detailed discussion of our objectives, scope,  and methodology.", "We checked the agency SES performance appraisal data for  reasonableness and the presence of any obvious or potential errors in  accuracy and completeness. We also reviewed related agency  documentation, interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the  data, and brought to the attention of these officials any concerns or  discrepancies we found with the data for correction or updating. The  agency officials confirmed the correctness of the data or in some cases  provided corrections to the data, which we used in our analysis. On the  basis of these procedures, we believe the data are sufficiently reliable for  use in the analyses presented in this report.", "The examples of the selected agencies\u2019 policies and procedures for their  SES performance-based pay systems are not generalizable to the  governmentwide SES population and all executive branch agencies. We  did not assess how the selected agencies are implementing all the policies  and procedures for their SES performance-based pay systems. We  recognize that focusing on 1 year of appraisal data may not show the  complete picture of how agencies are making meaningful distinctions in  senior executive performance. An agency may have implemented a policy  related to the study objectives even if it is not specifically highlighted in  this report. We conducted our work from October 2007 through November  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 2000, Congress and OPM have gradually shifted to performance- based pay for senior executives through legislative and regulatory  changes.", "In October 2000, OPM amended its senior executive performance  management regulations requiring agencies to (1) hold senior  executives accountable for their individual and organizational  performance by linking performance management with the results- oriented goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993; (2) evaluate senior executive performance using measures that  balance organizational results with customer satisfaction, employee  perspectives, and any other measures agencies decide are appropriate;  and (3) use performance results as a basis for pay, awards, and other  personnel decisions. While emphasizing the use of performance  results as the basis for pay and other awards, members of the SES still  received the annual across-the-board and locality pay adjustments.", "In 2002, Congress raised the total annual compensation limit\u2014from  Executive Schedule (EX) level I to the total annual compensation  payable to the Vice President\u2014for senior executives and other senior  professionals in agencies with systems that have been certified by  OPM with OMB concurrence as having performance appraisal systems  which as designed and applied make meaningful distinctions based on  relative performance. The act instructed OPM and OMB to promulgate  regulations regarding certification that, if met by an agency, would  allow it to access the higher total compensation cap, which includes  bonuses and other forms of compensation.", "In 2003, Congress changed the basis for how agencies pay their senior  executives and the overall SES pay structure. Beginning in January  2004, senior executives no longer received annual across-the-board or  locality pay adjustments. Agencies are to base pay adjustments for  senior executives on individual performance and contributions to the  agency\u2019s performance by considering the individual\u2019s accomplishments  and such things as unique skills, qualifications, or competencies of the  individual and the individual\u2019s significance to the agency\u2019s mission and  performance, as well as the individual\u2019s current responsibilities. In  addition, the SES pay structure changed from six pay levels to a single,  open-range pay band with a higher basic pay cap\u2014EX-level III for  agencies without certified appraisal systems and EX-level II for  agencies with such systems. For calendar year 2008, the pay caps are  $158,500 for basic pay (EX-level III) with a senior executive\u2019s total  compensation not to exceed $191,300 (EX-level I). If an agency\u2019s senior  executive performance appraisal system is certified by OPM and OMB  concurs, the caps are increased to $172,200 for basic pay (EX-level II)  and $221,100 for total compensation (the total annual compensation  payable to the Vice President).", "To qualify for senior executive pay flexibilities, agencies\u2019 performance  appraisal systems are evaluated against nine certification criteria and  any additional information that OPM and OMB may require to make  determinations regarding certification. OPM\u2019s and OMB\u2019s certification  criteria are broad principles that position agencies to use their pay  systems strategically to support the development of a stronger  performance culture and the attainment of their mission, goals, and  objectives. (See app. II for additional information on the certification  criteria). Two levels of performance appraisal system certification are  available to agencies\u2014full and provisional. Through a law passed in  October 2008, an agency\u2019s certification now lasts for up to 24 months,  with the possibility of a 6-month extension by the OPM Director, rather  than a calendar-year-based coverage. Previously, an agency\u2019s  certification lasted for 2 calendar years for full certification and 1  calendar year for provisional certification.", "In addition to SES employees, many agencies use senior employees  with scientific, technical, and professional expertise, commonly  known as senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST)  positions. An agency may apply to OPM and OMB for certification of  its SL/ST performance management system, and if its system is  certified as making meaningful distinctions in relative performance, an  agency may raise the total annual compensation maximum for SL/ST  employees to the salary of the Vice President. Beginning in April 2009,  the recently passed law allows certified agencies to raise the basic pay  cap for SL/ST employees to EX-level II\u2014the same maximum rate of  basic pay as SES members, and also exempts SL/ST employees from  receiving locality pay. Previously, SL/ST employees under certified  appraisal systems had a maximum rate of basic pay equal to EX-level  IV plus locality pay up to EX-level III. However, unlike the SES, their  individual rate of pay does not necessarily have to be based on  individual or agency performance.", "OPM has a key leadership and oversight role in the design and  implementation of agencies\u2019 SES performance-based pay systems by  certifying that the agencies\u2019 systems meet the certification criteria  before they can receive the pay flexibilities. In our January 2007  report examining the senior executive performance-based pay system,  we made a series of recommendations to OPM designed to address  issues specific to the performance-based pay system, such as sharing  best practices, tracking progress towards goals, and developing a  timeline for issuance of certification guidance. We are following up on  the status of these recommendations through this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Are Generally Addressing Key Areas Related to the Certification Criteria through Their SES Performance- Based Pay Systems, but an Opportunity for Refinement Exists", "paragraphs": ["The selected agencies are generally addressing three key areas related to  OPM\u2019s and OMB\u2019s certification criteria through their SES performance- based pay systems\u2014 factoring organizational performance into senior  executive performance appraisal systems, making meaningful distinctions  in senior executive performance, and building safeguards into senior  executive performance appraisal and pay systems.

Having a performance management system that creates a \u201cline of sight\u201d  showing how unit and individual performance can contribute to overall  organizational goals helps individuals understand the connection between  their daily activities and the organization\u2019s success. To receive  certification of their systems, agencies are to align senior executive  performance expectations with the agency\u2019s mission, strategic goals,  program and policy objectives, or annual performance plan and budget  priorities. While many agencies are doing a good job overall of aligning  executive performance plans with agency mission and goals, according to  OPM some of the plans do not fully identify the measures used to  determine whether the executive is achieving the necessary results, which  can affect the executive\u2019s overall performance appraisal. This challenge of  explicitly linking senior executive expectations to results-oriented  organizational goals is consistent with findings from our past work on  performance management.", "To help hold senior executives accountable for organizational results,  beginning in 2007, OPM required agencies to demonstrate that at least 60  percent of each senior executive\u2019s performance plan is focused on  achieving results and has clear measures associated with those results to  show whether the goals have been achieved to be certified. The selected  agencies have designed their appraisal systems to address OPM\u2019s  requirement of aligning individual expectations with organizational goals.  For example, in setting expectations for individual performance plans,  DOE requires senior executives and supervisors to identify three to five  key performance requirements with metrics that the executive must  accomplish in order for the agency to achieve its strategic goals. Weighted  at 60 percent of the summary rating, the performance requirements are to  be specific to the executive\u2019s position and described in terms of specific  results with clear, credible measures (e.g., quality, quantity, timeliness,  cost-effectiveness) of performance, rather than activities. For each  performance requirement, the executive is to identify the applicable  strategic goal in the performance plan. To ensure that agencies are  implementing their policies for alignment of performance expectations  with organizational goals, OPM requires agencies as part of their  certification submissions to provide a sample of executive performance  plans, the strategic plan or other organizational performance documents  for establishing alignment, and a description of the appraisal system  outlining the linkage of executive performance with organizational goals.", "Further, OPM requires agencies to factor organizational performance into  senior executive performance appraisals to receive certification of their  SES appraisal systems. According to OPM and OMB officials overseeing  the certification review process, the main sources of organizational  performance that agencies use are the performance and accountability  reports (PAR); program assessment rating tool (PART) summaries, which  capture agencywide as well as program- or office-specific performance;  and the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA) scorecards, as applicable.  However, agencies have the flexibility to determine the format and type of  organizational performance information for the performance appraisal  process and certification submissions, according to OMB\u2019s lead official for  the certification review process.", "All of the selected agencies have policies in place for factoring  organizational performance into senior executive appraisal decisions and  have identified common organizational assessments\u2014such as the PMA,  PAR, or PART results\u2014for highlighting organizational performance  results. As a next step, a few of the agencies, such as NRC and Treasury,  have developed customized tools summarizing organizational performance  at different levels of the organization, such as the bureau, office, or  program levels to help ensure that senior executive appraisal decisions are  consistent with organizational performance. For example, NRC provides  summary reports capturing office-level performance to rating and  reviewing officials to ensure that these officials have the information they  need to make consistent assessments between senior executive and  organizational performance. At the midpoint and end of the appraisal  cycle, NRC\u2019s senior performance officials (SPO)\u2014two top-level executives  responsible for assessing organizational performance\u2014conduct  assessments for each office that take into account quarterly office  performance reports on their operating plans, an interoffice survey on the  office\u2019s performance completed by the other directors as identified by  NRC, as well as the office director\u2019s self-assessment of the office\u2019s  performance.", "To assess bureau-level performance, Treasury uses a departmentwide  organizational assessment tool that provides a \u201csnapshot\u201d of each bureau\u2019s  performance across various indicators of organizational performance,  such as the PAR, PART results, PMA areas, OPM\u2019s Federal Human Capital  Survey results, budget data, and information on material weaknesses. PRB  members and reviewing officials receive copies of the organizational  performance assessments, which serve as a basic framework for reviewing  and recommending senior executive ratings, pay, and bonuses to help  ensure ratings and pay are consistent with the organization\u2019s performance.  According to Treasury\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources  and Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO), the indicators of organizational  performance are updated throughout the year as organizational  performance is always changing and the senior executives need to have a  sense of the organization\u2019s performance at all times.", "Prior to the completion of individual performance ratings, agencies are to  communicate organizational performance to senior executives, PRB  members, and other reviewing officials\u2014including supervisors who  complete the ratings\u2014involved in appraisal decisions to ensure they  understand the effect organizational performance can have on rating  distributions. Almost all of the selected agencies provided organizational  performance assessments and communicated the importance of  considering organizational performance in individual appraisals through  briefings, training, or document packages for the PRB meetings. One  agency, however, did not provide any specific information regarding  organizational performance to PRB members and other reviewing officials.", "DOD provided the heads of its components with a departmentwide  organizational assessment against its overall priorities for fiscal year  2007 that was to be used in appraising senior executive performance  and, as a check across the components, asked for copies of the  training given to PRB members and other reviewing officials on  factoring organizational performance into senior executive appraisal  recommendations. According to the Principal Director to the Deputy  Under Secretary of Defense for Civilian Personnel Policy, the  components had the flexibility to use the departmentwide assessment  and to develop their own organizational assessments. Component  organizational assessments were required to be linked to the  departmentwide priorities and assessment. Component organizational  assessments can provide a level of specificity that enables a clearer  connection or \u201cline of sight\u201d between individual executive and  organizational performance. Having the components provide the  department with their communications of organizational performance  and how it was used to inform executive rating decisions provides  accountability across the components for the departmental  performance management policies, according to this official.", "DOE provides its PRB members with snapshots of the Consolidated  Quarterly Performance Reports relevant to the senior executives that  measure how each departmental element performed respective to the  goals and targets in its annual performance plan. According to the  Director of the Office of Human Capital Management, the Deputy  Secretary also verbally briefed PRB members on the importance of  considering organizational performance in appraising executive  performance.", "For its most recently completed appraisal cycle, State for the first time  provided PRB members an organizational assessment composed of  various indicators from the most recent PART, PMA scorecard, and  PAR. For the previous appraisal cycle, PRB members received  various documents, such as senior executives\u2019 performance plans and  appraisals and the performance management policy, but did not  receive any specific assessments of organizational performance.  According to a senior human resources official at State, based on  OPM\u2019s and OMB\u2019s feedback for its 2008 certification submission, the  agency has committed to providing organizational performance results  in its guidance to the PRB members on how to consider organizational  performance in making individual senior executive appraisal  recommendations, among other things.", "In contrast, USAID did not provide its PRB members and other  reviewing officials with any specific information on organizational  performance to help inform their senior executive appraisal  recommendations for the fiscal year 2007 appraisal cycle. According to  a senior human resources official at USAID, the agency does not  provide PRB members and reviewing officials with these  organizational performance assessments because they know where to  find the relevant information applicable for each senior executive\u2019s  performance appraisal given the small size of the agency. Nevertheless,  providing and communicating uniform organizational performance  assessments can help ensure consistency and clarity in how  organizational performance is considered in appraising executive  performance among PRB members, rating officials, and other  reviewers. According to USAID\u2019s Deputy Director for Human  Resources, USAID has developed various indicators of organizational  performance\u2014such as individual operating unit reports, the Agency  Financial Report, the PMA, PART results, and the Congressional  Budget Justification outlining agency performance and other  information\u2014which are readily available for use by PRB members and  other reviewing officials responsible for appraising senior executive  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Use Various Mechanisms to Help Make Meaningful Distinctions in Performance, but Senior Executives Were Concentrated at the Top Two Rating Levels and Received Varying Performance Payout Amounts", "paragraphs": ["Effective performance management systems make meaningful distinctions  between acceptable and outstanding performance of individuals and  appropriately reward those who perform at the highest level.

According to a senior human resources official at NRC, the  bonus range for executives in group C with excellent ratings was  intended to help allow for meaningful distinctions in performance to  be made within that group, as well as to give the agency flexibility in  the monetary amounts of the bonuses awarded.", "State uses a six-tier structure to help differentiate executive  performance based on the ratings and bonuses and allocate pay  adjustment amounts for its senior executives, with senior executives  who are placed in the highest tier (I) receiving a larger percentage pay  adjustment than those in a lower tier (V), who received the annual  percentage adjustment to the EX pay schedule\u20142.5 percent in 2008.", "In 2008, DOD implemented a departmentwide tier structure to help  ensure comparability and transparency in SES position and  compensation management with pay ceilings for each of the tiers tied  to EX-level II and III pay rates. Specifically, DOD assigned SES  positions to three tiers based on the position\u2019s impact on mission, level  of complexity, span of control, and influence in joint, national security  matters, among other things. According to the Principal Director, DOD  is now using the tier structure to differentiate executive performance  payouts to recognize that high-level performance in some positions has  more impact than comparable performance in other positions. Further,  DOD uses a mathematical formula to differentiate the performance  payout amounts among its senior executives based on the  recommended performance rating, performance score, and  performance payout shares, as shown in table 2. In determining the  number of performance payout shares to recommend, rating officials  are to consider areas such as the executive\u2019s level of responsibility,  mission impact, current basic pay, and performance against the  relative performance of other executives, if applicable.

For the fiscal year 2007  appraisal cycle, senior executives were concentrated at the top two rating  levels, as shown in figure 1. At State and USAID, about 69 percent and 60  percent of senior executives, respectively, received the top performance  rating. At the other four agencies, the largest percentage of executives  received the second highest rating\u2014ranging from about 65 percent at NRC  to 45 percent at Treasury. Conversely, less than 1 percent of senior  executives across the selected agencies received a rating below fully  successful (level 3).

Similar to  the selected agencies, less than 1 percent of career senior executives  governmentwide received ratings below fully successful for fiscal year  2007.", "While OPM officials have certified that the selected agencies\u2019 systems are  making meaningful distinctions, performance ratings at the selected  agencies raise questions about the extent to which meaningful distinctions  based on relative performance are being made and how OPM applies this  criterion, as indicated in figure 1. As part of making meaningful  distinctions in performance, OPM has emphasized to agencies through its  certification guidance that its regulations prohibit forced distribution of  performance ratings and that agencies must avoid policies or practices  that would lead to forced distributions or even the appearance of it. A  senior OPM official acknowledged that it is difficult for OPM to determine  if an agency is using forced distributions through its review of agencies\u2019  aggregate appraisal results and policy documents. The official indicated  that OPM looks at trends in the data across different components of  agencies for statistical improbabilities, such as a certain percentage of SES  members receiving an outstanding rating each year within an office that  could be explained by a quota system. OPM has not provided specific  guidance to agencies on how to make meaningful distinctions in senior  executive performance while avoiding the perception of forced  distributions of performance ratings. OPM has an opportunity to  strengthen its communication with agencies and executives regarding the  importance of using a range of rating levels when assessing performance  while avoiding the use of forced distributions. Communicating this  information to agencies will help them begin to transform their cultures to  one where a fully successful rating is valued and rewarded.", "Senior-level officials at three of the selected agencies recognized the  challenge in using a range of rating levels when appraising senior  executive performance. In a memo to all SES members, DOE\u2019s Deputy  Secretary stated his concern with the negligible difference in bonuses and  pay adjustments among executives receiving the top two rating levels and  stressed the importance of making meaningful distinctions in the  allocation of compensation tied to performance ratings in the upcoming  appraisal cycle. According to State\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for the  Bureau of Human Resources, historically the vast majority of senior  executives have received the highest rating of outstanding, including for  fiscal year 2007. Since the implementation of performance-based pay, this  official said State has struggled with changing the culture and general  perception among senior executives that any rating less than outstanding  is a failure. According to DOD\u2019s Principal Director, DOD is communicating  the message that the SES performance-based pay system recalibrates  performance appraisals as a way to help change the culture and make  meaningful distinctions in performance. A fully successful or equivalent  rating is a high standard as well as a valued and quality rating. Levels  above fully successful require extraordinary results. Part of this  communication is developing common benchmark descriptors for the  performance elements at the 5, 4, and 3 rating levels. The Principal  Director said she hopes that developing common definitions for the  performance elements at all three levels will aid the development of a  common understanding and in turn make more meaningful distinctions in  ratings.

Specifically, Treasury\u2019s Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and CHCO said an agency does  not have enough room in the governmentwide pay band to fully recognize  the outstanding performers through the appraisal system since the best  performers are already near the top of the pay range and their  performance payouts in the form of basic pay increases are limited.

A  senior executive would not receive a pay increase if the executive had  already reached the pay ceiling for the applicable position group. While  there is little room for pay increases within the pay bands for each  position group, the agency official indicated that NRC tries to give pay  adjustments and generous bonus amounts when possible to acknowledge  that their senior executives are high-performing individuals. To identify  possible areas and options for improvement to its performance appraisal  and pay system including the tier structure, NRC convened an executive  working group of PRB members and senior executives from different  areas and position groups.

The higher-level reviewer cannot change the initial rating given by  the supervisor, but may recommend a different rating in writing to the  PRB that is shared with the senior executive and the supervisor. For  example, according to State\u2019s policy, an executive may request a higher- level review of the initial rating in writing prior to the PRB convening, at  which time the initial summary rating, the executive\u2019s request, and the  higher-level reviewer\u2019s written findings and recommendations are  considered.

USAID has an opportunity to strengthen the link between organizational  and individual performance by providing rating and reviewing officials  with specific information on organizational performance. For senior  executives to lead the way in transforming their organizations to meet the  complex challenges facing the nation, it will be important for them to have  confidence that the SES performance-based pay system is operating as  intended and that they will be rewarded according to their performance. In  this regard, making meaningful distinctions among executives when  assessing performance is important to the overall credibility of the SES  performance-based pay system. Less than a third of senior executives  governmentwide strongly agreed or agreed that bonuses or pay  distinctions were meaningfully different among senior executives,  according to OPM\u2019s SES survey. OPM has an opportunity to help ensure  that agencies are making meaningful distinctions in executive  performance by strengthening its communication with agencies and  executives on the importance of using a range of rating levels when  assessing performance, while avoiding forced distributions. Additionally,  communicating how OPM uses data and other tools in making certification  decisions will be important so that agencies can make continuous  improvements to their systems to support the development of a stronger  performance culture and the attainment of their missions, goals, and  objectives. Moving forward, it will also be important for OPM and OMB to  identify ways to improve the certification process and make it more  streamlined while ensuring that agencies have the guidance, tools, and  training they need to implement effective performance appraisal and pay  systems for their senior executives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure consistency and clarity in how organizational performance  is considered in appraising executive performance, we recommend that  the Administrator of USAID provide uniform organizational performance  assessments to PRB members and other reviewing officials to help inform  their appraisal recommendations for senior executives at the end of the  performance appraisal cycle.", "To help improve agencies\u2019 understanding of certain aspects of the  certification decisions, we recommend two areas for the Acting Director  of OPM to take action to strengthen OPM\u2019s communication with agencies  and executives on  the importance of making meaningful distinctions in performance  while avoiding the use of forced distributions and that a fully  successful rating is valued and rewarded and    how it uses the SES performance appraisal data and the correlation  between ratings and performance pay in determining whether agencies  are making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance as  measured though the pay and performance differentiation certification  criteria.", "In addition, to help improve the efficiency of the certification submission  process for agencies, we recommend that the Acting Director of OPM and  Director of OMB explore opportunities for streamlining the certification  process, such as electronic submissions or lengthening the full  certification coverage beyond 2 years for agencies that received full  certification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a copy of the draft report to the Secretaries of Defense,  Energy, State, and the Treasury; the Commissioners of NRC; the  Administrator of USAID; the Acting Director of OPM; and the Director of  OMB for their review and comment.", "DOE had no comments on the draft report. We received written comments  from DOD and OPM, which are included in appendixes III and IV. NRC,  OMB, State, Treasury, and USAID provided clarifying and technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. With respect to making  meaningful distinctions in performance, Treasury officials provided broad  comments on the challenge agencies face in using the full range of rating  levels given that executives are high achievers and had to exhibit  exceptional performance to enter the SES. The officials suggested that  meaningful distinctions can not be defined simply by the distribution of  performance ratings. Our findings and recommendations about making  meaningful distinctions acknowledged challenges, but also the need for  additional communication from OPM in this area.", "Regarding our recommendations, USAID, OPM, and OMB expressed  general agreement. The Acting Director stated that OPM looks forward to  working with agencies and OMB to find ways to further improve  communications with the agencies concerning the certification process.   OMB generally agreed with our assessment and recommendation  regarding the possibilities of streamlining the certification process to  improve efficiency and potentially extending full certification coverage  beyond 2 years. OMB stated that it agrees with OPM that careful review of  the newly passed law and its effect will be necessary before considering  such an extension. Regarding our discussion of pay compression, OPM  stated that it is not comfortable with the identification of tiers as a means  to address SES pay compression. The Acting Director commented that  using tiers results in salaries clustering around points in the salary range  rather than only at the top of the range. While we recognize OPM\u2019s  concern about agencies\u2019 use of tiers, we are not recommending the use of  tiers as a way for agencies to address future problems with pay  compression and have revised the language in the report to clarify this  point.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  the date of this letter.

In addition, this report examines how the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are providing  oversight in the certification of the senior executive performance-based  pay system through their statutory roles.", "We selected the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and the  Treasury; the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC); and the United  States Agency for International Development based on variations in  agency mission, organizational structure, size of their career SES  workforces to reflect agencies with a large, average, and small number of  executives; and results of their SES performance appraisal systems in  terms of the percentage of SES rated at the highest rating levels and the  percentage that received performance awards or bonuses from fiscal years  2004 to 2006, according to OPM\u2019s governmentwide data reports. We  focused on career members of the SES because they represent the  majority of all SES appointments governmentwide.", "To address our first and third objectives, we analyzed selected agencies\u2019  documents on their SES performance appraisal and pay systems including  performance management policies, directives, guidance, and other related  information; performance planning and appraisal templates; briefings,  memos, and other materials used to communicate aggregate appraisal  results to senior executives; and the submission documents to OPM and  OMB for certification in 2007.

We defined our universe of analysis as career  senior executives who received ratings. In calculating the percentage of  eligible senior executives who received bonuses (cash awards) or pay  adjustments (increases to basic pay) and average (or mean) amounts, we  excluded executives who received a rating less than \u201cfully successful\u201d  (level 3), as applicable, from the eligible population since those executives  are not eligible to receive bonuses, according to the selected agencies\u2019  policies, or pay increases, according to OPM regulation. We also excluded  senior executives at NRC, Treasury, and State who received Presidential  Rank Awards from our calculations of percentages of eligible SES  members receiving bonuses and average amounts because those  individuals were not considered for bonuses that year, according to the  agencies\u2019 policies. In order to have consistency in our analysis across  selected agencies, we included senior executives who were rated but left  their positions\u2014because of retirement, attrition, or assignment to a lower  grade\u2014prior to performance payouts being made in our analysis. The  agencies\u2019 policies and practices varied in whether or not senior executives  who retired were eligible for performance payouts.", "In analyzing the basic pay rates, we used the rates of basic pay for rated,  career senior executives after pay adjustments were made for the fiscal  year 2007 appraisal cycle. We compared these basic pay amounts to the  governmentwide SES basic pay range and the Executive Schedule (EX)  pay levels, specifically EX-level II (the SES pay cap) and EX-level III  (within the SES pay band) for calendar year 2008. EX pay rates are set at  the beginning of each calendar year and because performance payouts  from the completed appraisal cycle are usually paid out in January,  agencies are able to use the next calendar year SES pay rates for their pay  ranges. In calculating the percentage of senior executives paid at or above  EX-level III, we included those SES paid at EX-level II in our calculations.  For this objective, we also analyzed relevant agency policies and guidance  regarding performance ratings, bonuses, and pay adjustments, and  interviewed selected senior-level agency officials from the human capital  offices. For the governmentwide perspective, we reviewed OPM\u2019s Report  on Senior Executive Pay for Performance for Fiscal Year 2007 to identify  relevant governmentwide performance data as a comparison point for the  selected agencies.

We also  reviewed related agency documentation, interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data, and brought to the attention of these  officials any concerns or discrepancies we found with the data for  correction or updating. The agency officials confirmed the correctness of  the data or in some cases provided corrections to the data, which we used  in our analysis. On the basis of these procedures, we believe the data are  sufficiently reliable for use in the analyses presented in this report.", "For our fourth objective, we analyzed OPM\u2019s and OMB\u2019s guidance, memos,  and other documents regarding the certification process and criteria;  interviewed senior-level OPM and OMB officials involved in the  certification process regarding their oversight of the certification process;  and interviewed senior-level agency officials from the selected agencies\u2019  human capital offices to obtain their perspectives on OPM and OMB  oversight.
