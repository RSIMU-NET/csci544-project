In the spring of 2016, long screening checkpoint lines at certain U.S. airports raised questions about TSA's process for allocating TSOs to airports.", "The Aviation Security Act of 2016 includes a provision for GAO to review TSA's process for allocating TSOs. This report examines how (1) TSA modifies staffing assumptions and tailors staffing levels to airports' needs, (2) TSA monitors wait times and throughput and adjusts resources accordingly, and (3) TSA shares information with stakeholders about staffing and related screening procedures at airports. GAO reviewed TSA documentation describing how the agency modifies staffing assumptions and manages stakeholder coordination.

Specifically, TSA works with a contractor annually to evaluate the assumptions used in the model and modifies the model's assumptions as needed. For example, TSA adjusted its model after contractor evaluations conducted in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 found that transportation security officers (TSO) needed more time to screen passengers and their baggage when using one type of screening equipment. Moreover, in 2016, TSA began using forecasts on the number of passengers screened at each airport's checkpoints (throughput) to better allocate staff commensurate with the expected rate of increase in passenger throughput at each airport. Furthermore, prompted by the long wait times at some airports in 2016, for the 2017 model TSA officials used actual expedited screening data, specific to each individual airport, rather than relying on the system-wide estimate used in 2016. TSA officials also use other information specific to each airport\u2014such as staff training needs\u2014to further tailor the TSO allocation because the initial allocation resulting from the model does not reflect the full range of operating conditions at individual airports.", "TSA uses data to monitor passenger wait times and throughput on a daily basis and responds to increases. For example, TSA's Airport Operations Center (AOC) monitors daily wait times and passenger throughput from 28 airports that TSA officials say represent the majority of passenger throughput nationwide or are operationally significant. Furthermore, TSA officials at airports are required to report to the AOC when an event occurs\u2014such as equipment malfunctions\u2014that affects airport screening operations and results in wait times that are greater than 30 minutes in standard screening lanes. GAO analyzed wait time data for the AOC-monitored airports for the period of January 2015 through May 2017 and found that TSA's reported wait times met its standard of less than 30 minutes in standard screening 99 percent of the time. Within that time frame, two airports accounted for the longest wait times in the spring of 2016. TSA officials identified several tools, such as passenger screening canines, that they use to respond to increases in passenger wait times at these airports.", "TSA has taken steps to improve information sharing with airline and airport officials (stakeholders) about staffing and related airport screening operations, and most stakeholders GAO interviewed reported improved satisfaction with information sharing.

According to TSA directives and TSA  headquarters officials, TSA began requiring that FSDs and their  designees collect actual instead of estimated wait times for all airports in  July 2014, so we began our analysis in 2015, the first full calendar year  after this requirement was in place. We assessed the reliability of the  data used in our analyses by checking the data for any discrepancies,  reviewing TSA reports on the quality of the data, as well as related  database documentation, and working with agency officials responsible  for compiling the data to understand the data collection and reporting  methodologies. We determined that passenger wait time data and  throughput data for the 28 airports monitored by TSA headquarters were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.  Additionally, using the same data, we analyzed the extent to which TSA  met its wait time standards for the period of January 2015 through May  2017 at the 28 airports.

TSA implemented this recommendation by developing  an evaluation plan for regularly assessing the assumptions used in the  staffing model. Assumptions include the number of passengers or bags  that can be screened each hour by TSA equipment and the time TSOs  require to operate discrete sections of the screening process, such as  conducting pat-downs or searches of passengers\u2019 carry-on baggage. The  evaluation plan states that TSA is to assess (1) the time it takes to screen  passengers using TSA equipment and (2) the number of staff needed to  operate the equipment.

TSOs also inspect checked baggage to  deter, detect, and prevent the carriage of any unauthorized explosive,  incendiary, or weapon onboard an aircraft. Checked baggage screening  is conducted in accordance with standard operating procedures and  generally is accomplished through the use of explosives detection  systems or explosives trace detection systems. TSA employs an  expedited screening program, known as TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae that assesses  passenger risk to aviation security prior to their arrival at an airport  checkpoint. According to TSA, expedited screening involves a relatively  more efficient and convenient screening process for individuals from  whom TSA has obtained sufficient information to determine them to be of  lower risk and thus undergo an expedited screening process, compared  to the standard screening process a traveler may undergo, for whom TSA  does not have such information in advance.", "Finally, at each airport, TSA is to collect throughput data on the number of  passengers screened under both expedited and standard screening and  monitor passenger wait times at screening checkpoints.

For example, TSA officials stated  that they increased the expected time needed to screen passengers for  one type of passenger screening equipment in fiscal year 2017 because  the contractor found that the actual time needed was more than the  assumption TSA used in fiscal year 2016. Similarly, in fiscal year 2016,  TSA allocated fewer staff to review images of checked baggage,  compared to previous years, because the contractor\u2019s evaluation  determined it took TSOs less time to review the images than the time  observed in previous years.", "In addition to modifying its model based on evaluations performed by  contractors, TSA officials at the headquarters level review and modify  other assumptions in the model to ensure they are accurate. For  example, prompted by the long waits in the spring of 2016, officials stated  that they modified the model for the 2017 fiscal year based on their  evaluation of the 2016 assumptions. Specifically, TSA assumed that 50  percent of airline passengers would use expedited screening in 2016, but  only an average of 27 percent of passengers used expedited screening  that year. According to the officials, TSA modified this assumption in fiscal  year 2017 and now uses TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae Program data specific to each  individual airport in the model. Similarly, officials told us that, since TSA  was established in November 2001, many employees will reach 15 years  of service with the federal government in fiscal years 2016 and 2017,  resulting in increased annual leave allowances. In response, officials  have increased the amount of annual leave they expect employees to use  and rely on airport-specific data regarding employee tenure to estimate  annual leave for the coming year.", "TSA has also modified the way it develops assumptions regarding  passenger throughput at each airport. For example, beginning in fiscal  year 2016, TSA used passenger throughput forecasts to allocate staff  commensurate with the expected rate of increase in passenger  throughput at each airport.

Because the staffing  allocation resulting from TSA\u2019s model does not reflect the full range of  operating conditions at individual airports, TSA headquarters officials use  airport-specific information to further adjust allocations by changing  individual line items within the allocation after running the model on both  an annual and an ad hoc basis. TSA headquarters officials stated that  they have developed methodologies for making standard line item  adjustments such as training requirements, overtime, and annual and sick  leave. Officials told us they review the methodologies each year and  use their professional judgement to modify the methodologies to account  for changes in airport needs as well as budget constraints. We found that  through its process of tailoring staffing allocations to individual airports\u2019  needs, TSA is able to respond to the circumstances at each individual  airport.", "TSA headquarters officials also use airport-specific data on staff  availability, training needs, supervisory needs, and additional security  layers to manually adjust the model\u2019s staffing allocation output at a line  item level. For instance, headquarters officials use the previous years\u2019  data on staff sick leave for each airport to evaluate whether they are  allocating the appropriate amount of sick leave to their staff allocations on  an individual airport basis. According to TSA headquarters officials, sick  leave use can vary by airport and region of the country. Similarly, officials  stated that they adjust the model\u2019s output to account for individual airport  staff\u2019s training needs so that each airport\u2019s staff can meet TSA\u2019s annual  training requirements.", "In addition, according to TSA officials at both the headquarters and airport  levels, airport-level officials can request exceptions\u2014modifications to their  staffing allocation\u2014based on unusual airport conditions that are difficult to  address, such as problematic checkpoint configurations or lack of space  for security operations. For instance, officials at one airport said that they  had been granted exceptions for one checkpoint because pillars and  curves within the checkpoint prevented the lanes in the checkpoint from  screening passengers at the rate assumed by the model. TSA officials at  the headquarters level review requests for exceptions and use their  professional judgement to determine whether the exception will be  granted.", "Finally, in some cases, TSA may adjust an airport\u2019s staffing allocation  outside of the annual staffing allocation process and may do so as the  result of significant and unforeseen changes in airport operations.

Additionally, TSA headquarters officials facilitated  a stakeholder meeting in May 2017 to discuss planned improvements for  the TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae Program and met with stakeholders in June 2017 to  discuss security enhancements and changes to screening procedures for  carry-on baggage.", "In addition to headquarters-level initiatives, at the eight airports we  visited, we found that FSDs shared information with airport and airline  officials by meeting on an ongoing basis to discuss TSA staffing and  related screening procedures. For example, according to the FSDs and  airline and airport officials at all eight airports we visited, FSDs met with  stakeholders on a daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis. During these  meetings, FSDs and airline and airport officials told us that FSDs  discussed TSO staffing levels at the airports, instances when passenger  screening wait times were long at security checkpoints, and TSA  screening equipment performance, among other things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Reported Improved Satisfaction with TSA Headquarters Information Sharing Efforts and with Most FSDs", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders told us that TSA headquarters officials and most FSDs  improved information sharing since fiscal year 2016. With regard to TSA  headquarters officials\u2019 information sharing efforts, officials from all three  industry associations we interviewed stated that, since fiscal year 2016,  TSA headquarters improved information sharing with their association  member companies and attributed that improvement, in part, to the daily  conference call between TSA and stakeholders. For example, officials  from one industry association stated that the calls benefited members by  facilitating collaboration with TSA to more quickly identify and address  problems, such as malfunctioning screening equipment, before the  problems negatively affected passengers. An official from another  industry association told us that the daily conference call improved  communication substantially between TSA and the organization by  providing a regular opportunity to discuss airport security issues and  TSA\u2019s plans to resolve those issues.", "Additionally, stakeholders we interviewed generally reported positive  relationships or improved information sharing with FSDs, but also noted  differences in the type and extent of information that FSDs shared. For  example, officials at seven of eight airlines and all eight airports we visited  stated that they have positive relationships with their FSDs and that their  FSDs were accessible and available when needed, while the remaining  airline official noted improving access to information. Furthermore,  officials from all three industry associations cited improved information  sharing between their members at airports and FSDs since fiscal year  2016, but officials from two association noted that some FSDs still do not  regularly share information, such as changes in the number of TSOs  staffed at individual airports. According to TSA headquarters officials,  stakeholders can elevate any problems they experience with FSDs  sharing information to regional directors who are responsible for ensuring  that FSDs engage regularly with stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to DHS for comment.
