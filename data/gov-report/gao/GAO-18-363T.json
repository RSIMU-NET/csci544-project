However, in October 2015, the Coast Guard announced that the modernization project would be canceled.", "GAO was asked to summarize its report that is being released today on the Coast Guard's actions related to its EHR modernization initiative. GAO's testimony specifically addresses Coast Guard's (1) reasons for deciding to terminate further IHiS development; (2) management and oversight actions for the discontinued project and whether lessons learned were identified; (3) current process for managing health records and the challenges it is encountering; and (4) plans for effectively implementing a new EHR system and the current status of its efforts.", "In preparing the report on which this testimony is based, GAO reviewed IHiS project expenditures; analyzed key project management documentation; surveyed Coast Guard's Regional Managers and clinical staff; and interviewed key staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Financial, technical, schedule, and personnel risks led to the United States Coast Guard's (Coast Guard) decision to terminate the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS) project in 2015. According to the Coast Guard (a military service within the Department of Homeland Security), as of August 2017, $59.9 million was spent on the project over nearly 7 years and no equipment or software could be reused for future efforts. In addition, the Coast Guard could not fully demonstrate the project management actions taken for IHiS, lacked governance mechanisms, and did not document lessons learned for the failed project.", "In the absence of an electronic health record (EHR) system, the Coast Guard currently relies on a predominately paper health record management process to document health care services. Currently, the Coast Guard's clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each paper health record. Coast Guard Regional Managers and clinic and sick bay administrators informed GAO of the many challenges encountered in returning to a paper process. These challenges include the inability for some clinics to adequately track vital information such as medications\u2014potentially causing harm to members if they take medications that have dangerous interactions.", "To help alleviate several of these challenges, the Coast Guard has developed alternative work-around processes. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges.", "In February 2016, the Coast Guard initiated the process for acquiring a new EHR system. As of November 2017, agency officials had conducted research and recommended a solution based on performance, risk, cost, and schedule advantages. However, 2 years after canceling IHiS and moving toward a predominately manual process, the agency has not yet made a final determination on this. Successfully and quickly implementing an EHR system is vital to overcoming the challenges the Coast Guard currently faces in managing paper health records. The expeditious implementation of such a system can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of care to the thousands of Coast Guard active duty and reserve members that receive health care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the report being released today, GAO is recommending that the Coast Guard (1) expeditiously and judiciously pursue a new EHR system, and in doing so (2) ensure key processes are implemented; (3) establish project governance boards; and (4) document lessons learned from the IHiS project. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to participate in your hearing on the United  States Coast Guard\u2019s (Coast Guard) electronic health record (EHR)  system. As part of its mission, the Coast Guard is tasked with providing  health care to active duty and reserve members and ensuring the  availability of quality, cost-effective health care for all eligible  beneficiaries. To assist with this task, the agency has historically relied on  EHR systems to perform such functions as scheduling patient  appointments, documenting patient consults and referrals, and tracking  prescribed medications.", "In 2010, the Coast Guard\u2019s Health Safety and Work-Life Directorate  (HSWL) initiated an effort to replace the agency\u2019s aging EHR systems  with a new system called the Integrated Health Information System (IHiS).  This system was to modernize various health care services and provide  additional functionality, such as a document management system, which  was previously lacking. The project consisted of various contracts with 25  different vendors and was estimated to cost approximately $56 million to  implement. However, in October 2015, the Coast Guard announced that  the modernization project would be canceled.", "As requested, my statement summarizes our report that is being released  today on the Coast Guard\u2019s actions related to its EHR modernization  initiative and its current health records management process.  Specifically, the statement addresses the Coast Guard\u2019s (1) reasons for  deciding to terminate further IHiS development and how much it spent on  the project; (2) management and oversight actions for the discontinued  EHR modernization project and whether lessons learned were identified;  (3) current process for managing health records and the challenges it is  encountering; and (4) plans for effectively implementing a new EHR  system and the current status of its efforts.", "Among other steps, in conducting our work, we reviewed IHiS project  expenditures; analyzed key project management documentation;  surveyed Regional Managers and clinical staff regarding challenges they  face in managing paper health records and any mitigation strategies; and  interviewed knowledgeable staff about the project. Our related report  includes a detailed explanation of the scope and methodology for our  work.", "We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Internal investigations were initiated in January 2015  and May 2015 to determine whether the HSWL Directorate had  violated the Antideficiency Act by using incorrect funding sources and  incorrect fiscal year funds for the IHiS project. The Coast Guard  ordered project management and contractor staff to cease work on  IHiS until a determination was made regarding the antideficiency  violation.", "Technical risks. IHiS lacked an independent security assessment  and full interface testing to ensure security and data integrity. In  addition, key functionality for the system, such as user verification,  had not been completed.", "Schedule risks. The HSWL Director stated that she requested that  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Defense Health Agency Solution  Delivery Information Technology (IT) team independently validate the  IHiS timelines and the status of the project in 2015 because of the  identified technical risks and concerns as to whether the system  would be ready to be piloted in the fall of 2015. According to the  Director, the Defense Health Agency team projected the timeline for  the first clinic implementation to be approximately 1 year later than  originally estimated due, in part, to incomplete interfaces and  workflows.", "Personnel risks. Although HSWL staff had been managing the IHiS  project since it was initiated in 2010, Command, Control,  Communications, Computers, and Information Technology (C4&IT)  was directed to assume the oversight responsibilities for IHiS  implementation in May 2015. This action was due to concerns about  the project\u2019s adherence to established governance processes raised  by the internal investigators looking into the potential Antideficiency  Act violations. By August 2015, the key HSWL project management  personnel that had overseen the project since 2010 had been  removed. As a result of the changes in staff, one vendor noted that it  was unclear as to who were the stakeholders, responsible parties,  and decision makers.", "According to an analysis conducted by the Coast Guard, which included  obligations and expenditures from September 2010 to August 2017, the  agency had obligated approximately $67 million for the IHiS project and,  of that amount, had spent approximately $59.9 million at the time of its  cancelation. In addition, over 2 years after the project\u2019s cancelation, the  Coast Guard continued to pay vendors. In this regard, it paid  approximately $6.6 million to vendors between November 2017 and  February 2018 to satisfy existing contractual obligations for services such  as leased equipment that was damaged or missing; software licensing  and support; a data storage center; and removal and shipment of  equipment. Further, according to staff in Coast Guard\u2019s Office of Budget  and Programs, no equipment or software from the IHiS project could be  reused for future efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Could Not Demonstrate Effective Project Management, Lacked Governance Mechanisms, and Did Not Document Lessons Learned for the IHiS Project", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it effectively managed and  oversaw the IHiS project prior to its discontinuance, and did not document  and share valuable lessons learned from the failed project. Specifically,  although the Coast Guard was to follow its System Development Life  Cycle (SDLC) Practice Manual to guide its management and oversight of  the project, the agency could not provide complete evidence that it had  addressed 15 of the 30 SDLC practices we selected for evaluation. For  example, the Coast Guard could not demonstrate that it had conducted  IHiS system testing, although the agency granted an authority to operate  (ATO) and indicated in the ATO memorandum that the system had  undergone some form of testing. The Coast Guard\u2019s SDLC specifies that  system testing is to take place prior to the issuance of an ATO.", "Project team members provided inconsistent explanations regarding  whether or not documentation existed to demonstrate the actions taken to  manage and oversee the project. The absence of the various documents  and other artifacts that would support the required SDLC activities raises  doubts that the Coast Guard took the necessary and appropriate steps to  ensure effective management of the IHiS project.", "Further, although the Coast Guard developed charters for various  governance boards to provide project oversight and direction, the boards  were not active and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) was not included  as a member of the boards. Taking steps to fully implement governance  boards that include the CIO will be important to the Coast Guard\u2019s  oversight efforts in implementing a future EHR system and may decrease  the risk of IT project failure.", "Lastly, although Coast Guard officials stated that lessons learned had  been identified throughout the process of developing IHiS, as of 2 years  after its cancelation, the agency had not documented and shared any  lessons learned from the project and did not have established plans for  doing so. Until the Coast Guard takes steps to document and share  identified lessons learned with individuals charged with developing and  acquiring its IT systems, opportunities to protect future systems against  the recurrence of mistakes that contributed to the failure of IHiS will likely  be missed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Is Managing Health Records Using a Predominately Paper Process, but Many Challenges Hinder Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of an EHR system, the Coast Guard is relying on a  predominately paper health record management process to document  health care services for its nearly 50,000 military members. Currently, the  Coast Guard\u2019s clinical staff perform various manual steps to process each  paper health record. For example, clinical staff schedule appointments for  patients using Microsoft Outlook\u2019s calendar feature and provide the  patient with paper forms for completion upon his or her arrival. In addition,  clinical staff must handwrite clinical notes in the paper health record  during the appointment, as well as handwrite prescriptions, among other  manual processes.", "In response to our survey, the 12 HSWL Regional Managers identified a  number of challenges that clinics and sick bays in their regions had  experienced in managing and maintaining paper health records. These  challenges were grouped into 16 categories. Further, the 120 clinic and  sick bay administrators that subsequently responded to a separate survey  reported varying degrees to which they viewed each category as  challenging. Figure 1 provides the clinic and sick bay respondents\u2019  views of the top four challenges.", "With regard to these top four challenges to managing and maintaining  paper health records, clinic and sick bay respondents offered the  following examples:  Incomplete records. Ninety-eight (82 percent) of the respondents  reported incomplete records as challenging. In this regard, 34 of the  survey respondents reported that not all records from the Coast Guard  legacy EHR systems were printed out and included in patients\u2019 paper  health records as required before the systems were retired. Thus, they  had no way to ensure the patients\u2019 paper records were complete.", "Penmanship. Among the 91 (76 percent) survey respondents that  reported penmanship as challenging, several respondents noted that it is  difficult for staff to read illegible handwritten medical notes. This, in turn,  results in difficulty determining the accurate diagnosis, the required  prescription, or a referral.", "Tracking medications. According to 89 (76 percent) of the respondents,  it is challenging to track medications without an EHR. For example, one  administrator stated that staff members rely heavily on patients to  remember what medications they are taking\u2014potentially causing harm if  patients cannot remember what medications they are taking and the  medications have dangerous interactions.", "Amount of time to manage records. According to 86 (72 percent) of the  respondents, managing paper health records is challenging and requires  more time for staff to complete and file paperwork. Several respondents  stated that the size of the paper health records has increased, resulting in  additional time required to review and file records.", "The responding clinic and sickbay administrators described a range of  alternative work-around processes that they have developed to help  alleviate several of the challenges. Specifically, they reported having  developed additional forms, tracking methods, and alternative processes,  as well as having notified Coast Guard HSWL management of the  challenges they face.
