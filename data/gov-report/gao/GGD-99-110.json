The steering committee, which can be made up of various federal, state, and local representatives, including residents, is responsible for local administration of the program. For official recognition, a site is also required to develop a management plan, engage residents and other partners in its activities, and develop a comprehensive strategy to weed out crime and gang activity and to seed the area with social services, economic services, and economic revitalization.", "The four required elements of the Weed and Seed Program are (1) law enforcement; (2) community policing; (3) crime and substance prevention, intervention, and treatment; and (4) neighborhood restoration. According to EOWS, law enforcement should attempt to eliminate the most violent offenders by coordinating and integrating the efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in targeted high-crime neighborhoods. The objective of community policing is to raise the level of citizen and community involvement in crime prevention and intervention activities. Crime and substance abuse prevention, intervention, and treatment should include youth services, school programs, community and social programs, and support groups. Finally, neighborhood restoration should focus on distressed neighborhoods through economic and housing development. Weed and Seed sites fund a variety of law enforcement and community activities.

While this information provided a framework for OJP financial controls, it did not specifically relate to our recommendation. Our internal control review focused on EOWS\u2019 decisions for qualifying new and existing sites for funding.", "DOJ agreed with our recommendation to improve program monitoring, citing that it has a chronic problem of grantees not submitting programmatic progress reports in a timely manner.  To address this problem, EOWS is proposing to suspend funding for grantees failing to submit progress reports in a timely manner.  Because this new proposal has yet to be implemented by EOWS, we believe our recommendation to ensure that sites meet the grant requirement of submitting timely progress reports is appropriate.  In addition, EOWS acknowledged the need to document all monitoring visits. After they received our draft report, they told us they had taken corrective action, and all monitoring reports are now up to date. However, there is no assurance that a process and procedures are in place to ensure that monitoring visits will always be documented, and we continue to believe that our recommendation is needed.", "DOJ disagreed with our recommendation on self-sustainability, stating that developing criteria is problematic.  They also commented that the draft report was incorrect in stating that no site\u2019s funding had been reduced or withdrawn as a result of the site\u2019s efforts to become self-sustaining, and that we used the terms \u201csite\u201d and \u201cgrantee\u201d incorrectly. DOJ maintains that, as one neighborhood reached a point where it could sustain its Weed and Seed crime-reduction efforts, funds and resources were shifted by the grantee to other neighborhoods.", "With respect to self-sustainability, there is a distinction to be drawn between DOJ\u2019s comments and evidence we gathered from interviews with program officials and our own observations.  We acknowledge that some grantee funds and resources have been shifted to other neighborhoods within the grantee\u2019s location. However, it is not clear whether this occurred because the programs became less reliant on Weed and Seed grants or for other reasons. EOWS management and local program officials told us that funding had been reduced at some sites to fund activities in other neighborhoods, but not because the site demonstrated that it successfully reached self-sustainability. Our limited site visits confirmed this at the locations we selected for review.", "In an attempt to create criteria for achieving self-sustainability, EOWS adopted a 5-year rule under which it can discontinue qualifying sites for continued program funding unless the sites expand to an additional neighborhood site. EOWS expressed the opinion that this rule has created an expectation of self-sustainability for current sites, since some funds are to be shifted from the current neighborhood site to the expansion site.", "We continue to believe that EOWS needs to develop better criteria for determining when sites become self-sustaining and when to reduce or withdraw program funding.  Under EOWS\u2019 current 5-year rule, even if some resources are shifted to an expansion site, there still may be substantial Weed and Seed investment at the original site and EOWS would have no way of knowing whether the original site is self-sustaining. Withdrawing funding after 5 years of federal investment without criteria could be arbitrary.  Some sites may become self-sustaining sooner than 5 years\u2014resulting in a missed opportunity to fund other Weed and Seed sites\u2014while other sites may need more than 5 years to achieve self- sustainability.  While it may be challenging to develop criteria for determining when a site becomes self-sustaining, we believe EOWS should work toward this goal since it is a central and fundamental tenet of the Weed and Seed Program.", "With respect to the distinction between sites and grantees mentioned in EOWS\u2019 comments, we have modified the report to clarify when we are referring to a grantee or a site.", "DOJ officials agreed with our recommendation to develop performance measures that track program outcomes.  However, they noted that EOWS already has one performance measure in place\u2014homicides\u2014that it uses to track program outcomes.  Consequently, they believed that our recommendation should be modified to state that EOWS should develop and use additional performance measures.  We recognize that EOWS has adopted this outcome-oriented performance measure and have modified our recommendation to require EOWS to develop additional measures.", "DOJ also expressed concern that we did not include the results of a recently completed national evaluation of the Weed and Seed Program by Abt Associates Inc.  As noted in Abt\u2019s report, this evaluation involved case studies of eight Weed and Seed sites.  Among other activities, each case study included two principal sources of empirical data, as follows: (1) analysis of crime trends at each site and (2) surveys of site residents, one conducted in 1995 and the other in 1997.  Overall, the report indicated mixed results across the sites\u2014there were significant favorable effects in key outcome measures for some cities and some time periods, while the results on outcome measures in other cities were not as favorable.

We believe our report title and captions better convey the message of our report, therefore, we made no modifications. 2. DOJ stated that the Grant Manager\u2019s Memoranda outline the basis and rationale for funding decisions.  Our review of the Grant Manager\u2019s Memoranda showed that they did not provide a basis and rationale for funding decisions but rather provided a project overview, including purpose, goals and objectives, strategy, and project management.  Further, EOWS management officials told us the narrative on this form is the same for all grantees; therefore, we do not believe these memoranda communicate the basis and rationale for qualifying new and existing sites for funding. 3. DOJ stated that we are  suggesting that it routinely perform impact assessments of program components.  We are not suggesting that EOWS routinely perform impact assessments.  Our statement is meant as an example of a possible outcome measure. 4. DOJ stated that our report did not appropriately highlight positive program results.  However, in the results in brief section we note that selected sites had taken actions toward self-sustainment as well as highlight the satisfaction that most local officials had with the activities funded by Weed and Seed.  These results are discussed in greater detail in the body of this report.  In addition, our survey results, in their entirety, are included in appendix II of the report. 5.
