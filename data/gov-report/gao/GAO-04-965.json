In addition, they reported that new privacy procedures have become routine practice for their members' staff. However, provider and health plan representatives also raised a variety of issues about provisions that continue to be problematic. In particular, many organizations emphasized that two provisions--the requirement to account for certain information disclosures and the requirement to develop agreements with business associates that extend privacy protections \"downstream\"--are unnecessarily burdensome. Some organizations suggested that difficulties with these provisions could be ameliorated with modification of certain provisions and further guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Organizations reported a number of challenges faced by entities that rely on access to health information for public health monitoring, research, and patient advocacy. Public health entities noted that some states have had to take concerted action to ensure that providers' concerns about complying with the Privacy Rule do not impede the flow of important information to state health departments and disease registries. Some research groups asserted that the rule has delayed clinical and health services research by reducing access to data. Some consumer advocacy groups told us that patients' families, friends, and other representatives have experienced unnecessary difficulty in assisting patients. These groups perceived that while providers and plans are allowed, in certain cases, to disclose health information without written patient authorization, they are reluctant to do so. Consumer and provider representatives contend that the general public is not well informed about their rights under the Privacy Rule. According to these organizations, patients may not understand the privacy notices they receive, or do not focus their attention on privacy issues when the notices are presented to them. Some evidence of patients' lack of understanding is reflected in the 5,648 complaints filed with OCR in the first year after the Privacy Rule took effect. Of the roughly 2,700 complaint cases OCR closed as of April 13, 2004, nearly two-thirds were found to fall outside the scope of the Privacy Rule because they either involved accusations of actions that were not prohibited by the regulation, involved entities that were not \"covered entities\" as defined by the Privacy Rule, or involved actions that occurred before covered entities were required to be compliant. Of those cases that were germane to the rule, OCR determined that about half represented cases in which no violation had occurred."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Issued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of  1996 (HIPAA), the federal Privacy Rule provided individuals with new  protections regarding the confidentiality of their health information and  established new responsibilities for health care providers, health plans, and  other entities to protect such information.

For example, in hospitals, various departments keep patient  information in separate systems that are not necessarily electronically  linked.  According to the Health Care Compliance Association, hospitals  have had to revise systems to establish electronic links or have had to  create manual tracking mechanisms.

They commented that frequent, diverse disclosures required by law add  significantly to the volume of information that must be continually tracked.   These include disclosures to public entities to maintain disease registries,  vital statistics, and other health databases.  For example, the Minnesota  Department of Public Health identified over 50 state statutes in which  health information may or must be released to specific state or local  organizations, such as health departments, health licensing boards, and  schools.  Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) representatives told  us that accounting for the disclosures of births and deaths to state health  departments\u2014required by state law\u2014can be burdensome.

Organizations we interviewed  stated that some of their members have spent substantial amounts of time  and money to develop thousands of business associate agreements with  downstream users of protected health information, though they did not  estimate specific amounts.  Provider and health plan representatives  reported that high costs have been associated with the need for legal  counsel to negotiate and customize agreements with the multiple and  various business associates.  For example, BCBSA officials stated that  some of their business associates have requested specific and sometimes  \u201cexcessive\u201d details in their agreements.

First,  organizations we spoke with believed that providers have a disincentive to  report data requested by public health agencies because of the provision to  account for such disclosures.

This is consistent with  concerns expressed by representatives of health plans, physicians,  hospitals, and long-term care facilities about the burden of accounting for  certain disclosures.  Second, some providers were confused about the rule  in that they believed they were permitted to report to public health  agencies only when specifically required by federal or state law.  A  representative of CDC noted that in some states that did not mandate  reporting of birth defect surveillance data, providers were initially  unwilling to disclose this information.  Third, state officials noted that  providers are concerned legal action might be taken against them if they  provide health information to public agencies.

AHCA also reported that the Privacy Rule does not address a potential  conflict with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 that requires  nursing homes to notify families of incidents or significant changes in  health status unless the resident exercises the right to privacy.  Under the  Privacy Rule, a provider may, in certain situations, determine whether or  not to share information with family based on professional judgment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evidence Suggests Patients Are Not Aware of Privacy Rights or May Misunderstand the Privacy Rule", "paragraphs": ["Numerous organizations reported that patients are not aware of their rights  under the Privacy Rule, either because they do not understand the notice of  privacy practices, or because they have not focused their attention on  privacy issues when the notices are presented to them.  In the first year  after entities were required to be compliant with the Privacy Rule, OCR  received over 5,600 privacy complaints and closed about half of the  complaint cases filed.  Nearly two-thirds of the closed cases were resolved  on the basis that they were outside the scope of the Privacy Rule,  suggesting that patients may misunderstand their rights."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Diverse Groups Contend That Patients Are Not Well Informed of Their Rights", "paragraphs": ["Consumer groups\u2014including AARP, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health  Law, the Health Privacy Project, the Health Assistance Partnership, and the  National Health Law Program\uf8e7reported that many patients are not aware  of their privacy rights.  They attribute this, in part, to the use of customized  privacy notices.  For example, consumer groups reported that typical  privacy notices, as drafted by providers and health plans, are often difficult  to read and understand.  The Health Privacy Project maintained that the  privacy notices are written primarily to protect providers and health plans  from enforcement actions, rather than as a vehicle to inform the patient.  It  noted that even basic information about disclosures and the right to access  records is often buried in the document.", "Representatives of providers and health plans also stated that patients are  largely unaware of their rights.  According to AHIMA, patients are unaware  of their privacy rights because the privacy notice is treated as one more  piece of paper that they have to sign when they seek care. MGMA noted  that some physicians have placed boxes in their offices specifically for the  purpose of recycling the notices after patients discard them.", "Representatives from both provider and consumer groups noted that the  public should receive more education about how their rights have changed.  MGMA told us that OCR has placed the burden of patient education on  private organizations\u2014such as professional associations, providers, and  health plans\u2014and that some of these organizations interpret the rule  incorrectly.  Moreover, provider and consumer groups stated that further  OCR attention is needed to address the issue of privacy notices that are  difficult for patients to read and understand.  Some groups told us that the  notice of privacy practices could be made easier to comprehend by  highlighting some key patient rights under the Privacy Rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaints Filed with HHS OCR Indicate That Patients May Misunderstand the Privacy Rule", "paragraphs": ["In the first year that entities were required to be compliant with the Privacy  Rule, consumers and others filed 5,648 privacy-related complaints with  OCR.  The number of complaints received increased steadily from quarter  to quarter, with each quarter\u2019s intake totaling 1,068, 1,392, 1,521, and 1,667,  respectively.  Overall, roughly half of the complaints filed in the rule\u2019s first  year were closed as of early May 2004.", "The database that OCR maintains on these complaints includes information  that classifies one or more privacy issues raised in several broad  categories.  Data on the open and closed cases showed that the most  commonly cited category (56 percent of complaints) was \u201cimpermissible  uses and disclosures.\u201d  According to an OCR official, this could include  allegations regarding patient billing information sent to the wrong address  or FAX number, patient information seen or overheard in a doctor\u2019s office  or hospital, or provider employees accessing patient information for their  own personal or business benefit.  Approximately a third of the  complaints cited inadequate safeguards for patient information, and 17  percent reported problems with patients gaining access to their own health  information.", "Patients have filed privacy complaints against many different types of  health care entities.  The two most commonly cited were private  practices\u2014comprising physicians, dentists, chiropractors, and similar  licensed health professionals\u2014and hospitals\u2014including general,  psychiatric, and specialty hospitals.  Together, private practices and  hospitals accounted for 41 percent of privacy complaints with information  on entity type recorded.", "For closed cases, the OCR database provides additional information,  primarily related to the final disposition of the complaint.  The majority of  these complaints\u201479.1 percent\u2014were not germane to the Privacy Rule,  lacked sufficient information to process them, or fell into diverse  miscellaneous categories.  That left 20.9 percent of the closed privacy  complaints that OCR concluded fell within the scope of the Privacy Rule  (see table 1).", "About half of the germane complaints (representing 9.4 percent of total  closed cases) involved a violation of the Privacy Rule substantiated by  OCR\u2019s investigation where the provider or plan agreed to correct its  policies or procedures.  For the rest of these germane complaints (11.5  percent of total closed cases), OCR determined that no violation had  occurred.  By May 2004, OCR had not recommended sanctions against any  provider or health plan for privacy violations, but this remained a potential  outcome for the first-year complaints that were still open at that point.", "Nearly two-thirds of the privacy complaints closed during the rule\u2019s first  year of operation fell outside the scope or time frame of the rule.  This  included the 35.4 percent of closed privacy complaints that involved  alleged actions by providers, health plans, or other entities that OCR  determined would not constitute violations of the regulation even if true.   In other words, they concerned actions to which the patient might object,  but that were not prohibited by the Privacy Rule.  An additional 17.7  percent of closed complaints involved entities that were not \u201ccovered  entities\u201d as defined by the Privacy Rule, and 9.6 percent cited actions that  occurred before covered entities were required to be compliant.  However,  OCR officials stated that the proportion of complaints closed because they  were not germane to the Privacy Rule may have been higher in the first year  of the rule\u2019s implementation than it will be in later years because OCR can  generally complete its processing of such complaints more quickly than  complaints that require full-scale investigations.  Just over half of the  complaints received in the first year remained open in early May 2004.", "Finally, about 15 percent of closed complaints fell into one of a number of  miscellaneous categories or, more commonly, could not be pursued  because OCR did not receive, and could not obtain, critical information.   For example, some complaints lack addresses or telephone numbers by  which the persons filing the complaints could be contacted for more  information.", "Closed complaints involving three major categories of providers\u2014private  practices, hospitals, and pharmacies\u2014were more likely to be judged  germane under the Privacy Rule by OCR than were complaints about other  organizations.  Nevertheless, for each of these major provider types, as well  as for all other entities cited in privacy complaints, OCR found that a clear  majority of the complaints it closed were not germane to the regulation  because they either involved accusations of actions that were not  prohibited by the regulation, involved entities that were not \u201ccovered  entities\u201d as defined by the Privacy Rule, or involved actions that occurred  before covered entities were required to be compliant (see fig. 1).", "The similarity of this pattern across different types of entities suggests that  patients may misunderstand the scope of the protections provided to them  under the Privacy Rule.  The pattern is also consistent with consumer  advocates\u2019 opinions concerning the limitations of privacy notices in  informing patients about their rights under the Privacy Rule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Overall, in its first year, HIPAA\u2019s Privacy Rule has resulted in both positive  and negative experiences among covered entities and other users of health  information.  Health care staff have been sensitized to privacy issues and  the procedures required of their organizations to protect patient health  information.  Providers and health plans have taken steps to develop  working environments that are sensitive to patient privacy and to enhance  staff understanding of how to handle the complexities of complying with  the Privacy Rule.", "However, some operational issues and misconceptions about the rule  continue to raise concerns.  A prime example is the requirement to account  for disclosures for public health purposes that are mandated by law.  This  requirement is seen by many to have created a costly and unnecessary  demand on providers and health plans and a drag on the flow of  information for purposes considered to be in the public interest.", "Providers and health plans that are uncertain or misinformed about their  privacy responsibilities have often responded with an overly guarded  approach to disclosing information, resulting in procedures that may be  more protective of the organizations than necessary to ensure compliance  with the Privacy Rule.  At the same time, the job of educating the public  about the content and intent of the Privacy Rule has been relegated to  providers and health plans and their privacy notices have not consistently  provided a clear message to patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that to reduce unnecessary burden on covered entities and  to improve the effectiveness of the Privacy Rule, the Secretary of HHS take  the following two actions:   Modify the Privacy Rule to (1) require that patients be informed in the  notice of privacy practices that their information will be disclosed to  public health authorities when required by law and (2) exempt such  public health disclosures from the accounting-for-disclosures provision.", "Conduct a public information campaign to improve awareness of  patients\u2019 rights under the Privacy Rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, HHS agreed with our finding  that implementation went more smoothly than expected during the first  year, confusion has diminished, and new privacy procedures have become  routine practice for staff.  They stated that the experience of providers and  health plans in implementing the Privacy Rule, as we reported, were  generally consistent with what HHS has heard from many covered entities  and others. (See app. II.)", "Regarding our recommendation that mandatory reporting of health  information to public health authorities be exempted from the accounting  for disclosure requirement, HHS noted that it has considered such a change  in the past and continues to monitor the need to modify the Privacy Rule.   In August 2002, HHS considered exempting public health disclosures from  the accounting provisions whether required by law or not, but decided  against such a modification pending further experience with the rule.  HHS  acknowledged that covered entities continue to report difficulties tracking  such disclosures and stated that its guidance documents emphasize  flexibility in how covered entities structure their record keeping.", "Given HHS\u2019s goal of ensuring effective patient privacy protections without  imposing unnecessary costs or barriers to quality health care or interfering  with other important public benefits, we remain concerned that the  accounting for disclosure provision as applied to mandatory public health  reporting may not support this goal.  Effective privacy notices could be  used to inform patients of public health disclosures required by law and, in  turn, reduce the need to track these numerous disclosures.  Furthermore,  public health officials noted that the burden imposed by accounting for  legally required disclosures may generate the unintended consequence of  reducing the amount of information voluntarily reported to public health  authorities.  To the extent that covered entities are discouraged in this way,  the public interest may be negatively affected.", "In commenting on our second recommendation, to conduct a public  information campaign to improve awareness of patient\u2019s rights under the  Privacy Rule, HHS agreed that notices of privacy practices may appear too  long and complicated and that consumers may not be closely reading their  notices.  HHS stated that the complaint data received by OCR may not  indicate that consumers are unaware of their rights under the rule, but  rather that they may not properly understand them.  Regarding its  consumer outreach, HHS pointed to two new consumer fact sheets posted  to its Web site on August 17, 2004, a toll-free call-in line to respond to  questions about the rule, and efforts to encourage covered entities to  develop consumer-friendly notices that highlight key information.", "Evidence from numerous organizations indicated that consumers are  largely unaware of their rights under the Privacy Rule, and our analysis of  OCR complaint data suggested that consumers may misunderstand the  scope of the protections provided.  A more diverse approach to consumer  outreach may be necessary to effectively communicate the new privacy  rights.  The information available on the HHS Web site and from the call-in  line provide access to a portion of the general public but may not reach the  many consumers who do not know of these sources.  We believe it is  important that, in current and future efforts to educate the public, HHS  more effectively disseminate information about protections provided under  the Privacy Rule.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date.
