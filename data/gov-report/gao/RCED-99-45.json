Point sources are generally municipal and industrial facilities that discharge pollutants via a point, such as a pipe or other conveyance, directly to a body of water. EPA and the states issue permits to these entities to put limits on the types and amounts of pollutants such facilities can discharge. These laws and regulations have helped clean up major water quality problems and reduce the amount of pollutants directly discharged into surface waters.", "However, many of the nation\u2019s waters are still not meeting water quality standards. For example, toxic algae, such as Pfiesteria piscicida, which are associated with excessive amounts of nutrients (chemical elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus) in waters in Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia, resulted in millions of fish killed and adverse human health effects. Various pollutants have also resulted in over 2,000 fish consumption advisories and more than 2,500 beach closings and advisories being issued in 1996 alone. Overall, EPA reports that over one-third of the nation\u2019s waters that were assessed by states are still impaired. Nonpoint sources of water pollution, or diffused sources, have been identified as the primary reason for these continued problems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nonpoint Sources of Pollution Are Varied", "paragraphs": ["Nonpoint sources of water pollution include a wide array of land-based activities such as timber harvesting, grazing, urban development, and agriculture. Figure 1.1 shows many such nonpoint sources in a watershed setting. Pollution comes from these disparate sources via the process of rainwater, snowmelt, or irrigation water moving over or through land surfaces. This results in pollutants, either dissolved or solid, being transported and eventually deposited into rivers, lakes, and coastal waters or introduced into groundwater. Airborne pollutants, sometimes transported long distances and then deposited in bodies of water, are also considered a source of nonpoint pollution, as is polluted groundwater which discharges into surface water. The types of pollutants vary with the activity involved and include sediment, nutrients, pesticides, pathogens (such as bacteria and viruses), salts, oil, grease, toxic chemicals, and heavy metals.", "Sediment is a common pollutant from many nonpoint-generating activities and can impact water quality by contaminating drinking water sources or silting in spawning grounds for certain aquatic species. Another common group of nonpoint pollutants, nutrients, can result in excessive plant growth and subsequent decaying organic matter in water that depletes oxygen levels, thereby stressing or killing other aquatic life. Pesticides, pathogens, and other toxic substances associated with runoff from agriculture and other sources can also be hazardous to human health and aquatic life. The severity of any nonpoint impact is dependent on the amount of pollutants actually reaching a body of water and the ability of receiving waters to assimilate or transport those pollutants.", "Nonpoint source pollution is much more difficult to track than point source pollution. Because the sources are diffused, it is very difficult to pinpoint the exact amount of pollutants coming from individual sources, including that from natural sources of pollution, particularly for pollutants such as sediment that may result from a wide variety of activities and sources. In addition, control practices vary in their effectiveness depending on many site-specific characteristics such as soil type, topography, and climate. As a result, there is much uncertainty in quantifying nonpoint source pollution stemming from specific sources and tracking improvements resulting from control practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Responsibilities for Controlling Nonpoint Source Pollution", "paragraphs": ["The nature and extent of nonpoint source pollution is essentially a function of the way individuals use the land. Therefore, regulating these activities has been a sensitive issue since land use decisions are largely made at the local level and influenced by state policies. As a result, the Congress has left the actual control and regulation of nonpoint source pollution up to the states while addressing the importance of dealing with the problem in amendments to the Clean Water Act in 1987. Specifically, section 319 of the Clean Water Act, added in 1987, provides a limited federal role in addressing nonpoint pollution. Under this section, EPA provides federal funds and management and technical assistance to states to implement nonpoint source management programs. In their nonpoint source assessments completed in 1989, states identified waters that without additional controls over nonpoint sources, will not meet water quality standards. The states also developed management programs to deal with the problems. In addition, section 6217 of the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, administered jointly by EPA and the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), outlines a more rigorous process for states to deal with nonpoint sources impacting coastal waters. Section 6217 requires states to address significant sources of nonpoint pollution from agriculture, forestry, urban areas, marinas, and hydromodification. This program differs markedly from section 319 in that states are required to include in their programs enforceable policies and mechanisms to ensure that management measures to address these sources are implemented.", "In addition to section 319\u2019s explicit authorization of a federal role, other agencies are authorized to encourage more environmentally sensitive land use practices. For example, some federal programs use a voluntary cost-share approach with private landowners to encourage improved land use actions, particularly with regard to controlling soil erosion and improving agricultural practices.", "The Clean Water Act acknowledges that federal agencies are also potential sources of nonpoint pollution via their facilities or activities, or those issued permits or licenses by them, such as grazing and timber harvesting. Therefore, the act includes provisions whereby federal agencies are to ensure that their activities are \u201cconsistent\u201d with state nonpoint source pollution management programs. States can judgmentally review certain federal projects and activities to determine whether they conflict with the states\u2019 nonpoint management programs. In accordance with procedures outlined in an executive order regarding intergovernmental review of federal programs, federal agencies are required to consult with the states and make efforts to accommodate their concerns or explain their decisions not to do so.", "In February 1998, the administration proposed a new plan to address the nation\u2019s remaining water quality problems. Among the \u201cClean Water Action Plan\u2019s\u201d primary goals are to provide new resources to communities to control nonpoint source pollution, strengthen public health protection, and encourage community-based watershed protection at high-priority areas. The Action Plan also recognizes the role that federal land management agencies must play in protecting the water resources on their lands as well as federal agencies\u2019 roles in providing technical and financial assistance to states and private entities to better deal with nonpoint source pollution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman, Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, asked us to (1) provide background information and funding levels for federal programs that primarily address nonpoint source pollution (i.e., those programs identified as either focusing primarily on nonpoint source pollution or that devote at least $10 million annually to the problem); (2) examine the way EPA assesses the overall potential costs of reducing nonpoint source pollution nationwide and alternative methods for doing so; and (3) describe nonpoint source pollution from federal facilities, lands, and activities that federal agencies manage or authorize, or for which they issue permits or licenses.", "To address the first objective, we surveyed agencies to obtain information on program purpose, key goals and objectives, program funding and staffing levels, matching requirements, and opinions on the potential impact of the Clean Water Action Plan. For relevant Clean Water Act sections, we also included additional questions about how EPA allocates funds across projects, regions, and states. We pretested our survey with officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers. In order to identify the most important nonpoint source pollution programs, we asked agencies to respond to our survey for programs meeting at least one of the following two criteria: (1) program expenditures addressing nonpoint source pollution exceeded $10 million for at least 1 year during fiscal years 1994 through 1998 or (2) the program primarily addressed nonpoint source pollution regardless of program expenditures.", "We sent survey instruments to over 100 programs that we identified through our prior reports and agency background information and discussions with agency officials at EPA; NOAA; and the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, and Transportation. The response rate for our survey was 100 percent.", "For the second objective, we reviewed EPA\u2019s nonpoint source pollution component of the Needs Survey, examining the analytical structure of the models, the reasonableness of key assumptions, and the completeness of data using standard economic and statistical principles. We also interviewed EPA officials and contractor staff responsible for developing and using the models and requested model documentation. We interviewed EPA staff involved with the 1996 report as well as staff working on the report to be issued in 2000. We consulted with experts in water quality modeling from EPA, USDA\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Economic Research Service, and Interior\u2019s U.S. Geological Survey. We also reviewed pertinent scientific literature to help identify alternative methodologies for a conceptual framework for estimating nationwide control costs.", "For the third objective, we identified the primary federal agencies that manage or authorize, or issue permits or licenses for, activities or facilities that result in nonpoint source pollution by interviewing officials at EPA; the Army Corps of Engineers; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; and the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, and Transportation. We limited our investigation into nonpoint source pollution-generating activities to those that are not regulated under EPA\u2019s point source or stormwater permit requirements. For example, we excluded sources such as construction sites larger than 5 acres or certain industrial activities that must comply with stormwater runoff requirements to address nonpoint source pollution.", "Because quantitative data on federal agencies\u2019 nonpoint source pollution contribution generally do not exist, we developed an array of other indicators to help characterize agencies\u2019 possible contributions. The primary factors were the extent of agency involvement in nonpoint source-generating activities, the types of impacts that result from the activities, circumstances that may influence the impacts, and management practices that can minimize the impacts. We developed these factors based on a review of scientific research and discussions with federal and state officials. To collect information on the factors, we interviewed a wide array of agency officials, including headquarters program managers, research scientists, and field staff, to understand the range of activities, resulting water quality impacts, and management practices used. We also reviewed scientific literature that described types and ranges of impacts and results of management practices applied for specific nonpoint source pollution-generating activities.", "We interviewed water quality officials from five states with large portions of federal land\u2014Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah\u2014to understand how federal activities factored into state water quality issues. We judgmentally selected these states from states with at least 25 percent federal land in order to obtain information on the types of nonpoint source pollution associated with a diverse array of federal agencies. In addition, we obtained geographic data from the U.S. Geological Survey describing the percentage of land area owned by the federal government in watersheds across the country. We did not verify the reliability of these data.", "We conducted our work from February 1998 through January 1999 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Overall, the seven agencies we surveyed reported obligating about $14 billion for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 on 35 programs addressing nonpoint pollution. Total obligations during this period have been relatively stable\u2014at about $3 billion each year\u2014but obligations at EPA in particular, increased significantly during this period. In February 1998, the administration proposed a plan designed to more effectively address the nation\u2019s remaining water quality problems.

Some programs are intended to deal directly with the problem. EPA\u2019s National Nonpoint Source Program, for example, provides financial and technical assistance to help states develop their own nonpoint source management programs and to fund specific projects. Other programs are primarily focused on other objectives but indirectly serve to address specific nonpoint source pollution problems. For example, Interior\u2019s Abandoned Mine Land Program is intended primarily to reclaim abandoned mines for health and safety reasons (e.g., to address dangers such as open mine shafts), but in doing so significantly addresses potentially contaminated stormwater runoff from these facilities. A further distinction among these programs is that some provide financial and technical resources to nonfederal entities to address nonpoint source pollution such as providing resources to farmers to implement certain land management practices, while other programs are focused directly on addressing such pollution on federal land.

The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and the Chesapeake Bay programs also address nonpoint source pollution although their portions of funding to do so are significantly smaller than the National Nonpoint Source and CWSRF programs. As requested, we also identified other programs authorized by the Clean Water Act that address nonpoint source pollution in some manner. The four other programs that we identified are focused primarily on objectives other than nonpoint pollution, and consequently, just a small amount of program funding went to nonpoint pollution. Background and funding data on these programs are in appendix I. Figure 2.2 shows the percentage breakdown of total obligations for fiscal years 1994 through 1998 for EPA\u2019s programs.", "Section 319 of the Clean Water Act established a national nonpoint source program under which states (1) assessed the extent to which nonpoint sources cause water quality problems and (2) developed management programs to address these problems. EPA was charged with reviewing and approving these programs and is authorized to provide grants to states for implementing their activities and programs. Grants have been used for a wide variety of activities, including technical assistance, financial assistance, education, training, technology transfer, and demonstration projects. The funds also support monitoring efforts to assess the success of specific nonpoint source implementation projects.", "EPA estimated that for fiscal years 1994 through 1998, the agency obligated about $544 million to address nonpoint source pollution, with obligations of $119 million in fiscal year 1998. According to EPA, all states have approved nonpoint source control programs that are helping to reduce nonpoint source loadings, increase public awareness, and improve water quality. While the program\u2019s funding was relatively stable during the 5-year period, its annual funding is significantly higher than it was in prior years. In fiscal year 1990, for example, $38 million was appropriated for the program.", "EPA uses a formula to allocate the states\u2019 share of the total federal funding appropriated each year for these grants. The formula considers each state\u2019s population, cropland acreage, pasture and rangeland acreage, forest harvest acreage, wellhead protection allotment (the acreage around a groundwater drinking source designated for protection), critical aquatic habitat acreage, mining acreage, and amounts of pesticides applied.

As a condition of receiving federal funds, states provide a matching amount equal to 20 percent of the total grant and agree to use the money first to ensure that wastewater treatment facilities are in compliance with deadlines, goals, and requirements of the Clean Water Act (also known as the \u201cfirst use\u201d requirement). In addition to federal and state matching funds, the revolving fund is also funded by the issuance of bonds, interest earnings, and repayments. According to EPA, federal funding currently accounts for about one-half of total program funding. As loans are repaid, the fund is replenished and loans are made for other eligible projects.", "All states have met their priority needs and, therefore, may use CWSRF funds to support programs to deal with nonpoint source pollution and protect their estuaries. We reported in 1991 that only two states were using their CWSRF funds to support nonpoint source pollution projects.Since then, however, states\u2019 reliance on the CWSRF to fund nonpoint pollution-related activities has grown considerably. According to EPA, 18 states currently use their CWSRFs for this purpose. EPA is encouraging states to use CWSRF funds for nonpoint source control and has set a goal to have 30 states doing so by the end of the decade.", "Other EPA goals for increasing CWSRF emphasis on nonpoint pollution include ensuring that CWSRF funding decisions are made in a manner that enables states to direct funds based on environmental priorities\u2014whether they be point or nonpoint in nature. Such a strategy could be expected to place increasing emphasis on addressing nonpoint pollution because most remaining water quality problems are attributed to nonpoint sources. EPA has set a goal for 15 states to be doing so by 1999. In addition, over the next 3 years, EPA plans to increase the number and dollar amount of CWSRF loans annually for polluted runoff control to 10 percent of all CWSRF funds loaned.", "Figures provided by EPA show that federal CWSRF funds devoted to nonpoint source pollution has increased significantly in recent years.

In addition to authorizing the infrastructure fund, the Congress placed a strong new emphasis on preventing contamination problems through source water protection and enhanced water systems management. States have the flexibility to set aside up to 31 percent of their capitalization grant to develop and implement programs that encourage better drinking water systems operation to ensure a safer supply of water for the public. The four broad set-aside categories for which a state can choose to reserve funds are (1) administrative and technical assistance (up to 4 percent), (2) state program management (up to 10 percent and must be matched dollar for dollar), (3) small systems technical assistance (up to 2 percent), and (4) local assistance and other state programs (up to 15 percent and includes primarily activities devoted to protecting drinking water sources from contamination).

These activities identify the areas around groundwater drinking water sources that must be protected to avoid contamination and the possible sources of contamination. EPA reported that 100 percent of the funds obligated for these activities, $111.8 million, should be considered as addressing nonpoint source pollution. In addition to providing funding to delineate and assess source water protection areas, the set-asides made available by the DWSRF Program provide states with funds to implement protection measures. These protection measures can address all sources of contamination, which may include nonpoint sources.

Other silvicultural practices such as site preparation, prescribed burning, and chemical applications were not cited by state or federal officials as significant sources of nonpoint pollution overall.", "Timber harvesting can be a significant source of nonpoint pollution. However, USFS officials emphasized that the timber harvest itself is typically a less significant cause of nonpoint source pollution than associated activities required to transport logs from the harvest site, such as hauling logs along trails known as skid trails. The movement of logs from the harvest site typically involves the use of heavy equipment, such as tractors, to haul logs along skid trails to landings where they can be loaded onto trucks. The use of heavy equipment and skidding of logs compacts the soil and can severely disturb land surfaces. Rain falling on these areas tends to run off the surface, allowing sediment to flow more easily into streams.", "USFS is the dominant federal agency involved in timber harvesting. However, timber harvesting on USFS lands has been declining significantly in the past decade, from 12.7 billion board feet in fiscal year 1987 to 3.3 billion board feet in fiscal year 1998, a decline of over 70 percent.Accordingly, associated activities such as the use of skid trails have also declined. BLM is the only other agency with a significant level of timber harvesting with 239 million board feet in fiscal year 1997.", "The amount of nonpoint source pollution generated by timber operations varies considerably depending on (1) site-specific conditions, such as the stability of the soil and the slope of the land where the harvest occurs, and (2) management decisions, such as the choice of log transport method, which is a key determinant of the amount of ground disturbance that will be caused by the operation. Forest Service research shows that nonpoint pollution generally results from a timber harvest when there is a large amount of surface disturbance on steep slopes or when riparian vegetation is removed or modified. For example, clear-cutting on steep slopes in the Pacific Northwest has led to significant increases in the number of landslides that deposit large amounts of sediment. In addition, the manager of the nonpoint source unit in Oregon told us that past timber harvesting operations in the state have resulted in removal of riparian vegetation and consequent reduction of streamside shade, which causes elevated stream temperatures that are considered harmful to some fish species.", "Recognizing the need to reduce soil erosion and other nonpoint source impacts resulting from silvicultural activities, the Forest Service and BLM have moved away from the use of clear-cutting as a harvest method. For example, clear-cutting on Forest Service lands has declined significantly in the past 5 years, from 132,674 acres in fiscal year 1993 to 45,854 acres in fiscal year 1997, a decline of about 65 percent. In addition, Forest Service and BLM timber contracts are to include requirements to implement best management practices, appropriate to the conditions of the site being harvested, to reduce water quality impacts. For example, a contract may require that skid trails and landings be designed to minimize erosion or that the lifting of logs from the harvest area occur via helicopter when slopes are steep.

About 14,000 miles of BLM roads have been constructed in Oregon and Washington where 85 percent of BLM-authorized timber harvesting occurs. Forest Service and BLM officials noted that few new roads have been constructed in recent years, and little new construction is planned. The officials also pointed out that there are many other uses for which forest roads stay open after a harvest is completed, and the majority of traffic on forest roads are from these other uses. Officials from both the Forest Service and BLM told us that, overall, roads are among the two most serious threats to water quality on lands they manage. According to Forest Service officials and scientific literature, roads are considered to be the major source of erosion from forested lands, contributing up to 90 percent of the total sediment production from forestry operations.", "Historically, forest road construction standards were not focused on reducing the potential for erosion and associated water quality impacts. Poorly designed and sited roads can change natural stream flowpaths, which leads to incision, or cutting away, of previously unchanneled portions of the landscape and increased erosion. Roads also concentrate stormwater runoff on road surfaces of exposed and often-compacted soil, and may channel flow into adjacent ditches, where eroded sediment from hillsides and roadbeds can be more easily transported to streams. We observed such channel incision and erosion on Forest Service land in Arizona. (See fig. 4.3.)", "Sediment from roads can contribute to water quality problems. For example, we recently reported that forest roads were one of several sources of sediment that led to exceedances of turbidity in drinking water and the shut down of several drinking water systems during an unusually heavy storm in western Oregon. Scientific literature shows that aquatic habitat and fish populations can also be adversely affected. Mass erosion resulting from roads can lead to the filling of stream pools, which causes them to support fewer fish and may increase fish mortality. In addition, fine sediment can fill crevices in stream gravel that would otherwise serve to protect juvenile fish and provide spawning grounds.", "Forest Service and BLM officials told us that they have attempted to begin minimizing impacts from roads\u2014within current budget constraints and priorities. For example, the Forest Service and BLM have formal management guidance specifying several engineering practices that may reduce the impacts of roads on water quality. These practices include halting timber operations in wet weather; constructing drainage ditches, culverts, and other structures for controlling erosion; inspecting and maintaining roads during and after winter storms; and creating stream-side buffers to minimize water quality impacts. Figure 4.4 shows a Forest Service road improvement project installed to change the way the road diverted stormwater runoff in order to reduce stream velocities and subsequent erosion.", "In addition, the Forest Service recently began developing a new roads policy. The three key objectives of this policy are to: (1) provide Forest Service managers with new scientific and analytical tools with which to make better decisions about when, where, and if new roads should be constructed; (2) decommission unnecessary and unused roads, as well as unplanned or unauthorized roads; and (3) improve forest roads where appropriate to respond to changing demands, local communities\u2019 access needs, and the growing recreational use of Forest Service lands.", "One state official we interviewed expressed concern that the Forest Service will face significant challenges in closing roads, since signage and gates used to close them can be ignored by people wanting to use the roads for recreational purposes.

In Oregon, for example, the manager of the nonpoint source unit told us that federally authorized grazing contributes to the degradation of about 30 percent of all impaired waters in the state.", "Grazing can result in nonpoint pollution in several ways. Continuous grazing can lead to a reduction of vegetation that would otherwise serve to protect soil surfaces from the erosive impact of rain. Livestock may also strip vegetation from bushes and shrubs, de-stabilizing root structures and loosening soils, making the soils more vulnerable to runoff during a major storm event. Grazing in riparian areas, which are located in and alongside streams, can lead to a loss of vegetation that would otherwise serve to filter sediment in the streamflow, stabilize streambanks, and provide shade that moderates stream temperatures to levels tolerable for aquatic species. Continuous grazing also leads to trampling of surfaces, causing soil compaction. This reduces rainfall infiltration and in turn leads to increased runoff. Trampling can also cause streambanks to slump and erode, resulting in direct deposit of streamside soil into waterbodies. In addition, direct deposits of manure can occur when animals graze near waterbodies and can lead to fecal coliform and pathogen contamination.", "Figure 4.7 shows a streambank that is beginning to erode due to loss of vegetation through grazing and a healthy riparian area where grazing has been excluded. Livestock grazing is not the only source of grazing impacts, however. Wildlife, such as elk and deer, graze federal lands and can cause significant impacts such as loss of vegetation and fecal coliform contamination in some places. According to Arizona officials, uncontrolled populations of wildlife are among the state\u2019s most serious threats to water quality.", "BLM officials acknowledge that grazing causes damage to the riparian stream environment. They note that almost three-quarters of the agency\u2019s nearly 40,000 miles of riparian stream environment in the lower 48 states have been assessed to determine ecological condition. Of these assessed stream miles, BLM reported that 14 percent, or almost 4,000 miles, are \u201cnon-functional\u201d or do not provide adequate vegetation to slow streamflows that would otherwise cause significant erosion. Another 45 percent of the stream miles are classified as \u201cfunctional\u2014at risk\u201d and most are declining or have no apparent condition trend. BLM officials added, however, that the precise impact of grazing on the riparian environment is difficult to isolate from that of other sources.", "State and federal officials told us that while impacts from current grazing are significant in some areas, the impacts vary considerably depending on several factors, including soil and vegetation type in forage areas, the duration and intensity of grazing, and management practices implemented to mitigate nonpoint source impacts. Proper management of grazing lands can often reduce or minimize nonpoint pollution from grazing. However, the officials we talked with said that federal efforts to actively manage grazing are often limited by insufficient staff and resources.", "In addition to the effects of present-day grazing, many watersheds throughout the west have not fully recovered from the heavy grazing that occurred on public lands around the turn of the century.

To date, 70,000 abandoned mines have been inventoried on BLM lands, 39,000 on Forest Service lands, 2,500 on National Park Service lands, and 240 on National Wildlife Refuges.", "Mining disturbs rock surfaces and generates piles of waste rock and mine tailings, which exposes minerals in the rock to air and water, accelerating natural rates of oxidation. The oxidation of sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (iron sulfide), generates strong acids, which can drain or run off with stormwater into streams. Acidic conditions in streams can have severe consequences for aquatic life by interfering with biological processes such as reproduction. For example, a Park Service study found that many aquatic species that once existed in major portions of the Cumberland River in Kentucky now exist only as isolated remnant populations possibly because of acid drainage from abandoned coal mines.", "Acids from mine drainage can also dissolve metals, such as copper, zinc, manganese, and aluminum, that can be carried into surface waters in toxic concentrations. High concentrations of metals in surface waters can threaten ecological health. According to a Forest Service official, a few livestock fatalities have occurred as a result of ingesting selenium while grazing in areas contaminated by drainage from abandoned mines on National Forest lands in Idaho. In addition, plant growth has been severely disrupted by acid mine drainage from the abandoned McLaren and Glengary gold and copper mines on the Custer and Gallatin National Forests in Montana. This loss of natural vegetation leaves soils vulnerable to the erosive impact of rain, which can increase the amount of sediment running off into waterbodies.", "Officials we interviewed from each of the five states identified abandoned mines as significant contributors to nonpoint source pollution. In Colorado, for example, the manager of the nonpoint source unit estimated that almost 50 percent of water impairments in the state are adversely affected by acid drainage from abandoned mines. Many of these mines occur on federal lands. Several federal agencies have programs to reclaim abandoned mine sites and thereby reduce nonpoint source pollution impacts from acid mine drainage. For example, in 1997, the Forest Service obligated about $10 million for hazardous waste projects that were targeted mostly to abandoned mine land reclamation.

Arizona and Oregon state officials noted that river recreation, such as tubing, kayaking, and swimming and unauthorized dumping of sewage from boats and motor homes, can cause high levels of fecal coliform in surface water. Oil and gas spills from motor boats and other recreational vehicles are also possible sources of nonpoint pollution.", "Use of vehicles on public lands and roads can also cause significant erosion. As noted previously, forest roads are often left open after harvesting for other purposes such as recreational use. Forest Service research has shown that increased vehicle use causes an increase in erosion from forest roads. An estimated 1.7 million vehicles associated with recreational activities travel forest roads each day, over 10 times more than in 1950. In addition, land disturbances caused by the use of off-road vehicles can also lead to increased erosion. One BLM official told us that in extreme cases, off-road vehicle use through stream environments can cause road-beds to divert channel flows from streams onto the road surface.", "State officials told us that recreational activities tend to cause water quality impairments when the activity is highly concentrated in a given area. For example, during the summer 1998, 25,000 people assembled in a small area of Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona, causing severe land disturbances and increased erosion, as well as unusually high fecal coliform levels in otherwise-pristine forest streams. In addition, state officials said that concentrations of campers along streambanks can lead to the destruction of vegetation in riparian areas, in turn causing sediment and temperature impacts to waterbodies.", "With few exceptions, federal agencies do not have specific guidance or policies for dealing with recreation and associated water quality impacts. The Park Service has a policy dealing with recreational boating and marinas and associated nonpoint sources. Some agencies perform assessments and develop solutions on a case-by-case basis once problems are identified. For example, the Park Service has recently closed some parks to off-road vehicle and jet ski use to reduce water quality problems.

As a result, these operations can cause increased downstream erosion and faster rates of pollutant transport. Channel enlargement projects include activities such as increasing channel depths while retaining the original bank slopes. This may cause stream banks to slump and erode, resulting in increased loadings of sediment.

Some impacts are specific to a particular type or purpose of a project, while others may occur regardless of the project type or purpose. For example, in some cases, deep reservoirs stratify by temperature, resulting in a cold, deep layer that may result in low dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of some dissolved elements such as iron, manganese, sulfur, and nitrogen. Releases from deep reservoirs can have significant temperature impacts on receiving waters; federal officials said that aquatic species can be adversely affected by these conditions if dam releases draw water primarily from this lower layer. In addition, dams and reservoirs also cause significant habitat modification problems for migrating aquatic species. For example, dams can be a factor contributing to decreasing numbers in salmon populations, some of which in the Northwest are on the verge of being endangered or extinct.", "Because reservoirs trap and accumulate sediment, waters released from reservoirs are often low in sediment, leaving them capable of carrying more sediment (i.e., increasing erosion) from the banks and beds of the stream immediately downstream from the reservoir. Peaking operations of dams may result in accelerated downstream erosion with the resulting increased flow rates. However, in other instances, dam releases may contain high levels of sediment, which can lead to accumulation of sediment downstream as it settles out. Bureau officials told us that downstream movement of suspended sediment during extreme reservoir drawdown periods has been documented at several reservoirs, including Island Park, American Falls, and Black Canyon in Idaho, and Thief Valley in Oregon.", "The impact of individual dam and reservoir projects varies significantly, depending on the type and purpose of the project, the streamflow and sediment characteristics of the parent streams, and the management practices applied at a given site.

Several state officials pointed out, however, that not all water quality impacts are due to current federal activities citing past timber and grazing practices, in particular, as sources of continuing nonpoint pollution in their states.", "Even in watersheds where there is not significant federal land ownership or a significant federal contribution to nonpoint source pollution, control of nonpoint source pollution by federal agencies may promote strong federal stewardship of lands held in the public trust and encourage strong stewardship by private landholders. EPA officials in the interagency Chesapeake Bay Program told us that even though federal agencies own just a small percent of the land in the Bay watershed, they have enjoyed broad federal involvement in restoration activities, which has helped to promote federal stewardship of public lands and set an example for private landholders. In November 1998, EPA and its federal partners announced a new commitment to this stewardship, recognizing the important role the agencies can play in the Bay watershed.", "State environmental efforts can benefit from such stewardship as the manager of the nonpoint source program in Oregon pointed out to us. He said that weak federal commitment to addressing nonpoint pollution discourages private stewardship. On the other hand, he noted that strong federal stewardship of public lands can encourage private stewardship by demonstrating commitment and accomplishments. In addition, each of the five state officials we contacted noted that they had good working relationships with several of the federal agencies discussed in this report and, in these instances, were working with their federal counterparts to address water quality impacts.", "The Clean Water Action Plan acknowledges the importance of the federal contribution to nonpoint source pollution, outlining several key action items federal agencies are to implement in order to better protect water resources on federal land. Specifically, USDA and Interior are to lead the development of a unified federal policy to enhance watershed management on federal lands to provide for the protection of water quality and health of aquatic systems.

The Service suggests characterizing the federal contributions as \u201cpotential\u201d rather than \u201cactual.\u201d As discussed in chapter 4, information obtained from the states we contacted does in fact show that a significant proportion of water quality problems can be attributed, at least in part, to activities occurring on federal land. However, we acknowledge the variability in this relationship, noting that the degree of pollution in specific areas may depend on site-specific characteristics such as geographic and hydrologic conditions, the type of activities occurring and intensity of use, and management practices applied to minimize impacts.

However, such practices may not always be in place. Moreover, as pointed out by federal and state officials, as well as by Forest Service research\u2014and included in our report\u2014water quality impacts continue to result from past management practices, such as the type of heavy grazing that occurred in the late 1800s and certain timber harvesting practices.", "FERC acknowledged that nonpoint source pollution-related impacts can result from FERC-licensed hydropower projects, but cautioned that in characterizing these impacts, the report (1) carefully distinguish between the effects of hydropower versus other forms of hydromodification; (2) distinguish between FERC-licensed projects and federally managed projects; and (3) recognize that hydropower is not an original source of some of the impacts identified, but rather a factor that can amplify the effects of other sources that contribute nonpoint pollution. Regarding the first two points, while our draft did in fact recognize the distinctions identified by FERC, we made additional changes to add further clarification. Regarding the third point, we agree that, in some instances, hydropower is not technically the source of the pollution, although, as FERC points out, it may still be a contributor. In other instances, however (such as situations where changes in temperature or dissolved oxygen levels or increased downstream erosion result directly from a project\u2019s operations), we continue to believe that it is more appropriate to characterize the project as an original source of the pollution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Clean Water Act Sections Addressing Nonpoint Pollution", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs discussed in this report that primarily address nonpoint source pollution, a few other programs authorized by the Clean Water Act address nonpoint source pollution but to a lesser extent.

Several of USDA\u2019s services provided clarifications and technical points that were incorporated into the report as appropriate. Within the letter, there are 21 points on which we provide the following comments. 1. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) said that the information in the executive summary indicating that USDA programs represent almost 80 percent of the funding identified for nonpoint source pollution is misleading because, as the draft points out later, its largest program\u2014the Conservation Reserve Program\u2014has no specific nonpoint source objectives. NRCS suggested that certain information in the body of the report be reflected in the executive summary to clarify that while activities under the program do in fact address nonpoint source pollution, nonpoint source pollution control is not a stated objective of the program. We have made these changes as suggested. 2. NRCS commented that an example in the draft report where Arizona officials reported that activities on federal lands contribute to 50 percent of the water quality problems in the state provides no indication of the relative size of the federal contribution to these waters. This information was provided by state officials who are required by the Clean Water Act to routinely assess their waters for water quality problems and identify contributing sources. While they do not quantify the contribution of individual sources to impaired waters, Arizona officials did indicate that federal activities were the \u201cprimary\u201d source of 50 percent of the water quality problems in the state. We have added this distinction to the report. 3. NRCS requested that we revise the language in the draft to clarify that water quality is not the sole purpose of funding for EQIP and the Conservation Reserve Program, noting that environmental benefits can include water quality, but may not have this benefit in some locations. We have clarified the report where appropriate. However, we asked agencies to report on programs that in their opinion helped address nonpoint source pollution. By including programs in this report, we are not suggesting that all the programs focused exclusively on nonpoint source pollution. We recognize that some programs simply help reduce nonpoint source pollution through the implementation of other program objectives. 4. NRCS suggested that we add an item to our graphic depicting possible sources of nonpoint source pollution in a watershed showing \u201call vehicle traffic\u201d as an additional possible source. We agree that vehicle traffic is another possible source of nonpoint pollution, however, our graphic was not intended to include every pollution source. 5. See comment 1. 6. NRCS commented that to say that all funds for the EQIP program went to nonpoint source may be \u201cstretching it, since some areas do not have enough rainfall to have runoff or be a source.\u201d We reported that 100 percent of EQIP funding addressed nonpoint source pollution based on information from the agency. The rationale provided by the agency in response to our questionnaire noted that, \u201cEQIP is intended to solely address nonpoint source pollution from farms and ranches.\u201d In addition, we discussed the issue of percent of program funds targeted to addressing nonpoint source pollution several times with agency officials to be sure that the 100-percent figure was appropriate. Moreover, one conservation official addressed the issue of lack of rainfall by pointing out that such areas will either (1) not be capable of producing crops and, therefore, not be eligible for funding or (2) be irrigated, making runoff a possibility. 7. NRCS commented that EQIP should not be characterized as a nonpoint source pollution-reduction program. As discussed in comment 6, we reported information on the program based on information the agency provided in response to our questionnaire. To avoid any confusion, we have revised the text in the report to reflect language in the final rule as suggested by the Service. 8. The draft did not include the two programs cited in this comment, the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Forestry Incentives Program, because agency officials initially indicated that neither program met our criteria for inclusion. We included information on the Wetlands Reserve Program provided later by USDA in appendix II; however, no program and funding data were provided for the other program. 9. NRCS commented that the section heading, \u201cFederal Activities That Contribute Significantly to Nonpoint Source Pollution,\u201d leaves the impression that all activities cause nonpoint source pollution. NRCS suggested that the heading be reworded to reflect that activities contribute when not properly managed, and remove the word \u201csignificant.\u201d We agree that water quality impacts can be minimized by the use of appropriate management practices and discuss some of these practices in each of the activity sections. However, such practices may not always be in place. We have revised the heading to acknowledge that all the activities do not necessarily contribute to nonpoint source pollution, but rather \u201chave the most potential\u201d to contribute. We have left the reference to \u201csignificant\u201d contributions because this section discusses the activities that federal and state officials identified as those with the potential to be the most significant contributors. 10. NRCS questioned the example that \u201c30 percent of all impaired waters in the state of Oregon are due to grazing.\u201d We reported that \u201cfederally authorized grazing contributes to the degradation of about 30 percent of all impaired waters in the state.\u201d This information was obtained from the state nonpoint source pollution program manager based on the state\u2019s list of impaired waters. As discussed in comment 2., states routinely assess their waters for water quality problems and identify the sources contributing to the problems, as required by the Clean Water Act, but do not quantify the contribution of individual sources. 11. NRCS commented that two of the programs included in the draft did not address nonpoint source pollution, nor was it a collateral benefit of the programs. As discussed in comment 8., we included information provided by the respective agency program officials. Regarding the National Resource Inventory, the agency said that the program addressed nonpoint source pollution because it collects data on agriculturally related natural resource elements that can be used to provide some measure of nonpoint source pollution rates. For the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program, the agency said that, among other objectives, the program is intended to improve or enhance water quality and quantity and that \u201cabout 975 watershed projects have a significant impact on nonpoint source pollution.\u201d 12. The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) commented that we did not address the adequacy of scientific understanding of nonpoint source pollution. Such an analysis was outside the scope of this review. 13. ARS also commented that there was inconsistency in the type of programs addressing nonpoint source pollution identified in our report. See comments 8 and 11 for information regarding how we identified programs for inclusion in the report. 14. We have added information on ARS\u2019 Water Quality/Research, Development, Information Program, as requested. 15. The Forest Service suggested that the relationship between the magnitude of federal lands and the proportion of nonpoint source pollution should be conditioned in terms of potential rather than actual, noting that management practices intended to minimize nonpoint source pollution are prescribed for all Forest Service projects. As discussed in chapter 4, information obtained from the states we contacted does in fact show that a significant amount of water quality problems can be attributed, at least in part, to activities occurring on federal land. However, we acknowledge the variability in this relationship, noting that the degree of pollution in specific areas may depend on site-specific characteristics such as geographic and hydrologic conditions, the type of activities occurring and intensity of use, and management practices applied to minimize impacts. Accordingly, as suggested by the Forest Service, we modified language in this chapter where appropriate to characterize the association between a large portion of federally owned land to contributing a significant amount of nonpoint pollution as potential rather than actual. 16. As an additional point, the Forest Service provided data to show how silvicultural activity is occurring on just a small part of national forest lands. We did include information regarding the decline of silvicultural activities in the report; however, Forest Service research has shown that pollution from harvest sites may continue for decades after a harvest has been completed. In addition, silviculture is just one of the many activities occurring on Forest Service land that may lead to nonpoint source pollution. While federal agencies are implementing practices to minimize water quality impacts from current activities, agencies must also deal with impacts resulting from past activities and practices. In several sections of chapter 4, we acknowledge that past practices contribute to water quality impacts. 17. The Forest Service commented that it devotes more resources to addressing nonpoint source pollution than is reflected in the one program included in our report\u2014the Watershed Research Program. The Service said that the control of nonpoint source pollution is the responsibility of each resource program manager. While the Service did not provide cost estimates for these activities, we have noted this comment in the report. 18. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service commented that we did not discuss the research needs associated with nonpoint source pollution. Assessing the adequacy of funding for nonpoint source pollution research was outside the scope of this review. 19. The Extension Service encouraged coordination among EPA and other USDA agencies within the Department with regard to watershed-based modeling research, but noted that NRCS was the only agency we discussed in the report. We agree that all relevant agencies in USDA should coordinate research on nonpoint source pollution modeling to avoid duplication and help move scientific understanding of the problem forward as efficiently as possible. We included NRCS in our report because it was one of the few federal agencies that had developed a nationwide model relevant to our evaluation of EPA\u2019s nonpoint source control modeling approach. 20. The Extension Service suggests that we examine biases in the states\u2019 evaluation of surface water quality problems. Such an analysis was outside the scope of this review. 21. The Extension Service also makes some observations on, and criticisms of, the Clean Water Action Plan and how it can be used as a means to further address nonpoint source pollution issues. We provided factual information about the Clean Water Action Plan since several of its components address nonpoint source pollution, in particular funding increases for several of the programs included in our report. However, an analytical evaluation of the Action Plan (including the assumptions made regarding the current understanding of water quality problems and associated research and monitoring needs) was beyond the scope of this review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on FERC\u2019s comments on our draft report. The Commission agreed with the report\u2019s major conclusions, but raised three concerns regarding how hydropower is characterized in the report. The Commission also made several clarifications and technical points that were incorporated into the report as appropriate. Our comments to the Commission\u2019s three major concerns follow. 1. FERC expressed concern that a lay reader would misconstrue the word \u201chydromodification\u201d or think that the term is interchangeable with \u201chydropower.\u201d We believe we have properly defined hydromodification to make it clear that hydropower is just one example of hydromodification activities. In each instance where we introduce the term hydromodification, we refer to the major categories of hydromodification\u2014channelization and dams and reservoirs. In addition, we provide explanations of the types of projects included in each of the categories. For example, in the Results in Brief, we provide the example for hydromodification, \u201csuch as building and operating dams, or modifying rivers for flood control and other purposes.\u201d Similarly, in the first paragraph of the hydromodification section, we describe hydromodification activities as \u201cchannelization and the construction and operation of dams.\u201d Later, in the subsection on dams and reservoirs, we describe such structures as being \u201cmultipurpose, such as providing municipal and industrial water supply, flood control, recreation, irrigation, and power generation.\u201d 2. FERC believes that we have misrepresented hydropower as a nonpoint source of pollution, stating that \u201chydropower is not a nonpoint source of pollutants, but rather an activity that can positively or negatively affect the impacts of pollutants introduced by nonpoint sources.\u201d However, as described in an EPA technical document regarding management measures for sources of nonpoint pollution, dams (which can be constructed for many purposes including flood control, power generation, irrigation, and municipal water supply) \u201ccan generate a variety of types of nonpoint source pollution in surface waters.\u201d Examples of such pollution are discussed in our report such as increased downstream erosion and changes in water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels that may impact aquatic life. FERC acknowledges in its comments that hydropower projects do have these negative effects. Therefore, in these instances, we believe it is appropriate to portray hydropower as an original source of nonpoint pollution. However, we acknowledge that most of our examples regarding the impacts of hydromodification are hydropower examples and may have overemphasized the negative impacts of hydropower in this section. We have revised the text to recognize that the impacts discussed may result from any of the types of hydromodification, not just hydropower projects. 3. The Commission commented that the draft does not distinguish between federally operated projects and Commission-licensed projects, which are generally smaller and, therefore, should not be represented as having the same environmental impacts. The draft did, in fact, distinguish between Commission-licensed projects and federally operated projects, noting the number of projects of each and, in particular, the environmental requirements to which the nonfederal projects are subject. Moreover, while we acknowledge FERC\u2019s point about the relatively smaller size of FERC-licensed projects (.09 billion kilowatt hours per year versus .9 billion kilowatt hours per year for federally operated projects), we would point out that there is a considerably greater number of these smaller projects nationwide\u20141,750 FERC-regulated projects versus 133 federally operated projects. Beyond this distinction, however, we would add that in many respects, the types of impacts described apply generically to dam and reservoir operations regardless of whether it is a FERC-licensed project, a federally operated project, or whether the project\u2019s primary purpose is for a use other than hydropower. In addition, as with the other sources of nonpoint pollution, the extent of the potential impact varies significantly with site-specific characteristics and management practices employed at the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of the Interior and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of the Interior\u2019s letter dated January 26, 1999. Additional specific comments were provided by the individual services and bureaus within Interior and have been addressed as appropriate. Many of these specific issues are also discussed at the end of chapters 2, 3, and 4. Our comments on the Department\u2019s two major concerns follow. 1. Interior expressed concern that the draft report appeared to equate the magnitude of nonpoint source pollution to the amount of federally managed land involved. As discussed in chapter 4, information obtained from the states that we contacted does in fact show that a significant proportion of water quality problems can be attributed, at least in part, to activities occurring on federal land. However, we acknowledge the variability in this relationship, noting that the degree of pollution in specific areas may depend on site-specific characteristics such as geographic and hydrologic conditions, the type of activities occurring and intensity of use, and management practices applied to minimize impacts. Accordingly, where appropriate, we modified language in this chapter to characterize the contribution to nonpoint source pollution from federal lands as potential rather than actual. 2. Interior also points out that federal land managers are working diligently to develop and implement new land management practices which will conserve our natural resources and reduce the impacts of the activities they conduct or permit on water resources. We agree that water quality impacts can be minimized by the use of appropriate management practices and discuss some of these practices in each of the activity sections. However, such practices may not always be in place.
