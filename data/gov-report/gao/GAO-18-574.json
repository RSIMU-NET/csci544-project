GAO reviewed the quality measures DOD identified in March 2017 in response to the NDAA 2016; DOD senior leadership tracks these measures on dashboards to gauge progress on MHS strategic goals. GAO found that DOD does not use a common set of measures on its dashboards to assess the quality of care provided by either military hospitals and clinics\u2014known as direct care\u2014or networks of civilian hospitals and other providers, known as purchased care. (See figure.) As a result, DOD's senior leadership has limited information on the extent to which MHS beneficiaries receive consistently high quality care across the MHS.", "Furthermore, for both direct and purchased care, DOD uses measures on its dashboards that track a limited range of quality care areas and medical conditions compared to the measures adopted by Medicare and by private health insurers. For example, whereas civilian hospitals report to Medicare information on 11 measures of patients' self-reported experience in hospitals, Military hospitals report only 1 such measure. By using a limited range of quality measures, DOD may not detect key quality issues. Further, when selecting quality measures, the MHS does not prioritize using common measures across direct and purchased care or expanding the range of measures it uses.", "GAO also found that for direct care DOD has established performance standards and corrective action requirements for military hospitals or clinics that do not meet those standards in direct care. The performance standards indicate the level of performance providers should meet on the various quality measures DOD tracks on its dashboards, and the corrective action requirements instruct providers to take steps to improve care. However, for purchased care, DOD has not established similar performance standards for individual providers.

These  beneficiaries may receive care from military treatment facilities (MTFs)\u2014 known as direct care\u2014or from civilian hospitals, physicians, and other  clinicians participating in DOD-sponsored health plans that are  administered by contractors\u2014known as purchased care. While MTFs  take the lead in delivering health care to active duty servicemembers,  eligible beneficiaries can receive a wide array of primary and specialty  care from the MTFs, purchased care providers, or both. Overall, about 60  percent of all the health care services that beneficiaries received in 2017  were delivered through purchased care.", "In 2014, the Secretary of Defense ordered a comprehensive review of the  MHS that found considerable variation in the quality of care delivered. For  example, the review found that 8 of 17 MTFs with high volume surgery  programs had higher than expected rates of surgical complications.  Furthermore, in the case of purchased care, the review found that DOD  had limited information on the quality of care delivered by those civilian  providers.", "The information DOD has on the quality of care in the MHS comes from  what it collects on various quality measures. In general, health care  quality measures are standard, evidence based metrics\u2014such as the  percentage of patients receiving a screening or the rate of hospital  readmissions or surgical complications\u2014that health care systems such as  the MHS use to quantify health care processes, outcomes, and other  aspects of care. Health care quality measures can be linked to  performance standards established for providers. For example, a quality  measure may indicate the percentage of patients who receive a diabetes  screening, while a related performance standard may be that providers  are expected to ensure that at least a certain percentage of applicable  patients receive the screening each year.", "Section 730 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2016 (NDAA 2016) directed DOD to develop plans to enhance the  experience of beneficiaries receiving care under the MHS and eliminate  variation in the quality of care that beneficiaries receive across direct and  purchased care. The Act stipulated that DOD align the measures used to  assess the quality of direct and purchased care to improve care across  the MHS as a whole. In March 2017, DOD issued its response to section  730, reporting that it had established two sets of quality measures\u2014 a set  of measures for direct care described as \u201ccore measures\u201d and another set  of measures for purchased care. The MHS reported to Congress that the  core direct care measures and purchased care measures are the key  quality measures DOD\u2019s senior health care leadership use to track DOD\u2019s  progress towards achieving the department\u2019s overall strategic goals of  providing high quality care across the MHS as a whole. DOD reported  that it aligned these quality measures across direct and purchased care  where possible.", "Section 730 of the NDAA 2016 also includes a provision for us to assess  the strengths and limitations of DOD\u2019s plans for achieving the Act\u2019s  objectives. In this report, we examine  1.  the core direct care measures and purchased care measures DOD  uses to assess the quality of care in the MHS; and  2.  the extent to which DOD has established performance standards  related to its core direct care measures and purchased care measures  and corrective action requirements for providers that do not meet  these performance standards.", "To examine the core direct care measures and purchased care measures  DOD uses to assess the quality of care in the MHS, we focused our  review on the measures listed on the Core Dashboard and Purchased  Care Dashboard, which are used in direct care and purchased care,  respectively. We focused on the dashboard measures because the MHS  reported to Congress that these are the measures that DOD health care  leaders rely on to establish accountability throughout the MHS and  identify areas where quality improvement is needed. The measures on  the dashboards are periodically updated, and we examined the measures  included on the dashboards as of March 31, 2018 and the extent to which  the measures on one dashboard aligned with those on the other. We also  examined the range of quality care areas and medical conditions  assessed by the dashboard measures and compared these to the range  of quality care areas and medical conditions assessed by the measures  included in the Hospital Compare measure set for inpatient care and the  Core Quality Measure Collaborative (CQMC) measure sets for outpatient  care. Because the Hospital Compare and CQMC measures for inpatient  and outpatient care have been vetted and reviewed by multiple health  care stakeholders and widely adopted, we determined that they  represented appropriate benchmarks for assessing the scope of the  MHS\u2019s quality assessment. We also reviewed DOD documents to  understand DOD senior health leadership\u2019s decisions to select and track  the measures on the Core and Purchased Care Dashboards and not  others. Specifically, we systematically reviewed minutes from 335  meetings of the MHS governance bodies\u2014which represent the three  military services that provide health care services under the MHS (Army,  Navy, and Air Force) and other components of the MHS\u2014that make final  decisions on the measures to be included on the Core and Purchased  Care Dashboards. We supplemented this document review with  interviews of the MHS officials responsible for managing direct care as  well as those responsible for overseeing the MHS\u2019s contracting of  purchased care. We also interviewed representatives of the medical  commands for each of the three military services to obtain their  perspectives on the measures that the MHS had selected to assess the  quality of care provided to their active duty members and other  beneficiaries. In addition, we interviewed the Chair of the Health Care  Subcommittee of the Military Coalition, a group of 32 military, veterans,  and uniformed services organizations. Although not representative, this  allowed us to obtain the perspectives of beneficiaries on the MHS\u2019s  quality measurement efforts.", "To examine the extent to which DOD has established performance  standards related to its core direct care measures and purchased care  measures and corrective action requirements for providers that do not  meet performance standards, we reviewed policies related to the MHS\u2019s  oversight of provider performance on the measures on its Core and  Purchased Care Dashboards. We also interviewed MHS officials and  reviewed relevant MHS documents to determine whether the MHS sets  specific performance standards for MTFs and civilian providers related to  the quality measures on the Core and Purchased Care Dashboards. We  also examined whether or to what extent MHS has established  requirements for initiating corrective actions when providers do not meet  those performance standards. The relevant documents we reviewed  include the minutes of the MHS governance body meetings noted above;  the MHS reports to Congress on direct and purchased care; documents  related to the purchased care contracts; and reports that contractors  submitted to the MHS for purchased care. Additionally, in our review of  the MHS governance body meeting minutes, we examined MHS officials\u2019  decisions, their rationale, and any actions taken in response to the trends  being monitored on the Core and Purchased Care Dashboard quality  measures.

Health care quality measures are  intended to (1) inform providers about opportunities for potential  improvements in their delivery of care, (2) encourage or incentivize  providers to consistently provide high quality care, and (3) inform  consumers about which providers are most likely to deliver high quality  care. There are broad categories of clinical quality measures that address  various aspects of quality of care. See table 1 for a description of these  broad categories of quality measures.", "The data used to calculate the results of health care quality measures can  come from a number of different sources. Some measures often require  detailed clinical information obtained from patient medical records, such  as process measures that indicate whether timely and effective care was  provided in a specific situation, for example, or whether stroke patients  received clot-dissolving medication appropriately. Other measures are  designed to use information on patient demographics and diagnoses that  can be obtained from more readily accessible sources, such as claims  data or other administrative data that have already been collected for  other purposes such as billing.

DHA reports through the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness to the Secretary of Defense. The  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs manages  the Defense Health Program appropriation, which funds the medical and  health care programs at the medical commands of the military services.  As of fiscal year 2018, most of the MTFs, including military hospitals and  clinics, were under the direction and control of the military services, which  are responsible for staffing, training, and equipping those MTFs to meet  mission requirements. DHA has responsibility for the managed care  support contracts through which the MHS administers its purchased care,  and DHA also administers several MTFs in the vicinity of Washington,  DC. Figure 1 depicts the MHS organizational structure.", "Recently enacted changes will affect the administration of the MTFs in  future years. Most notably, DOD will alter administration of the MTFs,  shifting responsibility from the military services to DHA. Section 702 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA 2017)  directed DOD to give DHA responsibility for the administration of all  MTFs, including budgetary matters, information technology, and health  care administration and management. In the conference report for  NDAA 2017, Congress stated its intention that the creation of a single  agency responsible for all MTFs would improve and sustain readiness,  reduce costs, and increase efficiency. DOD has since prepared a series  of implementation plans as it works to develop the specific policies and  procedures to enable this change to take effect starting October 1, 2018.  The most recent plan issued by DOD in June 2018 envisions a 3-year  transition to be completed October 1, 2021.", "For purchased care, DOD contracts with civilian health care contractors to  manage its civilian providers on a regional basis. The primary  responsibilities of these managed care support contractors include the  following: developing civilian provider networks, which include hospitals and ensuring adequate access to health care;  referring and authorizing beneficiaries to receive health care; processing health care claims; educating providers and beneficiaries; and  conducting utilization management and quality management  programs.", "There have been several generations of multi-year contracts since 1996.

The  documents show that proposals for potential quality measures are  developed by work groups that focus on different specialized areas, such  as maternity care or mental health. These proposals are reviewed and  approved by the Steering Committee for P4I, which develops the list of  core quality measures for direct care. The Steering Committee then  presents the list of core quality measures to a succession of governance  bodies\u2014each of which incorporates representation from the three military  services plus DHA\u2014for review and approval. DOD documents indicate  that the MHS repeats this process annually as it decides which quality  measures to add, drop, or modify for the coming fiscal year from the Core  Dashboard.", "The DOD documents we reviewed lay out a parallel process that the MHS  follows to select which purchased care quality measures will be tracked in  the Purchased Care Dashboard. A work group that specializes on  purchased care issues with representation of DHA and the three military  services develops the proposed list of quality measures for the Purchased  Care Dashboard. This list is then reviewed and approved by the same  succession of governance bodies that decide on the Core Dashboard  measures.", "Officials told us and DOD documents confirmed that the MHS and the  purchased care contractors also track additional quality measures that  are not included in the Core and Purchased Care Dashboards. For  example, MHS clinicians who provide maternity care track a set of  measures developed by the National Perinatal Information Center.  Similarly, a number of military hospitals report on surgical quality  measures to the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The  MHS also conducts surveys of MHS beneficiaries from which it obtains  data for patient experience measures for both direct and purchased care.  Additionally, the MHS requires the managed care support contractors that  administer the MHS\u2019s networks of civilian providers for purchased care to  monitor several different sets of quality measures or indicators, many of  which focus on patient safety. These include patient safety indicators,  hospital acquired conditions, and serious reportable events.

Since 2005, CMS  has collected results for individual hospitals on a specific list of health  care quality measures that are posted on a website known as Hospital  Compare. CMS does this to make comparable information on the quality  of care provided by different hospitals publicly available. Hospital  Compare currently covers more than 4,000 hospitals that participate in  the Medicare program. These hospitals supply data to CMS for quality  measures of inpatient and emergency department care. These data  reflect the care provided to all patients treated at these hospitals, not just  those covered by Medicare. Each year CMS goes through a formal  process, including receiving input from experts and stakeholders, to  review and revise the mix of quality measures that these hospitals are  expected to report. The purpose of this review, according to CMS, is to  ensure that the set of measures reported on Hospital Compare provides  meaningful information for quality improvement while reducing  unnecessary administrative burden.", "Initiated in 2014, the CQMC is a multi-stakeholder voluntary effort  focused on quality measure alignment that has developed eight sets of  measures for outpatient primary and specialty care, known as the CQMC  measure sets.

Physician specialty  societies, employer groups, consumer groups, and regional collaboratives  also participate in the negotiations. The CQMC measure sets have been  adopted by CMS for Medicare and by 15 major private health insurers for  commercial health plans. Additionally, section 728 of the NDAA 2017  directs the MHS to use, to the extent appropriate, these quality measures  to assess the quality of direct and purchased care. CQMC documents  show that the members of the CQMC intend to continually update these  core measure sets as more meaningful measures are developed over  time.

To assess the quality of direct care, the  MHS tracks 43 measures on its Core Dashboard, and to assess the  quality of purchased care, the MHS tracks 18 measures on its Purchased  Care Dashboard. The MHS tracks 8 measures that are the same for both  dashboards, leaving 35 measures tracked only on the Core Dashboard  for direct care and 10 measures tracked only on the Purchased Care  Dashboard for purchased care. (See fig. 2.)", "According to MHS officials, since launching the P4I performance  management system in 2015, the MHS has focused on making  systematic improvements in the quality of care across the MTFs in direct  care. As a result, the 43 measures they have chosen for the Core  Dashboard reflect their priorities for quality improvement within direct care  only. In the case of purchased care, MHS officials stated that requiring  civilian providers to report on the same 43 measures that are used on the  Core Dashboard for direct care would add burden, and the MHS had  concerns that this would make civilian providers less likely to participate  in purchased care. Instead, the MHS tracks 18 measures on the  Purchased Care Dashboard that rely on information sources other than  provider reporting, such as claims that the providers submit in the normal  course of receiving payment for their services and surveys that the MHS  conducts of its beneficiaries. MHS officials explained that they try to  minimize the reporting burden for purchased care providers because for  most of these civilian providers, eligible MHS beneficiaries represent only  a small proportion of their patient population.", "We also found that for direct care, the MHS uses its quality measures on  the Core Dashboard to assess the quality of care delivered to  beneficiaries served by individual MTFs, such as hospitals or clinics.  However, for purchased care, the MHS uses its quality measures on the  Purchased Care Dashboard to assess the quality of care delivered to the  beneficiary population served by each contractor\u2019s network as a whole\u2013 not the quality of care delivered by individual civilian hospitals, clinicians,  or other providers in the network. Specifically:  In direct care, the MHS uses the 43 measures on the Core Dashboard  to track the quality of care delivered by individual MTFs. For example,  on a measure of central line-associated bloodstream infections, the  MHS tracks the incidence of such infections by individual MTF and by  military service (i.e., the incidence of such infections in Army, Navy  and Air Force MTFs).", "In contrast, in purchased care, the MHS assesses information on the  18 measures on the Purchased Care Dashboard for all beneficiaries  in each of the networks administered by the two managed care  support contractors. For example, on a measure of the percentage of  beneficiaries with diabetes who have their hemoglobin level tested  annually, the MHS calculates an overall rate of hemoglobin testing  across all the diabetic patients that receive care in each contractor\u2019s  network.", "The beneficiary population-level reporting on quality measures on the  Purchased Care Dashboard reflects the nature of the MHS\u2019s relationship  with its managed care support contractors for purchased care. Under the  terms of the contracts that the MHS has negotiated with the contractors  that administer the networks of civilian providers to care for eligible  beneficiaries, the contractors bear responsibility for ensuring the quality of  care delivered by those providers. While the MHS requires the managed  care support contractors to monitor different sets of quality measures or  indicators, such as patient safety indicators, hospital acquired conditions,  and serious reportable events to identify possible cases of individual  patient harm and determine appropriate interventions, the contractors  report this information in annual reports to the MHS for their network as a  whole, as opposed to reporting on individual providers.", "Because the MHS largely uses separate measures for direct and  purchased care on its dashboards and tracks the quality of care delivered  by civilian providers in purchased care in the aggregate rather than  individually, the MHS lacks the information it needs to make comparable  assessments of the quality of care delivered across the MHS as a whole.  This, in turn, limits the MHS\u2019s ability to ensure it has the information  needed to determine whether it is achieving the department\u2019s overall  strategic goals of providing high quality care across the MHS as a whole  and ensuring that beneficiaries receive a consistent level of high quality  care regardless of whether that care is delivered in direct or purchased  care. Moreover, using a different set of quality of measures on the  dashboards for direct and purchased care is inconsistent with section 730  of the NDAA 2016, which directs the MHS to align its measures for direct  and purchased care so it can reduce performance variation across the  MHS. MHS officials acknowledge in principle the value of using aligned  measures to assess quality of care in direct and purchased care, but the  officials cited a range of factors that pose challenges to achieving this  objective, such as the large number of civilian providers and the lack of  common health information technology systems.", "Based on our review, we found that one way the MHS could have a  common set of quality measures for both direct and purchased care,  without increasing the reporting burden on civilian providers, would be to  use, as appropriate, Hospital Compare and CQMC quality measures.  Notably, the MHS states on its website that almost all of the civilian  hospitals that are in the contractors\u2019 networks for purchased care already  report information on the measures posted on the Hospital Compare  website. As a result, there potentially would be no additional burden for  these purchased care providers to report information on the Hospital  Compare quality measures. Similarly, major health plans report that they  have begun implementing the CQMC measure sets in their contracts with  physicians, meaning that physicians participating in those plans already  report information on CQMC outpatient quality measures. To the extent  that those physicians are also in the MHS contractors\u2019 networks for  purchased care, the information the physicians report on the CQMC  measures could be used by the MHS.", "We found the MHS is already using some Hospital Compare and CQMC  measures for inpatient and outpatient care. There are a total of 76  measures that Medicare and private health insurers report to Hospital  Compare and a total of 60 CQMC outpatient measures. Besides the  measures used in the Core and Purchased Care Dashboards, MHS also  collects 24 of 76 Hospital Compare measures and 10 of the 60 CQMC  outpatient measures. For the most part, these measures are not part of  the direct and purchased care dashboards that MHS leadership uses to  assess the performance of direct and purchased care. Furthermore, MHS  officials told us that they have no specific plans to increase the number of  measures that the MHS uses from Hospital Compare for inpatient care  delivered in its hospitals.

These measures should cover a broad enough range of  measure types and medical conditions so that they provide an accurate  overall assessment of the quality of care patients receive.", "Based on our analysis, Table 2 below shows the limited range of  measures on the Core and Purchased Care dashboards used by the  MHS to assess inpatient care, as compared to the range of inpatient  measures that Medicare hospitals report for Hospital Compare. In  general, each of the five types of measures shown in the table below  addresses different aspects of health care quality in hospital settings. For  direct care, the MHS uses no more than one measure on its Core  Dashboard for all of these five measure types except for \u201cOutcome\u201d  measures; for purchased care, the MHS does not use any inpatient care  measures on its Purchased Care Dashboard.", "Similarly, based on our analysis, Table 3 below shows the limited range  of measures on the Core and Purchased Care Dashboards used by the  MHS to assess outpatient care, as compared to the range of outpatient  measures that are part of the CQMC measure sets adopted by Medicare  and private health insurers. The MHS uses measures on its dashboards  that assess fewer clinical focus areas and medical conditions as  compared with those measures included in the CQMC measure sets. As  with hospital care, the difference is greatest with respect to purchased  care.", "The limitations we found in the quality measures used by the MHS\u2014the  relatively narrow range of measures as well as the relatively few  measures used across direct and purchased care\u2014reflect the MHS\u2019s  priorities in selecting quality measures. In short, the MHS focuses on the  value and impact of implementing individual measures, but does not  prioritize aligning the measures used across direct and purchased care or  expanding the range of medical conditions and quality areas covered in  the aggregate by the measures. The MHS\u2019s annual assessment of quality  measures focuses only the Core Dashboard measures. For each Core  Dashboard measure for which a change is under consideration\u2014such as  dropping, modifying, or adding another quality measure to the Core  Dashboard\u2014MHS officials apply a standard set of criteria involving both  the feasibility of collecting the data needed for that measure and the utility  of that measure for addressing a strategic priority or promoting  performance improvement. When asked about the potential value of  increasing the number of Hospital Compare measures, MHS officials said  they need to make a value-based determination of whether the benefits of  obtaining results for any given Hospital Compare measure justified the  costs of collecting and transmitting the data required for that measure. In  discussions about potential measures for the Purchased Care  Dashboard, MHS officials also focused on the characteristics of specific  measures being considered for inclusion in the dashboard.", "Because the MHS does not prioritize expanding the range of medical  conditions and quality areas covered by common measures across direct  and purchased care, the measures the MHS uses provide DOD\u2019s senior  health care leadership with an incomplete picture of the quality of care  across the MHS. As we have noted, the MHS has reported to the  Congress that its DOD health care leaders rely on the Core and  Purchased Care Dashboard measures to establish accountability  throughout the MHS and identify areas where quality improvement is  needed. However, the current approach may not lead to the selection of  quality measures for the two dashboards that would enable MHS officials  to identify the most critical quality of care issues in the MHS.

For example, in the  case of the HEDIS All Cause Readmission measure on the Core  Dashboard, the MHS\u2019s performance standard is that MTFs should have a  rate of unplanned acute readmissions within 30 days of an initial hospital  admission that is as good as or better than the national 75th percentile.  This performance standard is based on the readmission rates that the  National Committee for Quality Assurance, the lead entity for that  measure, has observed across U.S. hospitals.", "During regularly recurring governance meetings throughout the year,  MHS governance bodies review how MTFs have performed relative to the  performance standards for the Core Dashboard measures. Our review  found that during these meetings, the governance bodies generally do not  examine the circumstances of MTFs that do not perform well on the  performance standards related to the Core Dashboard measures.  Consequently, DOD\u2019s senior health care leadership within the  governance bodies may receive limited information on the challenges  faced by low-performing individual MTFs. However, during these  meetings, officials from the military services and DHA highlight MTFs that  are performing well on the established performance standards, and the  officials share best practices and specific strategies used to achieve high  performance.", "We also found that in direct care, the MHS requires MTFs that do not  meet the MHS\u2019s performance standards related to its Core Dashboard  measures to take corrective actions to improve the quality of care they  deliver. The military services\u2014Army, Navy and Air Force\u2014and DHA have  been responsible for implementing this requirement. For example, Navy  officials explained that they periodically review information collected on  the MHS\u2019s Core Dashboard quality measures to analyze areas where  MTFs do not meet established performance standards tied to these  measures and to oversee MTFs\u2019 efforts to correct these deficiencies.  Officials told us that each of the services exercises its discretion to  independently develop and implement the corrective actions that the  service determines best address the performance issues identified  through the use of the MHS\u2019s quality measures. For example, to help  reduce the number of Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections  (CLABSI), the Army began financially awarding MTFs that performed well  on the CLABSI measure, whereas the Air Force developed a toolkit to  help providers prevent CLABSI.", "As the MHS moves to transfer administration of the MTFs from the  individual military services to DHA as directed by section 702 of the  NDAA 2017, the approach for assessing performance and implementing  corrective actions is likely to change. The MHS\u2019s recently issued  implementation plan as of June 2018 outlines some alterations to the  current performance assessment process. Specifically, MTFs will create  and submit a performance plan that will be reviewed and approved by  DHA. DHA will host monthly review sessions with MTFs to track  performance on the plan. MTFs will be evaluated using a set of measures  aligned to the Quadruple Aim that will include many but not all of the Core  Dashboard measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The MHS Has Not Established Performance Standards and Related Corrective Action Requirements for Individual Civilian Providers in Purchased Care", "paragraphs": ["The MHS has not established performance standards related to the 18  Purchased Care Dashboard measures for individual civilian hospitals,  clinicians, or other providers in purchased care. Instead, the MHS has  established performance standards related to the 18 Purchased Care  Dashboard measures that MHS officials use to track the performance of  each of the two managed care support contractors. According to MHS  officials, the MHS does not require the contractors to ensure that each  individual hospital, physician, or other provider in these networks meets  the performance standards related to the Purchased Care Dashboard  measures. For example, in the case of a measure on the use of imaging  for low back pain, the MHS has set a performance standard for each  managed care support contractor, one that aims at avoiding excessive  imaging across the beneficiary population in the contractor\u2019s network.  However, officials told us that the information that the MHS collects on the  measure\u2014the number of beneficiaries in each of the contractors\u2019  networks who receive imaging services for low back pain\u2014does not  indicate the extent to which each individual civilian provider in the  contractor networks meets or fails to meet the performance standard.  Thus, the information the MHS obtains on the quality measure and its  related performance standard does not identify which hospitals, clinicians,  or other providers need to improve their performance in order for all  beneficiaries to receive the expected level of care quality that the  performance standard represents.", "Because the MHS has not established performance standards related to  the Purchased Care dashboard measures for individual civilian hospitals,  clinicians, or other providers in purchased care, there are no related  requirements for corrective action. Instead, the MHS requires its  managed care support contractors to undertake other activities to  promote improved quality of care across civilian providers in their  networks. These include investigations of quality issues, focused reviews,  analyses of Hospital Compare data, and value-based purchasing pilots,  as discussed further below. However, our review found that these efforts  are not applied comprehensively across all individual purchased care  providers.", "Investigations of Quality Issues. One approach the MHS uses to promote  improved quality of care across purchased care providers is to direct its  managed care support contractors to investigate whether individual  beneficiaries have experienced what the MHS refers to as a quality issue.  Potential quality issues are defined by the MHS as any instance when  there are indications that a purchased care provider has deviated from  what the managed care support contractors deem acceptable standards  of professional practice. The contractors can identify these potential  quality issues through beneficiary complaints; analyses of patient safety  indicators, hospital acquired conditions, and serious reportable events; or  by the MHS or contractor staff. Once potential quality issues are  identified, they are investigated by a clinician, who reviews the patient\u2019s  complete medical record. Based on the clinician\u2019s review of the patient\u2019s  medical records, the clinician verifies whether or not a quality issue has  occurred and, if so, assigns the quality issue a severity level. To  address the quality issue, the managed care support contractors may  take a range of steps, including educating the provider, monitoring the  provider, notifying the appropriate state or federal bodies, and removing  the provider from the MHS\u2019s purchased care provider network. In  practice, however, MHS officials said and documents we reviewed show  that providers are rarely removed from the network. For example, MHS  officials reported that one contractor estimated that one provider was  removed from its network over quality issues every 1 to 2 years.", "Focused Reviews. Another way the MHS uses its managed care support  contractors to promote improved quality of care across purchased care  providers is through focused reviews. During these reviews, the managed  care support contractors review the medical records for a selected patient  population to determine the extent to which a specified quality concern is  a widespread problem. For example, in 2015 one contractor reviewed the  medical records of 96 beneficiaries to determine the frequency of  obstetric trauma, an injury related to vaginal deliveries. If a focused  review determines that there is a widespread quality problem, the  contractor may implement a quality improvement initiative designed to  prompt all of its network providers to address that concern, as opposed to  targeting specific providers.", "Analyses of Hospital Compare Data. The MHS also requires the  contractors to conduct an annual examination of the performance of  hospitals in their networks on the different quality measures reported on  Medicare\u2019s Hospital Compare. However, the managed care support  contractors have considerable flexibility in deciding how to structure these  analyses and how to follow-up on results. Consequently, the two  managed care support contractors have adopted different analytical  approaches to define and identify hospitals with relatively low  performance. For example, the managed care support contractors  chose to examine different quality measures and use different criteria to  identify hospitals with relatively low performance. In their most recent  annual reports issued during 2017, both managed care support  contractors indicated that they were considering contacting the lower  performing hospitals to prompt remedial action, but because no action  had yet occurred, the reports leave open what steps were ultimately taken  and how these hospitals responded. Nonetheless, these activities  suggest that the managed care support contractors have the ability to use  Hospital Compare to analyze and address individual provider  performance on a standard set of quality measures. However, the MHS  has not specified how this process should proceed, leaving it to the  managed care support contractors to decide what and how much they will  do in conducting these analyses of individual hospitals.", "Value-Based Purchasing Pilots. The MHS has recently begun to test  different approaches to incentivize purchased care providers to deliver  high quality care through several value-based purchasing pilots. For  example, in February 2018 the MHS launched a maternity care pilot that  pays providers more for better performance on specified quality  measures. The pilot also implements a \u2018steerage model\u2019 approach that  identifies higher performing providers in directories provided to patients  by indicating providers as \u201cGold Stork\u201d or \u201cSilver Stork.\u201d These pilots may  provide the MHS another way to influence the quality of care provided by  certain subsets of its purchased care providers. MHS officials stated that  although DOD has not arrived at specific goals, it plans to expand these  pilots to cover around 20 to 25 percent of its purchased care services by  2020.", "The use of performance standards and corrective action requirements for  individual hospitals, clinicians, or other providers who serve MHS  beneficiaries is consistent with federal internal control standards for  monitoring, which state that management should establish monitoring  activities, evaluate the results, and remediate any deficiencies. While  the MHS has established performance standards related to its Core  Dashboard measures in direct care and has corrective action  requirements for MTFs that do not meet those standards, it has not done  so for individual civilian hospitals, clinicians, or other providers in  purchased care related to its Purchased Care Dashboard measures.  Additionally, if the MHS aligned quality measures on the Core and  Purchased Care Dashboards at the provider level, the MHS could require  its managed care support contractors to monitor the performance of  individual civilian providers relative to set performance standards  comparable to the ones that the MHS has established for MTFs. This  approach would allow the MHS to determine the extent of performance  variability, both among individual civilian providers and across MTFs and  individual civilian providers. By not establishing consistent performance  standards at the provider-level for direct and purchased care and  requiring corrective action requirements to ensure that these standards  are met by providers in both direct and purchased care, the MHS is  limited in its ability to address variation in the quality of care delivered.  This further limits the MHS\u2019s ability to ensure that it is achieving the  department\u2019s overall strategic goals of providing high quality care across  the MHS as whole and ensuring that beneficiaries receive a consistent  level of high quality care regardless of whether that care is delivered in  direct or purchased care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress directed DOD to reduce variation in the quality of care  beneficiaries receive through the MHS. DOD has taken important steps  towards this goal by identifying a set of core measures that DOD senior  health care leadership use to assess quality of care in direct care and  another set of measures that they use to assess quality in purchased  care. DOD health care leaders rely on these measures on their Core and  Purchased Care Dashboards to establish accountability throughout the  MHS and identify areas where quality improvement is needed. However,  with few exceptions, the MHS uses different measures on its Core and  Purchased Care Dashboards to assess the quality of direct and  purchased care, making it difficult to determine the extent to which it is  ensuring consistent quality across the MHS as a whole. Furthermore, for  both direct and purchased care, the MHS uses measures on its  dashboards that assess a limited range of quality areas and medical  conditions when compared to the widely used quality measure sets  adopted by Medicare and private insurers. Without using a broader range  of available quality measures available\u2014measures that many purchased  care providers already report to CMS and private health insurers\u2014DOD is  missing an opportunity to better target the most critical quality of care  issues in the MHS. The limitations we identified in the MHS\u2019s Core and  Purchased Care Dashboard quality measures reflect the fact that in its  annual measure selection process, the MHS does not prioritize aligning  the quality measures across direct and purchased care and expanding  the range of measures it uses across the two systems of care.", "Finally, our review shows that while DOD has established performance  standards for the core measures in direct care and corrective action  requirements for MTFs that do not meet these standards, DOD has not  done so for individual purchased care providers. Notably, DOD does not  set clear expectations that individual purchased care providers should  meet the performance standards related to the quality measures on the  Purchased Care Dashboard. Performance standards and related  corrective action requirements are critical for holding both MTFs and  individual civilian providers accountable for providing quality care. Without  consistent standards and related corrective action requirements across  the MHS, DOD is limited in its ability to ensure that beneficiaries  consistently receive high quality care, regardless of whether they receive  that care in the direct or purchased care systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations to the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Health Affairs.", "As MHS governing bodies conduct their recurring reviews of quality  measures selected for MHS\u2019s Core Dashboard and Purchased Care  Dashboards, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs should  direct those bodies to prioritize, as appropriate, the selection of measures  that apply to both direct and purchased care at the provider level and that  expand the range of quality measure types and medical conditions that  are assessed. (Recommendation 1)", "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs should establish, as  appropriate, performance standards related to the Purchased Care  Dashboard measures that are consistent with the MHS\u2019s performance  standards for direct care; ensure they are applied to individual purchased  care providers; and take steps, such as amending its managed care  support contracts, if necessary, to require corrective actions to be taken  when providers do not meet those standards.

Additionally, DOD  stated that it has efforts underway to create a library of all quality  measures used across direct and purchased care.", "With regards to the second recommendation, DOD acknowledged the  need to strengthen accountability for meeting performance standards that  apply to both direct and purchased care providers.  It also agreed that  measures of individual provider performance in purchased care should be  augmented and consistent with measures in direct care, where possible.  DOD noted, however, that because it works through managed care  support contractors for purchased care, it can hold the contractors  accountable for meeting performance standards but cannot currently take  action against individual providers based solely on performance. Instead,  DOD stated that rather than taking a corrective action approach, it plans  to expand its value-based purchasing efforts and incentivize providers  that meet and exceed certain quality standards.  This raises concerns, as  DOD\u2019s current plans to expand its value-based purchasing efforts would  only be applicable for between 20 and 25 percent of the services MHS  beneficiaries receive from purchased care providers by 2020, as we  noted in our report. Without having all providers managed consistently  and subject to prompt remediation of deficiencies, DOD is missing an  opportunity to improve the quality of purchased care, and it increases the  risk that not all beneficiaries will receive a consistent level of high quality  care across the MHS. Acknowledging DOD\u2019s comment that it cannot  currently take action against individual providers based solely on  performance, we have modified our recommendation to clarify that DOD  should take the steps it determines are necessary, such as amending its  managed care support contracts, to institute corrective action  requirements for purchased care providers.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and  appropriate congressional committees.
