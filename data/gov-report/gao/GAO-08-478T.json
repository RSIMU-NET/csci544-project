A sound basis for reexamination can productively begin with identification of and debate on underlying principles. Through prior analyses of existing programs, GAO identified a number of principles that could help drive an assessment of proposals for restructuring the federal surface transportation program. These principles include (1) defining the federal role based on identified areas of national interest, (2) incorporating performance and accountability for results into funding decisions, and (3) ensuring fiscal sustainability and employing the best tools and approaches to improve results and return on investment. GAO developed these principles based on prior analyses of existing surface transportation programs as well as a body of work that GAO developed for Congress, including its High-Risk, Performance and Accountability, and 21st Century Challenges reports. The principles do not prescribe a specific approach to restructuring, but they do highlight key attributes that will help ensure that a restructured surface transportation program addresses current challenges. In its report, the Commission makes a number of recommendations for restructuring the federal surface transportation program. The recommendations include significantly increasing the level of investment by all levels of government in surface transportation, consolidating and reorganizing the current programs, speeding project delivery, and making the current program more performance- and outcome-based and mode-neutral, among other things. GAO is currently analyzing the Commission's recommendations using the principles that GAO developed for evaluating proposals for restructuring the surface transportation program. Although this analysis is not complete, GAO's preliminary results indicate that some of the Commission's recommendations appear to be aligned with the principles, while others may not be aligned. For example, although the Commission identifies areas of national interest and recommends reorganizing the individual surface transportation programs around these areas, it generally recommends that the federal government pay for 80 percent of project costs without considering whether this level of funding reflects the national interest or should vary by program or project."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to present our preliminary observations  about the recent report of The National Surface Transportation Policy and  Revenue Study Commission (Commission). The Commission was given a  broad mandate that includes examining the current condition and future  needs of the surface transportation system, identifying alternative revenue  sources, and providing specific recommendations regarding changes to the  surface transportation program\u2019s design and operations, federal policies,  and legislation. The Commission\u2019s January 2008 report is the culmination  of over 18 months of work to fulfill the mandate set by Congress, and we  applaud the Commission\u2019s efforts.", "The Commission\u2019s report comes at a time when our nation has reached a  critical junction with the current surface transportation program. For  example, the Highway Trust Fund was created in 1956 to finance the  construction of the interstate highway system. That system is now  complete. However, the federal highway program\u2019s financing and delivery  mechanisms have not substantially changed, and the program\u2019s continued  relevance in the 21st century is unclear. The federal role in surface  transportation has also grown over the years, and the Highway Trust Fund  now funds a variety of highway, transit, and even some rail programs. In  addition, without significant changes in funding mechanisms, revenue  sources, or planned spending, the Highway Trust Fund is projected to  incur significant deficits in the years ahead. As a result, in 2007, we added  financing the nation\u2019s transportation system to GAO\u2019s High Risk List.  Furthermore, the growing demand has outpaced the capacity of the  transportation system over the past several decades. The result is  apparent: increasing number of hours spent inching along clogged roads  and highways, especially at rush hours and other times of peak demand.  The economic implications are significant, ranging from wasted fuel and  time as cars idle in traffic to increased costs for businesses as the system  grows more unreliable. In addition to burdening the economy, congestion  can harm the environment and health of the nation\u2019s citizens.", "Addressing these challenges is complicated by the breadth of the nation\u2019s  surface transportation network\u2014encompassing highway, transit, and rail  systems and ports that are owned, funded, and operated by both the public  and the private sectors. Moreover, surface transportation policy decisions  are inextricably linked with aviation, economic, environmental, and energy  policy concerns. In addition, the federal government\u2019s financial condition  and fiscal outlook are worse than many may understand. Specifically, the  federal budget is on an imprudent and unsustainable path\u2014heightening  concern about the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund because other  federal revenue sources may not be available to help solve the nation\u2019s  current transportation challenges. Addressing these challenges requires  strategic and intermodal approaches, effective tools and programs, and  coordinated solutions involving all levels of the government and the  private sector. Yet in many cases, the government is still trying to do  business in ways that are based on conditions, priorities, and approaches  that were established decades ago and are not well suited to addressing  21st century challenges. Consequently, we have called for a fundamental  reexamination of the nation\u2019s transportation policies and programs.", "My remarks today focus on (1) principles to assess proposals for  restructuring the surface transportation program and (2) our preliminary  observations on the Commission\u2019s recommendations. My comments are  based on our ongoing work for the Ranking Member of this Committee,  the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  Senator DeMint, as well as a body of work that we have completed over  the past several years for Congress. We conducted our work on the  Commission\u2019s recommendations in January and February 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Long-term fiscal simulations  by GAO, the Congressional Budget Office, and others all show that despite  a 3-year decline in the federal government\u2019s unified budget deficit, we still  face large and growing structural deficits driven by rising health care costs  and demographic trends. As the baby boom generation retires, entitlement  programs will grow and require increasing shares of federal spending.  Absent significant changes to tax and spending programs and policies, we  face a future of unsustainable deficits and debt that threaten to cripple our  economy and quality of life. This looming fiscal crisis requires a  fundamental reexamination of all government programs and  commitments. Although the long-term outlook is driven by rising health  care costs, all areas of government should be re-examined. This involves  reviewing government programs and commitments and testing their  continued relevance and relative priority for the 21st century. Such a  reexamination offers an opportunity to address emerging needs by  eliminating outdated or ineffective programs, more sharply defining the  federal role in relation to state and local roles, and modernizing those  programs and policies that remain relevant. We are currently working with  Congress to develop a variety of tools to help carry out a reexamination of  federal programs.", "The nation\u2019s surface transportation programs are particularly ready for  reexamination. This would include asking whether existing program  constructs and financing mechanisms are relevant to the challenges of the  21st century, and making tough choices in setting priorities and linking  resources to results. We have previously reported on the following factors  that highlight the need for transformation of the nation\u2019s transportation  policy.", "Future demand for transportation will strain the network. Projected  population growth, technological changes, and increased globalization are  expected to increase the strain on the nation\u2019s transportation system.  Congestion across modes is significant and projected to worsen.", "National transportation goals and priorities are difficult to discern.", "Federal transportation statutes and regulations establish multiple, and  sometimes conflicting, goals and outcomes for federal programs. In  addition, federal transportation funding is generally not linked to system  performance or to the accomplishment of goals or outcomes.  Furthermore, the transportation program, like many other federal  programs, is subject to congressional directives, which could impede the  selection of merit-based projects.", "The federal government\u2019s role is often indirect. The Department of  Transportation (DOT) implements national transportation policy and  administers most federal transportation programs. While DOT carries out  some activities directly, it does not have control over the vast majority of  the activities it funds. Additionally, DOT\u2019s framework of separate modal  administrations makes it difficult for intermodal projects to be integrated  into the transportation network.", "Future transportation funding is uncertain. Revenues to support the  Highway Trust Fund\u2014the major source of federal highway and transit  funding\u2014are eroding. Receipts for the Highway Trust Fund, which are  derived from motor fuel and truck-related taxes (e.g., truck sales) are  continuing to grow. However, the federal motor fuel tax of 18.4 cents per  gallon has not been increased since 1993, and thus the purchasing power  of fuel tax revenues has eroded with inflation. Furthermore, that erosion  will continue with the introduction of more fuel-efficient vehicles and  alternative-fueled vehicles in the coming years, raising the question of  whether fuel taxes are a sustainable source of financing transportation. In  addition, funding authorized in the recently enacted highway and transit  program legislation is expected to outstrip the growth in trust fund  receipts. Finally, the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges constrain  decision makers\u2019 ability to use other revenue sources for transportation  needs.", "Recognizing many of these challenges and the importance of the  transportation system to the nation, Congress established The National  Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission  (Commission) in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation  Equity Act\u2014A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). The mission of the  Commission was, among other things, to examine the condition and future  needs of the nation\u2019s surface transportation system and short and long- term alternatives to replace or supplement the fuel tax as the principal  revenue source to support the Highway Trust Fund. In January 2008, the  Commission released a report with numerous recommendations to place  the trust fund on a sustainable path and to reform the current structure of  the nation\u2019s surface transportation programs. Congress also created the  National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission in  SAFETEA-LU and charged it with analyzing future highway and transit  needs and the finances of the Highway Trust Fund and recommending  alternative approaches to financing transportation infrastructure. This  Commission issued its interim report this past week, and its final report is  expected by spring of 2009.

In identifying areas of national interest, proposals  should consider existing 21st century challenges and how future trends  could have an impact on emerging areas of national importance\u2014as well  as how the national interest and federal role may vary by area. For  example, experts have suggested that federal transportation policy should  recognize emerging national and global imperatives, such as reducing the  nation\u2019s dependence on foreign fuel sources and minimizing the impact of  the transportation system on global climate change. Once the various  national interests in surface transportation have been identified, proposals  should also clarify specific goals for federal involvement in the surface  transportation program as well as define the federal role in working  toward each goal. Goals should be specific and outcome-based to ensure  that resources are targeted to projects that further the national interest.  The federal role should be defined in relation to the roles of state and local  governments, regional entities, and the private sector. Where the national  interest is greatest, the federal government may play a more direct role in  setting priorities and allocating resources as well as fund a higher share of  program costs. Conversely, where the national interest is less evident,  state and local governments, and others could assume more responsibility.  For example, efforts to reduce transportation\u2019s impact on greenhouse gas  emissions may warrant a greater federal role than other initiatives, such as  reducing urban congestion, since the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions  are widely dispersed, whereas the impacts of urban congestion may be  more localized.", "The following illustrative questions can be used to determine the extent to  which proposals to restructure the surface transportation program define  the federal role in relation to identified areas of national interest and goals.", "To what extent are areas of national interest clearly defined?

In particular, the report notes that the national interest in  transportation is best served when (1) facilities are well maintained, (2)  mobility within and between metropolitan areas is reliable, (3)  transportation systems are appropriately priced, (4) modes are rebalanced  and travel options are plentiful, (5) freight movement is explicitly valued,  (6) safety is assured, (7) transportation decisions and resource impacts are  integrated, and (8) rational regulatory policy prevails. We and others have  also identified some of these and other issues as possible areas of national  interest for the surface transportation program. For example, at a recent  forum on transportation policy convened by the Comptroller General,  experts identified enhancing the mobility of people and goods, maintaining  global competitiveness, improving transportation safety, minimizing  adverse environmental impacts of the transportation system, and  facilitating transportation security as the most important transportation  policy goals.  The Commission report also recommends restructuring  DOT to consolidate the current programs and to eliminate modal  stovepipes. We have also identified the importance of breaking down  modal stovepipes. Specifically, we have reported that the modal structure  of DOT and state and local transportation agencies can inhibit the  consideration of a range of transportation options and impede  coordination among the modes. Furthermore, in the forum on  transportation policy, experts told us that the current federal structure,  with its modal administrations and stovepiped programs and funding,  frequently inhibits consideration of a range of transportation options at  both the regional and national levels.", "Some of the Commission\u2019s recommendations related to the national  interest and the federal role also raise questions for consideration.  Although consolidating and reorganizing the existing surface  transportation programs, as the Commission recommends, could help  eliminate modal stovepipes, it is not clear to what extent eliminating any  of the existing programs was considered. Given the federal government\u2019s  fiscal outlook, we have reported that we cannot accept all of the federal  government\u2019s existing programs, policies, and activities as \u201cgivens.\u201d  Rather, we have stated that we need to rethink existing programs, policies,  and activities by reviewing their results relative to the national interests  and by testing their continued relevance and relative priority. It is not  clear from the Commission\u2019s report that such a \u201czero-based\u201d review of the  current and proposed surface transportation programs took place.", "The Commission also recommends an 80/20 cost sharing arrangement for  transportation projects under most programs\u2014that is, the federal  government would fund 80 percent of the project costs and the grantee  (e.g., state government) would fund 20 percent. In addition, the  Commission recommends that the federal government should pay 40  percent of national infrastructure capital costs. These proposed cost share  arrangements suggest that the recommended level and share of federal  funding reflects the benefits the nation receives from investment in the  project\u2014that is, the national interest. However, the report offers no  evidence that this is the case. Rather, the proposed cost share  arrangements appear to reflect the historical funding levels of many  surface transportation programs without considering whether this level of  funding reflects the national interest or should vary by program or project.  For example, the Commission recommends that the federal government  pay for 80 percent of the proposed intercity passenger rail system.  However, we have found that the nation\u2019s intercity passenger rail system  appears to provide limited public benefits for the level of federal  expenditures required to operate it, raising questions as to whether an 80  percent federal share is justified."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Observations on the Commission\u2019s Recommendations As They Relate to Performance and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The Commission proposes to make the surface transportation program  performance- and outcome-based, and its recommendations include  several performance and accountability mechanisms.

To receive federal funding, projects must be listed in state and local plans,  be shown to be cost-beneficial, and be linked to specific performance  targets. In addition, the Commission recognizes the importance of data in  measuring the effectiveness of transportation programs and overall project  performance and recommends that an important goal of the proposed  research, development, and technology program be to improve the  nation\u2019s ability to measure project performance data.", "Although the Commission emphasizes the need for a performance- and  outcome-based program, it is unclear to what extent some of the  Commission\u2019s recommendations are aligned with such principles.

Experts at our forum on transportation policy  also advocated the use of various financing mechanisms, including many  of the mechanisms recommended by the Commission, arguing that there is  no \u201csilver bullet\u201d for the current and future funding crisis facing the  nation\u2019s transportation system. The Commission also recognizes that  states will need to use other tools to generate revenues for their share of  the recommended increase in investment and to manage congestion.  Therefore, the Commission supports fewer federal restrictions on tolling  and congestion pricing on the interstate highways system and  recommends that Congress encourage the use of public-private  partnerships where appropriate. In addition, the Commission recognizes  the growing consensus that, with more fuel-efficient and more alternative- fuel vehicles, an alternative to the fuel tax will be required in the next 15 to  20 years. To facilitate a transition to new revenue sources, the  Commission recommends that Congress require a study of specific  mechanisms, such as mileage-based user fees.", "It is unclear, however, whether some of the Commission\u2019s  recommendations are fiscally sustainable\u2014both over the short and the  long-term\u2014and encourage the use of the best tools and approaches.

However, the level of investment called for by the  Commission reflects the most expensive \u201cneeds\u201d scenario examined by the  Commission, raising questions about whether this level of investment is  warranted and whether federal, state, and local governments can generate  their share of the investment in light of competing priorities and fiscal  constraints. In addition, while much of the increased investment in the  surface transportation program would come from increased fuel taxes and  other user fees, some funding would come from general revenues. Such  recommendations need to be considered in the context of the overall fiscal  condition of the federal government. Finally, while the Commission  recommends enhanced opportunities for states to implement alternative  tools such as tolling, congestion pricing, and public-private partnerships, it  also recommends that Congress place a number of restrictions on the use  of these mechanisms, such as requirements that states cap toll rates (at  the level of the CPI minus a productivity adjustment), prohibit the use of  revenues for non-transportation purposes, avoid toll rates that  discriminate against certain users, and fully consider the effect tolling  might have on diverting traffic to other facilities.
