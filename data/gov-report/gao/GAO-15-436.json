AOC also implemented measures to reduce energy consumption in the complex, such as conservation projects improving lighting and air-handling systems that yielded monetary savings. AOC has opportunities to implement other conservation measures in the complex. For example, energy audits by contractors identified additional opportunities to implement similar measures or other upgrades to lighting, mechanical, and plumbing systems to achieve additional energy and monetary savings. However, AOC officials said they have not implemented these measures but intend to act as resources become available.", "AOC decided to procure a cogeneration system to produce electricity and steam based on a 2009 long-term plan and subsequent partial updates but did not follow key leading federal capital-planning practices. In 2009, AOC issued a long-term energy plan that stated it should pursue cogeneration to meet future steam demand and provide a new source of electricity for its chillers, enabling the agency to decrease electricity purchases. Partial updates to the plan in 2014 sought to justify the choice of a cogeneration system. However, AOC's planning did not follow key leading capital-planning practices developed by GAO and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). First, though called for by leading federal planning practices, AOC has not fully updated the 2009 long-term plan, although changes in key planning assumptions, such as on fuel prices and the complex's demand for energy, have occurred. Instead, AOC intends to make a decision on implementing an $85 million cogeneration system before updating its long-term plan later in fiscal year 2015. Second, the 2014 partial updates to its 2009 plan that AOC has used to justify the project did not include complete information on the need or problem that the project would address. Third, the 2014 updates did not identify a full range of options for cost-effectively meeting projected future needs, including non-capital measures such as conservation. Fourth, the updates did not have valid sensitivity or uncertainty analyses to test key assumptions about whether the system would achieve sufficient savings over time\u2014from decreased electricity purchases\u2014to justify its costs. Related to this, AOC officials said that since upfront appropriations would likely not be available to procure the system, they had decided to use a third party to finance the project, thereby increasing its costs. These officials also said they relied on federal guidance for analyzing and financing energy projects. However, such guidance does not substitute for first completing an up-to-date capital plan. Finally, GAO's prior work has recommended using independent panels of experts to review complex projects such as a cogeneration system, but AOC has not engaged such a panel to review its 2014 updates to its long-term plan. AOC officials said they were unaware of some of these practices and that they needed to sign a contract quickly to avoid the risk of losing construction and air quality permits.

To identify  measures AOC could consider implementing to further manage the costs  of heating and cooling the buildings served by CPP, we reviewed AOC  reports and other documents. We also interviewed a nongeneralizable  sample of eight operators of other district energy systems\u2014representing  both public and private entities\u2014to learn about measures they have  implemented to manage costs as well as the benefits and costs of those  measures. We identified these operators based on, among other things,  literature research; interviews with CPP staff and managers of other  district energy systems; and selected operators of district energy systems  with similarities to CPP, such as those located in climates similar to  Washington, D.C. The information collected during these interviews  cannot be generalized to all district heating or cooling systems. However,  because of their characteristics, the select operators provide useful  insights on a range of issues relevant to AOC\u2019s management of CPP.

A 2013  study of the chilled water system shows that CPP should be able to meet  the majority of chilled water demand in winter months using free cooling,  thereby lowering its electricity costs. The study estimated that free  cooling would achieve about $307,000 annually in savings through  reduced electricity use.", "Also, in fiscal year 2014, AOC installed new chillers at CPP. The 2013  chilled-water- system audit concluded CPP could produce chilled water  more efficiently if it increased its use of two relatively new and efficient  chillers located in the East Refrigeration Plant, where the chillers were  underused due to the relatively poor condition of the cooling towers there.  AOC initially planned to move the two chillers to the West Refrigeration  Plant Expansion. Ultimately, AOC purchased and installed two new  chillers of similar capacity and efficiency.

Cooling and heating degree days measure the  number of days with outdoor temperatures above or below, respectively,  65 degrees Fahrenheit and the amount above or below that temperature.  For example, a cooling degree day value of 10 indicates that the average  temperature for the day was 75 degrees. AOC\u2019s annual energy  consumption of chilled water per cooling degree day fell between fiscal  years 2010 and 2013, which shows that consumption of chilled water (i.e.,  cooling) decreased more than would be expected simply due to lower  temperatures.

Cogeneration, also known as combined heat  and power, involves the simultaneous production of electricity and heat  from a single fuel source, such as natural gas. AOC has proposed a  cogeneration system that would use a natural gas combustion turbine to  generate electricity and a recovery unit that would use excess heat from  the turbine\u2019s exhaust stream to heat water and create steam (see fig. 6).", "AOC officials stated the cogeneration system, despite initial costs that are  significantly higher than other alternatives, will provide needed steam and  save money over time by producing electricity to power its chillers\u2014 thereby avoiding or decreasing the costs of purchasing electricity. In  addition, cogeneration systems can produce excess electricity that can be  sold to local utilities, thereby generating income that helps offset the cost  of the system.", "AOC\u2019s 2009 long-term energy plan included a forecast showing that  demand for steam would grow and exceed the plant\u2019s capacity to  generate steam by fiscal year 2016. To address this projected gap in  capacity, the 2009 plan assessed nearly 30 capital alternatives for  installing new steam-generating equipment, including natural-gas- powered boilers, a cogeneration system, or nuclear capabilities. The 2009  plan evaluated the capital alternatives using several criteria, including  total life cycle costs, initial construction costs, air pollution emissions,  energy efficiency, and security. AOC\u2019s 2009 plan recommended that  AOC continue to operate CPP as a district energy system to provide  heating, and in that context, the best options based on life cycle costs and  environmental impacts would involve a new cogeneration system or the  use of synthetic coal. Ultimately, citing concerns about the cost and  availability of synthetic coal as well as environmental concerns, the plan  recommended that AOC procure a cogeneration system.", "Specifically, the 2009 long-term plan recommended that AOC purchase a  cogeneration system comprising one 7.5-megawatt cogeneration  combustion turbine, which would represent the first of a three-phase  plan. The 2009 plan also called for the installation (in two subsequent  phases) of five natural gas boilers along with two other combustion  turbines\u2014another 7.5-megawatt turbine and a 15-megawatt turbine\u2014and  the equipment needed to distribute electricity throughout the complex.", "The 2009 plan assumed the first combustion turbine would serve only  CPP, but that the later installation of the additional turbines would enable  AOC to distribute electricity throughout the complex and potentially allow  for selling excess electricity to the local utility. The estimated construction  cost for the project was $120 million over its three phases. AOC officials  said that it estimated the construction costs in the 2009 plan through a  benchmarking analysis and did not reflect an actual bid from a vendor.", "AOC engaged the National Academies\u2019 National Research Council (NRC)  to review a draft of its 2009 long-term energy plan. In response to AOC\u2019s  request, the NRC organized an expert panel that identified several  shortcomings in the draft plan, including that the energy demand  projections were not supported by firm data and did not account for  mandates to reduce energy consumption. In the final version of the 2009  plan, AOC states it addressed NRC\u2019s concerns and accounted for both  increased utility demand from building renovations and reductions in  demand due to the energy reduction mandates.", "AOC subsequently developed the design of the cogeneration project  throughout 2012 and 2013. AOC formally proposed the project during its  fiscal year 2012 appropriations hearings. In 2012, AOC also received two  consultant-authored reports assessing the feasibility of the system. These  reports included an analysis that concluded that the value of a  cogeneration system, which AOC officials said represented the first two  phases of the 2009 long-term plan, was highly dependent on the price at  which AOC could sell the excess electricity generated by the system.  Throughout 2013, AOC worked with a vendor to further develop the  design of a cogeneration system representing the first two phases of the  2009 plan. In November 2013, AOC officials stated that the project\u2019s initial  construction-related costs would total roughly $67 million. The vendor  ultimately provided a bid in late 2013 that resulted in a total project cost  that was $100 million over AOC\u2019s estimate. As a result, AOC initiated  discussions with another vendor in January 2014.", "On two occasions in 2014, during the course of the audit work for this  report, AOC provided GAO with draft plans that concluded a cogeneration  system was still the preferred means of meeting steam demand. In July  2014, AOC provided GAO with a draft version of a partial update of the  2009 plan prepared by a consultant, titled Strategic Long Term Energy  Plan Update: Draft Final Report, that concluded new steam-generating  capacity was needed to replace two aging boilers and meet projected  increased future demand for steam. The draft July 2014 partial update  included an updated long-term forecast of demand and, unlike the 2009  plan, did not project a gap in steam capacity occurring in 2016. Instead,  the draft recommended that AOC replace the capacity of two aging  boilers to decrease CPP\u2019s reliance on coal. The draft July 2014 partial  update did not, however, describe the expected life of these boilers.  Unlike the 2009 document, the draft July 2014 partial update was not  comprehensive and reviewed adding new natural gas boilers or eight  different configurations of a cogeneration system (which involved  combining new gas boilers with the systems). When presenting the draft  partial update to GAO in July 2014, AOC officials said that the agency  had not accepted the update as final from the consultant and would likely  ask the consultant to add information and make changes before doing so.  The draft July 2014 update recommended the option with the lowest life  cycle costs: that AOC install a natural gas cogeneration system with two  5.7-megawatt turbines, as well as two natural gas boilers providing a total  of 190,000 pounds of steam per hour.", "The draft July 2014 partial update said the electricity generated by the  cogeneration system would only be used within CPP and would not serve  the rest of the complex or be sold to a utility; CPP does not have the  infrastructure to provide electricity to the complex.

The  December 2014 draft plan stated CPP needed to replace the steam- generating capacity of two of its oldest boilers, citing their age and  increasing operations and maintenance costs and recommended that  AOC install a natural gas cogeneration system with a single 7.5-  megawatt combustion turbine providing a maximum steam capacity of  100,000 pounds per hour. AOC officials stated this would fulfill the first  phase of its 2009 long-term energy plan. The December 2014 draft plan  stated the electricity generated by the cogeneration system would power  CPP\u2019s electric chillers and not serve the rest of the complex.", "In contrast to the draft July 2014 update, the December 2014 draft plan  stated that AOC would sell any excess electricity to the local utility. AOC  officials said they expect to use up to 90 percent of the electricity  generated by the proposed system to operate the plant\u2019s chillers, thereby  avoiding paying for the electricity from the local utility and justifying the  system\u2019s relatively large upfront investment (when compared to other  alternatives). The agency plans to sell the excess 10 percent of electricity  at rates to be determined by a future agreement with the local utility. AOC  officials stated this could involve CPP\u2019s becoming a facility qualified to sell  electricity to the grid under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act  (PURPA) of 1978. The officials said they used electricity rates for a  qualified facility in the analysis supporting the December 2014 draft plan  to use the most conservative approach.

Under the UESC, AOC would pay for financing costs, such as interest  payments to the utility, in addition to repaying the initial capital costs of  the cogeneration project (i.e., construction and other upfront costs) over  the contract period (AOC used an analysis period of two years for  construction and up to a 25-year contract period). According to our  analysis of AOC\u2019s updated data supporting its December 2014 draft plan,  the agency would pay about $28 million more in nominal costs under the  UESC than if the agency acquired the system using upfront appropriated  funds: $16 million more in initial construction costs, due to additional  UESC vendor overhead costs, and $12 million more in financing costs  over the life of the contract. Under a typical UESC, repayments to the  utility reflect the estimated cost savings from the project\u2019s energy  efficiency measures.

As  a result, AOC did not analyze the project and its merits relative to other  projects using the agency\u2019s pre-determined criteria for capital planning.

However, the guidance AOC cited generally applies after an  agency has conducted a needs assessment and conducted a capital- planning process using GAO, OMB, and other relevant guidance cited  above. Thus, the guidance AOC officials said they followed does not  substitute for first completing an up-to-date capital plan. Without following  key leading capital practices, AOC\u2019s planning could commit the agency to  a project that does not fully and cost-effectively meet its needs\u2014thereby  not providing taxpayers or Congress with the most efficient use of funds  in a time when the federal government faces significant financial  challenges.", "In August 2014, we discussed with AOC shortcomings in its planning for  the cogeneration project relative to leading practices and referred the  agency to documents outlining these practices. AOC officials then  provided the aforementioned set of planning documents in December  2014 that the agency stated were intended to address our concerns.  AOC officials also provided several reasons why they needed to continue  planning the project and quickly execute a contract. These included (1)  that certain existing boilers were near the end of their useful life and that  AOC might face challenges meeting demand for steam in the near future,  and (2) that AOC needed to start construction soon or the Washington,  D.C. government would retract the project\u2019s construction and air quality  permits.", "Our review did not identify valid support for these claims. Reports on the  condition of the boilers provided by AOC did not identify the remaining  useful life of the two boilers in question. Additionally, AOC did not provide  documents supporting its statement that the permits for the project were  at risk; AOC officials told us they believed the planning steps the agency  had taken would be sufficient to keep the permits in effect."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["AOC has implemented many measures to manage the costs of heating  and cooling the Capitol Complex and has achieved measurable results.

These include not (1) fully updating the agency\u2019s 2009 long- term energy plan to reflect changes in energy costs and demand that  occurred since the plan was issued; (2) fully assessing long-term energy  needs or the performance gap the project would address in light of  changes in key variables that could affect its relative merits; (3) identifying  a full range of alternatives for meeting future needs, including non-capital  or conservation measures; (4) conducting valid sensitivity or uncertainty  analyses; or (5) engaging an independent panel of experts to review  AOC\u2019s updates of its long-term plan. AOC officials said they were  unaware of some of these leading practices and therefore did not follow  them. AOC\u2019s planning was insufficient for us to discern whether the  cogeneration project would generate enough savings to cover its costs or  prove more cost-effective than other options for meeting the agency\u2019s  needs.

In  its written comments, included as appendix II, the Architect disagreed  with our findings, conclusions, and recommendations. However, AOC  also said that the agency has effectively implemented our  recommendations in a \u201cmanner sufficient to move forward with the  planned cogeneration project.\u201d As we discuss below, AOC provided two  new reports focusing on the need to replace its oldest boilers and  potential risks and costs associated with the proposed cogeneration  project. We did not review these reports because AOC did not provide  them or make us aware of them until after we had completed our work.  We plan to review these studies in the future and discuss them with  Congress. While these reports may expand on the justification for the  cogeneration project, we continue to believe that AOC should first update  its overall long-term strategic energy plan and evaluate a full range of  alternatives for best meeting its needs prior to undertaking major energy  projects in the future. We also acknowledge that AOC may need to  replace certain steam-generating equipment, in part or in whole, at some  point in the future. AOC also provided technical comments, which we  addressed as appropriate in the report.", "In its written comments, AOC stated that contrary to our  recommendations and assertions in the draft report, AOC adhered to key  leading capital-planning practices based on its 2009 long-term energy  plan, 2014 revalidation efforts, and additional documentation. AOC\u2019s  written comments contradict statements by AOC officials in April 2015  that they were not aware of the key leading capital-planning practices  cited in our draft report. At that time, these officials said that AOC instead  followed NIST guidance on performing life-cycle cost analyses for energy  conservation projects and DOE guidance for financing energy projects  using non-appropriated funds. Furthermore, the agency did not provide  evidence that contradicted our finding about it not adhering to these  practices during our review. We therefore maintain that we reached the  correct conclusion about AOC\u2019s adherence to key leading capital-  planning practices.", "As part of our first recommendation, we said that AOC should fully assess  the complex\u2019s long-term needs and identify any performance gaps. As  part of its written comments, AOC provided additional documentation that  the agency said fully explains how the agency has already assessed  these needs through preparing a justification for replacing the complex\u2019s  aging boilers. The documentation expands on its efforts to support the  proposed cogeneration project, including a report on the condition of two  of its oldest boilers and an updated sensitivity analysis comparing the  long-term benefits of installing new boilers or a cogeneration system. We  did not assess the validity of these documents because AOC did not  provide them or make us aware of them until after we had sent the draft  report for comment. Moreover, AOC did not use this information as part of  the basis for selecting the current planned cogeneration project. We  maintain that AOC should conduct such an analysis prior to making a  decision about energy projects, rather than as part of efforts to validate  decisions made in 2009 and 2014.", "Another part of our first recommendation said that AOC should identify  and evaluate a range of alternatives for how to best meet the agency\u2019s  needs, and identify key assumptions and risks of the alternatives.  Regarding identifying and evaluating a range of alternatives, including  non-capital options and energy conservation measures, AOC said that it  did so in 2009 and selected cogeneration to replace the aging boilers.  AOC added that it updated key assumptions used in the 2009 plan in  2014 and further evaluated the two technically feasible options\u2014natural  gas boilers and cogeneration\u2014in extensive detail, which AOC stated  validated that cogeneration remained the best option. We agree that the  2009 long-term energy plan broadly considered a range of alternatives for  meeting the agency\u2019s long-term energy needs, but the analysis conducted  in 2014 focused solely on two options. From 2009 to the present, many  factors have changed that could potentially lead AOC to reach a different,  more cost-effective solution to meet any future performance gaps. For  example, the costs of fuels, electricity, and labor have changed since  2009. In addition, the demand for AOC\u2019s services has changed as the  agency has pursued conservation and other energy-saving efforts.  We  therefore continue to believe that AOC should fully update its long-term  energy plan, taking into account changes in key variables and the full  range of options for how best to meet the agency\u2019s needs, including non- capital options and energy conservation measures.", "The last part of our first recommendation said that AOC should identify  key assumptions and risks and perform valid sensitivity and uncertainty  analyses to identify cost-effective alternatives under a range of future  scenarios. In its written comments, AOC said that it identified key  assumptions and risks and subsequently performed valid sensitivity and  uncertainty analyses. The Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable  Energy Laboratory (NREL), as a third-party reviewer of the cogeneration  validation effort, conducted a deterministic sensitivity analysis of the  cogeneration project\u2019s life-cycle cost, and AOC performed its own  sensitivity analysis in its December 2014 draft plan. Our report identified  shortcomings of these analyses, raising questions about their usefulness  in identifying a cost-effective alternative. AOC also used a different third  party to perform a probabilistic risk assessment of the project\u2019s  construction cost, which we acknowledged in our report. In addition, AOC  said the agency also used another third party to complete an additional  probabilistic risk assessment of the project\u2019s life-cycle cost in May 2015.  We did not assess the validity of this analysis because AOC did not  provide it to us until after we had sent the draft report for comment. While  AOC has conducted some sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, it did so  to support a decision made in 2009, rather than to evaluate alternatives in  the context of a full update of its long-term energy plan. We, therefore,  continue to believe that AOC should fully update its long-term energy plan  and follow leading practices for analyzing alternatives in that context.", "Our second recommendation states that, as AOC updates its long-term  energy plan, the Architect should seek an independent review of the plan  by an expert panel to ensure it follows key leading practices and provide  the results of the review to Congress. In its written comments, AOC  stated that it had engaged an outside entity to review AOC\u2019s 2014 effort  to validate its choice to pursue a cogeneration project.

We assessed the  reliability of these data\u2014for example, by reviewing related documentation  and interviewing knowledgeable AOC budget and finance officials\u2014and  found them sufficiently reliable for our reporting purposes. We also  reviewed relevant AOC reports and documents, and interviewed AOC  and CPP officials.", "To identify measures AOC could potentially implement to further manage  its energy-related costs, we reviewed AOC reports and other documents,  such as energy audits of CPP\u2019s steam and chilled water systems.

After we provided our draft report to AOC for  comment, the agency provided a new report on justifying the replacement of some of  its older boilers, dated July 17, 2015, that provides anecdotes on problems AOC has  overcome in maintaining the boilers but did not provide information quantifying the  operational or budget impacts of these problems or estimates of the likelihood of a  sudden failure of the boilers in the near future. Furthermore, AOC has not provided  us with information\u2014other than condition reports we reviewed finding that the boilers  were in good to fair condition for their ages\u2014supporting AOC\u2019s claims that the  boilers are effectively \u201con life support.\u201d", "Comment 2:  We agree that AOC should operate and maintain CPP with the goal of  meeting peak steam demand. However, AOC has not quantified any negative effects  that would occur if CPP had to meet peak steam demand while operating its boilers  only on natural gas and experiencing a temporary boiler outage. Furthermore, as  AOC has noted, the proposed cogeneration system would not provide enough steam  to allow AOC to meet its peak steam demand without using one of the two older  boilers it intends to replace. Therefore, AOC will continue to incur some of the  increased costs associated with infrequent use of one of the two older boilers that  the agency stated the cogeneration project was meant to address. Furthermore, it is  not clear when the agency intends to fully replace the capacity of the two oldest  boilers. We therefore continue to believe that AOC should fully update its long-term  energy plan while following leading capital-planning practices to ensure the agency  fully assesses its needs and finds the most cost-effective ways to meet them.", "Comment 3:  We agree that AOC\u2019s 2009 long-term energy plan assessed a broad  range of technical options for providing heating and cooling to the complex.  However, given that many factors have changed that could potentially lead AOC to  reach a different, more cost-effective solution to meet any future performance gaps,  we continue to recommend that AOC fully update its long-term energy plan while  following key leading capital-planning practices and seek an independent review of  the plan and provide the results of this review to Congress. In its letter, AOC noted  that the NRC committee that reviewed its 2009 plan stated that \u201celectric generation  (or Cogeneration) is the best long-term strategy for AOC to achieve its mission of  reliable, cost-effective, efficient, and environmentally sound utility services.\u201d", "However, we did not find this statement in the NRC committee\u2019s 2009 report;  instead, it is an AOC statement included in its final 2009 long-term energy plan.", "Comment 4:  AOC sought to clarify the progression of its planning efforts, which we  summarized in Table 6 in our report. However, it is unclear why AOC stated that we  mischaracterized its July 2014 Strategic Long Term Energy Plan Update: Draft Final  Report, which we described as a draft plan throughout our report. In August 2014,  we discussed with AOC shortcomings in its planning for the cogeneration project  relative to leading practices and referred the agency to documents outlining these  practices. AOC officials later wrote that the agency addressed the presented  shortcomings by completing the December 2014 draft plan and supporting  documents, which called for a cogeneration system with a configuration that differed  from the July 2014 draft plan.", "Comment 5:  AOC stated that its 2014 revalidation addressed the key leading  capital-planning practices we cited, but this revalidation focused on two technical  options and did not, as called for in leading practices, fully assess the complex\u2019s  long-term needs and identify and evaluate a full range of options for best meeting  those needs. We continue to maintain that, prior to undertaking major energy  projects, AOC should fully update its 2009 long-term energy plan as called for in  leading capital-planning practices, given that key factors have changed that could  have changed the plan\u2019s conclusions.", "Comment 6:  AOC stated that it completed an evaluation and redeveloped its long- term steam demand forecasts to address the urgent need to replace its older coal- firing boilers. We did not assess the validity of this evaluation because AOC did not  provide it, or make us aware of it, until after we had sent the draft report to the  agency for its comments. This evaluation did not accompany the agency\u2019s December  2014 draft plan, which AOC used to justify the need for and scope of the proposed  cogeneration project.", "Comment 7:  We agree that AOC reviewed a broad range of options for meeting its  long-term needs in its 2009 long-term energy plan. However, AOC did not examine  non-capital options in the 2009 plan\u2014such as operational changes or conservation  measures\u2014and it is unclear how or when AOC assessed some of the capital or  financing options it cited in its written comments.  Since 2009, AOC has assessed  two capital options\u2014a cogeneration system or a natural gas boiler. From 2009 to the  present, many factors have changed that could potentially lead AOC to reach a  different, more cost-effective solution to meet its needs. Therefore, we continue to  believe that AOC should identify and assess a wide range of options for meeting its  needs in a full update of its long-term energy plan.", "Comment 8:  We have not assessed AOC\u2019s additional sensitivity analysis, as the  agency provided it after we had completed our draft report. We do not know the  basis for AOC's statement that the group of energy conservation measures it  identified would reduce the complex\u2019s steam demand by 20 percent or the basis for  the statement that the cost of the measures\u2014including some or all of the costs of the  Cannon House Office Building Renewal project\u2014would exceed $2 billion.", "Comment 9:  AOC disagreed with our statement that the agency did not update its  2009 long-term plan in response to changes in key assumptions, citing the analyses  it performed in 2014 and 2015 on the life cycle costs of the proposed cogeneration  system and an alternative of a natural gas boiler. However, AOC did not update the  key assumptions in the context of a full update of its 2009 plan, which assessed a  broad range of options for meeting the complex\u2019s heating and cooling needs. AOC  stated that it included updated assumptions in its spreadsheets on the life cycle costs  of the proposed cogeneration project and a natural gas boiler alternative, and stated  that we declined its offers to discuss these spreadsheets. However, we reviewed  these spreadsheets containing AOC\u2019s life cycle cost analyses and identified  shortcomings that we describe in our report.", "Comment 10:  AOC stated that it completed a probabilistic risk assessment in May  2015 that was consistent with GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating Guide, which identifies some  key leading capital-planning practices. However, AOC did not make us aware of or  provide this assessment until after we had completed our review and prepared our  draft report.", "Comment 11:  AOC stated that the Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable  Energy Laboratory (NREL) provided an independent review of its December 2014  draft plan, which compared the proposed cogeneration system to an alternative of a  natural gas boiler. NREL\u2019s review of a partial update to a 2009 plan, rather than a full  update, does not address our recommendation. AOC needs to fully update its long- term energy plan and then seek outside review by an independent panel of experts,  as it did in 2009.", "Comment 12:  We agree that cogeneration can offer benefits in certain settings.  However, given the significantly higher upfront costs of cogeneration when compared  to alternatives like a natural gas boiler, it is important that the planning involved in  selecting the technology over viable alternatives exhibit the aspects of key leading  capital-planning practices we cited\u2014such as fully assessing needs, assessing a  range of alternatives, and using valid sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to identify  key risks and confirm the superiority of a chosen option over its alternatives. To  ensure that AOC\u2019s choices for meeting its long-term energy needs result from  planning that exhibits these leading practices, we continue to believe that AOC  should fully update its long-term energy plan while following the key leading practices  we cited.", "Comment 13:  AOC stated that the construction permit for the proposed  cogeneration project will expire in June 2016 and that fully implementing our  recommendations would introduce a delay of approximately two years to either  option for obtaining additional steam generating capacity. We maintain it is important  for AOC to make the correct decisions about its capital and long-term energy needs  through planning that follows key leading capital-planning practices, regardless of  when any permits may expire for a particular project. Furthermore, AOC did not  provide a basis for its claim that fully updating its long-term energy plan would cause  a delay of an additional two years to either option for adding new steam generating  capacity, and if AOC\u2019s claim is accurate then the agency should start the update as  expeditiously as possible. Therefore, we continue to recommend that AOC fully  update its long-term energy plan while following leading capital-planning practices  before undertaking future major capital projects related to its energy needs.", "Comment 14:  We agree that AOC faces limits on its continued use of coal at CPP  and on its emission of air pollutants, and we believe AOC should factor in such  constraints in a full update of its long-term energy plan.", "Comment 15:  AOC stated in its letter that our report suggested that capital-planning  guidance is clear and leaves no room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation by  agencies. During the course of our review, and after receiving a preview of our  report\u2019s findings, AOC officials said they were generally unaware of the applicability  of the leading practices we cited. We identify in our report GAO\u2019s prior work that  recommends the use of independent panels by agencies when addressing complex  issues such as those facing AOC, and as the agency itself used in 2009 to review its  draft long-term energy plan. As part of fulfilling our recommendation that the agency  fully update its long-term energy plan while following leading capital-planning  practices, we continue to believe AOC should submit the plan for review by an  independent panel of experts and submit the results to Congress.", "Comment 16: AOC did not assess the proposed cogeneration project using its  capital planning prioritization process for projects to be funded with upfront  appropriations, stating that it is the agency\u2019s strategy to use a UESC to finance the  proposed cogeneration project\u2014thereby allowing AOC to request appropriations to  fund other critical infrastructure projects for which AOC stated such alternative  funding sources are not available. As we stated in our report, by not assessing the  proposed project using the agency\u2019s capital planning prioritization, AOC did not  analyze the project relative to other projects for which the AOC was seeking  appropriated funding using the agency\u2019s pre-determined criteria for capital planning.", "Comment 17:  We agree that, like the proposed cogeneration project, AOC would  have incurred some pre-construction obligations for design and project management  to replace the steam-generating capacity of one or both of its older coal-firing boilers  with a natural gas boiler. AOC\u2019s draft December 2014 plan shows that a natural gas  boiler providing the same amount of steam as the proposed cogeneration system  would cost approximately $9.3 million. It is not clear to what extent this estimate  includes pre-construction obligations, which for the cogeneration project totaled  about $16 million as of March 2015.", "Comment 18:  We agree that CPP may not be able maintain adequate capacity to  meet peak demand should both older coal-firing boilers fail at the same time, but this  does not change the need for AOC to fully assess its long-term energy needs and  evaluate a range of alternatives for meeting them in the context of a full update of its  long-term energy plan.", "Comment 19:  AOC officials stated appropriations would likely not be available for  the cogeneration project and therefore selected a UESC to finance the project.  Because the agency did not intend to use upfront appropriations to acquire the  system, AOC did not assess the project using its capital planning prioritization  process. As we reported, acquiring the system using a UESC results in more upfront  costs and financing costs than if the agency used upfront appropriations. AOC stated  that it discussed its funding challenges with GAO, but it is not GAO\u2019s role to advise  agencies as they seek funding for their proposed capital projects.", "Comment 20:  AOC stated that its selection of the proposed cogeneration project  and its revalidation efforts have followed key leading practices. However, as we state  in our report and our response, we remain unconvinced that AOC\u2019s planning followed  key leading capital-planning practices and therefore AOC has not demonstrated  whether the proposed cogeneration project will prove more cost-effective than other  alternatives for meeting the agency\u2019s needs. We therefore continue to recommend  that AOC, prior to undertaking major energy projects, fully update its 2009 long-term  energy plan while following key leading capital-planning practices, including: fully  assessing its energy needs, identifying and evaluating a range of alternatives for  meeting its needs, and identifying key assumptions and risks and performing valid  sensitivity and uncertainty analyses.
