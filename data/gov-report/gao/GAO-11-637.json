GAO also interviewed officials from the National Security Staff, of the National Security Council (NSC), which oversees counterterrorism policy. GAO met with these agencies and conducted field work in Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has identified four key gaps in foreign countries' capacity to prevent terrorist travel overseas. U.S. government foreign capacity-building programs and activities address these gaps to varying degrees. For instance, as one of the U.S. efforts to enhance foreign partners' sharing of information about known and suspected terrorists, State's Terrorist Interdiction Program provides participating countries with hardware and software to develop, maintain, and use terrorist screening information. In fiscal year 2010, nearly 150 ports of entry overseas were using this program. With regard to addressing the use of fraudulent travel documents, GAO found the potential for overlap and duplication since seven components of three federal agencies are involved in providing training on fraudulent travel document recognition to foreign government officials, with no mechanism to coordinate such training. In two countries GAO visited, there was a lack of collaboration among agencies funding and implementing training on this topic. For example, in Pakistan, State and DHS were both planning to hold fraudulent travel document training for the same Pakistani agency during the same month without knowing of the other's plans. Regarding helping countries improve the security of their passport issuance, State and USAID have multiple efforts, including State's Bureau of Consular Affairs bringing delegations from foreign passport offices to the United States for briefings at passport-related agencies. Finally, the U.S. government has many efforts aimed at combating corruption overseas, such as encouraging countries to pass anticorruption laws. While these efforts are not aimed specifically at countries' passport and immigration agencies, they are intended to improve the effectiveness of all government functions. The U.S. government lacks performance measures to assess governmentwide progress in closing the key gaps in foreign partners' capacity to prevent terrorist travel overseas. None of the governmentwide or individual agency strategic documents GAO reviewed contained such measures. While components of State and DOJ have some performance measures related to information sharing, these measures do not provide decision makers with comprehensive information on governmentwide progress in enhancing foreign partners' capacity."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) State develop a mechanism to improve coordination of various agencies' efforts to provide fraudulent travel document training to foreign partners, and (2) NSC develop a mechanism to measure, track, and report on overall progress toward the goal of enhancing foreign partners' capacity to prevent terrorist travel overseas.

In 2006, the National  Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) released the National Strategy to  Combat Terrorist Travel, which established governmentwide goals for  preventing terrorist travel and identified enhancing the capacity of partner  nations as one of two pillars supporting that strategy. The attempted  attack on a Detroit-bound airliner on December 25, 2009, involving an  individual allegedly affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who  had traveled from Nigeria and transited through Amsterdam, highlights the  continued critical importance of U.S. foreign partners\u2019 capacity to stop  terrorists before they travel to the United States.", "This report evaluates the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to close gaps identified  in the capacity of foreign partners to stop terrorists from traveling across  international borders.

We also reviewed documentation on U.S. capacity-building  efforts to help countries prevent terrorist travel overseas, from the  Departments of State (State), Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS),  and Justice (DOJ); the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID); and the NCTC. For the purposes of this engagement, we define  terrorist travel as movements of known or suspected terrorists overseas,  crossing international borders outside of the United States by land, sea, or  air. We also interviewed knowledgeable officials in Washington D.C.,  including those from the White House National Security Staff and relevant  components of the intelligence community.", "To obtain examples of U.S. efforts and more in-depth understanding of  specific programs, we conducted fieldwork in four countries selected  using criteria that included participation in U.S. capacity-building  programs designed to prevent terrorist travel, designation as a terrorist  safe haven, presence of key U.S. agency personnel at post, or coverage of  key regions to counterterrorism. Based on these criteria, we traveled to  Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand. In each location, we met  with U.S. government personnel involved in capacity building to prevent  terrorist travel abroad to learn about the types of activities they undertake,  how they measure progress, and their reported results. We also met with  foreign government officials to learn about the challenges they face in  improving their ability to prevent terrorist travel abroad and their  perspectives on the effectiveness of U.S. efforts.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 to June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Subsequently, Congress passed a series of laws that called for various  measures to address weaknesses in U.S. and other countries\u2019 foreign travel  systems. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  directed the NCTC to submit to Congress a strategy for combating  terrorist travel. In 2006, the NCTC issued the National Strategy to  Combat Terrorist Travel. One of the strategy\u2019s two pillars was to enhance  U.S. and foreign partner capabilities to constrain terrorist mobility  overseas. Among the pillar\u2019s objectives were to suppress terrorists\u2019 ability  to cross international borders and help partner nations build capacity to  limit terrorist travel.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established  the interagency Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC) to serve,  in part, as a clearinghouse for all U.S. agency information on preventing  terrorist travel, and to submit annual assessments of vulnerabilities in the  foreign travel system that may be exploited by international terrorists.  Later, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of  2007 called for the HSTC to serve as the focal point for interagency efforts  to integrate and disseminate intelligence and information related to  terrorist travel. The 2007 Act directed DHS, with the cooperation of other  relevant agencies, to ensure that HSTC have no less than 40 full-time  positions, including, as appropriate, detailees from DHS, State, DOJ, DOD,  NCTC, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and  the Department of the Treasury. Presently, DHS\u2019 U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) provides the director of the center, which  includes personnel from State, DHS, and the U.S. intelligence community.", "NCTC and HSTC jointly issued the first terrorist travel vulnerability  assessment in 2005, and HSTC issued additional terrorist travel  vulnerability assessments in 2008 and 2009. The assessments synthesize  information and analyses from key stakeholders throughout the U.S.  government. Specifically, HSTC officials review intelligence and other  information from all relevant agencies; attend interagency working groups,  interagency intelligence meetings, and other coordination meetings related  to terrorist travel; review open source information from banks,  nongovernmental organizations, and multinational organizations; and  consult with agencies responsible for implementing programs. All relevant  agencies are given the opportunity to review and comment on the drafts.", "Various U.S. agencies and subagencies are involved in providing capacity  building related to enhancing countries\u2019 ability to prevent terrorist travel  abroad. As shown in figure 1, counterterrorism as a whole, including  preventing terrorist travel, is overseen at the policy level by the Office of  the Director of National Intelligence and by the National Security Council.  The Director of NCTC reports both to the President regarding executive  branch-wide counterterrorism planning, and to the Director of National  Intelligence regarding intelligence matters. NCTC follows the policy  direction of the President and the National Security Council. State, DHS,  DOD, and DOJ fund and/or implement the majority of the capacity- building programs. Within the Department of State, the Office of the  Coordinator for Counterterrorism (S/CT), in addition to funding and  implementing capacity-building programs, has a leading role in developing  coordinated strategies to defeat terrorists abroad and securing the  cooperation of international partners. S/CT works with all appropriate  elements of the U.S. government to ensure integrated and effective  counterterrorism efforts, and coordinates and supports the development  and implementation of all U.S. government policies and programs aimed at  countering terrorism overseas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Assessments Have Identified Four Key Gaps in Foreign Countries\u2019 Capacity to Prevent Terrorist Travel Overseas", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 1, the U.S. government has identified four key gaps in  foreign countries\u2019 capacity to prevent terrorist travel overseas.", "HSTC and NCTC vulnerability assessments have identified sharing  information about known and suspected terrorists as one key gap in  foreign partners\u2019 capacity to prevent terrorist travel. For example, some  countries do not have their own database systems with terrorist screening  information or access to other countries\u2019 terrorist screening information,  which contains biographical or biometric information about individuals  who are known or suspected terrorists. Even when countries have  terrorist screening information, they may not have reciprocal relationships  to share such information or other travel-related information, such as  airline passenger lists, with other countries, thereby limiting their ability to  identify and prevent the travel of known and suspected terrorists. In  addition, some countries do not have access to or fully use biometric  information, which provides a unique identifier for each person, such as a  fingerprint. For example, Pakistan has a centralized fingerprint database,  but it is not shared across all law enforcement agencies, making the  database less comprehensive and, as a result, more difficult for Pakistani  government officials to prevent potential terrorists from traveling.", "A second key gap in foreign partners\u2019 capacity relates to their ability to  address the use of fraudulent travel documents. For instance, in many  countries, fraudulent travel documents, including fraudulent passports and  visas, are easy to obtain, and could thereby be used by people who want to  travel under a false identity. In addition, some countries\u2019 failure to  consistently report lost or stolen passports to the International Criminal  Police Organization (INTERPOL) or to access INTERPOL\u2019s database that  stores information on lost and stolen passports, can facilitate the use of  legitimate passports by imposters. According to U.S. embassy officials in  Kenya we spoke with, this is a common occurrence in Kenya, where  individuals with a similar appearance to a Somali-American with a  legitimate travel document will fraudulently use this travel document for  illicit travel. Another common issue related to fraudulent travel documents  is using fraudulent \u201cbreeder documents,\u201d such as birth certificates and  drivers\u2019 licenses issued to support a person\u2019s false identity, to obtain  genuine passports. The issue of fraudulent documents is further  compounded by the lack of a requirement for a visa to some countries. For  example, according to a former Pakistani official that had responsibilities  related to immigration enforcement, fraudulent British passports are the  most prevalent type of fraudulent travel document in Pakistan. Since  British citizens are not required to obtain visas to travel to many countries,  a terrorist could use one of these fraudulent passports to travel to many  countries without further background checks that would occur through a  visa adjudication process.", "The third key gap identified in the NCTC and HSTC assessments is a lack  in some countries\u2019 abilities to ensure the security of their passport  issuance systems. The passports from some countries are of low quality  and are therefore easily stolen or counterfeited. For example, 18 countries  still use passports that are not machine readable and almost half of  countries use passports without biometric information stored  electronically inside the passport. Such biometric information can include  facial and fingerprint data, and can be used to authenticate the identity of  travelers. In addition, once countries convert to biometric passports,  previously issued passports may be valid for up to 10 years from their  issuance dates.", "A fourth key gap in some foreign countries\u2019 capacity to prevent terrorist  travel is in combating corruption in passport issuance and immigration  agencies. Corruption in government agencies relevant to travel can  facilitate the illicit travel of terrorists or other criminals. For example,  corruption in passport issuance agencies can allow potential terrorists to  obtain genuine passports under a false identity or blank passports that can  be easily manipulated. U.S. embassy officials in Kenya told us that such  false passports can be obtained for just a few hundred dollars in some  cases. Further, corruption within countries\u2019 immigration agencies, such as  border patrol or civil aviation officials with immigration duties, leaves a  country\u2019s immigration system vulnerable to human smugglers and  traffickers who often have established relationships with these corrupt  officials. For example, according to U.S. embassy officials in Kenya, illicit  travel facilitators are known to stand outside the airport and indicate to  corrupt immigration officials through the window which individuals they  should let pass without checking their passports. In addition, according to  the HSTC terrorist travel vulnerability assessments, countries that are  known for having corrupt immigration officials are more likely to be used  by terrorists as transit countries so that the terrorists can avoid  interdiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Conduct Foreign Capacity-Building Efforts Related to Three of the Four Key Gaps, but Coordination Could be Improved", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government foreign capacity-building programs and activities address  to some degree most of the key gaps identified by the U.S. government in  foreign governments\u2019 ability to prevent terrorist travel overseas.

First, State/S/CT\u2019s Terrorist Interdiction  Program (TIP) enables immigration officials in countries at risk of terrorist  activity to identify the attempted travel of known or suspected terrorists  through the provision of a computerized system called the Personal  Identification, Secure Comparison, and Evaluation System (PISCES). TIP  provides participating countries with the PISCES software, hardware, and  equipment to operate the software; any required maintenance and  expansion of the system; and training on how to use it. During fiscal year  2010, the PISCES system processed an estimated 150,000 travelers per day  entering or exiting 17 participating countries through ports of entry with  PISCES installations. In fiscal year 2010, State began to upgrade the  PISCES software with biometric capabilities that further enhance host  countries\u2019 capacity to interdict terrorists attempting to travel under a false  identity.", "Second, State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement  Affairs (INL) has funded at least two projects to provide different types of  database systems to foreign law enforcement authorities to help them screen  for potential terrorist or criminal travelers. These projects are implemented  through the DOJ/Criminal Division\u2019s International Criminal Investigative  Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), a broad law enforcement  development program that caters its program offerings to fit the host  country\u2019s needs. First, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ICITAP has provided the  State Police Information Network to Bosnian border officials to allow them to  link to INTERPOL databases to identify criminals who could then be denied  entry to the country. Second, ICITAP has provided a separate system, the  Total Information Management System, to Albania to enhance the country\u2019s  capacity to screen for known terrorists. According to State, the governments  of Kosovo and Albania are discussing adapting certain elements of the Total  Information Management System for use in Kosovo as well.", "Third, INL and State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation  have provided funding to DHS\u2019 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  to arrange trips for foreign officials to come to the United States to learn  about how CBP uses and analyzes terrorist screening information. These  trips are organized through the International Visitors Program, through  which CBP arranges briefings and visits to CBP operations in the United  States by foreign high-level customs and other law enforcement officials  who perform or manage functions similar to those encompassed within  CBP\u2019s area of responsibility and expertise. In fiscal year 2010, CBP  organized 22 visits by foreign officials for this purpose.", "Fourth, the United States enhances other countries\u2019 ability to prevent  terrorist travel abroad by sharing terrorist screening information with  other countries. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6 (HSPD- 6), the Terrorist Screening Center within the DOJ\u2019s Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) and the Terrorism Information Sharing Office within  State/S/CT negotiate agreements with foreign countries to systematically  share terrorist screening information, thereby enhancing both countries\u2019  abilities to prevent terrorist travel abroad through immediate and  systematic access to information on known and suspected terrorists. Once  the United States has signed an HSPD-6 agreement with a foreign country,  the Terrorist Screening Center then shares the information agreed to with  the foreign partners. As of May 2011, the Terrorist Screening Center  shared terrorist screening information with 23 foreign countries. In  addition to the systematic information sharing on known and suspected  terrorists that occurs through HSPD-6 agreements, the Terrorist Screening  Center also has had approximately six one-time arrangements for sharing  terrorist screening information with countries hosting special events.", "Fifth, DHS leads an interagency negotiating team, on which State/S/CT and  State\u2019s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs also serve, that is  involved in renegotiating a 2007 agreement between the United States and  the European Union on the exchange of Passenger Name Records data.  Once a country has the capacity to analyze this type of information  provided by airlines on its passengers, the country is able to prescreen  airline passengers against terrorist screening information, thereby helping  them to prevent terrorists from traveling abroad. The European Union is  now considering developing such a system and CBP has hosted officials  from the European Union for briefings on how the United States analyzes  Passenger Name Records data.", "According to State and DOJ officials, capacity-building efforts related to  information sharing about known and suspected terrorists face some  challenges. Some countries have expressed concerns about the privacy  and protections related to the sharing of sensitive terrorist screening  information. For example, European countries that have negotiated  HSPD-6 agreements with the United States have been concerned about  data protection, redress, and privacy policies and procedures in both  utilizing terrorist screening information from the United States and sharing  terrorist screening information with the United States because of  differences between U.S. and European laws. According to officials from  the Terrorist Screening Center, such differences can include the countries\u2019  statutes of limitations that delineate how long they can keep derogatory  information. According to State officials, another related challenge is that  providing information to foreign countries involves a loss of control over  the information and creates the possibility that the information could be  compromised through internal corruption. To address both challenges, the  United States and the foreign governments negotiate on specific  information-sharing mechanisms and protections that are feasible and  acceptable to both sides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several U.S. Foreign Capacity-Building Efforts Address the Use of Fraudulent Travel Documents but Some Efforts Lack Coordination", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiple Agencies Fund and Implement Training Courses in Fraudulent Travel Document Recognition", "paragraphs": ["Seven different U.S. government entities across three federal agencies are  involved in providing fraudulent travel document training to foreign  government officials, as shown in figure 2.

At the country  level, we found that agency officials at two of the posts we visited did not  always collaborate on the delivery of fraudulent travel document  recognition training. As a result, some planned training was duplicative  and did not make an effective use of limited resources. For example,  during our March 2011 visit to Pakistan, we identified two agencies  planning to provide fraudulent travel document recognition training  courses in April 2011 to Pakistani officials from the same agency without  coordinating with one another.

Although agencies have implemented significant new domestic  programs to prevent terrorists from entering the United States, events of  the past few years illustrate that the international travel system is only as  secure as its weakest link. As a result, the United States seeks to enhance  the capacity of its foreign partners to prevent terrorist travel overseas,  with agencies implementing a variety of programs and activities to close  key gaps in our foreign partners\u2019 capacity. However, some of these  efforts\u2014such as improving foreign partners\u2019 capacity to prevent the use of  fraudulent travel documents\u2014are not always well coordinated and create  the risk of duplication and overlap. In light of the limited resources  available to address these important issues, it is critically important to  ensure that such resources are used efficiently. Further, while more than 5  years have passed since the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel  linked our foreign partners\u2019 capacity to constrain terrorist travel to our  own national security, the U.S. government still lacks an effective system  for measuring and reporting progress toward the goal of enhancing our  foreign partners\u2019 capacity. As agencies implement the new National  Strategy for Counterterrorism, it is important to focus on measuring,  tracking, and reporting on governmentwide progress toward the goal of  enhancing foreign partners\u2019 capacity to prevent terrorist travel.
