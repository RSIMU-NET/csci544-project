First, many of the rural federal assistance programs target agriculture, which is no longer the principal economic base of most rural communities. Today, rural America depends on a broad mix of manufacturing and service industries, as well as agriculture. In 1990, only about 22 percent of the nation\u2019s approximately 2,400 rural counties relied on agriculture as an economic base and only about 6 percent of the rural population lived on farms. Therefore, by focusing on agriculture, the federal government may be missing opportunities for rural development in areas with potentially much greater payoff.", "Second, many federal programs that could benefit rural communities do not because they require coordination of expertise and resources, that are often not available in rural communities. A given problem\u2014for example, in obtaining water and sewer funds for an industrial park\u2014may involve multiple agencies, such as the Economic Development Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and FmHA. Each agency has its own forms and regulations. While urban areas may respond to this complexity of federal programs by dedicating human resources to each agency, rural communities do not have that luxury.", "Third, federal programs do not adequately distinguish among communities of different population densities. For example, many federal programs define small communities as those with fewer than 50,000 people\u2014that is, communities of 49,000 are considered identical to those of 1,000 for program benefits and/or mandates. The needs and the administrative capabilities of a community of 49,000, however, may be vastly different from those of a community of 1,000.", "And, finally, federal programs focus on process rather than effectiveness\u2014they tend to measure effectiveness by numbers served or dollars spent rather than by achievement of program goals.

Among these are reducing the number of transportation-related fatalities and injuries; restoring the obsolete and deteriorated portions of the transportation infrastructure; and relieving the increasingly congested aviation, highway, and waterway systems. In addition, transportation-related environmental effects and the need to strengthen U.S. transportation to remain competitive globally are of widespread concern. And demands are increasing for more and better public transit and rail service. At the same time, despite increased federal funding over the past several years for transportation activities, severe fiscal constraints require increased reliance on private resources and more efficient use of public resources to meet transportation needs.", "As detailed below, this issue area\u2019s work, which has included an increasing emphasis on the transportation sector\u2019s international and intermodal aspects, has influenced the Congress and the Department of Transportation (DOT) and its agencies to take many actions to improve transportation safety and the efficiency and the effectiveness of transportation policies and programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Surface Transportation Safety", "paragraphs": ["Our work over the past several years relating to highway, vehicle, and driver safety has contributed significantly in guiding DOT and congressional actions that helped the nation achieve in 1992 the lowest highway death toll in 31 years.

This decline is especially striking because, compared with 1961, the U.S. population was 38 percent higher in 1992, more than twice as many vehicles were on the road, and Americans drove almost three times as many miles annually. Among the issues addressed in our past work that contributed to the decline in highway fatalities were minimum drinking laws for drivers under 21; need for more-stringent laws for seat belt and motorcycle helmet use and improved enforcement of these laws; need for passive restraints in light trucks and vans; and improvements in monitoring and regulating commercial vehicles, commercial drivers, and motor vehicles.", "Our work also influenced congressional decisions and agency actions related to railroad and pipeline safety. For example, regarding railroad hours of service, our work showed that the Congress did not need to change the law setting 12 hours as the maximum number of hours that engineers may legally work. We did, however, point out that Amtrak needed to improve its training for employees who inspect and maintain rail equipment. Regarding pipeline safety, our conclusion that the potential for pipeline incidents (that is, ruptures and leakages) in the nation\u2019s aging natural gas pipelines could be reduced by using instrumented internal inspection technology (smart pigs) was instrumental in the enactment of legislation requiring the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations prescribing the circumstances under which safety inspections of pipelines must be conducted with instrumented devices.", "In other safety-related actions based on our work, DOT expanded its regulation of hazardous materials to include truck, rail, and air shipments of about 520 marine pollutants when packaged in bulk containers, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed an action plan to improve the timeliness of its compliance reviews for motor carriers that were previously rated less than satisfactory during safety reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation Safety", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented several of our recommendations for improving aviation safety.
