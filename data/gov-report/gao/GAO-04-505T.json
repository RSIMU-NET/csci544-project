Additionally, ATSA included a provision that allows  airport operators to apply to TSA to use private rather than federal  screeners beginning in November 2004. TSA has acknowledged that one of  its key challenges in 2004 will be designing appropriate criteria for the  potential expansion of contract screening.", "As required by ATSA, TSA implemented a pilot program using contract  screeners in lieu of federal screeners at 5 commercial airports\u2014one in  each airport security category. ATSA sets forth numerous requirements  regarding the pilot program. Specifically, it requires that  the private screening company be owned and controlled by a citizen of the  United States;  the private screening company, at a minimum, meet employment  standards, compensation and benefits rates, and performance  requirements that apply to federal screeners;    all private screener candidates meet the same minimum qualifications as  federal screeners, including U.S. citizenship, high school diploma or  equivalent, English proficiency, and pass a criminal background check;  and    all private screener candidates undergo the same battery of employment  screening tests that federal screener candidates undergo.", "In June 2002, TSA selected the 5 airports that would comprise the contract  screening pilot program. In October 2002, TSA awarded contracts to four  private screening contractors to provide passenger and baggage screening  services. TSA\u2019s role at the airports with private screeners is to provide on- site federal supervision of all passenger and property screening. Table 1  provides a list of the airports participating in the pilot program and the  private contractors responsible for conducting screening operations.", "Prior to the passage of ATSA, air carriers were responsible for screening  passengers and most used private security firms to perform this function.  Long-standing concerns existed regarding screener performance in  detecting threat objects during covert tests at passenger screening  checkpoints. In 1978, screeners failed to detect 13 percent of the  potentially dangerous objects Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)  undercover agents carried through checkpoints during tests\u2014a level that  was considered \u201csignificant and alarming.\u201d In 1987, screeners did not  detect 20 percent of the objects during the same types of tests. In addition,  we reported that FAA tests conducted between 1991 and 1999 showed that  screeners\u2019 ability to detect objects was not improving, and in some cases,  was worsening. In tests conducted in the late 1990s, as the testing objects  became more realistic and the tests more closely approximated how a  terrorist might attempt to penetrate a checkpoint, screeners\u2019 ability to  detect dangerous objects declined even further. Inadequate training and  poor supervision, along with low wages, rapid turnover, and inadequate  attention to human factors, were historically identified as key  contributors to poor screener performance.", "The results I am presenting today are based on preliminary observations of  our ongoing review of TSA\u2019s passenger screening program, which includes  a review of TSA\u2019s efforts to implement and evaluate the contract screening  pilot program. As part of our ongoing review, which we are conducting for  this subcommittee, we interviewed TSA officials and visited all 5 pilot  program airports and 23 airports with federal screeners. During these  visits, we observed screening operations and interviewed FSDs, their  staffs, and, at some airports, airport authority and airline officials. At the   5 pilot program airports, we also interviewed representatives of the private  screening contractors. Additionally, we interviewed representatives of  several aviation associations. We plan to conduct additional analysis  during the remainder of our review, including assessing the results of our  recent survey of all 155 FSDs regarding their screening operations.

This staffing model was based on the  congressionally mandated nationwide ceiling of 45,000 full-time  equivalent federal screeners. Both the contractors and FSDs at airports  with federal screeners have raised concerns about the adequacy of the  staffing model in accounting for the unique needs of each airport,  particularly given that the model is based on a full-time equivalent ceiling.  Two representatives of the private screening contractors that were at or  near their TSA authorized staffing levels told us in February 2004 that they  were concerned about having adequate staffing levels to meet demand  during the peak 2004 travel season. TSA had required one of these  contractors to lay off screeners in 2003 as part of its nationwide screener  downsizing effort, even though, according to TSA, private screeners do not  count toward TSA\u2019s ceiling of 45,000 full-time equivalent screeners. TSA  acknowledged that its initial staffing efforts created imbalances in the  screener workforce and hired a consultant in September 2003 to conduct a  study of screener staffing levels, including levels for the 5 pilot program  airports. The study, which TSA initially expected to be completed in April  2004, is now scheduled for completion in May 2004. We will continue to  review TSA\u2019s efforts to determine appropriate staffing levels during the  remainder of our review.", "The private screening contractors\u2019 concerns regarding their staffing levels  are compounded by TSA\u2019s requirement that the contractors coordinate  their hiring through TSA headquarters.

The inability to conduct hiring on an as needed basis has  limited their ability to respond quickly to staffing shortages. In one  instance, an FSD for an airport with private screeners stated that in  response to continued attrition at his airport, he notified TSA in advance  that additional screeners would be needed before the peak summer travel  season. However, an assessment center was not opened until mid-June  2003, and the FSD had to request assistance from TSA\u2019s Mobile Screening  Force, a team of TSA screeners deployed around the country where  additional screening staff are needed. These screeners were in place for   2 months while TSA scheduled and conducted screener applicant  assessments and trained candidates who were selected for employment by  the private screening company. The private screening contractor and the  FSD at this airport told us that the inability to hire screeners during the  first several months of the attrition problem contributed to screener  performance issues, such as absenteeism or tardiness, and screener  complacency because screeners were aware that they were unlikely to be  terminated due to staffing shortages.", "Pilot program contractors have requested the opportunity to  independently establish and operate assessment centers on an as needed  basis. Accordingly, in December 2003 and February 2004, TSA submitted  to the screening contractors requests for proposals for additional  flexibilities. TSA\u2019s December 12, 2003, request for proposal, which  solicited input from the private screening contractors on potential  program innovations regarding day-to-day operations, was followed by a  more specific request for proposals, dated February 24, 2004, to provide  human resource services, such as screener assessments, qualification,  examination, and selection of security screener candidates. TSA received  proposals from 3 of the private screening contractors, and found that they  were insufficient in meeting the requirements set forth in the request for  proposal.

As required by ATSA, TSA established a basic  screener training program comprised of a minimum of 40 hours of  classroom instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training for all passenger  and baggage screeners. TSA also requires private and federal screeners to  participate in 3 hours of recurrent training per week, averaged over a  quarter. Consistent with ATSA, TSA further requires remedial training for  any private or federal screener who fails an operational test.", "Representatives of the private screening contractors stated that a  challenge they face in implementing their screening functions is the  limitations TSA places on them in developing and implementing locally  based training programs. Private screening contractors at the pilot  program airports are required to participate in the basic screener training  provided by TSA\u2019s training contractor and to maintain the same recurrent  and remedial training curriculums used by TSA. To provide training  beyond TSA\u2019s curriculums, the private screening contractors must have  their training reviewed and approved by TSA. Contractors expressed  concern that TSA had either rejected or was slow to approve their  requests to provide additional training outside of TSA\u2019s approved  curriculum. This was of particular concern during the first year of the pilot  program when TSA had not yet deployed a recurrent or supervisory  training program to airports to ensure that screeners were effectively  trained and supervised. TSA officials told us, on the other hand, that the  private screening contractors have yet to submit any requests for approval  of locally developed recurrent training.", "Private screening contractors also expressed concerns about the lack of  specific feedback regarding screeners\u2019 performance on the annual  recertification tests, which assess their proficiency in identifying threat  objects and adhering to standard operating procedures. TSA stores the  results of the recertification tests in a database that FSDs can access to  determine whether screeners for their respective airports passed or failed.  However, private screening contractors told us they cannot view how  screeners performed on specific questions.

In September 2003, we reported  that FSDs had little input in determining their screener staffing levels.  Since then, FSDs have continued to express concerns about their limited  role in establishing airport-specific staffing levels and the need for realistic  staffing levels based on the unique needs of each airport. In February 2004,  we reported that many of the FSDs we interviewed expressed concern  with the lack of a continuous hiring process to backfill screeners lost  through attrition, and their lack of authority to conduct hiring on an as  needed basis. The FSDs also complained of the time lag between their  requests for additional staff and having trained and certified screeners  onboard. Some FSDs reported that this time lag has hindered their ability  to provide sufficient resources to staff screening checkpoints and oversee  screening operations at their airports. Contractors at 3 of the pilot  program airports reported difficulties in getting an assessment center  established for hiring at their airport, particularly after the first cadre of  screeners had been hired, trained, and deployed. Likewise, an FSD at an  airport with federal screeners reported that inadequate staffing is his most  critical issue. He stated that to address the staffing inadequacies and  maintain a reasonably acceptable passenger wait time level, FSD staff and  screening management personnel have assisted in staffing of exit lanes,  checking boarding passes, and transporting bags, among other tasks.  However, he noted that these practices are not sustainable in the long  term.", "We recently surveyed all 155 FSDs regarding their screening operations.

For example, at one airport,  following the applicants\u2019 successful completion of the first assessment  phase at the assessment center, the private screening contractor  interviews the candidates to assess whether the company thinks they are a  good fit for the job. Individuals whom the contractor agrees to hire are  sent through the second phase at the assessment center and, upon  successful completion of that assessment phase, to training. FSDs at  airports with federal screeners have expressed the need for a role in the  hiring process. Several FSDs told us that it is important for them or their  staff to participate in the hiring process to both build a rapport with the  screeners early in the process and to determine whether the screener  candidates would be a good fit for their airport, thereby possibly reducing  the high levels of attrition. TSA officials told us that they are planning to  redesign and streamline TSA\u2019s hiring process, particularly the assessment  center process, to allow for greater involvement by FSDs and their staff.  Specifically, officials reported that they are beginning to (1) ensure that  the recruiting contractor includes the FSD in recruiting planning, including  obtaining input regarding where and how the contractor recruits; (2) allow  FSDs to participate with TSA\u2019s hiring contractor in the structured  interview of the candidates; and (3) ensure that FSDs swear in the  candidates and provide organizational briefings on their first day of  orientation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Allowed Contractor to Hire Baggage Handlers", "paragraphs": ["TSA has also allowed a private screening contractor to hire baggage  handlers to enhance checked baggage screening operations.

The contractor officials also told us that while they were  operating below their authorized staffing levels, they were still able to  effectively operate screening checkpoints due in part to their use of  baggage handlers. TSA has not provided FSDs with the authority to hire  baggage handlers, and thus, FSDs at airports with federal screeners where  baggage handlers would be useful are more limited in their ability to  efficiently maximize staffing resources.", "This contractor is working with a local university to set up a program  where college students working as baggage handlers would earn a regular  hourly wage and tuition reimbursements in lieu of benefits.

Thus,  rather than accepting the decisions of TSA\u2019s hiring contractor regarding  applicants who would be suitable supervisors, it determined which  screeners should be made supervisors based on actual screener  performance. This decision to promote from within gave the private  screening contractor more decision-making authority in the staffing  selection process.

To be certified, a screener must have  passed all the applicable modules and have a rating of \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cexceeded\u201d  standards on their annual performance assessment.", "Screeners have completed all three modules of the knowledge and skills  assessment program. TSA is currently analyzing the results of the fiscal  year 2004 recertification tests and plans to report on the results of the  certification process to TSA\u2019s Acting Administrator in late April 2004. The  report will include the results of all three modules of the knowledge and  skills assessment tests, the outcomes of screener performance  assessments, and the total number of screeners terminated due to failure  to successfully pass the recertification program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Efforts to Enhance Performance of Private and Federal Screeners", "paragraphs": ["In October 2003, TSA began implementing a screening performance  improvement program for private and federal screeners. The goal of the  program is to improve screener performance through several training and  management initiatives, including increasing covert testing at screening  checkpoints, completing installation of TIP at all airports, enhancing  screener training, and strengthening supervisors\u2019 skills through leadership  and technical training. As part of TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance screener  performance, TSA requires all screeners to participate in 3 hours of  training per week averaged over each quarter. One hour is required to be  devoted to X-ray image interpretation and the other 2 hours to screening  techniques or reviews of standard operating procedures. TSA recently  provided FSDs at all airports, including airports with private screeners,  with additional training tools. Specifically, according to TSA officials, TSA  has    provided every airport, including the 5 pilot program airports, with at least  one Modular Bomb Set (MBS II) kit\u2014containing components of an  improvised explosive device\u2014and one weapons training kit, in part  because screeners had consistently told OIAPR inspectors that they would  like more training with test objects similar to ones used in the tests;  instituted a program called \u201cThreat in the Spotlight\u201d that, based on  intelligence TSA receives, provides screeners with the latest in threat  information regarding terrorist attempts to get threat objects past  screening checkpoints;    established video training and fielded the first two videos in the series; and  fielded an Online Learning Center\u2014a Web based tool with 366 self-guided  training courses available to all screening staff, including staff at the 5  pilot program airports.", "As we reported in February 2004, staffing shortages and lack of high- speed connectivity at airport training facilities have made it difficult for  screeners to fully utilize these programs. According to TSA officials, the  Online Learning Center is now available via the Internet and the Intranet;  therefore the issues of connectivity have been mitigated. In January 2004,  OIAPR began to gather data on selected training initiatives and to conduct  repeat covert testing at airports. At each of the airports OIAPR visited to  conduct covert tests between January 5, 2004, and February 1, 2004,  OIAPR inspectors interviewed screeners about whether they had  participated in the training initiatives. Based on these interviews, OIAPR  found that the training initiatives they discussed with the screeners had  not been fully implemented at every airport.", "TSA officials said that they have begun to focus attention on airports  where screeners performed particularly poorly on covert tests. For  example, TSA officials said that mobile training assist teams were  deployed in November 2003 to identify causes of poor performance at  these airports and work with FSDs to devise and implement solutions.  Additionally, in January 2004, OIAPR began conducting repeat covert  testing at airports to determine whether TSA\u2019s initiatives designed to  enhance screener performance, such as additional recurrent training, have  in fact improved performance. Furthermore, FSDs are to be held  accountable for screening performance and delivery of security.  Specifically, annual performance assessments for all FSDs are to be tied to  the overall performance level of their screeners as well as to their ability  to address deficiencies quickly and adequately.", "Despite its efforts to collect screener performance data and enhance  screener performance, TSA officials acknowledged that they had not  established overall performance targets by which to assess whether  screeners within and across airports are achieving a desired level of  performance. However, TSA has made progress in establishing  performance standards for one screening function\u2014X-ray image  interpretation. In March 2004, TSA established interim TIP performance  standards and plans to finalize these standards in May 2004. TSA is  currently considering developing performance indexes for representing  the performance of passenger and baggage screeners. During the  remainder of our review, we plan to continue to examine TSA\u2019s efforts to  measure screeners\u2019 performance, establish performance standards, and  assess the performance of the private screening pilot program. As part of  this effort, we will review the results of the BearingPoint, Inc. evaluation  of the private screening pilot program, which was provided to TSA on  April 9, 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The private screening pilot program was not established in a way to enable  an effective evaluation of the differences in the performance of federal and  private screening and the reasons for those differences. In developing the  pilot program, TSA did not develop an evaluation plan or performance  targets by which to assess how the performance of federal and private  screening compares. Additionally, TSA did not collect data in ways that  would enable it to reach generalizable conclusions about the performance  of private screeners. Further, the program was not designed to achieve its  intended mission, as defined by TSA\u2014to test the effectiveness of  increased operational flexibility at the airport level that contractors may  provide. Key operational areas, such as staffing and training have to a  large extent been held constant across all airports, and therefore, are not  within the control of the private screening contractors. Therefore, it is not  surprising that TSA\u2019s available screener performance data indicate little  difference between federal or private screeners in detecting threat objects.  It would have been informative to have an evaluation of a true pilot  program where the private screening contractors were provided with  operational flexibility that could assist in identifying practices that lead to  improved screener performance and higher security at the most efficient  cost to the taxpayer. Without data to better assess the performance of  private screening operations and flexible practices, TSA and airport  operators have little information on which to plan for the possible  transition of airports from a federal system to a private screening  contractor. We will continue our work and make recommendations for  TSA actions, as appropriate, in a future report.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
