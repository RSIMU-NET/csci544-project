In response to a conference report provision that it review the applicability of the IOM recommendations across its ICs, NIH administered a survey to all 24 of the ICs that fund clinical trials and presented the findings at a leadership forum and in a report to Congress. These findings showed that over half of the ICs surveyed indicated that the majority of the recommendations were applicable. NIH decided not to apply the recommendations across its ICs because more analysis was needed before proposing any NIH-wide recommendations, given the variation across ICs. Officials explained that the IOM recommendations were designed for one program within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and that most ICs do not support clinical trial networks that operate with the size and volume of the program, thus making the recommendations more pertinent to NCI. Leaders from NIH and the ICs indicated that more analysis was needed to account for the ICs' portfolios and management activities. As a result, NIH developed its own recommendations that aimed to enhance its stewardship of clinical trials, including several to improve data collection across the ICs. For example, its recommendation to improve monitoring systems, tools, and processes could assist NIH in identifying additional data that could be collected across the ICs.", "NIH's Office of the Director (OD) reviews some data on clinical trial activity across NIH but has not finalized what additional data it needs or established a process for using these data to enhance its stewardship of clinical trials, as intended by NIH's own recommendations. The OD only reviews two types of data related to clinical trial activity on a regular basis: financial data and data on the inclusion of minorities and women. Beyond these data, OD officials review other data from the ICs on clinical trial activity if there is a specific inquiry. Officials from the OD acknowledged that they do not regularly review much data specifically related to clinical trial activity, but they are considering reviewing additional data collected from the ICs to inform the OD's stewardship of clinical trial activity across NIH. However, the OD has not finalized what data it needs from the ICs. In addition, the OD has not established a process that specifies how and when the OD will use the additional data it decides to review. As a result, it is unclear how often the OD will review the data, for what purpose, and what the product of its analysis will be. Federal Standards for Internal Control state that agencies need operational and financial data to determine whether they are meeting their goals for effective and efficient use of resources. Given that ICs oversee specific clinical trials, the OD may not need the same data or level of detail collected by ICs. However, until the OD determines which additional data it will review and the process it will use to review these data, NIH is limited in its ability to make data-driven decisions regarding the use of its roughly $3 billion annual investment in clinical trials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the NIH OD (1) finalize data on clinical trial activity that the OD needs to collect from ICs, and (2) establish and implement a process for using those data.

This research includes clinical trials, which are studies  involving human subjects that test the effects of interventions on health- related outcomes. In fiscal year 2014, NIH spent nearly $3.2 billion on  clinical trials, an amount representing about 11 percent of the agency\u2019s  overall budget, through 24 of NIH\u2019s Institutes and Centers (IC).  According to NIH, clinical trials are a critically important component of  NIH\u2019s mission and among the most complex and challenging research  activities the agency funds. In addition, because they involve human  subjects, including some with life-threatening conditions, clinical trials  inherently carry more risk than other types of research.", "While NIH\u2019s ICs are directly responsible for overseeing the clinical trials  they fund, NIH\u2019s Office of the Director (OD), the agency\u2019s central policy  office, is responsible for overseeing the operations of the ICs and for  program coordination across the ICs, including ensuring that NIH\u2019s  research portfolio across the ICs is balanced, not unnecessarily  duplicative, and utilizes cross-cutting research. Because of the multi- billion dollar investment associated with clinical trials and the risk to  patients who participate in them, NIH has stated that it has an obligation  to exercise good stewardship over these studies, such as by reviewing  data to help set agency-wide policies and priorities. According to NIH, the  OD provides leadership to the ICs and helps coordinate research priority- setting activities across the ICs.", "One of NIH\u2019s ICs, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), asked the Institute  of Medicine (IOM) to review NCI\u2019s Cooperative Group Program, a  component of a clinical trial network that comprised more than 3,100  institutions, 14,000 investigators, and enrolled more than 25,000 patients  in clinical trials each year. According to IOM, NCI requested this review  to address several challenges faced by the Cooperative Group Program,  such as redundancies and inefficiencies in its process for designing,  reviewing, and initiating clinical trials. In 2010, IOM released its report  detailing its review of the Cooperative Group Program and provided 12  recommendations\u2014referred to in this report as the IOM  recommendations\u2014to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical  trials supported by the program.

We interviewed officials who  were involved in determining the applicability of the IOM  recommendations across NIH, including officials from the OD. To  supplement our understanding of the steps NIH took to apply the IOM  recommendations, we interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable  selection of 4 of the 24 ICs that fund clinical trials. Our selection included  ICs with a range of low, medium, and high levels of funding for clinical  trials in fiscal year 2014 and included two ICs with clinical trial networks  and two ICs without clinical trial networks. We interviewed officials from  the selected ICs about the applicability of the IOM recommendations to  clinical trials funded by their ICs and how NIH assessed the applicability  of the IOM recommendations across the ICs.

Although it  decided not to apply the IOM recommendations across ICs, NIH officials  recognized that they could enhance aspects of NIH\u2019s stewardship of  clinical trials, and so they developed the CTWG to provide  recommendations on how NIH could do so. In August 2013, the CTWG  issued eight recommendations intended to enhance NIH\u2019s stewardship of  clinical trials. (See Table 2.)", "Several of the CTWG recommendations aim to improve the data NIH  collects from across the ICs. For example, in developing the fourth  recommendation to improve monitoring systems, tools, and processes,  the CTWG concluded that there is a need for standardized data collected  across NIH\u2019s ICs that would help NIH identify the factors or characteristics  that contribute to a successful clinical trial. The CTWG indicated that one  type of additional data that could be collected across the ICs is accrual  data\u2014that is, information on the number of patients enrolled in a research  study, such as a clinical trial. According to the CTWG, some ICs have  their own systems for monitoring clinical trials, which could be used to  collect accrual data, while other ICs do not have these systems and  instead rely on communication with awardees and grant reports to  monitor their clinical trials.

Officials on the Task Force told us that they are  taking steps to address the CTWG recommendations by developing  policies and procedures. For example, officials stated that the Task Force  is currently working on identifying a standard set of data on clinical trials  that each IC would collect to respond to the CTWG\u2019s fourth  recommendation to improve monitoring systems, tools, and processes.
