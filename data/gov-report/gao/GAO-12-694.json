More complete state reporting of payments and new and modified supplemental payments were factors in this increase. The information available to identify changes from 2006 to 2010 came from 39 states that separately reported non-DSH supplemental payments during either 2006 or 2010 or both. Most of the increase was from the 15 states that reported some payments in both years and reported higher non-DSH supplemental payments during 2010 than 2006. In addition, most of the reported increase was for inpatient hospital services. In 11 selected states, GAO found that new and modified supplemental payments contributed to some increases. For example, new and modified supplemental payments for hospital services in Colorado and Illinois are estimated to increase the states\u0092 non-DSH supplemental payments by about $300 million and $1 billion per year, respectively. However, data limitations prevented GAO from quantifying the full extent to which the increase was attributable to new and modified payments.

To  examine reasons for differences between 2006 and 2010 in reported  non-DSH supplemental payments, and to obtain additional information  about states\u2019 reports of these payments, we obtained information from  CMS and public sources about non-DSH supplemental payments in a  judgmental sample of 11 states selected to include a mix of relevant  characteristics. Our selections included some states that separately  reported such payments in only 1 of the 2 years, and states that differed  in absolute and relative changes in reported non-DSH supplemental  payments and changes in categories of payment.

Nevertheless, as reporting of non-DSH supplemental payments becomes  more complete, the significance of these payments, in terms of cost,  growth, and contribution to total Medicaid payments for those providers  receiving them, is becoming clearer. Identifying and monitoring Medicaid  supplemental payments and ensuring that they, along with regular  Medicaid payments, are consistent with federal requirements are complex  tasks that will require continued vigilance by CMS.
