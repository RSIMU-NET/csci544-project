In fiscal year 1997, the federal government provided approximately $145 million (or 85 percent) of the Academy\u2019s funding. These funds, provided through federal agency contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, sponsored approximately 300 of the Academy\u2019s committee projects. The results of these projects are often used to increase federal agencies\u2019 knowledge in a particular subject area and can become the impetus for change in federal policies, regulations, or programs.", "Committees that provide advice to the federal government are generally subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972. The Congress passed the act because of concerns that such committees were proliferating without adequate review, oversight, or accountability. Under the act and regulations issued by the General Services Administration (GSA), agency heads have a number of responsibilities, including appointing a designated federal officer for each advisory committee and submitting a proposed charter to GSA for its review. In addition, the act requires that most meetings must be open to the public and must be attended by a federal official. Prior to 1997, the Academy did not believe that the act applied to its committees. However, in early 1997, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that an Academy committee doing work for the Department of Health and Human Services was an advisory committee under the act and, therefore, the Academy\u2019s committees were required to comply with the act.", "The court\u2019s decision prompted Academy officials to seek legislative relief from the act. The result was the enactment of the Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997. The amendments exclude committees created by the Academy from the definition of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d and add a new section 15 dealing with Academy advisory committees. That section precludes an agency from using the Academy\u2019s advice or recommendations unless, among other things, certain information is made available to the public\u2014notice of committee appointments, advance notice of open meetings, written materials presented to the committee, minutes of closed meetings, copies of final committee reports, and the names of external reviewers of draft reports. Information may be withheld if subject to exclusion under the Freedom of Information Act.", "This report responds to your April 10, 1998, request that we study the committee process at the National Academy of Sciences. Specifically, as agreed with your offices, we (1) identify reasons the Academy sought relief from the act, (2) describe the Academy\u2019s committee procedures for providing advice to the federal government, and (3) discuss the Academy\u2019s implementation of the new requirements for providing information to the public. Your request also included three legal questions on (1) the applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the subgroups of the Academy, (2) the applicability of the Freedom of Information Act to Academy advisory committees, and (3) statutory and contractual barriers to the release of data gathered by the Academy. These issues are being addressed under separate cover by our Office of General Counsel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Founded in 1863 by congressional charter, the National Academy of Sciences has a long history of serving as a scientific adviser. The Academy, which has a total membership of 4,800, also serves as an honorary institution to recognize distinguished members of the scientific community. Among other activities, the Academy also organizes symposiums, manages scientific databases, and serves as a clearinghouse for research.", "Throughout this report we use \u201cAcademy\u201d to refer to the constituent members of the Academy complex: the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the National Research Council. In 1916, the Academy formed the National Research Council to broaden its committee membership to include non-Academy members and to oversee the Academy\u2019s advisory activities. In a 1998 report, the Academy reported that committee membership consists of 55 percent from academia, 24 percent from industry, 9 percent from nonprofit institutions, and 12 percent from different levels of government. The National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine were established in 1964 and 1970, respectively, to recognize distinguished members in these fields and to provide more specialized advice in these areas. The Academy is organized by study units, which produce reports in the following topic areas: transportation, health and safety, science, commerce, natural resources, defense, space, education, and international affairs. (See table 1.)", "The Academy issued 1,331 committee reports from January 1993 to June 1997 and had an average annual budget of about $150 million. During those 5 years, most of its work was performed for the federal government, which provided the Academy with 87 percent of its revenue. (See fig. 1.) The Departments of Transportation, Energy, Health and Human Services, and the Army; the National Science Foundation; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have been its largest federal sponsors\u2014amounting to 75 percent of the total revenues for 1993 to 1997. The Academy also advises state governments, private industry, and nonprofit institutions, but that work is limited by internal Academy guidelines. In addition, the Academy may use its endowment to fund self-initiated studies deemed critical by the Academy leadership.", "The Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997 addressed concerns over the openness of the Academy\u2019s procedures. Prior to the amendments, the Academy\u2019s committee procedures included some openness. A 1975 policy document stated that committee meetings where data would be gathered were to be open to the public with advance notice given. Announcements of scheduled open meetings were published monthly in a newsletter by the Academy\u2019s Office of Information. However, the study unit heads determined which projects would have scheduled and announced open meetings. Executive meetings and working meetings, referred to as deliberative sessions, would \u201cnot normally be open to the public.\u201d A 1995 proposed change to the Academy\u2019s public access policy, among other things, further defined the types of meetings that could be closed and applied the policy uniformly across the Academy\u2019s major study units. This proposal was under consideration at the time the amendments were enacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reasons the Academy Sought Relief From the Federal Advisory Committee Act", "paragraphs": ["According to Academy officials, the Academy had three main concerns that caused it to seek relief from the Federal Advisory Committee Act: (1) the erosion of independence if the Academy was under the influence of sponsoring agencies, (2) the inability to recruit committee members if committee deliberations were open to the public, and (3) the burden of administrative requirements that would render the Academy unresponsive to the government.", "Paramount among these concerns was the Academy\u2019s independence from the influence of sponsoring agencies. Under the act, a federal government officer or employee would have to chair or be present at every advisory committee meeting. This individual would have the power to adjourn the meeting \u201cwhenever he determines it to be in the public\u2019s interest.\u201d According to Academy officials, the Academy could lose sole authority in appointing committee members, and the Academy and committee members could be under pressure from a sponsoring agency to change a report during the drafting process.", "Under the act and GSA regulations, advisory committee meetings, including deliberative meetings, would be open to the public. However, the Academy opposed opening its deliberative meetings to the public because it believed that such an action could stifle open debate and criticism of ideas in those meetings. The Academy was also concerned that the independence of the committees\u2019 deliberations and the Academy\u2019s review process would be jeopardized by attempts of sponsors and special interest groups to bring political pressure to bear. Academy officials said that closed committee deliberations are fundamental for ensuring the independence of their studies and the scientific quality of their reports. Moreover, they stated, if draft reports were available to the public, the first draft would become the enduring impressions of a report, regardless of any changes made later. In addition, the President of the Academy said that it could be more difficult to recruit potential committee members in the future if deliberations were open to the public.", "We surveyed 12 current and former Academy committee members to obtain their views on whether or not they would serve on Academy committees if the deliberative meetings were open to the public. Two members said that they would serve, six said that their decision to serve would depend on the topic of study, and three said that they probably would not serve on a committee whose deliberations were open to the public. One member did not respond directly to the question but said that closed deliberative sessions encourage greater candor among the members.", "In addition, these members generally echoed the Academy officials\u2019 views regarding the need for closed deliberative sessions. The three members who responded that they would probably not serve said that open deliberations could seriously jeopardize the quality of the reports. Two members said that Academy study committees might be difficult to staff if deliberations were open to the public. Eleven out of 12 respondents indicated that the Academy should retain the ability to close committee deliberations.", "Finally, the Academy was concerned that the amount of time and expense associated with implementing the act would render the Academy unresponsive to the government in general and to the Congress in particular. Of particular concern was the requirement under the act that each committee have a charter. Since the Academy is not a federal agency, the federal agency sponsoring the Academy study would prepare the charter and submit it for review by GSA. Academy officials estimated that the process would take between 6 and 12 months, on average, a length of time that an Academy official said would render the Academy unresponsive to the government\u2019s requests for information. In addition, most of the Academy\u2019s studies are funded by multiple agencies. Thus, the Academy was not certain which agency would be responsible for fulfilling the administrative requirements of the act. Academy officials also pointed out that applying the act to the Academy would more than double the number of committee charters that GSA would have to review each year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Academy Committee Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the enactment of the amendments of 1997, the Academy established a number of procedures for committee work that are intended to help ensure the integrity and the openness of committee activities. The procedures consist of the following phases: project formulation, committee selection, committee work, report review, and report release and dissemination. (See fig. 2.) According to Academy officials, the whole process can take anywhere from 4 months to 2 years (usually from 6 to 18 months)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Project Formulation", "paragraphs": ["During the project formulation phase, the Academy assigns the project to a study unit. According to Academy guidance, the study unit is responsible for defining the scope of the project, leaving room for the committee to further define the study, and for developing the initial cost estimates. After the study unit approves the project, the Academy gives final approval for the project. Then a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement (depending on the sponsor) is drawn up and entered into with the agency. A permanent Academy staff member, referred to as the responsible staff officer, is assigned to organize and support the project. The staff officer is responsible for ensuring that institutional procedures and practices are followed throughout the study and that the study stays on schedule and within budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee Selection", "paragraphs": ["According to the Academy\u2019s documents, each project is conducted by a committee of subject matter experts who serve without compensation. Committee selection starts with suggestions from the sponsoring organization, members of the Academy, outside professional colleagues, and Academy staff. After review of the suggestions, the President of the Academy selects committee candidates. The Academy\u2019s procedures require that each committee candidate fill out a form on his or her potential conflicts of interest. The form consists of five questions asking for the member\u2019s relevant organizational affiliations, financial interests, research support, government service, and public statements and positions concerning the committee\u2019s topic. We reviewed a sample (about 10 percent) of the 331 current committees to determine whether the forms had been filed and found that the Academy\u2019s procedures were generally being followed. Under Academy procedures, 5 of the 30 committees selected were not required to file the conflict-of-interest forms because they were not subject to section 15 for various reasons. Of the remaining 25 committees, we found that almost all members (316 out of 341 or 93 percent) had forms on file.", "At the first meeting of every committee, the Academy\u2019s procedures require a confidential discussion among committee members and project staff of potential conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest is identified, the committee member may be asked to resign from the committee. If the Academy determines that the conflict is unavoidable, the Academy will make the conflict public and will retain the committee member. After this meeting, the executive director of the relevant study unit makes a tentative determination of whether the committee as constituted is composed of individuals with the requisite expertise to address the task and whether the points of view of individual members are adequately balanced such that the committee as a whole can address its charge objectively. Final approval of the committee membership, however, rests with the President of the Academy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Committee Work", "paragraphs": ["Committees meet in data-gathering sessions that are generally open to the public and in deliberative sessions that are closed to the public.

The Academy\u2019s responsible staff officer facilitates the meetings.", "In order to identify the number of open versus closed meetings, we reviewed the meetings held from December 1997 through June 1998 for the 331 committees. Since we found that most meetings were a combination of open and closed sessions, we identified the number of open and closed hours during these meetings. Of the 331 committees, 129 either had no meetings or were not subject to section 15 for various reasons. The remaining 202 committees held a total of 353 meetings. For 300 (or 85 percent) of those meetings, at least some portion of the meeting was closed. For 139 of the 300 meetings where complete information about open and closed sessions was available, we found that slightly less than half (45 percent) of the time was spent in closed sessions. For 251 projects, we determined the reasons for the closed sessions: 61 meetings included discussions of potential bias of committee members, 36 meetings included discussions of the committee\u2019s composition and balance, and 201 meetings involved drafting the committee report. We also found that seven data-gathering meetings were closed under Freedom of Information Act exemptions.", "Every report is the collective product of the committee.

However, these five committees were not required to post biographies because the committees were created prior to the act.", "The Academy\u2019s guidelines state that the summary minutes for closed meetings should be posted to the web site, preferably within 10 business days of the meeting. In order to determine whether this requirement was met by the Academy, we reviewed data on the closed meetings for the 202 committees that held meetings from December 17, 1997, through June 17, 1998. As previously stated, these committees held a total of 353 meetings, with 300 of those meetings having some portion closed.

For example, the listings of the meetings for three projects were out of order. One meeting had two different dates listed on the project web site. For 34 projects, the agenda or summary minutes were not posted. The Academy has already taken action to correct this information or has adequately explained these specific problems. In addition, since we conducted our audit, the Academy created a records officer position responsible for checking the timeliness and accuracy of data on a daily basis.", "Through the web site, the Academy also elicits public comments about committee composition.
