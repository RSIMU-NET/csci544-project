Such policy is important because the government relies on contractors that employ foreign workers in countries where, according to State, they may be vulnerable to abuse.", "GAO was mandated to report on the use of foreign workers. This report examines (1) policies and guidance governing the recruitment of foreign workers and the fees these workers may pay to secure work on U.S. government contracts overseas and (2) agencies' monitoring of contractor efforts to combat TIP. GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 11 contracts awarded by DOD, State, and USAID, composing nearly one-third of all reported foreign workers on contracts awarded by these agencies at the end of fiscal year 2013.

GAO found that some foreign workers\u2014individuals who are not citizens of the United States or the host country\u2014had reported paying for their jobs. Such recruitment fees can lead to various abuses related to trafficking in persons (TIP), such as debt bondage. For example, on the contract employing the largest number of foreign workers in its sample, GAO found that more than 1,900 foreign workers reported paying fees for their jobs, including to recruitment agencies used by a subcontractor. According to the subcontractor, these fees were likely paid to a recruiter who assisted foreign workers with transportation to and housing in Dubai before they were hired to work on the contract in Afghanistan (see figure). Some Department of Defense (DOD) contracting officials GAO interviewed said that such fees may be reasonable. DOD, the Department of State (State), and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have developed policy and guidance for certain contracts addressing recruitment fees in different ways. However, these agencies do not specify what components or amounts of recruitment fees are considered permissible, limiting the ability of contracting officers and contractors to implement agency policy and guidance.", "GAO found that agency monitoring, called for by federal acquisition regulations and agency guidance, did not always include processes to specifically monitor contractor efforts to combat TIP. For 7 of the 11 contracts in GAO's sample, DOD and State had specific monitoring processes to combat TIP. On the 4 remaining contracts, agencies did not specifically monitor for TIP, but rather focused on contractor-provided goods and services, such as building construction. In addition, some DOD and State contracting officials said they were unaware of relevant acquisitions policy and guidance for combating TIP and did not clearly understand their monitoring responsibilities. Both DOD and State have developed additional training to help make contracting officials more aware of their monitoring responsibilities to combat TIP. Without specific efforts to monitor for TIP, agencies' ability to implement the zero tolerance policy and detect concerns about TIP is limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that agencies (1) develop a more precise definition of recruitment fees and (2) ensure that contract monitoring specifically includes TIP.

We selected a sample of 11 contracts that were  active at the end of fiscal year 2013, based on the contracts\u2019 place of  performance, value, type of service provided, and the number of foreign  workers employed to reflect a range of agencies, countries, and services.  We conducted structured interviews with agency contracting officials,  contractors, and, in some cases, interviewed the subcontractors  responsible for these contracts. The contracts in our sample represent  nearly one-third of all reported foreign workers employed on contracts  awarded by these three agencies as reported in the Synchronized Pre- deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) database at the end of fiscal  year 2013. The results of our structured interviews are not generalizable  but provided us with insights about contractor recruitment practices and  efforts to combat TIP, as well as agencies\u2019 monitoring of these efforts.

In addition, we  conducted fieldwork in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Qatar, where we spoke  with contracting officials, contractors, and subcontractors regarding  contracts in our sample, and in Jordan, where we spoke with State and  USAID officials to inform our research design and methodology. We also  spoke with other DOD, State, and USAID officials; host government  officials; and local nongovernmental organizations to obtain a broader  view about labor practices and efforts to combat TIP in these countries.  We chose these countries based on the range of U.S. government  activities in these countries, the prevalence of foreign workers, and  State\u2019s assessment of the host government\u2019s efforts to combat TIP.  Furthermore, we interviewed contracting officials, acquisition policy  officials, and officials responsible for coordinating agencies\u2019 efforts to  combat TIP in the United States.

Traffickers use acquaintances or  false advertisements to recruit men, women, and children in or near their  homes, and then transfer them to and exploit them in another city, region,  or country. The U.S. government defines severe forms of trafficking in  persons to include the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or  obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud,  or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude,  peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. International organizations have  also defined trafficking in persons and developed a list of indicators of  trafficking for labor exploitation.

Currently, agency contracting officials lack policy  or guidance that specifies what components are considered to be  recruitment fees and may not be able to determine which fees are  permissible, hindering their ability to carry out their responsibilities. For  example, neither the FAR nor agency policy or guidance specifies what  components are considered to constitute recruitment fees, but these fees  could include air tickets, lodging, passport and visa fees, or medical  screening, among other expenses. One subcontractor who hires foreign  workers in Dubai for work in Afghanistan said that the definition of  recruitment fees is imprecise and varies widely within the contracting  community.

They  said that they had consulted State\u2019s Office to Monitor and Combat  Trafficking in Persons, which took the same position of the Office of the  Procurement Executive given that such fees create vulnerability among  workers and often are the precursor to debt bondage.

They  noted that eliminating these fees would be nearly impossible, and that  recruiters would pass these fees on to workers in some other form if  recruitment fees were explicitly banned. DOD Joint Staff officials added  that the elimination of recruitment fees will cause contractors to change  the name from recruitment fees to travel or per diem fees to cover air  travel, housing and food, thus a precise definition of these fees that  specifically addresses travel costs is needed.

The United States has an obligation to prevent entities working  on its behalf from engaging in trafficking in persons, and when it uses  contractors to support its activities in such countries, it bears an even  greater responsibility to protect workers given the increased risk of abuse.  Accordingly, it has taken several steps to eliminate trafficking in persons  from government contracts and strengthened these efforts in 2007 with  amendments to a contract clause required on all contracts that prohibits  contractors from engaging in a variety of trafficking-related activities.  Recognizing the need for further guidance on how to implement these  regulations, agencies developed their own guidance and policy to  augment worker protections and to clarify agency and contractor  responsibilities.", "The President and Congress both signaled the need for further clarity in  reducing the risk of TIP on government contracts by directing  amendments to existing regulations in 2012.

Contracting officers and agency officials with  monitoring responsibilities currently rely on policy and guidance that do  not define recruitment fees, resulting in ambiguity over what constitutes  such a fee. Without an explicit definition of what components constitute  recruitment fees, prohibited fees may be renamed and passed on to  foreign workers, increasing the risk of debt bondage and other conditions  that contribute to trafficking. State also commented that, to ensure  consistent treatment of recruitment fees across government, we should  recommend that the Office of Management and Budget draft a FAR  definition of recruitment fees.

In 2012, average per capita income in the six Gulf  countries was nearly 25 times higher than average income per capita in  the top five source countries, and some differences between individual  countries were even more dramatic, according to the World Bank. For  example, in 2012, annual per capita income in Qatar was more than  $58,000, nearly 100 times higher than in Bangladesh, where per capita  income was almost $600. Foreign workers in Gulf countries send billions  of dollars in remittances to their home countries annually. For example, in  2012 the World Bank estimated that migrant workers from the top five  source countries sent home almost $60 billion from the Gulf countries,  including nearly $33 billion to India, nearly $10 billion to Egypt, and nearly  $7 billion to Pakistan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Source Country Regulation of Overseas Employment", "paragraphs": ["Source countries regulate the recruitment of their nationals for overseas  employment in a variety of ways. According to relevant regulatory  agencies in their countries, some source countries, such as India and the  Philippines, have a licensing process for recruitment agencies and require  potential overseas employers to use only licensed recruiters. According to  these agencies, these countries also permit recruiters to charge  prospective migrant workers a fee in specified circumstances but limit the  amount of this fee. For example, according to the Indian Ministry of  Overseas Indian Affairs, India\u2019s Emigration Act and Rules detail  requirements for the registration of recruiters, prohibit the use of  subagents, prescribe the emigration clearance process, and permit  registered recruiters to charge migrant workers fees up to 20,000 rupees,  currently about $325, for their services. Similarly, according to the  Philippines Overseas Employment Administration, the government of the  Philippines facilitates the emigration of Filipino workers employed abroad  and provides standards and oversight through licensing, required contract  provisions, and placement fees. Filipino embassies in host countries also  provide services for its citizens in those countries, such as assistance  establishing bank accounts and wiring money home and information  regarding worker rights in the host country, according to the Filipino Labor  Attach\u00e9 in Qatar. According to the Bangladeshi Ministry of Expatriates\u2019  Welfare and Overseas Employment, the ministry was established in 2001  to ensure the overall welfare of migrant workers and has established a  process for licensing recruitment agents. Other countries, such as Egypt,  do not regulate overseas recruitment, lacking a licensing process for  recruiters and regulations on the amount of fees that these recruiters may  charge, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Manpower and Emigration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Host Country Labor Practices", "paragraphs": ["The ILO has reported that in Gulf countries, several common and  restrictive labor practices stem from the Kafala sponsorship system of  foreign workers. According to the ILO, the Kafala system is a  sponsorship system whereby a foreign worker is employed in a Gulf  country by a specific employer that controls the worker\u2019s residency,  immigration, and employment status. Under this system, employers meet  their demand for labor either by direct recruitment or through the use of  recruitment agents who find foreign workers. The system generally ties  workers\u2019 residency and immigration status to the employer, which can  prevent workers from changing employers and limit their freedom of  movement, according to the ILO. The ILO further stated that sponsors  can also prohibit workers from leaving the country and have the right to  terminate workers\u2019 employment contracts and have residency permits  canceled. According to State\u2019s Qatar 2013 Human Rights Report,  international media and human rights organizations alleged numerous  abuses against foreign workers, including a sponsorship system that gave  employers an inordinate level of control over foreign workers.", "In addition to the labor practices associated with the Kafala system, the  withholding of workers\u2019 passports is an additional restrictive labor practice  common in many Gulf countries. For example, State reported that in  Qatar, despite laws prohibiting the withholding of foreign workers\u2019 identity  documents, employers withheld the passports of a large portion of their  foreign workers in that country. According to State\u2019s most recent  Trafficking in Persons Report, the withholding of foreign workers\u2019  passports contributes to the potential for trafficking in persons (TIP).  Furthermore, the ILO has reported that employers in Gulf countries may  refuse to release workers or may charge high fees for release, withhold  wages as security to prevent workers from running away, and withhold  personal travel documents. The ILO also found that workers in these  countries may be subjected to forced overtime, limited freedom of  movement, degrading living and working conditions, and physical  violence and threats. Overall, the ILO estimated that there were 600,000  victims of forced labor in the Middle East at any given point in time  between 2002 and 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Federal Acquisition Regulations and Agency Policy and Guidance Related to Contractor Recruitment and Labor Practices", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires all solicitations and  contracts to include Clause 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons  (TIP).
