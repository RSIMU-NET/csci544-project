For example, in our prior work, we found that  DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a hierarchical, portfolio-based approach to  strategically acquire contracted services had not been successful. In part,  we found that the cultural barriers and military commanders\u2019 reluctance to  give up certain responsibilities for determining how and which services  were needed to meet their missions hindered DOD\u2019s efforts. We have  also highlighted these challenges in our High-Risk List, which calls  attention to agencies and program areas that are high risk because of  their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are  most in need of transformation.

The act also  requires DOD to establish cross-functional teams whose leaders report  directly to the Secretary of Defense and that, among other things,  address the critical objectives and outputs outlined in the department\u2019s  organizational strategy. The act further requires DOD to issue guidance  on cross-functional teams and to provide training to members of those  established teams and their supervisors on elements of successful cross- functional teams.

According to the draft strategy, this plan  could include goals and milestones for these initiatives, and the CMO  could report periodically on the achievement of the goals.
