None of the three planned DHS implementations of ADVISE that GAO reviewed are fully operational. (GAO did not review uses of the tool by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis.) The intended benefit of the ADVISE tool is to help detect threatening activities by facilitating the analysis of large amounts of data. DHS is currently in the process of testing the tool's effectiveness. Use of the ADVISE tool raises a number of privacy concerns. DHS has added security controls to the tool; however, it has not assessed privacy risks. Privacy risks that could apply to ADVISE include the potential for erroneous association of individuals with crime or terrorism and the misidentification of individuals with similar names. A privacy impact assessment would identify specific privacy risks and help officials determine what controls are needed to mitigate those risks. ADVISE has not undergone such an assessment because DHS officials believe it is not needed given that the tool itself does not contain personal data. However, the tool's intended uses include applications involving personal data, and the E-Government Act and related guidance emphasize the need to assess privacy risks early in systems development. Further, if an assessment were conducted and privacy risks identified, a number of controls could be built into the tool to mitigate those risks. For example, controls could be implemented to ensure that personal information is used only for a specified purpose or compatible purposes, and they could provide the capability to distinguish among individuals that have similar names to address the risk of misidentification. Because privacy has not been assessed and mitigating controls have not been implemented, DHS faces the risk that ADVISE-based system implementations containing personal information may require costly and potentially duplicative retrofitting at a later date to add the needed controls."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been an  increasing focus on the need to prevent and detect terrorist threats  through technological means.

In the private  sector, these applications include customer relationship management,  market research, retail and supply chain analysis, medical analysis and  diagnostics, financial analysis, and fraud detection. In the government,  data mining has been used to detect financial fraud and abuse. For  example, we used data mining to identify fraud and abuse in expedited  assistance and other disbursements to Hurricane Katrina victims.", "Although the characteristics of data mining efforts can vary greatly, data  mining generally incorporates three processes: data input, data analysis,  and results output. In data input, data are collected in a central data  \u201cwarehouse,\u201d validated, and formatted for use in data mining. In the data  analysis phase, data are typically queried to find records that match topics  of interest. The two most common types of queries are pattern-based  queries and subject-based queries:    Pattern-based queries search for data elements that match or depart from  a predetermined pattern (e.g., unusual claim patterns in an insurance  program).", "Subject-based queries search for any available information on a  predetermined subject using a specific identifier. This could be personal  information such as an individual identifier (e.g., an individual\u2019s name or  Social Security number) or an identifier for a specific object or location.  For example, the Navy uses subject-based data mining to identify trends in  the failure rate of parts used in its ships.", "The data analysis phase can be iterative, with the results of one query  being used to refine criteria for a subsequent query. The output phase can  produce results in printed or electronic format. These reports can be  accessed by agency personnel and can also be shared with personnel from  other agencies.

In our May  2004 report, we noted that 52 agencies were using or were planning to use  data mining in 199 cases, of which 68 were planned, and 131 were  operational. Additionally, following the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, data mining has been used increasingly as a tool to help detect  terrorist threats through the collection and analysis of public and private  sector data. This may include tracking terrorist activities, including money  transfers and communications, and tracking terrorists themselves through  travel and immigration records.

For example, the act requires  that to the greatest extent practicable, personal information should be  collected directly from the subject individual when it may affect an  individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program. The act also  requires that an agency inform individuals whom it asks to supply  information of (1) the authority for soliciting the information and whether  disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; (2) the principal  purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (3) the routine  uses that may be made of the information; and (4) the effects on the  individual, if any, of not providing the information.

Further, the report recommends that data mining projects give  explicit consideration to using anonymized data when personally  identifiable information is involved. Although some of the report\u2019s  recommendations may apply only to operational data mining activities,  many reflect system functionalities that can be addressed during  technology development.", "Based on privacy risks identified in a PIA, controls exist that could be  implemented in ADVISE to mitigate those risks. For example, controls  could be implemented to enforce use limitations associated with the  purpose specified when the data were originally collected. Specifically,  software controls could be implemented that require an analyst to specify  an allowable purpose and check that purpose against the specified  purposes of the databases being accessed.", "Regarding data quality risks, the ADVISE tool currently does not have the  capability to distinguish among individuals with similar identifying  information, nor does it have a mechanism to assess the accuracy of the  relationships it uncovers. To address the risk of misidentification,  software could be added to the tool to distinguish among individuals that  have similar names, a process known as disambiguation. Disambiguation  tools have been developed for other applications. Additionally, although  the ADVISE tool includes a feature that allows analysts to designate  confidence levels for individual pieces of data, no mechanism has been  developed to assess the confidence of relationships identified by the tool.  While software specifically to determine data quality would be difficult to  develop, other controls exist that could be readily used as part of a  strategy for mitigating this risk. For example, anonymization could be used  to minimize the exposure of personal data, and operational procedures  could be developed to restrict the use of analytical results containing  personal information that could have data quality concerns. To implement  anonymization, the tool would need the software capability to handle  anonymized data or have a built-in data anonymizer. DHS currently does  not have plans to build anonymization into the ADVISE tool.", "Until a PIA that identifies the privacy risks of ADVISE is conducted and  privacy controls to mitigate those risks are implemented, DHS faces the  risk that privacy concerns will arise during implementation of systems  based on ADVISE that may be more difficult to address at that stage and  possibly require costly retrofitting."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The ADVISE tool is intended to provide the capability to ingest large  amounts of data from multiple sources and to display relationships that  can be discerned within the data. Although the ADVISE tool has not yet  been fully implemented and its effectiveness is still being evaluated, the  chief intended benefit is to help detect activities threatening to the United  States by facilitating the analysis of large amounts of data.", "The ADVISE tool incorporates security controls intended to protect the  information it processes from unauthorized access. However, because  ADVISE is intended to be used in ways that are likely to involve personal  data, a range of potential privacy risks could be involved in its operational  use. Thus, it is important that those risks be assessed\u2014through a PIA\u2014so  that additional controls can be established to mitigate them. However,  DHS has not yet conducted a PIA, despite the fact that the E-Government  Act and related OMB and DHS guidance emphasize the need to assess  privacy risks early in systems development. Although DHS officials stated  that they believe a PIA is not required because the tool alone does not  contain personal data, they also told us they are considering conducting a  modified PIA for the tool. Until a PIA is conducted, little assurance exists  that privacy risks have been rigorously considered and mitigating controls  established. If controls are not addressed now, they may be more difficult  and costly to retrofit at a later stage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that privacy protections are in place before DHS proceeds with  implementations of systems based on ADVISE, we recommend that the  Secretary of Homeland Security take the following two actions:  immediately conduct a privacy impact assessment of the ADVISE tool to  identify privacy risks, such as those described in this report, and implement privacy controls to mitigate potential privacy risks identified in  the PIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received oral and written comments on a draft of this report from the  DHS Departmental GAO/Office of Inspector General Liaison Office.  (Written comments are reproduced in appendix II.) DHS officials generally  agreed with the content of this report and described actions initiated to  address our recommendations. DHS also provided technical comments,  which have been incorporated in the final report as appropriate.", "In its comments DHS emphasized the fact that the ADVISE tool itself does  not contain personal data and that each deployment of the tool will be  reviewed through the department\u2019s privacy compliance process, including,  as applicable, development of a PIA and a system of records notice. DHS  further stated that it is currently developing a \u201cPrivacy Technology  Implementation Guide\u201d to be used to conduct a PIA for ADVISE. Although  we have not reviewed the guide, it appears to be a positive step toward  developing a PIA process to address technology tools such as ADVISE.", "It is not clear from the department\u2019s response whether the privacy  controls identified based on applying the Privacy Technology  Implementation Guide to ADVISE are to be incorporated into the tool  itself. We believe that any controls identified by a PIA to mitigate privacy  risks should be implemented, to the extent possible, in the tool itself.  Specific development efforts that use the tool will then have these  integrated controls readily available, thus reducing the potential for added  costs and technical risks. The department also requested that we change  the wording of our recommendation; however, we have retained the  wording in our draft report because it clearly emphasizes the need to  incorporate privacy controls into the ADVISE tool itself.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We reviewed program  documentation, including annual program execution plans, and  interviewed agency officials responsible for managing and implementing  the program, including officials from the DHS Science and Technology  Directorate and the Lawrence Livermore and Pacific Northwest National  Laboratories. We also viewed a demonstration of the tool\u2019s semantic  graphing capability. In addition, we interviewed officials at DHS  components to identify their current or planned uses of ADVISE, the  progress of their implementations, and the benefits they hope to gain from  using the tool. These components included Immigrations and Customs  Enforcement and other components. We also interviewed officials from  the Interagency Center of Applied Homeland Security Technology  (ICAHST), who are responsible for conducting testing of the tool\u2019s  capabilities. We also visited ICAHST at the John Hopkins Applied Physics  Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, to view a demonstration of its testing  activities.
