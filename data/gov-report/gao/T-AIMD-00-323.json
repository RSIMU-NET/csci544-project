For fiscal year 1999, Education made significant efforts to work around these weaknesses and produce financial statements. These efforts enabled its auditors to issue qualified opinionson four of its five required financial statements and a disclaimer on the fifth statement. Its auditors\u2019 qualified opinion states that except for the effect of the matters to which the qualification relates, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, financial position, net costs, changes in net position, and budgetary resources in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditors stated the following reasons or matters for their qualification:", "The Department had significant systems weaknesses during fiscal year 1999 affecting its financial management systems. The new accounting system, implemented in fiscal year 1998, had several limitations, including an inability to perform a year-end closing process or produce automated consolidated financial statements. Through its efforts and those of its contractors, Education was able to partially compensate for, but did not correct, certain aspects of the material weaknesses in its financial reporting process. In addition, during fiscal year 1999, Education experienced significant turnover of financial management staff, which also contributed to the overall weakness in financial reporting.", "Education was unable to provide adequate support for about $800 million reported in the September 30, 1999, net position balance in its financial statements, and the auditors were unable to perform other audit procedures to satisfy themselves that this amount was correct.", "Education processed many transactions from prior fiscal years as fiscal year 1999 transactions and manually adjusted its records in an effort to reflect the transactions in the proper period; however, the auditors could not determine if these adjustments for certain costs and obligations were correct.", "Error!

Summaries of the material internal control weaknesses follow:", "Education did not have adequate internal controls over its financial reporting process. Its general ledger system was not able to perform an automated year-end closing process and directly produce consolidated financial statements as would normally be expected from such systems. Because of these weaknesses, Education had to resort to a costly, labor- intensive, and time-consuming process involving manual and automated procedures to prepare financial statements for fiscal year 1999. In addition, Education had to rely heavily on contractor services to help perform reconciliations among the various data sources used. In one instance, Education reported a balance of approximately $7.5 billion for its cumulative results of operations. However, the majority of this amount, which pertains to the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), should have been reported as a payable to Treasury rather than as cumulative results of operations. As a result of the independent auditors\u2019 work, an adjustment was made to reclassify the $7.5 billion to the proper account. When such errors occur and are not detected by the Department\u2019s controls, there are increased risks that the Department could retain funds inappropriately that should be returned to Treasury.", "Error!

In some instances, Education adjusted its general ledger to reflect the balance per the subsidiary records, without sufficiently researching the cause for differences. Also, as indicated in prior audits, Education has not been able to identify and resolve differences between its accounting records and cash transactions reported by the Treasury. For example, for fiscal year 1999, Education adjusted its Fund Balance with Treasury, due to a difference between its general ledger and the Treasury, by a net amount of about $244 million. Reconciling agencies\u2019 accounting records with relevant Treasury records is required by Treasury policy and is analogous to individuals reconciling their checkbooks to monthly bank statements. In another instance, as we recently reported,Education used its grantback account as a suspense account beginning in 1993 for hundreds of millions of dollars of activity related to grant reconciliation efforts. We also reported that Education did not maintain adequate detailed records for certain grantback account activity by the applicable fiscal year and appropriation. In addition, Education used the grantback account to clear unreconciled differences in various grant appropriation fund balance accounts and adjust certain appropriation fund balances to ensure that they did not become negative.", "In response to the auditors\u2019 findings, Education has purchased a software tool to help enhance its ability to reconcile its account balances with the corresponding Treasury account balances on a monthly basis.
