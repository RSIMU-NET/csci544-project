To  implement this verification process, CMS developed the data services  hub (data hub), which acts as a portal for exchanging information  between the federal Marketplace, state-based marketplaces, and  Medicaid agencies, among other entities, and CMS\u2019s external partners,  including other federal agencies. The Marketplace uses the data hub in  an attempt to verify that applicant information necessary to support an  eligibility determination is consistent with external data sources.", "For qualifying applicants, the act provides two possible forms of subsidies  for consumers enrolling in individual health plans, both of which are  generally paid directly to insurers on consumers\u2019 behalf. One is a federal  income-tax credit, which enrollees may elect to receive in advance, and  which reduces a consumer\u2019s monthly premium payment. When taken in  advance, this benefit is known as the advance premium tax credit  (APTC). The other, known as cost-sharing reduction (CSR), is a discount  that lowers the amount consumers pay for out-of-pocket charges for  deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.", "Under PPACA, an applicant\u2019s filing of a federal income-tax return,  including a required additional form, is a significant eligibility requirement  for continued receipt of federal subsidies. When applicants apply for  coverage, they report family size and the amount of projected income. On  the basis, in part, of that information, the Marketplace will calculate the  maximum allowable amount of APTC. An applicant can then decide  whether he or she wants all, some, or none of the estimated credit paid in  advance, in the form of payment to the applicant\u2019s insurer that reduces  the applicant\u2019s monthly premium payment.", "If an applicant chooses to have all or some of his or her credit paid in  advance, the applicant is required to \u201creconcile\u201d on his or her federal  income-tax return the amount of advance payments the government sent  to the applicant\u2019s insurer on the applicant\u2019s behalf with the tax credit for  which the applicant qualifies based on actual reported income and family  size. Reconciliation is accomplished using IRS Form 8692, Premium  Tax Credit (PTC). To receive advance payment of the tax credit at time of  application, applicants must attest they will file a tax return for the year for  which they receive APTC. CMS announced that, beginning with the open- enrollment period for 2016 coverage, APTC and CSR subsidies will be  discontinued for 2016 coverage for enrollees who received APTC in 2014,  but did not comply with the requirement to file a federal income-tax return  and reconcile receipt of their APTC subsidy.", "Under PPACA\u2019s application process, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d are generated  when individual applicant information does not match information from  federal data sources\u2014either because information an applicant provided  does not match information contained in data sources that a marketplace  uses for eligibility verification at the time of application, or because such  information is not available.

For 11 applicants, we successfully made  premium payments. However, for three applicants, our initial premium  payments\u2014made to insurers we selected\u2014were unsuccessful, and we  were unable to resolve the issue. While we believed we had received  confirmation of premium payments, insurers said payments were not  received on a timely basis. As a result, our coverage was not put into  effect in these three cases.

IRS officials told  us that assuming a return is complete, normal processing time is  typically 3 to 12 weeks. They also confirmed that the IRS status  updates, which occur monthly, can add additional time.", "Enrollees receiving the APTC subsidy had not previously been  required to reconcile the credit as part of their taxes and were  unfamiliar with the reconciliation process.", "CMS officials told us that in May 2016, seeking to check individuals who  received APTC after attesting to filing a 2014 tax return, the agency  began a postapplication approval process for tax-filing verification. Under  this process, the officials said, the federal Marketplace would first check  IRS tax-filing-requirement data for applicants who attested on their  applications that they had filed a tax return; next, would notify remaining  APTC recipients who have not filed of the obligation to do so; and then  would conduct a final IRS check of tax-filing status for those who had  received warning notices. After that, nonfilers will lose APTC and income- based CSR subsidies. According to the officials, this process will be  complete, with subsidies terminated, by October 2016. If such a  determination is made to end subsidies, on the schedule CMS identified,  those losing financial assistance for failure to file may have received  subsidized coverage for January to September, or 9 months of the 2016  coverage year, according to CMS officials. IRS officials said subsidy  recipients would still be responsible for reconciling APTC provided. As  noted, that could increase or decrease tax liability depending on the  individual situation.", "According to CMS officials, the tax-filing recheck process\u2014done following  applicant attestations on tax-filing earlier\u2014began in May 2016, 4 months  after the close of 2016 open enrollment. The CMS officials told us this  timing was chiefly because the federal Marketplace did not have the  system capability earlier to both first determine on a large-scale basis  whether applicants had made required tax filings, and then also to  subsequently end subsidies for those who had not done so. The process  of both comprehensively checking tax-return-filing status and also taking  action against those not making the required filings is a difficult, complex  task, CMS officials told us, due to coordination required with IRS and  restrictions on disclosure of protected federal taxpayer information.  Although building a system to do so has been a priority, they said,  competing priorities, coupled with complexity of building a new system,  meant system capability to remove APTC on a large-scale basis following  a recheck process would not be available until August or September 2016  at the earliest. CMS officials said that among enrollees in Marketplace  coverage with APTC subsidies who had attested to filing a 2014 tax  return, there were about 19,000 applications for which IRS indicated no  2014 return had been processed at the start of the recheck process in  May 2016. CMS officials said they do not have information on the value of  APTC and CSR subsidies associated with this coverage. Although the  recheck process began 4 months after the end of 2016 open enrollment,  the Marketplace hopes to begin the tax-filing check-and-termination  process earlier for the upcoming 2017 coverage year, because the  system will already be in place, the officials said. But a timetable has not  been set, they said.", "For our 2016 fictitious applicants, because they did not file a tax return  and reconcile APTC subsidies they received, IRS could have reported the  failure to file in response to marketplace queries if the applicant had a  valid Social Security number, CMS officials told us. Since the federal  Marketplace process allowed applicant attestation instead, that is likely  what accounted for our fictitious applicants successfully gaining coverage  despite not having filed tax returns, according to the officials.", "IRS officials told us they expressed concerns to CMS about CMS\u2019s  attestation approach. Allowing applicants to attest to tax filing, without  making some validation attempt at the time of application, raises the  possibility that improper APTC payments would be made, in the case that  it is determined later that an applicant in fact did not make the required  filing. The issue arises because the APTC is paid before reconciliation  status is ultimately known, the officials told us. From IRS\u2019s perspective, if  someone has not reconciled, the person has not met the obligation  necessary to continue to receive APTC, they said. IRS officials said they  have had ongoing discussions with CMS about this issue, but noted that  CMS has the decision-making authority in the matter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Reconciliation for the State Marketplace", "paragraphs": ["In the case of the state marketplace we tested, Covered California  similarly opted for applicant attestation rather than relying on IRS tax-filing  data, marketplace officials told us. State officials told us that for 2016  enrollment, the marketplace added an attestation form to its online  application system for those who had received subsidized coverage for  2014 and were renewing their coverage. In November 2015, the  marketplace conducted an outreach campaign, sending notices to  consumers who were reported by IRS as not having filed, warning that  they were at risk of losing subsidies if they did not file tax returns.  Covered California followed up with a reminder notice in January 2016,  the officials said. Then, in May 2016, the marketplace rechecked IRS tax- filing data, officials told us, for those reported by IRS as not having filed,  plus those who had not attested earlier that they had filed tax returns. On  the basis of that check, the marketplace then ended subsidized coverage  for those still showing as not having filed, officials told us.", "Covered California also allowed an opportunity to regain subsidized  coverage, however. The state marketplace sent a notice of loss of  subsidy, explaining that the change was based on failure to file. But the  marketplace also told those losing subsidized coverage that if they  believed the determination was wrong, they could attest to having filed. If  consumers made that attestation, subsidized coverage would be restored,  officials told us. Thus, a consumer could have attested (at renewal, when  submitting a new application, or while reporting a change) that he or she  had filed, or would file; next, have had subsidized coverage end when  IRS data did not support the attestation; but then have the subsidized  coverage reestablished through another attestation. The reason for this  ultimate reliance on attestation is that officials were \u201cvery mindful\u201d that  IRS data being reported to marketplaces may not be current. While  relying on attestation, the marketplace does not have information on the  extent to which people who attested to filing have actually done so, the  officials said. The officials also could not provide information on the  number of applications where the IRS non-filing code was received, but  the marketplace relied on attestation. As of May 2016, among 14,000  consumers that had not attested, 5,000 lost APTC during the  redetermination process, Covered California officials told us.", "After subsidized coverage is restored following a postcutoff attestation,  there are no further checks of IRS data for the coverage year, officials  told us. This practice is because they deemed a new round of checks for  the 2017 coverage year, beginning in about October 2016, as an  opportune time to make the next check. However, the officials said the  October check would not distinguish between failure to file for the first  year subject to the reconciliation requirement\u20142014\u2014or instead for the  second year for which the requirement was in effect, 2015.  Nevertheless, if a consumer has the IRS nonfiling code at that time, her  or she will not be renewed with a subsidy, the officials said. In general,  Covered California only takes action on the most recent tax-filing status  code returned from the data hub, the officials said, which currently does  not distinguish between years.", "In our California work we also identified that the state marketplace used a  paper application that did not include a tax-filing query, which means that  applicants filing by paper would not have to attest to tax-filing status. As a  result, two of our fictitious applicants that submitted paper applications  were not asked whether they filed taxes (as noted in fig. 3). Covered  California officials confirmed the form has been in use since the first  PPACA open-enrollment period began in 2013. The state marketplace is  seeking to revise its paper application, with CMS to review the changes,  Covered California officials told us.", "The state marketplace has limited ability to know whether applicants  received subsidies in prior years, the Covered California officials told us,  and thus are subject to the reconciliation requirement. Those who  obtained previous coverage through Covered California can readily be  identified, they said. But the state marketplace generally does not receive  information on whether its applicants have ever had previous coverage  elsewhere. An exception is for applicants flagged by IRS for failure to file.  For non\u2013Covered California enrollees, that flag indicates previous  coverage elsewhere, the officials said. Otherwise, the state marketplace  has no way to determine such previous coverage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Remaining Fictitious Applicants, Using Testing Scenarios Similar to Those Employed Previously, Likewise Were Approved for Coverage and Awarded Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["At the outset of our testing, we made 9 of our 15 applications using new  fictitious identities to test scenarios similar to those tested in our previous  undercover testing\u2014citizenship / lawful presence, Social Security identity,  and duplicate enrollment in more than one state. After the payment- processing issue noted earlier, eight of these nine applications remained  in active testing\u2014seven for qualified-health-plan coverage and one for  Medicaid.", "For all seven of the qualified-health-plan coverage cases that remained  active, our fictitious applicants were approved for coverage with APTC  and CSR subsidies. However, as discussed later, one fictitious applicant  did not maintain subsidized coverage. For these seven successful  applicants, we obtained APTC subsidies totaling about $2,700 on a  monthly basis, or about $33,000 annually. In the eighth case, our  applicant was approved for Medicaid coverage. Figure 4 summarizes  our testing results by scenario.", "As previously noted, citizenship/lawful presence is an explicit eligibility  criterion under PPACA. In the case of Social Security identity, the  information our applicants submitted did not match information on file with  SSA. In the case of duplicate enrollment, we used a single identity to  apply for coverage in each of the three states\u2014a situation consistent with  identity theft."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "According to Officials, Federal Marketplace Outcomes Appear to Be as Expected", "paragraphs": ["CMS officials told us that for the federal Marketplace there generally  appeared to be reasons to explain the outcomes our fictitious applicants  experienced. For example, in the case of the applicant who passed online  identity proofing (described earlier), the eligibility system may still have  been able to generate identity-proofing security questions even if our  applicant\u2019s identity was fictitious, the officials told us. This could be  possible through use of probable or likely matching criteria, rather than  exact matching of the phony applicant information, officials explained.  That is, the system that seeks to identify a person and then generate  corresponding security questions may have made a match based on  some applicant information, rather than on a one-for-one match with  information the applicant provided. The federal Marketplace uses a risk- based system for applicant identification, CMS officials told us, based on  the preponderance of data available, as opposed to a single identity  element. Because there is no universal source for applicant information,  the risk-based approach is best, they said. Meanwhile, the identity- proofing process used in online applications is not used in the telephone  application process, the officials said. This is due in part to resource  limits, CMS officials told us, but is chiefly attributable to a policy decision  that call center representatives not have access to applicants\u2019 credit  histories, in order to protect personally identifiable information.", "Likewise, according to CMS officials, some of our applicants\u2019 treatment  could likely be explained by an extension of document-submission  deadlines granted by the Marketplace. CMS regulations authorize the  Marketplace to extend the standard 90-day inconsistency resolution  period if the applicant demonstrates a good-faith effort to obtain the  required documentation during the period. In 2014, the Marketplace had  statutory authority to extend for any reason the period to resolve  inconsistencies unrelated to citizenship or lawful presence, as well as the  good-faith-effort regulatory authority to extend the submission period for  resolving any type of inconsistency. Using its authority, the Marketplace  effectively waived document-submission requirements for many  applicants.", "For 2015 and 2016, however, the statutory authority had expired, and the  Marketplace took a different approach in implementing its good-faith-effort  regulatory authority. CMS told us as part of our 2014 testing work that use  of the good-faith-effort authority would be limited to a case-by-case basis  after 2014. Under good-faith-effort extensions for 2016, documentation  requirements are not waived, but applicants are provided additional time  to submit documents, CMS officials said.", "According to CMS officials, a good-faith-effort extension can be triggered  for these reasons:  1.  An applicant has not received standard reminder notices warning of  an unresolved inconsistency and the deadline for submitting  documentation. In such cases, a 90-day extension is provided.  2.  The Marketplace has not called the applicant to warn that he or she  needs to submit documents by the deadline. A 30-day extension is  provided.  3.  The consumer requests an extension. A 60-day extension is  provided.", "Each extension based on these factors is onetime only, the CMS officials  told us. Other than granting these extensions, the Marketplace did not  apply good-faith-effort authority in any other way for 2016 enrollment,  officials told us. CMS also did not otherwise waive, amend, or extend  verification or eligibility controls in 2016, officials told us. We asked CMS  officials for details on the number of applications that benefited from  good-faith-effort extensions for 2016, including the reason for granting the  extensions and types of inconsistencies at issue, and as of August 2016  officials had yet to respond.", "In the case of duplicate enrollments, our fictitious applicant was first  approved for subsidized coverage in the California marketplace and  then\u2014using the same identity\u2014applied and was approved for a qualified  health plan in Virginia and for Medicaid in West Virginia. When our  applicant made the Medicaid application, a federal Marketplace  representative flagged the applicant as potentially fraudulent.  Nonetheless, the applicant was told that he was eligible for coverage.  CMS officials told us they consider it highly unlikely, and thus low risk,  that individuals would apply for multiple plans for themselves, given the  cost of paying premiums on more than one plan. But they also  acknowledged they are interested in the possibility that multiple  enrollments could represent identity theft, and said they are working on  approaches to identify such situations.", "As CMS has reported to us previously, officials during this review also  said the agency is unaware of any fraud in individual consumer  applications for federal Marketplace coverage. Apart from individual- consumer-level fraud, instances have occurred in which agents or brokers  have submitted applications for people without their knowledge, for  financial gain, such as if the agent/broker is working for an organization  and is paid on commission based on the number of people enrolled, CMS  officials told us. The officials said some consumers have reported to the  agency that they have been enrolled without their knowledge. CMS  officials declined to provide other details, saying work in this area is law- enforcement sensitive. In responding to consumer complaints, CMS has  recently developed a capability for service-center representatives to direct  complaint information to a program-integrity office for investigation into  waste, fraud, or abuse, CMS officials told us. They likewise said further  details were unavailable.", "Overall, according to CMS officials, the federal Marketplace has made a  number of improvements to the eligibility and enrollment process, as well  as the process for resolving application inconsistencies. In particular,  CMS officials said the agency has focused on providing applicants with  specific details of what documentation is required, and that notices sent to  consumers have been improved. As a result, more consumers are  sending proper documentation with appropriate information in response to  Marketplace requests, and applicant inconsistencies are down. As an  illustration of improvements in document filing, CMS officials cited a 40  percent increase in the number of documents consumers have submitted  to resolve inconsistencies.", "According to CMS officials, the Marketplace has also relaxed the income- inconsistency resolution-threshold standard beginning with applications  for 2016 coverage. Under this change, the acceptable variance for  applicants submitting documentation to resolve income inconsistences  has increased, and the inconsistency can be resolved if the new income  information meets one of two standards. First, there can now be up to a  25 percent difference, up from 20 percent, between what an applicant  initially reported in income and the amount submitted later when providing  income documentation to resolve an income inconsistency, for that  inconsistency to be officially resolved. Or second, he or she can resolve  the inconsistency if the income difference is within $6,000. CMS officials  said the federal Marketplace made the change in recognition that many  applicants experience variations in earnings, making it hard to project  income. They said that for lower-income households a small difference in  income, measured in dollars, can result in a large percentage change.", "In the case of our Medicaid application, as noted, we applied through the  federal Marketplace and were told our applicant may be eligible for  Medicaid and that the West Virginia state Medicaid agency would contact  us with a final determination. When we later called the West Virginia state  Medicaid agency, we were told our applicant was approved for Medicaid.  When we shared the results of our testing with West Virginia Medicaid  officials, they told us that without a specific identity for our fictitious  applicant, they could not comment authoritatively on the outcome.  However, the officials said that because our applicant was not directed to  produce any documentation, it is likely that the federal Marketplace did  not pass along any application inconsistencies, assuming the application  was processed properly. As noted, for this fictitious applicant a federal  Marketplace representative said the case would be flagged as a \u201cfraud  issue,\u201d because applicant identifying information was already present in  the Marketplace system. However, West Virginia officials said the  Marketplace does not pass along to the state any information suggesting  fraud.", "The West Virginia officials told us that this experience illustrates why the  federal Marketplace should make a greater effort to verify identity before  sending Medicaid applicant information to the state. West Virginia is a  \u201cdetermination state,\u201d meaning it delegates eligibility determinations to the  federal Marketplace. That underscores the importance of the federal  Marketplace making accurate determinations, the officials said. The  officials told us West Virginia\u2019s experience with Medicaid applicant data  from the federal Marketplace has been that for 2014, the first coverage  year for the program, data quality was not good overall. For example, the  state would receive applicant information showing income exceeding  Medicaid limits; or, the state would not receive Medicaid application  information that should have passed from the federal Marketplace to the  state. But since the first year, data quality has improved significantly, the  officials said, although quality issues such as blank data fields or incorrect  Social Security numbers remain. Data quality is important because if  applicant information cannot be verified electronically, a Medicaid case  worker must review it manually, the officials said. Had our West Virginia  Medicaid applicant been directed to send documentation, a case worker  would have examined it with the level of scrutiny applied varying  according to the particular situation, the officials told us."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Officials, State Marketplace Outcomes Also Appear to Be as Expected", "paragraphs": ["Although Covered California officials also told us that without specific  identities they could not comment on individual outcomes, in general they  said the results of our undercover testing indicate their marketplace  processes worked as designed. For example, they said, when our  applicants could not clear online identity proofing and contacted Covered  California representatives by phone, the representatives were correct in  first seeking to direct the applicants to visit enrollment counselors, so they  could verify identities in person. While in-person presentation of identity  documentation is never required, the officials said, an in-person visit  provides an opportunity to examine identity documents. When our  applicants indicated they would have difficulty in doing so, the  representatives were also correct in offering the opportunity to file a paper  application, the officials said. Likewise, applicants were treated correctly  in being granted eligibility with the directive to provide supporting  documentation.", "The state officials noted that under PPACA the marketplace is required to  accept paper applications. While our applicants could not establish their  identity through the standard online process, the officials said, they could  file a paper application in which the signature on the paper application is  done under penalty of perjury. The same paper process is available for  those originally applying by telephone, they said. Obtaining an eligibility  determination then becomes possible\u2014an option precluded by failure to  confirm an identity in the online process, the officials said. The state  marketplace does not have any information on the extent to which the  threat of a penalty for perjury actually compels applicants to provide  truthful answers.", "Like the federal Marketplace, Covered California made use of a good- faith-effort extension policy for applicant documentation. According to  state officials, consumers must affirmatively request such an extension by  contacting the state marketplace. They can be granted a maximum of 60  additional days to file required documentation, beyond the 90-day period  initially provided. According to the officials, there has been a low volume  of such requests\u2014about 10 percent to 15 percent of consumers required  to submit documentation to retain coverage.", "Covered California officials also told us they have eased documentation  requirements in several other ways:  Income: Covered California is not taking steps to resolve income  inconsistencies.  Even though it requested applicants to submit  income documentation, it is not taking action in cases in which they do  not. The reason is a policy decision that the issue of whether amount  of subsidies received was proper will be addressed through the tax  reconciliation process. The marketplace provides consumers with  multiple notices, alerting them to possible tax consequences of  income inconsistencies, officials said. In addition, Covered California  decided to give higher priority to other inconsistencies that can lead to  termination of coverage, such as citizenship / lawful presence, rather  than adjustment of subsidies, they said. We note that under PPACA,  even if reconciliation is made, the amount of excess APTC that can be  recovered can be limited, based on household income and tax-filing  status. CSR subsidies, however, are not subject to reconciliation.", "Minimum essential coverage: The marketplace is not taking action to  verify applicants\u2019 claims that they do not have access to \u201cminimum  essential coverage\u201d and hence can apply for subsidized coverage  through the marketplace. While important, such cases account for a  very low percentage of all applications, the officials said.", "Incarceration: Rather than rely on documentation, the marketplace  accepts applicant attestation on incarceration status. Under PPACA,  those who are incarcerated are not eligible for coverage, unless they  are incarcerated awaiting disposition of charges. The officials said  they did not have information on the number of such attestations  provided.", "Otherwise, Covered California officials told us the state marketplace has  made a number of improvements. In May 2016, it implemented a system  check to guard against use of impossible Social Security numbers; we  used such numbers in our 2015 undercover testing, which included  California. The marketplace is more consistently reminding people when  documents are due and warning of loss of coverage if the material is not  provided, they said. Consumer notices overall are more readable,  following work with focus groups, according to the officials, and efforts are  under way to address cases in which applicant-supplied Social Security  numbers cannot be verified through the data hub. Such applicants, too,  are being warned about loss of subsidy or coverage.", "On the issue of identity theft and duplicate enrollment, Covered California  officials said that while it can check the state marketplace\u2019s own records it  would be helpful if CMS could supply data on those obtaining plans  through the federal Marketplace. That way the state marketplace could  check those obtaining coverage against coverage obtained elsewhere."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "All But One of Our Fictitious Enrollees Maintained Subsidized Coverage, Even Though We Sent Fictitious Documents, or No Documents, to Resolve Application Inconsistencies", "paragraphs": ["We retained subsidized coverage for 10 of the 11 qualified-health-plan  applicants through August 2016, even though supporting documentation  we submitted was fictitious, and in some cases we submitted none or only  some of the documentation we were directed to send.", "As noted, we focused our testing on 12 fictitious applicants.

A representative told our applicant that  the applicant needed to submit documentation on citizenship status and  Social Security number. However, our applicant told the representative  that the applicant had a name change, and provided the former name.  The representative appeared to enter this information into the  Marketplace system before saying the documentation issues had been  cleared, and no other information was required. The information our  applicant provided over the phone, however, did not match  documentation our applicant had filed previously. Without a specific  identity, CMS officials could not say conclusively what happened with our  application.

A subsequent Marketplace  notice in early 2016, however, omitted that directive. We believe this  could be confusing to an applicant. Further, to the extent it might  cause an applicant to not submit necessary documentation, the  discrepancy could lead to loss of coverage. CMS officials told us that  the Marketplace initially requests a Social Security number, because  having a Social Security number can help to clear other  inconsistencies. The Marketplace does not, however, make it a  practice to resolve Social Security inconsistencies alone. In another  of our applications involving Social Security identity, a Marketplace  representative noted a discrepancy with our applicant\u2019s Social  Security number, and inquired about the possibility of identity theft.  Based on our applicant\u2019s assurances, however, the representative  cleared the discrepancy and made no request for the applicant\u2019s  Social Security card.", "In some cases, our applicants presented identical information, but  marketplace handling of their applications was different. For example,  in each of two federal Marketplace applicant scenarios, we claimed to  be lawfully present and with income at a level qualifying for a subsidy.  In each case, we were directed to provide proof of immigration status  and income, and in both cases, we did not provide any  documentation. In one case we lost coverage, while in the other we  retained it.", "As noted, we elected not to continue testing with three scenarios after  encountering premium-payment issues. Even though our coverage  was canceled in these cases, we continued to receive marketplace  notices directing us to provide supporting documentation or risk losing  coverage. Such a situation could cause consumer confusion. CMS  officials told us this practice is by design, because if consumers  reapply later, they would still need to resolve inconsistencies  previously identified.", "As noted in the case of our one successful Medicaid application, we were  not directed to submit any supporting documentation.", "In discussing these outcomes for our fictitious applicants, federal and  state marketplace officials reaffirmed, as we have reported previously,  that the marketplaces do not seek to identify fraudulent document  submissions. Federal Marketplace officials said document-review  standards\u2014in which CMS\u2019s documents-processing contractor is not  required to examine documents for fraud\u2014remain unchanged. Unless  documents show signs of being visibly altered, they are accepted as  authentic. Covered California officials likewise told us marketplace  service-center representatives do not authenticate documents. As with  the federal Marketplace, the standard for review is visible alteration and  whether a document presented appears as it should be; that is, for  example, that a permanent-resident card submitted conforms to  established design of such a card. If documents do look suspicious, they  can be referred to a consumer-protection office for investigation, the  officials said. Thus far, the office has not received any such referrals, they  said.", "In addition, as noted earlier, federal officials cited good-faith-effort  extensions as possibly contributing to our outcomes.

Our testing covered both  individual health-care plans and Medicaid, with a portion focusing on a  requirement that applicants who previously received advance payment of  tax credits to subsidize their monthly premium payments must file federal  income-tax returns and account for those credits, in order to continue  receiving subsidies in future years.", "To perform our undercover testing of the application, enrollment, and  eligibility-verification process for the 2016 open enrollment season\u2014 which ran from November 1, 2015, to January 31, 2016\u2014we used  fictitious identities for the purpose of making 15 applications. Specifically,  we made 14 applications for individual plans, and 1 application for  Medicaid. In these 15 applicant scenarios, we chose to test controls for  verifications related to the following:  1.  Whether applicants had made required income-tax filings. We made  six such fictitious applications. For qualifying applicants, the act  provides two possible forms of subsidies for consumers enrolling in  individual health plans, both of which are generally paid directly to  insurers on consumers\u2019 behalf. One is a federal income-tax credit,  which enrollees may elect to receive in advance, which reduces a  consumer\u2019s monthly premium payment. This is known as the  advance premium tax credit. If an applicant chooses to have all or  some of his or her credit paid in advance, the applicant is required to  \u201creconcile\u201d on his or her federal income-tax return the amount of  advance payments the government sent to the applicant\u2019s insurer on  the applicant\u2019s behalf with the tax credit for which the applicant  qualifies based on actual reported income and family size. Our group  of six fictitious applicants tested this reconciliation requirement.  2.  The identity or citizenship/immigration status of the applicant, or  whether the applicant had sought enrollment in multiple plans. We  made nine such fictitious applications.", "In general, our testing approach allowed us to test similar scenarios  across different states. We made 10 of our applications online initially,  and 5 by phone. In some cases, we filed paper applications, as is  permissible, after speaking with marketplace representatives. We set our  applicants\u2019 income levels at amounts eligible for subsidies provided under  the act, or to meet Medicaid eligibility requirements, as appropriate.", "Because the federal government, at the time of our review, operated a  marketplace on behalf of the state in about three-quarters of the states,  we focused our work on those states. Specifically, we selected two  states\u2014Virginia and West Virginia\u2014that elected to use the federal  Marketplace rather than operate a marketplace of their own. We selected  one additional state\u2014California\u2014that operates its own marketplace.

We also used publicly available hardware,  software, and materials to produce counterfeit or fictitious documents,  which we submitted as appropriate for our testing. In responding to  marketplace directives to submit documentation, we adopted an approach  of submitting all requested documentation in some cases, partial  documentation in other cases, or no documentation in the remaining  cases, in order to note any differences in outcomes. We observed any  approvals received, and responded as appropriate for our testing to any  directions to provide additional supporting documentation.", "Fourteen of our 15 applicant scenarios involved qualified individual health  plans. For these 14 plans, we attempted to pay the required premiums to  put policies into force. For 11 of these 14 applicants, we successfully  made premium payments. However, for three applicants, our initial  premium payments\u2014made to insurers we selected\u2014were unsuccessful,  and we were unable to resolve the issue. While we believed we had  received confirmation of premium payments, insurers said payments were  not received on a timely basis.
