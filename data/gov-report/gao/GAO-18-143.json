FEMA provides PA grants to state and local governments to help communities recover from such disasters. If applicants disagree with FEMA's decision on their PA grant application, they have two chances to appeal: a first-level appeal to be decided by the relevant FEMA regional office and, if denied, a second-level appeal to be decided within FEMA's Recovery Directorate. Each is subject to a 90-day statutory processing timeframe.", "GAO was asked to review FEMA's appeals process. This report examines: (1) the extent to which FEMA ensures the quality of its appeals data and what these data show about PA appeals inventory and timeliness; (2) what steps FEMA has taken to improve its management of the appeals process and what challenges, if any, remain; and (3) the extent to which FEMA developed goals and measures to assess program performance. GAO analyzed FEMA policies, procedures, and data on appeals and interviewed officials from headquarters and from regional offices with the highest number of pending appeals. GAO also spoke to state officials from the two states within each of the three regions with the highest number of pending appeals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in the quality of Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) appeals data limit its ability to oversee the appeals process. For example, FEMA's data are inaccurate and incomplete because regional offices do not consistently track first-level appeals and FEMA does not have processes to ensure data quality. When GAO discussed these weaknesses with FEMA officials, they acknowledged them and provided GAO with corrected data for January 2014 through July 2017. GAO's analyses of the corrected data show fluctuations in the appeal inventory from year to year depending on the number of disasters declared and delays in processing. For example, as shown in the figure, only 9 percent of first-level and 11 percent of second-level appeals were processed within the 90-day statutory timeframe.", "FEMA has taken steps to improve its management of the appeals process\u2014including issues that GAO and the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General identified in 2008 and 2011. For example, FEMA increased its appeal staffing levels and developed standard operating procedures. Despite these efforts, FEMA continued to face a number of workforce challenges that contributed to processing delays, such as staff vacancies, staff turnover, and delays in training. FEMA has not developed a workforce staffing plan to identify hiring, training, and retention needs across its headquarters and regional offices, though FEMA officials acknowledge the potential benefits of having such a plan and stated that they are focused on filling vacancies. In the absence of a workforce plan, FEMA will continue to experience workforce challenges that could further contribute to delays in processing appeals.", "FEMA has not established goals and measures for assessing first-level appeals processing performance, but has done so for second-level appeals. FEMA views establishing these first-level goals and measures as the responsibility of its regional offices. Without goals and measures, FEMA is limited in its ability to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of its overall appeals process and identify and address weaknesses that may lead to delays in making appeal decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that FEMA implement a consistent approach for tracking appeals and ensuring data quality, develop a workforce plan, and develop measurable goals for processing first-level appeals.

For the  communities that have been affected by these disasters, critical aspects  of response and recovery, such as removing debris, and rebuilding the  infrastructure of state and local schools, roads, and utilities, may take  years. The damage from such disasters points to the strains on state and  local resources in both response and recovery, especially in the event of  back-to-back catastrophic disasters, such as those witnessed during the  2017 hurricane season.", "Each year, the federal government obligates billions of dollars through  programs and activities that provide assistance to state, local, territorial,  and tribal governments; individuals; and certain nonprofit organizations  that have suffered injury or damages from major disasters or emergency  incidents, such as hurricanes, tornados, and fires. We recently reported  that, from fiscal years 2005 through 2014, the federal government  obligated at least $277.6 billion in disaster assistance through a range of  programs. One such program, Public Assistance (PA), provides grants to  state, local, territorial, and tribal governments and certain nonprofit  organizations following a disaster. Administered through the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), PA provides financial  assistance for debris removal; emergency protective measures; and the  repair, replacement, or restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned  facilities, and the facilities of certain private nonprofit organizations. From fiscal years 2009 through 2016, FEMA obligated more than $36 billion in  grants for such projects.", "As in the case of many federal grant programs, FEMA provides PA funds  to a state recipient which, in turn, passes these funds along to a local  entity, based on an application for assistance. Applicants who request  disaster assistance through the PA program are entitled to appeal any  decision regarding how FEMA determined their eligibility for PA grant  funds, including obligated amounts of PA funding. FEMA can also  deobligate PA funding when it finds, for example, that ineligible work was  performed, incurred costs were later deemed unreasonable, or improper  procurement methods were used. Applicants can also appeal decisions  resulting from FEMA audits of PA projects, even after a project has been  completed and closed as long as the appeal is filed in a timely manner.", "To appeal a decision, applicants are afforded two opportunities: (1) a first- level appeal to the relevant FEMA regional office to be decided by the  Regional Administrator and (2) a second-level appeal to be decided at  FEMA headquarters by the Assistant Administrator for the Recovery  Directorate or the PA Division Director through a delegation of authority.  FEMA regulations implement the statutory time frames for applicants to  file an appeal, for the state to transmit the appeal to FEMA, and for FEMA  to respond to the appeal.", "We and the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have identified a  number of issues related to FEMA\u2019s PA program, including its PA appeals  process. For example, in 2008, as part of our review of FEMA\u2019s  administration of the PA program, we found that, following Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita, FEMA often did not make decisions on applicant  appeals within statutorily required time frames. In 2011, the DHS OIG  also identified areas for improvement in the PA appeals process,  including the timeliness of processing an appeal and communicating with  applicants about the status of their appeals. In 2013, FEMA stood up the  Public Assistance Appeals Branch (PAAB) within the Office of the  Recovery Directorate in an effort to respond to these concerns, adding an  auditing component to the Branch in 2014.", "You asked us to review aspects of FEMA\u2019s management of the PA  appeals process.

We focused on this time frame because it  contained the most complete and available data at the time of our review.  We identified various discrepancies in the first-level appeal data, which  we discussed with knowledgeable FEMA staff and present later in this  report. In response to our discussions, FEMA provided us with corrected  data to address the identified discrepancies. After obtaining the corrected  data and making adjustments to our analysis based on our discussions  with FEMA officials, we determined that the appeals data from FEMA  were sufficiently reliable to provide information on PA appeals, including  appeals inventories, outcomes, amounts in dispute, and processing times  that we present in this report. We also obtained and analyzed FEMA  policies and procedures related to tracking appeals data, including those  related to regional offices, and evaluated them using Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To address the first and second objectives, we also administered  semistructured interviews to officials from 3 of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices  (Regions II, IV, and VI) with the highest number of first- and second-level  pending appeals. We asked these officials about their efforts to process  and track appeals, what improvements had been made regarding how PA  appeals are processed, as well as any challenges they have faced in  processing PA appeals since 2013.To select these offices, we obtained  data from FEMA on first- and second-level appeals that were pending a  decision, as of October 31, 2016. Collectively, appeals from these 3  regional offices represented 69 percent of all pending first-and second- level appeals FEMA had received as of October 31, 2016. We focused on  this time frame because it contained the most recent data for our  selection of FEMA regional offices at the time we began our review. To  obtain additional perspective on what, if any, challenges remain in  FEMA\u2019s management of the appeals process, we also interviewed state  emergency management officials in six states (two states in each of the  corresponding 3 FEMA regional offices.) (See figure 1.)", "To additionally address the second objective, we reviewed FEMA  documentation, such as standard operating procedures (SOP) and  policies, directives, internal staffing requests, appeals analyst position  descriptions, and other internal memoranda. We used these sources to  identify what steps FEMA had taken to improve its management of the  appeals process since 2013. We also used this information to supplement  our understanding of the challenges FEMA, including its regional officials,  raised during our interviews discussed above.", "To address the third objective, we obtained FEMA internal reports\u2014 including briefs and newsletters\u2014and performance plans to identify goals  and measures FEMA had developed to assess the appeals program. We  assessed that information against federal internal control standards and  leading practices we have identified in our prior work for managing for  results to determine the extent to which FEMA had developed goals and  measures to assess program performance.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed relevant legislation and interviewed  officials in PAAB and FEMA\u2019s Recovery Directorate.

One of the principal programs that FEMA operates to  fulfill its role is the PA program. PA is a complex and multistep grant  program administered through a partnership between FEMA and states,  which pass these funds along to eligible local grant applicants. Thus, PA  entails an extensive paperwork and review process between FEMA and  the state based on specific eligibility rules that outline the types of  damage that can be reimbursed by the federal government and steps that  federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal governments as well as certain  nonprofit organizations must take in order to document eligibility. The  complexity of the process led FEMA to re-engineer the PA program,  which FEMA has referred to as its \u201cnew delivery model.\u201d FEMA began  testing the new delivery model at select disaster locations in 2015, in  preparation for implementing it nationwide for all new disasters. On  September 12, 2017, FEMA announced that the new delivery model  would be used in all future disasters unless determined infeasible in a  particular instance.", "The process begins after FEMA determines that the applicant meets  eligibility requirements.

The PA appeals process can take longer if regional officials issue  a request for information (RFI) to the applicant or request technical advice  from subject-matter experts. According to a senior PAAB official, a  regional office may issue an RFI or seek technical advice when an  applicant\u2019s appeal is incomplete, lacks referenced documentation, or  raises additional eligibility concerns. The regional office may issue  multiple RFIs prior to rendering a final decision on an appeal. Within 90  days following the receipt of the requested additional information or  following expiration of the period for providing the information, FEMA is to  notify the state in writing of the disposition of the appeal.", "Regional Administrators are responsible for authorizing a final decision on  a first-level appeal. A decision may result in an appeal being granted,  partially granted, or denied. An appeal is considered granted when FEMA  has approved the relief requested by the applicant as part of the appeal.  An appeal is considered partially granted when FEMA has approved a  portion of the relief requested by the applicant. An appeal is considered  denied when FEMA has decided not to approve the relief requested by  the applicant. If the regional office is considering denying or partially  granting a first appeal, it must issue an RFI to provide applicants with a  final opportunity to supplement the administrative record (i.e., the  documents and materials considered in processing a first-level appeal),  which closes upon issuing a first-level appeal decision. According to a  senior PAAB official, this process adds additional time to first-level appeal  processing, but ensures that FEMA has considered all relevant and  applicable documentation. The applicant may file a second-level appeal  through the state within 60 days of receiving a first-level appeal decision.  The second-level appeal must explain why the applicant believes the  original determination is inconsistent with law or policy and the monetary  amount in dispute. The state then has 60 days to provide a written  recommendation to FEMA.

As is the case with first-level appeals, the PA  appeals process can take longer if PAAB officials request additional  information or technical advice on an appeal. These requests must also  include a date by which the information must be provided. According to a  senior PAAB official, RFIs are seldom issued for second-level appeals  because the administrative record is closed after a decision is rendered  on a first-level appeal. Similarly, this official told us that technical advice is  rarely sought for second-level appeals because such issues are typically  explored during the first-level appeal process.

Other challenges identified were that FEMA did not inform some  applicants of the status of their appeal, or, in some cases, assure them of  the independence of the FEMA officials making appeal decisions.  Specifically, some applicants perceived there to be a conflict of interest  because the PA program staff responsible for reviewing appeals was the  same staff that had made the PA project decision that was being  appealed.

As in our 2008 review, the  OIG identified appeal processing delays occurring at both FEMA regional  offices and at headquarters. For example, the report found that appeals  were left open for long periods of time and that some regional offices as  well as FEMA headquarters took more than 90 days to issue a decision  on first- and second-level appeals. Further, the OIG review found that  staffing approaches employed by individual regional offices contributed to  processing delays and varying processing timeframes. For example, the  management and processing of first-level appeals varied by FEMA  regional office in that some regional offices assigned staff specifically to  review appeals, while other offices assigned staff to appeals processing  as part of their other responsibilities within the PA Program, such as  determining eligibility for PA assistance. Further, second-level appeals  were processed by various offices within FEMA headquarters, and FEMA  had not established guidelines to complete work within a specific  timeframe.", "Moreover, the OIG review found inaccuracies with FEMA\u2019s system for  tracking appeal processing times for second-level appeals, resulting in  unreliable information being reported to FEMA management regarding  compliance with the 90-day statutory time frame.

Specifically, FEMA granted about 26 percent of second-level appeals  filed, awarding over $43 million, while the agency partially granted about  7 percent of second-level appeals filed, involving amounts in dispute  totaling almost $19 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Exceeded Statutory Processing Times", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of the corrected FEMA appeal data showed that, on  average, FEMA took more than three times the 90-day statutory time  frame to process an appeal, which includes rendering a decision.", "Specifically, for first- and second-level appeals that FEMA received  between January 2014 and July 2017 and that FEMA decided during the  same period, FEMA\u2019s average processing time was 297 days. The  processing time for decided first-level appeals averaged 293 days, while  the processing time for decided second-level appeals averaged 313 days.  Further, as shown in figure 6, only a small percentage of decided first-and  second-level appeals (9 and 11 percent, respectively) were processed  within the 90-day statutory time frame.", "For pending appeals, we found that, at the time of our analysis in July  2017, FEMA had taken on average, more than three times the 90-day  statutory time frame for rendering decisions.

Figure 7 shows the ranges of processing times as of July 2017 for both  first-and second level pending appeals.", "Officials from PAAB and the three regional offices in our review  acknowledged that they experienced challenges processing appeals  within the 90-day statutory time frame. They told us that issuing RFIs to  the applicant can contribute to lengthy processing delays. According to  PAAB officials, issuing an RFI may contribute to long processing periods  if the information relates to a complex appeal\u2014for example, an appeal  involving multiple engineering issues. An appeal decision can also be  delayed if FEMA issues an RFI because an applicant submitted  incomplete documentation to support an appeal. Under FEMA regulation,  these requests do not count against processing times and the 90-day  time frame in which FEMA can render a decision on an appeal.", "However, our analysis of the corrected FEMA data showed that FEMA  exceeded its statutory time frames even when it did not issue an RFI.", "Specifically, between January 2014 and July 2017, FEMA issued an RFI  in about 59 percent\u2014or 560\u2014of the 953 first- and second-level appeals  for which it rendered a decision. In 48 percent (267) of those decided  appeals, FEMA had issued the RFI after the 90-day time frame had  elapsed. FEMA did not issue RFIs for about 41 percent (393) of decided  first- and second-level appeals. In 78 percent (305) of those appeals,  FEMA\u2019s processing time still exceeded the 90-day statutory time frame.", "State emergency management officials from five of our six selected states  told us that they experienced long wait times for first- and second-level  appeal decisions and that FEMA rarely processed appeals within the 90- day time frame required by statute. State emergency management  officials further told us that such delays adversely affect applicants, such  as municipalities and localities, which may wait prolonged periods to  resolve project eligibility and costs related to rebuilding efforts. Delays in  FEMA\u2019s decision making may also result in additional costs to both the  state and the applicant, according to these officials. For example, the  state may pursue funding from an applicant if FEMA decides to  deobligate funds from the applicant for PA projects that have already  been completed. As discussed earlier in this report with respect to the  PA process, FEMA may do this if it finds that the applicant did not meet  certain PA project requirements. In these instances, the applicant may  appeal FEMA\u2019s decision, but the state may need to begin administrative  proceedings against the applicant to recover or offset the deobligated  funds. One state emergency manager told us that some applicants  withdrew their appeals because of the prolonged delays in receiving a  final decision.", "According to state emergency management officials, delays in FEMA\u2019s  appeal decisions can create significant challenges for local government  entities, such as counties and school districts. Officials from one state  provided an example of a rural school district that sought PA funding to  bus displaced children who had been left homeless from damage caused  by Hurricane Irene. According to relevant federal and state documents  these officials provided us, these children had been moved to shelters  outside of their school district and needed transportation to be able to  attend school. The school district applied to FEMA for transportation  costs associated with hiring an additional bus driver to bus the children to  the schools in the district. FEMA denied the school district\u2019s request,  based on its interpretation of the Stafford Act and the eligibility of costs  related to emergency public transportation. The district subsequently filed  a first-level appeal in November 2015. FEMA took over a year to issue a  decision and, in December 2016, denied the district\u2019s first-level appeal.  State management officials told us that incurring these unanticipated  transportation costs while waiting for FEMA to decide the appeal has a  major effect on the school district and the community as a whole, and can  lead to the elimination of school programs or staff. The school district  subsequently filed a second-level appeal in February 2017. FEMA denied  the appeal in August 2017.", "State emergency management officials we interviewed provided an  additional example wherein a small town had applied for PA grant funding  to rebuild a retaining wall and roadway following damage caused by  Hurricane Irene. According to relevant federal and state documents  officials provided us, the overflowing banks of a tributary caused a  retaining wall, which protected a nearby roadway, to wash away. The  roadway, which provided access to residential properties near the  tributary, was significantly damaged, due to the overflow. The town  requested funding to repair the roadway and to replace and extend the  retaining wall another 250 feet beyond the original wall in order to protect  the roadway from future flood events. FEMA approved the PA funding to  repair the roadway. However, FEMA denied the town\u2019s application for PA  assistance to extend the wall beyond its original length. In doing so,  FEMA concluded that the proposed work was ineligible for assistance  because it significantly changed the retaining wall\u2019s predisaster  configuration and that such a change constituted an improved project,  making it ineligible under FEMA regulations and policy. The town then  filed a first-level appeal in April 2014. More than 2 years later\u2014in June  2016\u2014FEMA denied the town\u2019s first-level appeal, upholding FEMA\u2019s  original determination. The town subsequently filed a second-level appeal  in September 2016. Over a year later, PAAB was still reviewing the  appeal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Taken Steps to Improve Appeals Processing, but Faces Challenges with Its Appeals Workforce", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has taken a number of steps to improve its management of the  appeals process and respond to issues raised by us and the DHS OIG  related to processing delays. As we presented earlier in this report, our  2008 review, and DHS\u2019s subsequent 2011 OIG review, identified a  number of organizational and procedural issues related to processing  delays, staff independence, and communications with applicants.  Responding to these issues, FEMA created the PAAB within the  Recovery Directorate at FEMA Headquarters in late 2013, adding an  auditing component to the Branch in 2014. PAAB then established a  core of full-time staff at FEMA headquarters that were specifically  assigned to process second-level appeals. At the same time, through the  Recovery Directorate, each of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices was assigned  full-time staff for processing first-level appeals. Prior to PAAB, second- level appeals were processed by various offices within FEMA  headquarters, while the management and processing of first-level  appeals varied by FEMA regional office. Some regional offices assigned  staff specifically to review appeals, while other offices assigned staff to  appeal processing as part of their other responsibilities within the PA  Program, such as determining eligibility for PA assistance.", "In standing up PAAB, FEMA also established an SOP that describes the  organizational structure of PAAB, as well as its responsibilities and the  roles of its staff. The SOP also addresses procedures related to PAAB\u2019s  responsibility for managing the entire PA appeals program. These  responsibilities include reporting on appeal processing performance,  providing training to appeals staff, and identifying PA appeal process and  policy improvements. FEMA later issued a regional SOP that included  procedures to help regional offices reduce the number of appeals that  exceeded statutory time frames. These procedures reflected an ongoing  effort to leverage internal resources when regional offices exceed processing capacity. Specifically, a regional office can submit a request to  PAAB for assistance from analyst staff from other regions or from PAAB  to assist with processing first-level appeals. PAAB may then temporarily  assign an appeals analyst from PAAB or from another regional office to  assist the regional office making the request. For example, one regional  office official told us his office had requested assistance with 10 first-level  appeals and PAAB was able to accommodate the request by assigning 8  of the 10 appeals to another region for processing. According to a senior  PAAB official, this procedure allows FEMA to maximize use of its national  appeal processing capacity. As of October 2017, PAAB had transferred  77 appeals from overwhelmed regional offices to those with capacity to  process additional appeals.", "Further, FEMA procedures now require that a conflict check be performed  to determine whether the analyst was involved with a PA project  determination that is substantively related to the appeal. If a conflict is  identified, options include disqualifying the appeals analyst from working  on the appeal, or requesting the appeal be transferred to another regional  office or PAAB for processing. State emergency management officials  from five of the six states in our review told us that they believed that  issues related to the independence of appeals staff had been addressed  and were no longer an issue.", "PAAB also took steps to improve communication with applicants by  creating an online second-level appeal tracking spreadsheet\u2014accessible  through the Internet\u2014intended to provide applicants with information on  the status of second-level appeals. The spreadsheet includes, among  other things, the date the appeal was received by FEMA headquarters,  the date that an RFI was sent to the applicant, whether the appeal was  \u201cunder review,\u201d whether a final decision had been granted, and the date  any final decision was signed.", "FEMA also took steps to increase its staffing levels. In January 2015,  FEMA\u2019s Recovery Directorate completed a workforce analysis and  determined that additional appeals analysts were needed to address  capacity issues that were resulting in growing inventories of first-level  appeals. At the time, FEMA concluded that, in addition to its 23 on-board  appeals analysts, an additional 29 appeals analysts were needed to  support the existing, as well as anticipated, appeal inventory increases  across FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices. The Recovery Directorate requested  and was subsequently authorized the additional appeals analyst  positions, which, when filled, would provide the PA appeal program with a  total of 52 first-level appeals analysts. With the exception of Region I,  FEMA planned to provide each of the remaining 9 regional offices with at  least 1 additional appeals analyst. Regional offices with the heaviest  workloads, such as Region II and Region IV, would be allocated more  appeals analysts. FEMA took steps to fill these positions over the next 2  years, and by June 2017, FEMA had filled 47 of the 52 positions.", "Despite efforts to improve its management of the appeals process, FEMA  faces a backlog of both first- and second-level appeals among the three  selected FEMA regional offices as well as PAAB. According to officials in  PAAB and the three regional offices in our review, workforce challenges  contribute to delays in processing PA appeals, even with the  improvements described above.", "PAAB and the three regional offices in our review identified the following  workforce challenges that contributed to PA appeal processing delays.", "Staff vacancies, inexperience, and turnover: Despite FEMA\u2019s  efforts to increase its appeals analyst staffing level\u2014an effort that  began in 2015\u2014two of the three regional offices in our review had  a number of vacancies for these positions through June 2017.  PAAB and regional officials told us that such vacancies, which  occurred over a prolonged period, contributed to appeal  processing delays.", "FEMA data on appeals analyst staffing show that FEMA took  nearly 2 years to fill the additional appeals analyst positions  across its 10 regional offices. For example, in 1 of the regional  offices in our review, 3 of the 8 appeals analyst positions were  vacant through 2016 and were not filled until July 2017. Further,  officials in this regional office told us that the current staffing level  of 8 appeals analysts was inadequate to keep pace with the  region\u2019s increasing appeal inventory. Similarly, 6 of PAAB\u2019s 11  appeals analyst positions were vacant from August 2015 to  October 2016. By July 2017, PAAB had filled all but 2 appeals  analyst positions. PAAB officials told us the appeals analyst  staffing level consisting of 52 positions was a preliminary estimate  and that this staffing level has not been adequate in regions with  heavy workloads and appeal inventories. PAAB officials also  acknowledged the potential benefits of having an appeals analyst  staffing plan, but stated that they are not yet prepared to update  the workforce assessment for PAAB and the regional offices, nor  do they have plans to do so until full staffing is achieved. These  officials also told us that they are still working to achieve the  staffing levels developed in 2015 and are taking steps to address  staffing challenges through more targeted hiring and use of career  ladder positions.", "Further, PAAB staffing data showed that almost half of PAAB\u2019s  staff had less than 1 year of experience. PAAB officials told us  that prior vacancies and a large number of inexperienced staff  have contributed to processing delays and second-level appeal  backlogs. PAAB officials also told us that retaining trained appeals  analysts has been challenging due to limited career advancement  opportunities within the appeals analyst position. These officials  told us that although not required, individuals who typically apply  for an appeals analyst position possess a law degree, and that  once hired, some of them apply for attorney positions within PAAB  or in various offices within FEMA or DHS. For example, PAAB  staffing data showed that within 18 months of being hired by  PAAB, four PAAB appeals analysts applied for and were  subsequently hired as attorney-advisors within PAAB or other  FEMA departments. Then those appeals analyst positions were  vacant until the next round of hiring.", "Regional officials told us it has been challenging to find qualified  applicants with the specialized skillset of an analyst position. They  told us that, ideally, an appeals analyst should be an expert in the  PA program and possess a nuanced understanding of the legal  issues associated with the program\u2019s requirements. Regional  officials told us that, because of this specialized skillset, they look  to recruit PA appeals analysts from other FEMA regional offices  who may have an interest in relocating or are seeking a  promotion. However, while recruiting appeals analysts from other  regions may assist individual offices, it does not address FEMA\u2019s  goal of achieving its staffing levels.", "Delays in training appeals staff: FEMA requires that PA appeals  analysts undergo a certification course that includes 3 days of  training on processing appeals. The appeals analyst certification  course, delivered through PAAB, covers both procedural steps of  processing appeals as well as the policy and legal issues raised  by the PA program, and ensures that trainees can prepare a well- written appeal response. After completing the course, an analyst  in training must pass a test to demonstrate proficiency in  reviewing and analyzing appeals and preparing appeal decisions.  To this end, the analyst must analyze a mock appeal\u2014based on  facts similar to those presented in a previously decided appeal\u2014 and draft an appeal decision.", "FEMA policy states that only certified staff can serve as appeals  analysts and must be recertified every 2 years. However, some  appeals analysts in the regional offices in our review had not yet  undergone the certification process, but were nonetheless working  in an appeals analyst capacity under the supervision of certified  analysts. PAAB procedures also state that a trainee analyst  cannot assume work on an appeal without being supervised by a  certified analyst. For example, in one regional office, four of the  office\u2019s nine appeals analysts had been working in their positions  for between 6 months to a year before they received appeals  analyst certification training. According to regional officials, this  increased the supervisory workload on the remaining five appeals  analysts within the region and the lack of timely training and  certification of appeals analysts affect the efficient processing of  appeals and can lead to delays in FEMA issuing appeal decisions.", "Deployment of appeals staff to disaster response: According  to PAAB officials, while PA appeals analysts are considered  \u201cdedicated\u201d positions, these analysts can be deployed at any time  to provide assistance on a disaster, such as working with grant  applicants to document damages or assisting applicants in  developing project proposals to request PA grants. Officials from  two of the three FEMA regional offices in our review told us that  these deployments contributed to processing delays because,  given limited resources, assigning staff to continue work on the  appeal is not always possible. In one regional office, five of the  nine PA appeals analysts were deployed in late 2016 to do  recovery work related to damage from Hurricane Matthew. These  deployments lasted approximately 30 to 90 days and left the  regional office understaffed. Further, one regional office official  told us that maintaining continuity in processing an appeal can be  difficult for those analysts who are deployed because they must  pick up where they left off on their assigned appeals upon their  return.", "A senior PAAB official told us that regional appeals analyst staff  have been deployed to assist with response and recovery efforts  as a result of the catastrophic damage from Hurricanes Harvey,  Irma, and Maria. As a result, these analysts have not been  available to process first-level appeals. This official further told us  that PAAB staff, including analyst staff\u2014while not deployed\u2014have  been assigned to support disaster operations. For example, one  staff member was assigned to support site inspector training,  while two others were assigned to stand National Response  Coordination Center watch. Further, one staff member was  assigned to support training and contract review functions and the  remaining staff members were assigned as call takers for the PA  Grants Manager and Grants Portal hotline.", "To help overcome staffing shortages, according to FEMA  documents, all three regional offices in our review staffed  assistance from PAAB at various times during the past 2 years.  However, officials from two of the three regional offices in our  review told us that, based on their experiences, requesting staff  from PAAB or other offices had a number of limitations.  Specifically, because the originating regional office is ultimately  responsible for the appeal, its staff must continue to oversee the  appeal, including such responsibilities as tracking the appeal,  corresponding with the applicant and the state as needed, and  reviewing and approving the appeal decision. One regional office  official told us that this arrangement was not helpful and only  added an additional layer of complexity that delayed processing.  Another regional official told us that the quality of the borrowed  staff\u2019s work was not consistent. This official further stated that,  because offices are not able to select the analysts that would be  assigned to work on their appeals, he was reluctant to use staff  from other regional offices.", "According to leading human capital practices, the key to an agency\u2019s  success in managing its programs is sustaining a workforce with the  necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities to execute a range of  management functions that support the agency\u2019s mission and goals.  Achieving such a workforce depends on having effective human capital  management through developing human capital strategies. Such strategic  workforce planning includes the agency assessing current and future  critical skill needs by, for example, analyzing the gaps between current  skills and future needs, and developing strategies for filling the gaps  identified in workforce skills or competencies. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government also states that agencies should  continually assess their needs so that they are able to obtain a workforce  that has the required knowledge, skills, and abilities to achieve their  organization\u2019s goals. Further, as we have previously reported in our  work on strategic workforce planning, such staffing assessments should  be based on valid and reliable data.", "However, FEMA has not developed a workforce staffing plan to identify  hiring, training, and retention needs of appeals staff across PAAB and the  regional offices. PAAB officials told us that they are still working to  achieve the staffing levels developed in 2015 and are taking steps to  address staffing challenges related to retention through more targeted  hiring and use of career ladder positions. In the absence of a workforce  plan for the PA appeals staff, FEMA will likely continue to experience  workforce challenges including vacancies in key appeals analyst  positions, appeals staff turnover, training delays, and understaffing due to  disaster deployment. These challenges will likely continue to contribute to  delays in FEMA\u2019s processing and issuing first- and second-level PA  appeals decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Established Goals and Measures to Assess Second- Level Appeal Processing, but Did Not Do So for First- Level Appeals", "paragraphs": ["FEMA officials have acknowledged the importance of establishing goals  and measures to assess the performance of the PA appeals program. In  particular, for fiscal year 2016, FEMA\u2019s Recovery Directorate established  two performance goals for PAAB\u2019s processing of second-level appeals.  The first goal was aimed at reducing the inventory of second-level  appeals by 20 percent. The second goal was aimed at processing at least  30 percent of second-level appeals received in 2016 within 90 days of  receiving the appeal, in order to comply with FEMA statutory time  frames. FEMA internal documents showed that these two performance  goals were intended to reduce the second-level appeal inventory, and, at  the same time, promote a standard of timely second-level appeal  processing for PAAB.", "According to PAAB officials, various factors beyond PAAB\u2019s control  prevented PAAB from meeting these performance goals. These factors  included an unanticipated surge in the number of second-level appeals in  2016, as well as increased vacancies due to staff turnover in PAAB  analyst positions in 2016. Recognizing these factors, PAAB developed a  revised goal that focused on the number of appeals an analyst could  process per month. According to PAAB officials, focusing the revised  goal on analyst production controlled for external factors that tended to  affect overall processing, such as surges in appeal submissions and staff  turnover. PAAB officials told us that their proposed production goal was  not accepted by the Recovery Directorate for 2016, but that PAAB  adopted the revised goal for individual performance plans for PAAB  appeals analyst staff.", "In contrast, although first-level appeals represent the majority of FEMA\u2019s  appeal inventory, FEMA has not developed goals and measures to  assess the performance of first-level appeals processing across regional  offices. PAAB collects various data from all 10 regional offices on first- level appeals, such as the number of first-level appeals being processed,  as well as processing timeliness (i.e., appeals that exceeded time limits)  and key words that can help identify various appeal subject-matter  categories. PAAB then aggregates this data, which it publishes on a  quarterly and weekly basis in internal reports that it shares with FEMA  management. However, FEMA has not established goals to assess  performance against the information that PAAB collects. According to  FEMA officials, while the Recovery Directorate established goals and  measures for second-level appeals, it is not responsible for developing  goals and measures to assess performance within the regional offices.  These officials told us further that some Regional Administrators have  established goals and measures for first-level appeals within their  regional offices, while others have not.", "For management to effectively monitor a program, Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government state that it should create goals and  measures to determine if a program is being implemented as intended. In  addition, the quality of the program\u2019s performance should be assessed  over time and monitoring efforts should be evaluated to assure they help  meet goals. Further, Congress enacted the GPRA Modernization Act of  2010 (GPRAMA) to focus and sustain attention on agency performance  and improvement by requiring that federal agencies establish outcome- oriented goals and measures to assess progress towards those goals.  Specifically, agencies, like DHS, are required to monitor progress towards  the achievement of goals, report on that progress, and address issues  identified. Without consistent performance measures across FEMA  regional offices to help assess progress and identify deficiencies in  appeals processing, DHS and its subcomponent agencies like FEMA may  have difficulty providing accurate reporting on the effectiveness of current  efforts to process first-level appeals and on the factors that contribute to  ongoing appeal processing delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although FEMA has made efforts to improve its management of the PA  appeals process, these efforts have been hampered by a number of  issues including weaknesses in FEMA\u2019s appeals tracking data and its  ability to ensure the quality of this data.

As a result, these weaknesses will persist. By  implementing procedures to consistently track appeals data and ensure  the quality of these data, FEMA will be in a better position to accurately  report on appeal processing performance and make informed decisions  about the appeals process.", "FEMA also faces a variety of workforce challenges that have contributed  to appeals processing delays. These challenges include staffing  vacancies, lack of experienced staff, high rates of staff turnover, delays in  training appeals staff, and the deployment of appeals analysts for disaster  response, all of which have contributed to processing delays. Addressing  these challenges by identifying the hiring, training, and retention needs of  its appeals offices through strategic workforce planning could help FEMA  better position itself to reduce its appeals backlog and better respond to  PA appeals.", "Further, although FEMA has established goals and measures for its  second-level appeals processing, it has not done so for first-level  appeals.

For first-level appeals, FEMA provided us  data on appeals received between January 1, 2014, and July 12, 2017,  while FEMA provided us data on second-level appeals received between  January 1, 2014, and July 6, 2017. We focused on this time frame  because it contained the most complete and available data on each type  of appeal at the time of our review. We identified various discrepancies in  the first-level appeals data, which we discussed with knowledgeable  FEMA staff. Examples of these discrepancies, which we present in this  report, included missing data, erroneous data entries, and inconsistent  recording of data. In response to our discussions, FEMA provided us with  corrected data to address the identified discrepancies. After obtaining the  corrected data, we concluded the appeals data from FEMA were  sufficiently reliable to provide information on PA appeals that we present  in this report. We also obtained and analyzed FEMA policies and  procedures related to tracking appeals data, such as FEMA\u2019s policies and  procedures related to regional offices, and evaluated them using  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "We analyzed the corrected data to determine FEMA\u2019s appeal inventory\u2014 that is, the number of first-and second-level appeals that were pending  and decided, including any amounts in dispute or amounts awarded, and  appeal outcomes for appeals that FEMA decided. From the total number  of appeals received, we excluded four second-level appeals that had  been remanded or rescinded. We determined the processing times for  first- and second-level decided appeals by calculating, for each appeal,  the number of calendar days between the date that FEMA received the  appeal and the date that FEMA rendered a decision on the appeal.", "We then calculated the average number of calendar days to determine  average processing times for first- and second-level decided appeals. We  determined the processing time for pending first-level appeals by  calculating, for each appeal, the number of calendar days between the  date FEMA received the appeal and July 12, 2017. Similarly, we  determined the processing time for pending second-level appeals by  calculating, for each appeal, the number of calendar days between the  date FEMA received the appeal and July 6, 2017. We then calculated the  average number of calendar days to determine average processing times  for pending first-and second-level appeals. We compared processing  times for first- and second-level appeals against FEMA\u2019s 90-day statutory  time frame to determine the number of calendar days by which FEMA  exceeded the time frame. We also determined the number of first- and  second-level appeals in which FEMA issued an RFI and those in which  FEMA did not issue an RFI. For the first- and second-level appeals in  which FEMA issued an RFI, we compared the date the appeal was  received to the date that FEMA issued the RFI. We used the first RFI in  cases where FEMA issued multiple RFIs. We then determined whether  FEMA had issued the RFI within 90 calendar days. For the first- and  second-level appeals in which FEMA did not issue an RFI, we compared  the date the appeal was received to the date that FEMA issued a  decision. We then determined whether FEMA had issued a decision after  90 calendar days. We also obtained and analyzed FEMA policies and  procedures and program directives governing appeal data collection and  evaluated them against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To address the first and second objectives, we also administered  semistructured interviews to officials from 3 of FEMA\u2019s 10 regional offices  (Regions II, IV, and VI) with the highest number of first- and second-level  pending appeals. We asked these officials about their efforts to process and track appeals, what improvements had been made regarding how PA  appeals are processed, as well as what challenges they believed  remained in processing PA appeals since 2013.To select these offices,  we obtained data from FEMA on first- and second-level appeals that were  pending a decision, as of October 31, 2016. Collectively, these appeals  represented 69 percent of all pending first- and second-level appeals  FEMA had received as of October 31, 2016. We focused on this time  frame because it contained the most recent data for selecting FEMA  regional offices at the time of our review. To obtain additional perspective  on what, if any, challenges remain in FEMA\u2019s management of the appeals  process, we also interviewed state emergency management officials in  six states (two states in each of the corresponding 3 FEMA regional  offices). (See table 2.)", "The information obtained from the FEMA regional offices and the state  emergency management offices cannot be generalized nationwide.  However, the information obtained from these officials provides insight  into the issues FEMA encountered during the appeal process.", "To additionally address the second objective, we reviewed our past report  and Department of Homeland Security Inspector General reports on the  PA appeals program. We also reviewed FEMA documentation, such as  policy directives, internal staffing requests, appeals analyst position  descriptions, and other internal memoranda. We used these sources to  identify what steps FEMA had taken to improve its management of the  appeals process since 2013. We also used this information to supplement  our understanding of the challenges the Public Assistance Appeals Board  (PAAB) and regional officials raised during our interviews discussed  above.", "To address the third objective, we analyzed a series of FEMA internal  performance reports issued between November 29, 2013, and February  15, 2017. Developed by PAAB and provided to FEMA management on a  quarterly basis, these reports included aggregate information on PA  appeals inventory, such as the number of first- and second-level pending  appeals, the number of appeals processed within statutory timeframes,  the number of pending appeals that are beyond the statutory timeframe,  and common appeal issues based on keywords entered by analysts  responsible for processing appeals. We also analyzed internal  documents, such as briefs and newsletters, which provided detail on  specific appeal decisions as well as the status of the appeals inventory.  Further, we analyzed FEMA\u2019s Strategic Plans for fiscal years 2008 to  2013 and fiscal years 2014 to 2018 to identify objectives, measures, and  overall agency-wide goals. We assessed the information in these  documents against leading practices in measuring agency performance  and against federal standards for internal control.", "For all three objectives, we reviewed relevant legislation and FEMA  standard operating procedures that govern both FEMA headquarters and  regional offices. We also interviewed officials in PAAB and FEMA\u2019s  Recovery Directorate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Brenda Rabinowitz (Assistant  Director), Anthony Bova (Analyst-in-Charge), Joseph Fread, and Sherrice  Kerns made key contributions to this report.

To help recover, state and local governments may apply to FEMA for grants for debris removal, public facility repairs, and similar activities.", "Applicants have two chances to appeal grant decisions. However, we found that, from 2014 to July 2017, FEMA processed only 9% of first-level and 11% of second-level appeals within its 90-day limit.", "Although FEMA has improved management of the appeals process in the last few years, it still faces challenges. Among other things, we recommended measures to more accurately track appeals and to develop FEMA's workforce."]}
