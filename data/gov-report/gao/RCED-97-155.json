Among other improvements, some of our most serious air and water quality problems have been alleviated, dangerous pesticides have been banned, and health threats posed by lead in gasoline and paint have been reduced. However, these strides in environmental protection have come to the nation at a growing cost. For example, the costs of pollution abatement and control have risen significantly\u2014from $64 billion in 1973 to over $121 billion in 1994 (constant 1995 dollars).", "EPA\u2019s top leadership acknowledges that such resource constraints, combined with (1) the increasing complexity of environmental problems and (2) the limited effectiveness of EPA\u2019s traditional medium-by-medium structure to address the full spectrum of pollution problems in an integrated manner, have forced the agency to fundamentally rethink its approach to environmental protection. Toward this end, EPA is currently experimenting with ways to improve its existing program activities and to lay the groundwork for a new, more flexible, integrated system of environmental protection\u2014one that will allow the agency to deliver the highest quality protection possible in the most cost-effective manner. The passage of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) has provided further impetus for the agency to improve its management practices, in part through the requirement that it develop measurable program results.", "To better understand EPA\u2019s initiatives and strategy to implement them, several congressional committees asked that we provide a broad overview of EPA\u2019s reinvention efforts, focusing on (1) what the initiatives are and how the agency is structured to carry them out and (2) what key issues need to be addressed for these initiatives to have their intended effect."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Structure Limits EPA\u2019s Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["EPA was created in 1970 under an executive reorganization plan that combined various environmental components of other federal agencies. This left EPA without a formal overarching mission and statutory framework to guide its activities. Initially, the agency was charged with the general task of cleaning up environmental pollution\u2014giving early attention to air and surface water. As further environmental needs were identified, the Congress enacted laws to address specific pollution problems. As a result, a dozen or so statutes govern the agency\u2019s activities, and several congressional committees are responsible for environmental issues. However, these statutes are not coordinated or integrated, and in some cases they contain differing approaches and reflect different philosophies. Hence, the agency has no overall system for setting priorities across all environmental problems and for identifying and addressing the most critical environmental needs first.", "In response to these legislative mandates, EPA has organized its activities around environmental media (such as air, water, or land) and the substances it regulates (such as hazardous waste, pesticides, and toxic substances)\u2014resulting in a structure that closely parallels the statutes that authorize its activities. Each of these program offices focuses primarily on implementing medium-specific or substance-specific responsibilities detailed in these statutes, rather than addressing the full range of pollution sources in a cross-cutting manner. The agency\u2019s medium-specific focus can result in both the intended and unintended transfer of pollution from one medium to another. For example, removing contaminants from public sewage systems or industrial smokestacks can create sludge and waste that can themselves be toxic and lead to further air, water, or land pollution. As a result, EPA and others have acknowledged a need for increased attention to such intermedia transfers to ensure that the agency\u2019s pollution reduction strategies have the best overall impact on the environment.", "While organizing EPA\u2019s activities in this manner has facilitated the implementation of individual environmental statutes and has reduced or prevented many threats to human health and the environment, it has also created problems for the agency. Most significantly, it has limited EPA\u2019s ability (1) to set risk-based priorities across the full spectrum of environmental problems and target its limited resources to the most pressing of these problems and (2) to take into account the cost and feasibility of various approaches to reduce pollution. It has also impaired the agency\u2019s ability to experiment with innovative and more cost-effective ways to address pollution problems, such as pollution prevention (eliminating or minimizing pollution at its source versus containing it at the end-of-the-pipe) or market-based incentives (such as taxes on pollution or trading emission pollution \u201crights\u201d). Such approaches give polluters financial reasons to reduce pollution without prescribing the methods for doing so. The current structure has also restricted EPA\u2019s ability to exercise flexibility with regulated entities, states, environmental groups, and other stakeholders in the regulatory process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Has Tried to Address Limits of Existing Structure", "paragraphs": ["Since at least the mid-1980s, EPA has taken steps to address the problems associated with its medium-specific structure. For example, then-Administrator Lee Thomas\u2014recognizing that environmental problems are complex and interrelated\u2014directed the agency to manage its programs and activities so that they (1) account for the relative risks posed by environmental problems to help ensure that limited resources are directed to the most pressing environmental needs; (2) recognize that pollution control efforts in one medium can result in a transfer of pollution to another (and, when feasible, that pollution should be eliminated or minimized at its source); and (3) lead to the achievement of measurable environmental results.", "While our 1988 general management review of EPA credited the agency with taking steps to address these concerns, it urged the agency, among other things, to (1) fill important gaps in its efforts to manage for environmental results (including setting priorities in measurable terms and ranking them to ensure that the most pressing needs are addressed first) and (2) establish more effective partnerships with the states, since they serve as the agency\u2019s key partners in implementing environmental programs. Since that time, GAO, EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board, the National Academy of Public Administration, and other organizations have all pointed to the need to make significantly greater progress in this direction.", "In our 1991 report, Environmental Protection: Meeting Public Expectations With Limited Resources (GAO/RCED-91-97), for example, we noted that for EPA to achieve environmental goals with limited resources, it needs to (1) link budget priorities to relative risks to the environment and public health rather than rely on public perceptions of risk; (2) measure changes in environmental conditions rather than measure activities (such as the number of permits issued) to obtain meaningful information on the effectiveness of its investments in environmental protection; and (3) combine traditional and innovative approaches (such as pollution prevention and the use of market incentives) to ensure that the most cost-effective methods for controlling pollution are used. The report observed, however, that EPA was hampered in setting priorities across all environmental problems by the lack of integration among environmental statutes.", "The National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) came to similar conclusions in its 1995 report, Setting Priorities, Getting Results. In particular, the report noted that EPA lacks a clear statutory mission because it derives its authority from many different statutes. It also noted, among other things, that the agency needs to encourage innovation among its regulated community (localities, states, and industries) to find the most appropriate methods for achieving environmental protection.", "EPA has responded to these and similar concerns by taking a number of steps to \u201creinvent\u201d its approach to environmental protection. For example, the agency launched its Common Sense Initiative (CSI) in 1994 to allow industrial sectors (such as printing and metal finishing) and their key stakeholders to work collaboratively to, among other things, (1) identify opportunities to get better environmental results at less cost; (2) streamline permitting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and (3) provide industry with incentives to develop innovative, cost-effective technologies to meet or exceed environmental standards. EPA has also increased the involvement of stakeholders in its decision-making processes.", "More recently, in March 1995, EPA launched a more comprehensive effort to fundamentally reexamine and reshape its efforts to protect the environment. As noted in a March 1996 progress report on its efforts to reinvent environmental regulation, the agency is presently undertaking a number of initiatives to apply \u201c. . . common sense, flexibility, and creativity in an effort to move beyond the one-size-fits-all system of the past and achieve the very best protection of public health and the environment at the least cost.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Government Performance and Results Act Requires a Focus on Measurable Results", "paragraphs": ["The provisions of GPRA, also known as \u201cthe Results Act,\u201d are consistent with the principles of reinvention and reinforce many of EPA\u2019s reinvention efforts.

Rather than focusing on the performance of prescribed tasks and processes, the statute emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on and achieve measurable program results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To address questions about EPA\u2019s current efforts to reinvent environmental regulation, a number of committees asked that we provide information on (1) what the agency\u2019s reinvention initiatives are and how the agency is structured to carry them out and (2) what key issues need to be addressed for these initiatives to have their intended effect.", "In addressing the first objective, we interviewed EPA officials responsible for the agency\u2019s reinvention efforts, including the Deputy Administrator, the designated Associate Administrator of the future Office of Reinvention, and members of EPA\u2019s Regulatory Reinvention Team. We also interviewed officials in selected EPA program offices (such as the Office of Water; the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances; and the Office of Air and Radiation) to better understand how these offices were structured to implement both agencywide and program-specific reinvention initiatives. Following our initial contacts with headquarters officials, we visited three EPA regional offices\u2014in Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago\u2014to obtain insights into how the agency\u2019s regional offices are structured to carry out the agency\u2019s reinvention efforts. These offices were suggested to us by headquarters officials because they had experience in implementing some of the agency\u2019s key initiatives. The issues discussed with the headquarters and regional officials included (1) EPA\u2019s reinvention philosophy and goals, (2) details on key agencywide and program-specific initiatives, and (3) the agency\u2019s structure for carrying out these initiatives (both at headquarters and among the regional offices).", "In addressing the second objective, we asked the same EPA officials questions about the challenges facing the agency in achieving its reinvention goals. Our questions focused largely on efforts by the agency to communicate its goals for change to its staff and to external stakeholders, its efforts to systematically evaluate the success of its activities, and other issues that are widely viewed among management experts as essential ingredients in successfully achieving desired organizational change. We also posed these questions to other key stakeholders, including state environmental officials in Georgia, Massachusetts, and Minnesota (because of their association with the three regions we visited and their involvement with key reinvention efforts), key national environmental and industry organizations (such as the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Law Institute, and the American Petroleum Institute, among others), and other organizations familiar with EPA\u2019s reinvention efforts, such as Resources for the Future and NAPA.", "Through these contacts, we identified specific projects to examine in more detail in order to gain a fuller understanding of the issues and challenges involved in applying reinvention principles and programs.

In addition, (1) EPA\u2019s program offices participate in agencywide initiatives and have generated some of their own medium-specific initiatives and (2) each of EPA\u2019s regional offices has established varied structures and strategies to implement both the EPA-wide and program-specific initiatives.

These projects have either a reinvention focus or reinvention-related components. For example, EPA\u2019s Boston regional office has initiated its own reinvention-specific activities (including a database to track the progress of its reinvention activities) and other efforts that have reinvention-related elements (such as integrating environmental considerations into transportation planning). Similarly, EPA\u2019s program offices have initiated their own medium-specific reinvention efforts, such as the Office of Water\u2019s efforts to improve the nation\u2019s water quality monitoring information through strategies and recommendations developed by an intergovernmental task force.

According to EPA, the project was created in response to the concerns expressed by numerous companies, facility managers, and communities that current applications of environmental rules do not necessarily provide the best possible environmental protection at the least cost. Further impetus was given by the experiences of some in the regulated community, who found that they could achieve substantial cost savings and improve environmental protection through more flexible, site-specific solutions to environmental protection.", "Under Project XL, EPA allows companies to test innovative ways of achieving environmental protection at both the facility and the community levels if they can demonstrate that the proposed changes will yield superior environmental performance. This requires applicants to achieve results superior to the level of environmental performance that would have occurred without XL. To test such innovative approaches, project sponsors collaborate with key stakeholders (including communities located near a project, state and local governments, and environmental and other public interest groups, among others) to develop project proposals. These proposals culminate in Final Project agreements that must be approved by EPA, the state environmental agency, and the project sponsor in order to be implemented.", "For example, a Final Project Agreement signed last year with Intel Corporation for its manufacturing site in Chandler, Arizona, includes a number of innovative features through which the company agreed to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements (but to achieve them more effectively) and to go beyond current requirements to improve its overall environmental performance. In return, the agreement gives Intel the flexibility to (1) implement a sitewide environmental master plan that integrates both mandatory and voluntary environmental undertakings across all media\u2014air, water, solid waste, and hazardous waste\u2014rather than operating strictly under separate medium-specific permits; (2) develop new procedures that will reduce paperwork and other procedural burdens; and (3) operate under a streamlined air permitting strategy that gives the company \u201cpreapproval\u201d to add new semiconductor-related facilities as long as the facilities do not exceed emission limits or fail to comply with other specified requirements (such as those for reporting). In addition, Intel agreed to report its progress (using nonproprietary information) to the public in a consolidated, user-friendly format to allow the public to track the company\u2019s progress in meeting the goals established for each medium.", "Working with corporations and key stakeholders (including states, localities, and environmental groups), EPA has also approved Project XL agreements with Berry Corporation in LaBelle, Florida, to consolidate its citrus juice manufacturing operations under a comprehensive single multimedia permit, and with Weyerhaeuser Corporation, to reduce the overall impact on the environment of its mill operations in Flint River, Georgia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Sense Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The EPA Administrator launched CSI in July 1994, as a way to bring government officials at all levels, environmentalists, and industry leaders together to create industry-by-industry strategies that will work toward \u201ccleaner, cheaper, and smarter\u201d ways to achieve environmental protection through consensus-based decision-making. CSI is similar to Project XL in that both initiatives attempt to reduce pollution in the most cost-effective manner.

At the end of 1996, the agency hired a contractor to evaluate the effectiveness of its processes for involving stakeholders. In May 1997, the contractor issued a report summarizing comments made by various internal and external stakeholder groups that were interviewed regarding their expectations for reinvention, opinions on possible performance measures and criteria for measuring the success of reinvention, and general advice on regulatory reinvention. Among other things, the stakeholders agreed that measures of environmental health should be the primary performance criteria for measuring reinvention success. EPA is currently evaluating the report\u2019s findings.", "Nonetheless, EPA reinvention officials acknowledged that a large number of reinvention projects do not currently have evaluation components. They added that among the projects that do have such components, the quality varies widely. These officials explained that, in part, it is too early to evaluate some of the reinvention efforts. For example, the February 1997 contractor review of CSI\u2019s first 2 years found that it is too early to observe the effects of CSI on statutes and regulations as well as on environmental compliance; environmental indicators; quality of life; public health; productivity; and burden on industry, government, and society.", "Even though it may be too early to observe the effects of reinvention initiatives, we believe it is not too early to build evaluation components into reinvention projects so that observable effects down the road can be evaluated. The agency has recently taken initial steps toward this end. Specifically, the Administrator has asked the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology\u2019s Reinvention Criteria Committee to identify criteria the agency can use to measure the progress and success of specific reinvention projects and its overall reinvention efforts. In October 1996, the committee completed a 6-month review of seven separate EPA reinvention initiatives to determine how they might be evaluated. These initiatives include CSI, Self-Policing/Audit policies, Self-Certification efforts, the Environmental Leadership Program (ELP), Project XL, NEPPS and the Sustainable Development Challenge Grants Program. This review found that two of the seven reinvention initiatives\u2014ELP and NEPPS\u2014had begun to define evaluation criteria.

In contrast, EPA maintains\u2014and some in the environmental community agree\u2014that the current statutory framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for real progress in most of the agency\u2019s reinvention efforts and that substantial changes in the statutes could compromise protection of the environment and public health.

Nonetheless, the framework does impose requirements that have led to and reinforce many of the existing practices the agency is most seeking to change.

Instead, its statutory responsibilities are set forth in a dozen or so separate pieces of legislation that generally assign pollution control responsibilities according to environmental medium (e.g., air and water) or category of pollutant (e.g., pesticides). These numerous legislative mandates have led to the creation of individual EPA program offices that focus primarily on reducing pollution within the particular environmental medium for which they have responsibility, rather than on reducing overall pollutant discharges.", "The complications arising from this framework have been documented by GAO and other organizations for many years. In our 1988 general management review of EPA, we cited several problems, including difficulties in setting risk-based priorities across environmental media because each statute prescribes certain activities to deal with its own medium-specific problems. In addition, different statutes require the use of different approaches in developing and evaluating regulatory options\u2014often resulting in \u201cfragmentation of effort, conflict in resource allocation, bias against new chemical/pesticide products, and multiple risk assessment documents for the same substance.\u201d In 1991, we touched on these issues again, noting, for example, that \u201cnumerous legislative mandates have led to the creation of individual EPA program offices that have tended to focus solely on reducing pollution within the particular environmental medium for which they have responsibility, rather than on reducing overall emissions.\u201d More recently, in testifying on efforts by EPA to improve its working relationship with the states and to provide them with additional flexibility, we concluded that \u201cas long as environmental laws are medium-specific and prescriptive and EPA personnel are held accountable for meeting the requirements of the laws, it will be difficult for the agency to fundamentally change its relationships with the states to reduce day-to-day control over program activities.\u201d", "As an alternative to modifying the statutory framework, a bill introduced at the end of the 104th Congress would have authorized a demonstration program under which the EPA Administrator could modify or waive an agency rule if, among other things, a regulated facility could demonstrate that an alternative compliance strategy would achieve better overall environmental results than would be achieved under current regulatory requirements.

Participants in this effort plan to deliver a package of recommendations to the Congress and the administration in 1997. The Deputy Administrator added, however, that the agency\u2019s experience to date with reinvention confirms that much can be accomplished within the existing statutory framework. EPA reinvention officials supported this view, maintaining that as they have evaluated proposed projects on a case-by-case basis, they have found that proposed changes have been achievable within the constraints posed by existing statutes.", "In addition, according to these officials, the agency can deal effectively with potential regulatory barriers through \u201csite-specific rulemakings\u201d that allow it to offer additional flexibility to participating companies. Under these rulemakings, EPA can promulgate a rule that will permit the agency to approve the terms of a project employing an alternative regulatory approach. According to EPA, the authority for such a rule would be based on an alternative interpretation of a statute applicable only to the specific site. The facility would then comply with this site-specific rule.", "Many in the environmental community also believe that statutory change is not needed and that much flexibility already exists in environmental statutes. An attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council cited the Clean Water Act as an example, noting that the law allows site-specific variances from water quality-based effluent limitations. Using this flexibility, facilities can have up to 5 years to comply with water quality effluent limitations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many in the Regulated Community Doubt That Much Progress Can Be Made Without Statutory Changes", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s view that reinvention can produce substantial results without statutory changes is at odds with the view held by many in industry\u2014whose participation, as key members of the regulated community, is crucial for reinvention to succeed. Both individual companies and other industrial organizations, including some discussed earlier that have participated in reinvention experiments, have expressed strong reservations about the potential for reinvention within the present statutory framework. For example, the report to the Global Environmental Management Initiative, discussed earlier in this chapter, noted that the agreements under Project XL do not provide firms with any protection from lawsuits by citizens or environmental groups that may object to the terms of these agreements. As a result, according to the report, \u201cindustry participants in reinvention programs generally steer the programs to peripheral matters because their general counsels caution them against taking any action that might result in litigation.\u201d", "Similarly, reflecting on its experience as the petroleum industry\u2019s representative on the Common Sense Initiative Council, a representative of the American Petroleum Institute told us that the Institute favors statutory change to explicitly authorize reinvention-type activities. Echoing the Global Environmental Management Initiative\u2019s concern over the consequences to companies of being perceived as violating the law, he noted that even frivolous lawsuits pose a real threat. He added that companies \u201cgoing out on a limb\u201d need to be afforded statutory protection.", "Some industry representatives have specifically questioned whether EPA\u2019s strategy of using site-specific rulemakings will provide industry with the assurance it desires that actions taken under a reinvention project will not extend the approval process for reinvention projects for months or years, because it may take years to implement a rule and additional years to litigate it. In fact, these concerns may be well founded because some environmental organizations have raised concerns that site-specific rulemakings may allow EPA regions to essentially rewrite federal policies, may raise questions about whether EPA\u2019s rules are applied consistently across the nation, and may preclude national environmental groups and other parties from participating adequately in the process. Among the other reservations voiced by industry representatives are concerns that EPA may not have the statutory authority to modify a rule in some cases.", "The state officials interviewed expressed some disagreement over the need for statutory change. Georgia environmental officials acknowledged that current law poses constraints on innovation but said that legislative changes may be premature until EPA and the states have gained more experience with reinvention.

For example, in June 1992, we concluded that the use of water pollutant trading had been limited, in part, by the absence of a clear and unambiguous authorization of this practice in the Clean Water Act. We cited an EPA analysis of participating states that found states\u2019 concerns over the absence of such authorization inhibited trading because of perceived legal risks that programs would be overturned or disallowed by regulators or the courts. We concluded that there would be benefits in amending the act to more clearly signal that trading is permissible. A recent study by Argonne National Laboratory reached similar conclusions, noting that \u201cto some extent, companies that elect to trade do so at their own risk. . . . Conservative corporate and municipal government managers would be more willing to undertake trades if they felt their risk of future litigation and liability were reduced.\u201d", "Similarly, we testified in February 1996 that concerns over existing statutory requirements have hampered states\u2019 efforts to experiment with integrated environmental management, a concept under which a state focuses on a whole facility and all of its sources of pollution, rather than on a medium-specific source of pollution. We noted, for example, that while these efforts had indeed met with some success, they were hampered by EPA funding and reporting requirements linked to individual federal environmental statutes. Referring to states\u2019 efforts to pursue innovative regulatory programs, such as integrated environmental management, we concluded that \u201cas long as environmental laws are medium-specific and prescriptive and EPA personnel are held accountable for meeting the requirements of the laws, it will be difficult for the agency to fundamentally change its relationships with the states to reduce day-to-day control over program activities.\u201d", "These examples do not suggest that all meaningful improvements necessarily require legislative authorization.

To date, the agency has taken some important steps toward devising a system that will protect the nation\u2019s environment more efficiently and cost-effectively. For example, the agency has learned that it needs a system for elevating problems requiring senior management\u2019s attention. It also has begun to develop criteria for systematically evaluating its reinvention efforts. Nonetheless, EPA faces significant hurdles that must be addressed effectively if reinvention is to succeed.", "First, we found that managing a large number of often-complex and demanding initiatives has caused difficulties for EPA staff as well as other stakeholders. The problem has been compounded by (1) the fact that some of the agency\u2019s key initiatives have proved to be more demanding than originally conceived and (2) key stakeholders are confused about the primary objectives of these initiatives. EPA officials, including the Deputy Administrator, have pointed out that the agency should respond to this issue over time as evaluations of these initiatives provide management with the information it needs to determine which programs should be continued and what can be done to improve them. However, a systematic and comprehensive review may be useful at this time\u2014particularly in light of (1) the problems, identified by EPA and other participants in reinvention activities, with the number and clarity of the initiatives; (2) the fact that the agency has had several years of experience with many of the initiatives; and (3) the fact that the agency has a long way to go in developing evaluation components for many of the initiatives. Such a review could lead EPA to discontinue initiatives that no longer support the agency\u2019s overall reinvention goals; set priorities among the initiatives that will continue; and ensure that the specific objectives and expectations for these initiatives are clear to stakeholders inside and outside the agency.", "Second, while EPA has made enormous\u2014perhaps unprecedented\u2014efforts to involve stakeholders with different interests and perspectives in the reinvention process, achieving and maintaining consensus has proved to be an enormous challenge. That challenge has been most difficult when EPA has sought to achieve\u2014or was perceived as seeking to achieve\u2014100 percent agreement. As the agency proceeds to evaluate its involvement of stakeholders in the reinvention process, we believe that it could usefully clarify its definition of consensus and the circumstances under which unanimous agreement must be achieved.", "Third, a long-term, institutional process for quickly resolving reinvention problems could help EPA avert the kind of miscommunication, disagreements, and other issues that undermined some of its earlier reinvention projects. While EPA\u2019s use of \u201creinvention ombudsmen\u201d has helped in specific cases, participants within and outside EPA have maintained that senior managers will not be able to intervene each time a problem arises. They maintain that a more sustainable process is needed\u2014one that distinguishes between problems that can be resolved at lower levels within the agency and those that need to be elevated for senior management\u2019s attention. EPA management expressed its agreement to us with the concept of such a process, and is currently negotiating arrangements for this type of process with the states.", "Fourth, EPA has made progress toward measuring the effectiveness of some of its reinvention initiatives, developing strategies for evaluation and establishing criteria to assess its reinvention efforts as a whole. At the same time, EPA reinvention officials acknowledged that many initiatives do not have an evaluation component and that such a component is not formally required. We believe the agency should build on its initial steps toward evaluating the success of reinvention by setting the expectation that each of its reinvention initiatives should include some kind of evaluation component. Such an evaluation component is all the more important in light of the acknowledgement by EPA management that it needs such information to make informed decisions about which initiatives to continue and how to improve them.", "Finally, much discussion has focused on the potential need for statutory changes as a precondition for reinventing environmental regulation. We believe that constructive modifications can indeed be made under the current environmental statutory framework. However, EPA will be limited in its ability to truly \u201creinvent\u201d environmental regulation without legislative changes.

We acknowledge that assessing how specific changes could improve the environmental statutory framework was outside the scope of this review, although our draft report did reflect the views of EPA officials, industrial and environmental groups, and other participants in the environmental regulatory process on this issue. We also acknowledge that EPA, in consultation with key advisers and stakeholders, is ultimately responsible for assessing whether changes to environmental statutes should be recommended to the Congress. At the same time, we believe that any discussion of the issues affecting reinvention\u2019s success would be incomplete without citing the inherent limitations to fundamental change posed by the statutes\u2019 current medium-by-medium focus. Such limitations have been acknowledged by EPA in past years; documented consistently in analyses by GAO and other organizations; and cited as a key issue by the large majority of officials interviewed for this report.", "Finally, the officials suggested that the report focuses on the most visible of EPA\u2019s initiatives, such as Project XL and the Common Sense Initiative, and does not sufficiently acknowledge (1) the agency\u2019s smaller, less visible initiatives and (2) the extent to which reinvention principles are being applied throughout EPA\u2019s day-to-day activities. Although we did not analyze all of EPA\u2019s reinvention initiatives in detail, focusing instead on the efforts emphasized by the EPA and state officials contacted during our review, the draft report acknowledged that EPA has undertaken numerous other initiatives and listed many of them in appendix I.

Here, too, however, the draft report discussed the agency\u2019s difficulties in achieving this goal, noting in chapter 3, for example, \u201cwidespread agreement among EPA officials, state officials, and others that the agency has a long way to go before reinvention becomes an integral part of its staff\u2019s everyday activities.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
