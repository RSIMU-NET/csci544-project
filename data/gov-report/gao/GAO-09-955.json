State continues to face foreign language shortfalls in regions of strategic interest--such as the Near East and South and Central Asia, where about 40 percent of officers in LDPs did not meet requirements. Despite efforts to recruit individuals with proficiency in critical languages, shortfalls in supercritical languages, such as Arabic and Chinese, remain at 39 percent. Past reports by GAO, State's Office of the Inspector General, and others have concluded that foreign language shortfalls could be negatively affecting U.S. activities overseas. Overseas fieldwork for this report reaffirmed this conclusion. State's approach to meeting its foreign language requirements includes an annual review of all LDPs, language training, recruitment of language-proficient staff, and pay incentives for language skills. For example, State trains staff in about 70 languages in Washington and overseas, and has reported a training success rate of 86 percent. Moreover, State offers bonus points for language-proficient applicants who have passed the Foreign Service exam and has hired 445 officers under this program since 2004. However, various challenges limit the effectiveness of these efforts. According to State, a primary challenge is overall staffing shortages, which limit the number of staff available for language training, as well as the recent increase in LDPs. State's efforts to meet its foreign language requirements have yielded some results but have not closed persistent gaps and reflect, in part, a lack of a comprehensive, strategic approach. State officials have said that the department's plan for meeting its foreign language requirements is spread throughout a number of documents that address these needs; however these documents are not linked to each other and do not contain measurable goals, objectives, or milestones for reducing the foreign language gaps. Because these gaps have persisted over several years despite staffing increases, we believe that a more comprehensive, strategic approach would help State to more effectively guide its efforts and assess its progress in meeting its foreign language requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Proficiency in foreign languages is a key skill for U.S. Foreign Service  officers (FSO) to advance U.S. foreign policy and economic interests  overseas.

Overall, 1,005  officers in language-designated positions did not meet both of the  requirements of their positions, and an additional 334 language-designated  positions were vacant (see fig. 1). The persistence of these shortfalls is  partially attributable to an overall increase of 332 overseas language- designated positions between 2005 and 2008, many of which are in hard  and superhard languages.

For example, State has reported that over 80 percent of  employees assigned to vacant language-designated positions met or  exceeded the proficiency requirement in each year since fiscal year 2005.  According to HR officials responsible for compiling and analyzing these  data, however, this figure is not the percentage of officers currently in  language-designated positions who have tested scores at or above the  requirements for the position; rather, it measures the percentage of  officers assigned to language-designated positions who are enrolled in  language training, regardless of the outcome of that training. Because  several officers do not complete the entire training, while others do not  achieve the level of proficiency required even after taking the training, the  actual percentage of officers meeting the requirements for their positions  is likely lower.", "While the extent of language deficiencies varies from post to post, some of  the greatest deficiencies exist in regions of strategic interest to the United  States (see fig. 2).

Every year, HR directs posts to  review all language-designated positions and to submit requests for any  changes in the number of positions or level of proficiency. Headquarters  officials from HR, FSI, and the regional bureaus then review and discuss  these requests and develop a list of positions identified as requiring foreign  language skills. However, the views expressed by officials from HR and  FSI, and FSOs at overseas posts during our meetings with these officials,  and our findings in previous work on this issue, suggest that State\u2019s  designated language proficiency requirements do not necessarily reflect  the actual language needs of the posts. State\u2019s current instructions to the  posts suggest the language designation review be tempered by budgetary  and staffing realities. Consequently, some overseas posts tend to request  only the positions they think they will receive. For example, a senior  official at one of the overseas posts we visited said that although he would  like several positions at the 4/4 proficiency level in his section, he knows  the positions will not be designated at that level, so he does not request  them. A senior official at another post we visited said he does not request  language-designated positions at a higher proficiency level because he  knows that ultimately the post will not get enough applicants for the  positions. This view was echoed by HR officials who stated that overseas  posts must often weigh the desire to attract a large number of applicants  against a desire to draw bidders with a higher level of language  proficiency.

A  1986 State report noted that the language designation system needed to be  overhauled on a worldwide basis and recommended that posts carefully  review their language-designated positions with the geographic bureaus,  eliminating positions that seem unnecessary, adding more if required,  deciding how many positions at the 4 proficiency level are needed, and  defining what kind of fluency each language-designated position requires.  For example, one senior official said there should be a systematic review  of which positions need language proficiency and which do not, and then  the department should decide whether it gives some language training to a  lot of people or extensive language training to a select few.", "Moreover, officers at the posts we visited questioned the validity of the  relatively low proficiency level required for certain positions, citing the  need for a higher proficiency level. Officials at most of the posts we visited  said that a 3/3 in certain critical languages is not always enough for  officers to do their jobs, although they acknowledged the difficulty State  would have filling positions at a higher proficiency level. For example, an  economics officer at one of the posts we visited said that she could start  meetings and read the newspaper with her 3/3 in Arabic, but that level of  proficiency did not provide her with language skills needed to discuss  technical issues, and the officers in the public affairs section of the same  post said that a 3/3 was not sufficient to effectively explain U.S. positions  in the local media. Officers in the public affairs section of another post we  visited said that they were not comfortable making statements on U.S.  foreign policy with a 3/3 proficiency level. Senior officials at a third post  said 3/3 is adequate to ask and answer questions but not to conduct  business. An officer with a 4/4 in Chinese said officers in his section did  the best job they could but a 3/3 was not enough. He said he sometimes  had difficulty at his level, for example, when participating in radio  interviews broadcast to local audiences. In addition, consular officers at  some of the posts we visited questioned whether a proficiency level of 2 in  speaking was sufficient for conducting visa interviews. They said they  could ask questions but did not always understand the answers and  sometimes had to rely on locally engaged staff to translate. HR officials  explained that a position may be classified at 2 when, in reality, a higher  level of proficiency is needed.

State also tracks overall  satisfaction with all training at FSI and reported a 94 percent satisfaction  rate for fiscal year 2008. Officials we met with overseas, however,  expressed mixed experiences with FSI language training. For example,  consular officers in Istanbul described the FSI training as outstanding.  Entry-level officers in Cairo said that instruction at the beginning levels at  FSI is very good, but that FSI is not well equipped for beyond-3 training.  However, FSI officials explained that because there are only 2 4/4  language-designated positions in the department, there is almost no formal  requirement for FSI to provide such training. FSI officials also stated that  without a mandate or the necessary resources, FSI provides beyond-3  training on an ad hoc basis.

Several officers  also stated that they were not aware of a formal mechanism for them to  provide feedback on this issue to FSI. A few officers said that they  provided feedback to FSI, but they were not sure if their concerns were  addressed. FSI officials stated that FSI provides several opportunities for  feedback.

An Office of Recruitment official, who was involved in the  development of the list, stated that the department could not yet assess  the program\u2019s effectiveness because the program, which started in 2004, is  still new and the department does not have sufficient data to perform such  an assessment. The official pointed out that there have been only about  five hiring cycles since it started.

A total of 19 officers that have either served  two tours or at least have the second tour onward assignment arranged  have definitively not filled the obligation and most of those were due to  medical or security reasons. The Office of Recruitment official said that  since the requirement for the second tour for midlevel officers is still new,  there are few, if any, officers recruited under the critical needs program  who have reached the middle level.", "State also does not have a formal schedule for reviewing and adding or  removing languages from the list of critical needs languages. Officials from  the Office of Recruitment said the list has been reviewed informally and  Japanese was removed because State is hiring sufficient numbers of  Japanese-speaking officers and there are few entry-level language- designated positions at Japanese posts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentive Pay", "paragraphs": ["State also offers bonus pay to members of the Foreign Service with  proficiency in certain languages under the Language Incentive Pay  program. To qualify for language incentive pay, officers must    have a proficiency of at least a 3/3 (for generalists) or 2/2 (for specialists)    be serving in any position (either language designated or non-language  designated) at a post abroad where a language currently on the list of  incentive languages is a primary or primary-alternate language, or in any  language-designated position requiring an incentive language.", "The incentive pay varies according to the officer\u2019s salary and tested scores.  For example, an officer with a 3/3 in Turkish in a language-designated  position in Istanbul would be eligible for a bonus of 10 percent of the base  salary abroad of an FS-01/step 1 member of the Foreign Service.", "State has not measured the impact of the pay incentive on increasing  foreign language proficiency, and the officers we met with expressed  mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the program. For example, a few  officers said it is difficult and takes a long time to advance from a 2 to a 3  to qualify for the incentive, while others said the pay was a very good  incentive. Others offered suggestions for improvement. For example, one  officer said the requirements for the language incentive program  discourage some people from participating and that State should provide  incentives for people in increments, for example, for going from a 2 to 2- plus. He also suggested that State provide incentives separately for  speaking and reading, because it takes time to increase proficiency in  reading, which is often not needed for the officer to perform his or her job.  HR and FSI officials said that State is considering proposals to improve the  incentive pay program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Staffing Shortages and Other Challenges Have Limited State\u2019s Ability to Reduce Its Language Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["According to senior State officials, the primary challenge State faces in  meeting its foreign language requirements is the department\u2019s continued  staffing shortages. Specifically, State\u2019s lack of a sufficient training float has  limited the number of officers available for language training. As a result,  State has had to choose between assigning an officer to post who may not  have the requisite language skills or allowing the position to remain empty  while the incoming officer is in language training. As noted above, in  October 2008, 334 language-designated positions (9 percent of all  language-designated positions) were vacant in addition to 1,005 positions  that were filled by officers who did not meet the language requirement for  the position. For example, in fiscal year 2006, State\u2019s Director General was  unable to fill a request by the embassy in Riyadh for two additional  language-proficient officers, as recommended by the Inspector General,  because of overall staffing shortages. Furthermore, a 2008 report on State  resource issues noted that personnel shortages result in training lags, and  that ongoing tension over whether staff should complete training  assignments or fill positions complicate efforts to create a well-trained  workforce.", "Despite these overall staffing shortages, State has doubled the number of  language-designated positions overseas since 2001. Department officials  noted that the recent increase in positions requiring a superhard  language\u2014that is, one that requires 2 years of training to reach the 3  level\u2014and the number of 1-year tours in these positions have  compounded these shortages. For example, State must budget three  people for a 3/3 Arabic language-designated position in Riyadh, which is  typically a 1-year tour: one to fill the position, one in the second year of  language training to arrive at post the next year, and one in the first year of  training to arrive the following year.", "Other staffing-related challenges include the following:    Staff time. In some cases, Foreign Service officers lack the time necessary  for maintaining their language skills upon arriving at post. Officers we  spoke to in Tunis, Ankara, and Cairo said that they do not have enough  time in their schedule to fully utilize the post language program. In  addition, in 2006, State\u2019s Inspector General reported that most political  and economic officers in Kabul find that a routine 6-day workweek  precludes rigorous language training.", "Curtailments. When officers cut short their tours in a language-designated  position, there is often no officer with the requisite language skills  available to fill the position. Some officers we spoke to said that in some  cases, they had to cut short their language training to come to post earlier  than expected in order to fill a position vacated by an officer who had  curtailed. For example, the regional security officers in Ankara and Tunis  said that they left language training after only a few months in order to   replace officers who had curtailed to Iraq or elsewhere. In addition,  several officers in Shenyang said that they had to leave language training  early in order to fill gaps at post.", "Position freeze. In recent years, State has left dozens of positions vacant\u2014 or \u201cfrozen\u201d them\u2014in order to fully staff missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Officers at several posts we visited said that in order to avoid further  shortages at post, the geographic bureaus, at times, have chosen to freeze  training positions, rather than overseas positions. Consequently, there is  no officer currently in language training for these positions, and posts will  either have to request a language waiver or hope that the incumbent  already has language skills when filling the position.", "In 2009, State received funding for an additional 450 positions, including  300 dedicated to language training. According to the department, these  positions will help to increase the training float and reduce gaps at post  while officers are in language training. State officials have said that if their  fiscal year 2010 request for an additional 200 training positions is  approved, they expect to see language gaps close starting in 2011;  however, State has not indicated when its foreign language staffing  requirements will be completely met, and previous staffing increases have  been consumed by higher priorities. For example, in 2003, State officials  stated that the increased hiring under the department\u2019s Diplomatic  Readiness Initiative would create a training float to help eliminate the  foreign language gaps at overseas posts within several years. Although the  initiative enabled State to hire more than 1,000 employees above attrition,  it did not reduce the language gaps, as most of this increase was absorbed  by the demand for personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, and thus the training  reserve was not achieved.", "Another challenge to State\u2019s efforts to address its language shortfalls is the  persistent perception among Foreign Service officers that State\u2019s  promotion system undervalues language training; however, while HR  officials told us that the system values language training, the department  has not conducted a systematic assessment to refute the perceptions.  Officers at several posts we visited stated a belief that long-term training,  specifically advanced training in hard languages, hinders their promotion  chances. For example, officers in Beijing said that some officers are  reluctant to study a foreign language that requires a 1- or 2-year  commitment because they believe it makes them less competitive for  promotion, and one officer said that she would not have bid on her current  position if she had had to take Chinese first. A former ambassador told us  that many officers feel that language training is a \u201cnet minus\u201d to their  careers, as the department views this as a drain on the staffing system. We  reported similar sentiments in 2006, when several officers said they  believed that State\u2019s promotion system might hinder officers\u2019 ability to  enhance and maintain their language skills over time.  Although senior HR  officials told us that the promotion system weighs time in training as equal  to time at post, they acknowledged that officers applying for promotion  while in long-term training were at a disadvantage compared with officers  assigned to an overseas post. Although promotion boards are required by  law to weigh end-of-training reports for employees in full-time language  training as heavily as the annual employee evaluation reports, officers in  Beijing, Shenyang, Istanbul, and Washington expressed concern that  evaluations for time in training were discounted. State officials said they  have reviewed the results of one promotion board and found a slightly  lower rate of promotions for officers in long-term training at the time of  the review. However, these officials were not sure if these results were  statistically significant and said that the department has not conducted a  more systematic assessment of the issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Lacks a Comprehensive Strategic Plan to Address Foreign Language Requirements", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s approach to addressing its foreign language proficiency  requirements does not reflect a comprehensive strategic approach. As we  previously mentioned, State considers staffing shortfalls and the lack of a  training float to be the primary challenges to achieving the department\u2019s  language proficiency requirements. However, prior work by GAO and  others has shown that addressing a critical human capital challenge\u2014such  as closing or reducing the long-running foreign language proficiency gaps  within State\u2019s Foreign Service corps\u2014requires a comprehensive strategic  plan or set of linked plans that sets a clear direction for addressing the  challenge."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Prior Work by GAO and Others Could Guide State\u2019s Strategic Plan for Addressing Foreign Language Requirements", "paragraphs": ["GAO, OPM, and others have developed a variety of strategic workforce  planning models that can serve as a guide for State to develop a  comprehensive plan to address its language proficiency gaps. Common  elements of these models include setting a strategic direction that includes  measurable performance goals and objectives and funding priorities,  determining critical skills and competencies that will be needed in the  future, developing an action plan to address gaps, and monitoring and  evaluating the success of the department\u2019s progress toward meeting goals.  In 2002, we reported that State had not prepared a separate strategic plan  for developing its foreign language skills or a related action plan to correct  long-standing proficiency shortfalls and recommended that the  department do so. State responded by noting that because language is  such an integral part of the department\u2019s operations, a separate planning  effort for foreign language skills was not needed. During this review,  State officials told us that a comprehensive strategic approach to reducing  foreign language gaps would be useful. The officials mentioned a number  of documents where the department has addressed State\u2019s foreign  language proficiency requirements in various forms, including the Foreign  Language Continuum, the Strategic Plan, a 2007 training needs assessment,  and the Five-Year Workforce Plan, but acknowledged that these  documents are not linked to each other and no one document contains  measurable goals, objectives, resource requirements, and milestones for  reducing the foreign language gap.", "We reviewed these documents and found that while some include a few of  the aforementioned elements of a strategic plan, none of the documents  present a comprehensive plan for State to address its foreign language  proficiency requirements. For example, the Foreign Language  Continuum\u2014a document developed by FSI for FSOs\u2014describes foreign  language training opportunities provided by State and, according to FSI  officials, was meant to serve as a guide for FSOs and not a plan for  reducing language gaps. The joint State-U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID) Strategic Plan contains seven priority goals for  achieving State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s overall mission but only tangentially  addresses the issue of foreign languages by stating that the department  will expand opportunities for classroom training and distance learning in a  number of areas, including foreign languages. It does not discuss if and  how expanding this training will contribute to reducing the department\u2019s  language proficiency gaps, or establish measurable goals, objectives, or  time frames for its performance. The training assessment\u2014a 2007 training  study conducted by HR and FSI to assess State\u2019s current and future  training needs\u2014identified additional positions to be requested in future  budget justifications to increase the training float.", "State\u2019s Five-Year Workforce Plan, which describes the department\u2019s  overall workforce planning, including hiring, training, and assignment  plans, is a step in the right direction. The plan addresses language gaps in  the Foreign Service workforce to a greater extent than any of the other  documents. However, the plan falls short in several respects. First, the  document states that State has established an ongoing monitoring process  to identify and set goals for reducing language skill gaps in the Foreign  Service. This process resulted in the development of an officer-to-position  ratio target of at least 2.5 officers with the required language proficiency  for each language-designated position at the 3/3 proficiency level. State  reports this ratio as a target for meeting its critical needs language  requirements; however, the ratio is not based on quantitative analysis but  on the consensus of a working group consisting of HR and FSI officials. In  developing the ratio, State assumed that the 2.5 officers already have the  required languages and did not link the ratio to the number of officers that  should be in language training and the size of the training float needed to  achieve the 2.5 ratio. Further, State assumed that 3/3 is the appropriate  skill level for the positions, although, as we discussed earlier, some  officers have questioned the validity of that level for certain positions.  Moreover, an HR official responsible for workforce planning at State said  that the 2.5 ratio is very broad and not sufficiently detailed or specific. For  example, the ratio does not take into account the different tour lengths.  More Arabic-speaking officers would be needed for 1-year tours than  Russian speakers for 3-year tours, so the languages should not have the  same target ratio. Also, the assessment treats Foreign Service officers at  all levels equally, even though more senior officers would not fill lower- graded positions. Therefore, even if State achieved the 2.5 ratio for each  language-designated position, not all of the language-designated positions  would be filled. The HR official explained that State is in the process of  improving its methodology for critical needs language assessment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite the various measures that State uses to determine and fill its  language-designated positions, it continues to experience persistent gaps  in its foreign language skills at many posts around the world, and  questions remain about the adequacy of the proficiency requirements.  State recognizes the importance of staffing language-designated positions  with FSOs who possess the requisite language skills to perform their  duties, and has taken some measures intended to address its foreign  language shortfalls, including requesting and receiving funding in 2009 to  build a training capacity, establishing a career development program that  requires FSOs to have sustained professional language proficiency for  consideration for promotion into the senior ranks, and offering special  incentives to attract speakers of foreign languages under its critical needs  language program. However, these individual actions, which State has  relied on for several years to address its language proficiency  requirements, do not constitute a comprehensive strategic approach to  addressing the department\u2019s persistent gaps in language proficiency within  the Foreign Service, and they are not linked to any targets, goals, or time  frames for reducing State\u2019s language gaps. Also, State is not fully assessing  the progress of its efforts toward closing the language gaps. Actions  described in State\u2019s Five-Year Workforce Plan, such as the department\u2019s  attempt to establish an ongoing monitoring process to identify and set  goals for reducing the language skill gaps, are a step in the right direction  that could be built upon to develop a more comprehensive plan. Given the  importance of foreign language competency to the mission of the Foreign  Service, any measures taken to address State\u2019s language proficiency  shortfalls should be part of a comprehensive strategic plan that takes a  long-term view and incorporates the key elements of strategic workforce  planning.
