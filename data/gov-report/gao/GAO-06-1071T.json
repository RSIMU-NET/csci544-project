In April 2004, President Bush called for widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records within 10 years and issued an executive order that established the position of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. A National Coordinator within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was appointed in May 2004 and released a framework for strategic action two months later. In May 2005, GAO recommended that HHS establish detailed plans and milestones for each phase of the framework and take steps to ensure that its plans are followed and milestones are met.

To do this, GAO reviewed prior reports and agency documents on the current status of relevant HHS activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In late 2005, to help define the future direction of a national strategy, HHS awarded several health IT contracts and formed the American Health Information Community, a federal advisory committee made up of health care stakeholders from both the public and private sectors.

These activities and others are being used by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to continue its efforts to complete a national strategy to guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health IT. Since the release of its initial framework in 2004, the office has defined objectives and high-level strategies for accomplishing its goals.

In  preparing this statement, we reviewed agency documents on the  current status of HHS\u2019s activities related to a national health IT  strategy and supplemented our analysis with interviews of agency  officials.

In addition, long-standing problems  with medical errors and inefficiencies increase costs for health care  delivery in the United States. With health care spending in 2004  reaching almost $1.9 trillion, or 16 percent, of the gross domestic  product, concerns about the costs of health care continue. As we  reported last year, many policy makers, industry experts, and  medical practitioners contend that the U.S. health care system is in a  crisis.", "Health IT provides a promising solution to help improve patient  safety and reduce inefficiencies. The expanded use of health IT has  great potential to improve the quality of care, bolster the  preparedness of our public health infrastructure, and save money on  administrative costs. As we reported in 2003, technologies such as  electronic health records and bar coding of certain human drug and  biological product labels have been shown to save money and  reduce medical errors. For example, a 1,951-bed teaching hospital  reported that it realized about $8.6 million in annual savings by  replacing outpatient paper medical charts with electronic medical  records. This hospital also reported saving more than $2.8 million  annually by replacing its manual process for managing medical  records with an electronic process to provide access to laboratory  results and reports. Health care organizations also reported that IT  contributed other benefits, such as shorter hospital stays, faster  communication of test results, improved management of chronic  diseases, and improved accuracy in capturing charges associated  with diagnostic and procedure codes. However, according to HHS,  only a small number of U.S. health care providers have fully adopted  health IT due to significant financial, technical, cultural, and legal  barriers such as a lack of access to capital, a lack of data standards,  and resistance from health care providers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Government\u2019s Role in Health Care", "paragraphs": ["According to the Institute of Medicine, the federal government has a  central role in shaping nearly all aspects of the health care industry  as a regulator, purchaser, health care provider, and sponsor of  research, education, and training. Seven major federal health care  programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, provide health care  services to approximately 115 million Americans. According to HHS,  federal agencies fund more than a third of the nation\u2019s total health  care costs. Table 1 summarizes the programs and number of citizens  who receive health care services from the federal government and  the cost of these services.", "Given the level of the federal government\u2019s participation in  providing health care, it has been urged to take a leadership role in  driving change to improve the quality and effectiveness of medical  care in the United States, including an expanded adoption of IT.", "In April 2004, President Bush called for the widespread adoption of  interoperable electronic health records within 10 years and issued  an executive order that established the position of the National  Coordinator for Health Information Technology within HHS.

The  framework described goals for achieving nationwide  interoperability of health IT and actions to be taken by both the  public and private sectors to implement a strategy.

Last year, we reported that HHS, through the Office  of the National Coordinator for Health IT, had taken a number of  actions toward accelerating the use of IT to transform the health  care industry. To further accelerate the adoption of interoperable  health information systems, we recommended that HHS establish  detailed plans and milestones for meeting the goals of its framework  for strategic action and take steps to ensure that those plans are  followed and milestones are met. The department agreed with our  recommendation.", "We also reported in June 2005 that challenges associated with major  public health IT initiatives still need to be overcome to strengthen  the IT that supports the public health infrastructure. Federal  agencies face many challenges in their efforts to improve the public  health infrastructure, including (1) the integration of current  initiatives into a national health IT strategy and federal architecture  to reduce the risk of duplicative efforts, (2) development and  adoption of consistent standards to encourage interoperability, (3)  coordination of initiatives with state and local agencies to improve  the public health infrastructure, and (4) overcoming federal IT  management weaknesses to improve progress on IT initiatives. To  address these challenges, we recommended that HHS align federal  public health initiatives with the national health IT strategy and  federal health architecture, coordinate with state and local public  health agencies, and continue federal actions to encourage the  development and adoption of data standards.", "Last September, we testified about the importance of defining and  implementing data and communication standards to speed the  adoption of interoperable IT in the health care industry. Hurricane  Katrina highlighted the need for interoperable electronic health  records as thousands of people were separated from their health  care providers and their paper medical records were lost. As we  have noted, standards are critical to enabling this interoperability.  Although federal leadership has been established to accelerate the  use of IT in health care, we testified that several actions were still  needed to position HHS to further define and implement relevant  standards. Otherwise, the health care industry will continue to be  plagued with incompatible systems that are incapable of exchanging  medical information that is critical to delivering care and responding  to public health emergencies.", "In March 2006, we testified before this subcommittee on HHS\u2019s  continued efforts to move forward with its mission to guide the  nationwide implementation of interoperable health IT in the public  and private health care sectors.
