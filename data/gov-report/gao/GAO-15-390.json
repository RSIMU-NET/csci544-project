Federal law requires each state to report on the operation of its review program, a key monitoring tool that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) uses to oversee the review process in states, but GAO identified additional actions that could improve oversight. In the first phase, states use tools and eligibility screening to promote patient safety and avoid abuse before the drugs are dispensed. The second phase involves ongoing and periodic examination of claims data to identify patterns of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or medically unnecessary care, and implement corrective action when needed.", "However, GAO identified two potential controls that are not included in CMS's current reporting requirements:", "Lock-in programs for noncontrolled substances. Lock-in programs address doctor shopping by restricting beneficiaries who have abused the Medicaid program to one health-care provider, one pharmacy, or both, for receiving prescriptions. Lock-in programs have typically been used on controlled substances. Expanding lock-in programs that currently focus on controlled substances to restrict abusers of noncontrolled substances, such as the human immunodeficiency virus medications Atripla and Truvada, to a single prescriber or pharmacy may help address potential fraud and abuse.", "Prohibition of automatic refills.

Federal laws prescribe responsibility for both federal and state entities to  protect the Medicaid program from fraud, waste, and abuse. Specifically,  federal law requires CMS to issue regulations to improve Medicaid  program integrity, with which state Medicaid programs must comply.", "Medicaid is a significant expenditure for the federal government and the  states, with total federal outlays of $310 billion in fiscal year 2014. In  February 2015, we reported that Medicaid remains at high risk because of  concerns about the adequacy of fiscal oversight of the program, including  improper payments to Medicaid providers. In fiscal year 2014, CMS  reported an estimated improper payment rate of 6.7 percent, or $17.5  billion for the Medicaid program, which is an increase over its 2013  estimate of 5.8 percent, or $14.4 billion.", "While most improper payments are not related to fraud, and the full extent  to which fraud, waste, and abuse related to prescription drugs affects  Medicaid is unknown, we have previously identified potentially fraudulent  or abusive practices in CMS\u2019s health-care programs. For example, in September 2009, we found tens of thousands of potential \u201cdoctor  shoppers\u201d of controlled substances in Medicaid. Doctor shopping is a  beneficiary fraud scheme in which patients visit several doctors and  pharmacies, receiving more drugs than any single physician would have  prescribed. Additionally, in September 2011, we reported on indications of  doctor shopping in the Medicare Part D program, which provides  voluntary, outpatient prescription-drug coverage for eligible individuals 65  years and older and eligible individuals with disabilities. As part of that  work, we found that about 170,000 Medicare beneficiaries received  prescriptions from five or more medical practitioners for frequently abused  controlled substances. In both of those reports we made  recommendations that CMS improve efforts to address doctor shopping.  CMS agreed with our recommendations and implemented them. In May  2015, we issued a report on our work associated with Medicaid  beneficiary and provider fraud.", "Because of the substantial amount of funds that are expended in the  Medicaid program and our prior work detailing potential fraudulent or  abusive practices, you asked us to review any pharmacy-related  program-integrity efforts at selected states. Specifically, for this review we  1.  evaluated the reliability of Medicaid data from CMS and selected  states for the purpose of identifying indicators of potential fraud or  abuse;  2.  identified and analyzed indicators, if any, of potentially fraudulent or  abusive activities related to prescription drugs in Medicaid; and  3.  examined the extent to which federal and selected state oversight  policies, controls, and processes are designed to prevent and detect  instances of prescription-drug fraud in Medicaid.", "To evaluate the reliability of Medicaid data from CMS and state Medicaid  programs for our selected states that could be used to identify indicators  of potential fraud or abuse, we took several steps. We vetted 11 states for  possible inclusion in our study. We selected states based on high  Medicaid beneficiary enrollment, geographic diversity, and availability of  data. In the selection process, we also considered whether drugs were  paid under fee-for-service (FFS) or managed care, by including states  that included these program types in our review. We performed electronic  testing to determine the validity of specific data elements in the federal  and selected states\u2019 databases that we used to perform our work. We  also reviewed related documentation, including data layouts and agency  reports. Specifically, we used a January 2013 Mathematica Policy Report  that details Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) state data  characteristics and anomalies to further vet states selected for our audit  work. We also used published GAO and HHS Office of Inspector  General (OIG) reports that detailed the limitations of the MSIS data we  used for our study. Additionally, we interviewed officials responsible for  their respective databases to discuss data-reliability considerations, and  reviewed prior work related to the quality of the MSIS data used for our  study. On the basis of our discussions with agency officials and our own  testing, we concluded that the data elements from four states\u2014Arizona,  Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey\u2014used for this report were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of identifying indicators of potential fraud or  abuse. However, in assessing the reliability of the data, we observed  reportable shortcomings such as issues with timeliness, completeness,  and accuracy in the data that may affect Medicaid administrators\u2019 ability  to effectively oversee their program. However, the results of the data- reliability evaluation only apply to the states we selected for fiscal year  2011 and cannot be generalized to other states or periods. We discuss  these shortcomings in greater detail later in this report.", "To identify indicators of potentially fraudulent or abusive activities related  to prescription drugs in Medicaid, we obtained and analyzed Medicaid  claims paid in fiscal year 2011, the most-recent period from which we  could draw reliable data, for four states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and  New Jersey. Medicaid payments to these states constituted about 13  percent of all Medicaid payments made during fiscal year 2011. These  states were selected primarily because they had consistently comparable  and reliable data and were among the states with the highest Medicaid  expenditures.

The crosswalk data we used contained specific identifying  information on prescribers, pharmacies, and beneficiaries that were not  collected in the MSIS data, such as name and address.", "We reviewed literature related to health-care fraud, including reports  discussing fraud, waste, and abuse related to prescription drugs. We  interviewed federal, state, and private-sector auditors, program  administrators, and other relevant officials that had published work that  investigated or researched prescription-drug fraud. On the basis of this  research, we identified areas at greater risk of fraud and abuse such as  drugs at high risk for diversion and types of prescribing patterns that  warranted additional review. We used this information to develop our  analytic approach to identify indicators of potential fraud and abuse  related to prescription drugs in Medicaid. To identify potential overuse, we  reviewed beneficiaries who received more than a 480-day supply of the  same medication in a single year based on the national drug code. To  identify potential doctor-shopping activities, we examined beneficiaries  who received prescriptions for drugs within one of two therapeutic classes  of drugs from five or more prescribers. We focused on beneficiaries who  received prescriptions for antipsychotics or respiratory medications from  five or more different prescribers over the course of 1 year. We selected  medications in these therapeutic classes because they had a large  number of individuals who received drugs from five or more prescribers  relative to other classes of noncontrolled substances we considered, have  a known diversion risk, and are relatively expensive. We selected the  five-or-more prescribers threshold based on our review of drug diversion  literature and prior GAO work. We also looked for prescribers and  pharmacies with a high proportion of prescribing or dispensing activities  for brand-name drugs (versus generics) compared to the average activity  of other prescribers and pharmacies and we looked for pharmacies  without any adjusted or voided claims. To identify potentially  unnecessary prescription-drug activities, we reviewed claims paid on  behalf of beneficiaries who received human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)  and diabetes medications despite having no HIV or diabetes-related  indicators related to such ailments in their fiscal year 2011 Medicaid  outpatient claims listed in the MSIS \u201cother services\u201d file.", "We also matched the Medicaid data to other external sources to identify  potential fraud and improper payments. These matches sought to identify  individuals who may be ineligible to receive Medicaid benefits or  providers who should not have received Medicaid payments due to  residency, death, or other exclusionary factors. We used the beneficiary  files to identify individuals who had payments made on their behalf  concurrently by two or more of our selected states. We compared the  beneficiary and prescriber identity information shown in the Medicaid  claims data to the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) complete file of  death information to determine whether any individuals were reportedly  deceased when they purportedly prescribed, dispensed, or received  prescription drugs from Medicaid. To identify prescription-drug claims that  might have been improperly processed and paid by the Medicaid program  because either the prescribers or beneficiaries were incarcerated, we  compared the Medicaid claims to data files listing incarcerated individuals  from the four selected states. To identify claims that might have been  improperly processed and paid by the Medicaid program because the  federal government had banned the corresponding prescribers from  providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries, we compared the Medicaid  claims to the exclusion and debarment files from the HHS OIG and the  General Services Administration (GSA). We compared files from the  different states to identify beneficiaries who received concurrent benefits  from multiple states.", "To determine the extent to which federal and state oversight policies,  controls, and processes are designed to prevent and detect indicators of  prescription-drug fraud in Medicaid, we reviewed CMS and state Medicaid  policies pertinent to program integrity over pharmaceuticals, met with  CMS officials, and visited state Medicaid offices that perform oversight  functions for the four states we selected.

Effective point-of-sale edits can address issues such as the potentially  excessive and unnecessary prescriptions described earlier in this  report. Alerts, such as drug\u2013drug interactions or therapeutic  duplication, appear when there is a drug interaction risk or when a  patient is to be dispensed a drug that is in the same therapeutic class  as another recently dispensed drug, respectively.

Other alerts such as  early-refill warnings are routine edits that may signal that the patient is  not taking the drug according to the directions or may be misusing the  medication. Early-refill alerts also help to prevent Medicaid from  paying for excessive amounts of medication above and beyond what  is necessary.

Postpayment reviews involve reviewing  claims and other documents after payment to ensure compliance with  payment rules, and to determine whether the prescription was  medically necessary. These reviews permit states to suspend  payments and obtain and review medical records. Specific tactics  states may choose to employ to find fraud in these payments include  examining claims by amount paid, average costs, number of claims,  adjustment rates, or percentage of claims for brand-name or Drug  Enforcement Administration Schedule II drugs. States can vary the  period of review depending on available data and may monitor overall  activity as well as activity within subsections of the population. For  example, states can look for top beneficiary recipients of a certain  drug or therapeutic class, prescribers who most frequently prescribe  controlled substances, or pharmacies that dispense certain drugs at  an average cost that is significantly higher than that of their peers.  There are numerous ways the data can be analyzed and checks can  be combined to strengthen detection of indicators of potential fraud.  Effective strategies can then be repeated. While it is likely not  possible to determine from data analysis alone whether any given  prescription was appropriate, such analysis can detect anomalies that  might warrant additional audit and investigation outside the DUR  process.

Officials in Arizona and New Jersey stated that their lock-in program  has historically focused on lock-in for controlled substances, although  lock-ins for other drugs were permitted. Officials in Florida stated that  their program does not use lock-in for noncontrolled substances and  has trended towards using point-of-sale edits to restrict doctor- shopping activities related to controlled substances. Michigan officials  stated that the state Medicaid program has two categories of lock-ins:  beneficiaries may be locked in to a specific prescriber for controlled  substances, or beneficiaries may be locked in to specific prescribers  and pharmacies for all medications. Michigan officials indicated that  they apply specific criteria to determine the lock-in category a  beneficiary is assigned.", "According to CMS officials, CMS does not have specific guidance for  the state Medicaid programs on lock-ins. They said that states decide  the requirement for placing a beneficiary in a lock-in program.

Pharmacies may automatically refill  prescriptions for certain medications without any customer action.  Automatic refill services can be employed at both retail and mail- service pharmacies. In retail settings, medications that are not picked  up by the patient within a finite period must be returned to stock.  However, mail-service pharmacies are unable to return the medication  to stock once the prescription is delivered. Concerns with pharmacy  automatic refill include the potential for stockpiling, continued fill of  discontinued medications, and an increase in the cost and waste of  prescription medications. In 2013, CMS banned pharmacy automatic  refills in the Medicare Part D program because these practices were  potentially generating significant waste and unnecessary additional  costs for the Medicare Part D program overall.", "Unlike Medicare Part D, CMS currently does not have specific  guidance on pharmacy automatic refills for the Medicaid program.", "CMS officials stated that policy on pharmacy automatic refills is a  state-specific decision and states may have information in their billing  instructions to pharmacies on their policy regarding automatic refills.  In addition, CMS officials said that each state\u2019s Board of Pharmacy  may have a policy on this subject and that these boards may audit  pharmacies regarding their compliance with state regulations.  Currently, Florida and Arizona are the states in our review that do not  allow automatic refills. When asked why such prohibitions were in  place, officials in Arizona noted that its Medicaid population was  transient, and automatic refills could lead to prescriptions mailed to  old addresses where the beneficiary no longer lived, at the state\u2019s  expense. Officials in Florida cited concerns about beneficiaries  stockpiling medications and not wanting to pay for prescriptions that  were no longer needed.", "Federal regulations define abuse as provider practices that are  inconsistent with sound fiscal, business, or medical practices, and  result in an unnecessary cost to the Medicaid program, or in  reimbursement for services that are not medically necessary.

The Medicare Part D program, as well as Florida  and Arizona Medicaid programs, prohibit automatic refills, citing both  patient safety and unnecessary costs as concerns for implementing these  practices. However, CMS does not collect this information in the DUR  survey or other collection methods. As a result, CMS does not know the  number of state Medicaid programs that prohibit automatic refills or have  lock-in programs for noncontrolled substances.

As we  noted in our meetings with all state agencies included in our study, we did  not provide state-level detail for two primary reasons. First, because CMS  was the audited agency for our work, conducting analysis at the state- level would be outside the scope of our work and would put the focus on  a comparison between the states, rather than on CMS oversight. In  addition, due to the age and limitations of the data, as noted in the report,  we would not be referring specific cases for follow-up. Moreover,  AHCCCS noted that the findings of our study represent less than one- tenth of Medicaid spending for the four states used in our study.  As we  stated previously in this report, all of the states in our study had MCO  arrangements in place during our study period. As a result, the Medicaid  paid amounts associated with managed care may not be reflected in the  state claims that were submitted to CMS for medical services, and hence  our estimate is likely understated.", "AHCCCS also commented on specific sections of our analysis. First,  AHCCCS stated that our report did not identify state practices that are  able to leverage more-accurate data sources on a real-time basis. As  mentioned above, the focus of our work was CMS oversight of the  Medicaid program rather than an in-depth discussion of current, specific  practices employed by the states. Second, AHCCCS incorrectly stated  that we used the federal incarceration file in our analysis. As we note in  appendix I, we used each state\u2019s department of corrections prisoner  databases for individuals incarcerated for any period during fiscal year  2011. Specifically, for our work, we used the same Arizona Department of  Corrections file to perform matches that AHCCCS outlined in its response  letter.

Specifically, we state that we identified beneficiaries who did not have  indicators of HIV or diabetes in their outpatient Medicaid activity from  fiscal 2011, and that the absence of such evidence does not prove that  the beneficiary does not have HIV or diabetes or that there was  inappropriate off-label use. Further we stated that the results of this  analysis may also be caused by off-label use, record-keeping, or data- coding issues. In addition, we noted that timing differences in the prior- authorization process could explain some of these observations. We also  note that we cannot determine from data analysis alone which cases  represent inappropriate prescriptions and which are permissible  prescribing patterns.", "Regarding our analysis of brand-name medications, AHCCCS stated that  our findings represent 0.425 percent of prescribing clinicians. In the draft  report provided to AHCCCS, we provided the number of individuals we  found and the total study population to provide the appropriate context.  AHCCCS also noted that our report did not take into consideration that  states may continue to require brand-name coverage because it may be  more costly to the state to purchase the generic product. As a result, we  incorporated discussion of this limitation in our report. Similarly, AHCCCS  stated that our report does not differentiate between retail pharmacies  and specialty pharmacies, and that some specific specialty pharmacies  are expected to have a high percentage of branded medications. We  noted that we did not control for medications where there was not a  generic version available. However, to address the specific concern of  AHCCCS, we incorporated this caveat into our report.

We performed electronic testing to  determine the validity of specific data elements in the federal and  selected state databases that we used to perform our work. We also  reviewed related documentation, including data layouts and agency  reports.

We discuss  these shortcomings in greater detail earlier in this report.", "On the basis of our discussions with agency officials and our own  To identify indicators of potentially fraudulent or abusive activities related  to prescription drugs in Medicaid, we obtained and analyzed Medicaid  claims paid in fiscal year 2011, the most-recent period from which we  could draw reliable data, for four states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan and  New Jersey. These states accounted for about 13 percent of the federal  share of fiscal year 2011 Medicaid expenditures.

We  interviewed federal, state, and private-sector auditors, program  administrators, and other relevant officials who had published work that  investigated or researched prescription-drug fraud. On the basis of this  research, we identified areas at greater risk of fraud and abuse such as  drugs at high risk for diversion and types of prescribing patterns that  warranted additional review. We used this information to develop our  analytic approach to identify indicators of potential fraud and abuse  related to prescription drugs in Medicaid. To identify potential overuse, we  reviewed beneficiaries who received more than a 480-day supply of the  same medication in a single year based on the national drug code. To  identify potential doctor-shopping activities, we examined beneficiaries  who received prescriptions for drugs within one of two therapeutic classes  of drugs from five or more prescribers. We focused on beneficiaries who  received prescriptions for antipsychotics or respiratory medications from  five or more different prescribers over the course of 1 year. We selected  medications in these therapeutic classes because they had a large  number of individuals who received drugs from five or more prescribers  relative to other classes of noncontrolled substances we considered, have  a known diversion risk, and are relatively expensive. We selected the  five-or-more prescribers threshold based on our review of drug-diversion  literature and prior GAO work. Since we did not focus on all noncontrolled  substances, our analysis understates the number of instances and dollar  amounts related to potential doctor-shopping activities. We also looked  for prescribers and pharmacies with a high proportion of prescribing or  dispensing activities for brand-name drugs (versus generics) compared to  the average activity of other prescribers and pharmacies and pharmacies  without any adjusted or voided claims.", "Our review did not include all drugs that may be used to treat HIV or diabetes. population. We restricted our review to only include beneficiaries who  received at least one prescription written during fiscal year 2011.", "We also matched the Medicaid data to other external sources to identify  potential fraud and improper payments. We compared the beneficiary and  prescriber identity information shown in the Medicaid claims data to the  Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) complete file of death information  from October 2012 to determine whether any individuals were reportedly  deceased before or when they purportedly prescribed, dispensed, or  received prescription drugs covered by Medicaid. To identify prescription- drug claims that might have been improperly processed and paid by the  Medicaid program because either the prescribers or beneficiaries were  incarcerated, we matched our selected states\u2019 MMIS data to the states\u2019  departments of corrections prisoner databases. Prisoner data included  individuals incarcerated for any period during fiscal year 2011. For  Arizona, Florida, and New Jersey, we identified provider and beneficiary  records for which the Medicaid Social Security number (SSN) and names  matched that of a person who was incarcerated in fiscal year 2011 in any  of the four states. Michigan did not provide SSNs in its incarceration data.  For Michigan, we identified provider and beneficiary records for which the  Medicaid name and birth day exactly matched that of a person who was  incarcerated in fiscal year 2011 in any of the four states. We then  identified Medicaid claims associated with the identified individuals by  matching to the MSIS data. We compared the beginning service date of  the claims to the individual\u2019s admittance and release date to identify all  claims that occurred while the associated beneficiary or provider identity  was incarcerated. Additionally, we reviewed these claims\u2019 type of service  to determine that none qualified for federal matching funds.", "It is not possible to determine from data matching alone whether these  matches definitively identify recipients who were deceased or  incarcerated without reviewing the facts and circumstances of each case.  For example, it is possible that individuals can be erroneously listed in the  full Death Master File. Similarly, a provider or beneficiary may have an  SSN, name, and date of birth similar to an individual in state prison  records. Alternatively, our matches may also understate the number of  deceased or incarcerated individuals receiving assistance because  matching would not detect applicants whose identifying information in the  Medicaid data differed slightly from their identifying information in other  databases.", "To identify Medicaid beneficiaries who received benefits in two or more  states concurrently, we identified all beneficiary SSNs that appeared in  two or more states\u2019 MMIS data in fiscal year 2011. We then found all  claims associated with the beneficiary identities. We conducted further  analysis to determine the states in which each beneficiary identity  appeared and the service ranges\u2014first and last prescribed date\u2014for  those states. We defined a concurrent claim as a claim that occurred  within the service range of a second state for the same beneficiary  identity. For each claim, we compared its prescription date to the service  ranges for the beneficiary identity to determine whether it was a  concurrent claim. It is not possible to definitely say through data matching  alone that a beneficiary was improperly receiving Medicaid benefits in two  or more states concurrently without looking into further information for  each claim and beneficiary. For example, a beneficiary could have been a  resident in one state and received services, then changed residency to a  second state and received benefits for a brief period, before finally  relocating again back to the original state and receiving additional  services. In this case, the claims could have been identified as a  concurrent claim even if the beneficiary did not receive any services from  the original state during his or her relocation period in the second state.", "To identify claims that might have been improperly processed and paid by  the Medicaid program because the federal government had excluded  these providers from providing services to Medicaid beneficiaries, we  compared the Medicaid claims to the exclusion and debarment files from  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector  General (OIG) and the General Services Administration (GSA).  Specifically, we used the HHS List of Excluded Individuals and Entities  file from September 2012 and the GSA Excluded Parties List System  database extract from October 2011 to perform our match. We matched  MMIS and MSIS Medicaid data using SSN and individual name with both  the List of Excluded Individuals and Entities and the Excluded Parties List  System data extracts. We then identified unique individuals who had  Medicaid claims processed where the date of exclusion occurred before  the prescribed date in the Medicaid claims file.", "To determine the extent to which federal and state oversight policies,  controls, and processes are designed to prevent and detect instances of  prescription-drug fraud in Medicaid, we reviewed CMS and state Medicaid  policies pertinent to program integrity over pharmaceuticals, met with  CMS officials, and visited state Medicaid offices that perform oversight  functions for the four states we selected. We used federal standards for  internal control, GAO\u2019s Fraud Prevention Framework,statutes and regulations addressing the administration of pharmacy  benefits to evaluate these functions.", "To determine the reliability of the data used in our analysis, we performed  electronic testing to determine the validity of specific data elements in the  federal and selected state databases that we used to perform our work.  We also interviewed officials responsible for their respective databases,  and reviewed documentation related to the databases and literature  related to the quality of the data. On the basis of our discussions with  agency officials and our own testing, we concluded that the data elements  used for this report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We identified criteria for Medicaid fraud controls by examining federal and  state policies, laws, and guidance, including policy memos and manuals.  We interviewed officials from CMS and the state governments of Arizona,  Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey involved in Medicaid program  administration, auditing, and Medicaid fraud response.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 to July 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  audit findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
