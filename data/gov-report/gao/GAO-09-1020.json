Grantees directly provide services to individuals (clients) or arrange with service providers to do so. The Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers CARE Act programs, is required to cancel balances of grants that are unobligated after one year and redistribute amounts to grantees in need. HRSA began to collect client-level data in 2009. Under the CARE Act, states and territories receive grants for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP), which provide HIV/AIDS drugs. GAO was asked to examine elements of the CARE Act. In this report, we review: (1) HRSA's implementation of the unobligated balance provisions, (2) HRSA's actions to collect client-level data, and (3) the status of ADAP waiting lists. GAO reviewed reports and agency documents and interviewed federal officials, officials from 13 state and 5 local health departments chosen based on location and number of cases, and other individuals knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The lack of timely and accurate information reporting by grantees has delayed HRSA's distribution of certain grants and has placed at risk HRSA's ability to obligate these funds. The late submission of actual unobligated balances for the 2007 grant year delayed HRSA's ability to determine grantees' unobligated balances and redistribute these funds to other grantees. A number of grantees were late in their submissions. For example, 21 of the 56 metropolitan areas submitted their information beyond the date initially set by HRSA. Additionally, some grantees reported inaccurate unobligated balances, which required HRSA staff to correspond with grantees and request revised information, creating additional delays. HRSA is authorized to obligate fiscal year 2007 funds for a 3-year period and is at risk of losing the authority to make grants from these funds. HRSA officials said they have made changes to how they implement the unobligated provisions in an effort to avoid these issues in the future. HRSA has taken actions to collect client-level data by implementing a new data collection and reporting system. However, some grantees and service providers did not submit the initial reports by HRSA's deadline. HRSA set a July 31, 2009, submission deadline for grantees' initial reports, but 100 of 638 grantees did not meet this deadline. Client-level data includes information such as the dates clients were served, the types of services provided, and the clients' health status. HRSA has implemented a system to collect data on the number of unique clients from grantees and service providers that will allow HRSA to determine the services each client received and the outcomes of these services. In order for HRSA to collect this information, grantees and service providers must first collect the data using their own systems, and HRSA has provided technical and financial assistance so that they can develop these systems. For example, under a project initiated in 2009, HRSA awarded approximately $4 million to CARE Act grantees for the development of their own client-level data collection systems. The number of ADAPs with waiting lists and the number of individuals on those lists is increasing. In the first quarter of grant year 2008 (April 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008), 2 ADAPs had waiting lists with a total of 55 people on those lists; this grew to 3 ADAPs and a total of 112 people in the fourth quarter of the year, and increased to 4 ADAPs and 136 individuals in August 2009. Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, and Wyoming were each maintaining a waiting list for ADAP services in August 2009; Nebraska had the largest number of individuals (71), and Wyoming had the smallest number (5). ADAP officials expressed concern that they will have to establish or expand waiting lists or implement other cost-control measures, such as limiting the number of drugs they make available."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["It has been more than 28 years since the first cases of acquired  immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States were reported in  June 1981.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) estimates that approximately 1.1 million people were living with  HIV infection in the United States at the end of 2006, and that there were  56,300 new HIV infections in that year.", "The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990  (CARE Act), administered by the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019s (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA),  was enacted to address the needs of jurisdictions, health care providers,  and people with HIV/AIDS and their family members. Each year CARE  Act programs provide assistance to over 530,000 mostly low-income,  underinsured, or uninsured individuals living with HIV/AIDS. Under the  CARE Act, approximately $2.2 billion in grants were made to states,  localities, and others in fiscal year 2009. CARE Act programs have been  reauthorized three times (1996, 2000, and 2006) and are scheduled to be  reauthorized again in 2009. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment  Modernization Act of 2006 (RWTMA) reauthorized CARE Act programs for  fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2009.", "Part A of the CARE Act provides for grants to selected metropolitan  areas\u2014known as eligible metropolitan areas (EMA) and transitional grant  areas (TGA)\u2014that have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS  epidemic. Part B provides for grants to states, the District of Columbia,  and territories and associated jurisdictions to improve quality, availability,  and organization of HIV/AIDS services, including grants specifically for  AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP). ADAPs provide medications for  the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Program funds may also be used to purchase  health insurance for eligible clients and for services that enhance access  to, adherence to, and monitoring of drug treatments. ADAP grants  accounted for about 37 percent of the total $2.2 billion in CARE Act grants  awarded in fiscal year 2009. ADAPs and other programs funded through  CARE Act grants serve as the payers of last resort for eligible individuals  who have no other private or public sources available for the services they  need. Some ADAPs have struggled to meet the demand for their services  and have established waiting lists for eligible individuals who will be  served when space in the program becomes available and have taken other  measures that restrict access and control costs. For example, in the past  ADAPs have required that individuals make a copayment in order to  receive a drug and have placed caps on expenditures per enrollee.", "Most CARE Act funding is distributed to grantees either as base or  supplemental grants. Base grants are distributed by formula, and HRSA  uses a grantee\u2019s share of living HIV/AIDS cases to determine the amount of  base grants. Supplemental grants are generally awarded through a  competitive process based on the demonstration of severe need and other  criteria. Grantees may deliver services directly to individuals (clients) or  arrange with service providers to provide client services.", "RWTMA added provisions regarding the obligation of funds by Part A and  Part B grantees. In the past, some CARE Act grantees did not obligate all  of their funds in some years, while others obligated all of their funds.  RWTMA provided that base and supplemental grants were available for  obligation by the grantee for a 1-year period beginning on the date  awarded funds first became available to the grantee (i.e., the grant year). It  also required HRSA to cancel any unobligated balances at the end of the  grant year, recover funds that had been disbursed to grantees, and  redistribute these funds to grantees in need as supplemental grants.  Under appropriations acts enacted since RWTMA, funds for these grants  are available for obligation by HRSA for a 3-year period. For example,  fiscal year 2007 appropriations are available until September 30, 2009.", "In 2009, HRSA began requiring the collection of client-level data from  grantees and service providers. Client-level data refers to information on  each client receiving CARE Act-funded services, such as the dates services  were received, the types of services provided, and current health status.  Previously, grantees and service providers submitted only aggregate data  to HRSA on those being served. To help ensure the accountability of CARE  Act funds, HRSA has begun to collect client-level data. Implementing a  client-level data collection and reporting system can allow HRSA to obtain  accurate information on the medical and support services received by  each unique client served with CARE Act funds. HRSA requires grantees  and service providers to complete specified reports and transfer these  reports electronically to HRSA.", "As Congress prepares to reauthorize CARE Act programs, you asked us to  examine various elements of CARE Act programs.

We also reviewed all grant year 2007 Part A  and B financial status reports provided to us by HRSA. We reviewed HRSA  documentation on grantees\u2019 carryover requests and financial status reports  as well as HRSA documentation on grantees\u2019 unobligated balances at the  end of grant year 2007. We interviewed HRSA officials and asked follow-up  questions related to the calculation of unobligated balances, discrepancies  in the carryover requests and financial status reports, grantee estimates of  their unobligated balances that differed from their actual unobligated  balances, and information provided by grantees that we found to be  incorrect. We determined that the information provided to us by HRSA  was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To examine the actions taken by HRSA to collect client-level data, we  reviewed statements, manuals, and other materials on the implementation  of client-level data collection by HRSA, grantees, and service providers.  We focused on 2009, the first year grantees and service providers were  required by HRSA to submit client-level data, including deadlines for data  submission. In addition, we interviewed officials at HRSA as well as  officials from 12 state and 5 local health departments who are  knowledgeable about the CARE Act and the client-level data that grantees  and service providers must collect. We also interviewed officials from the  Henry J.

RWTMA provides that  Part A and Part B grant funds are available for obligation for a one-year  period beginning on the date funds first become available (referred to as  the grant year for the award). RWTMA requires HRSA to cancel the  unobligated balance of grant awards at the end of a grant year and to  require grantees to return any amounts from such balances that have been  disbursed to them. However, in the case of base grants, a grantee may  submit a request to carry over the unobligated balance prior to the end of  the grant year. If HRSA approves the request, the unobligated balance that  is approved for carryover (carryover funds) is available to the grantee for  expenditure for a one-year period beginning upon the expiration of the  grant year (referred to as a carryover year). Under the RWTMA  unobligated balance provisions, HRSA is required to cancel any  unexpended balance of carryover funds at the end of the carryover year.  HRSA must make the canceled balances from the grant awards (that is,  funds that were not eligible or approved for carryover and carryover funds  that remain after the carryover year) available as supplemental grants for  the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which HRSA obtains  the information necessary for determining the balance available. Part A  grantees with greater than 2 percent of their base grant awards  unobligated at the end of the grant year and Part B grantees with greater  than 2 percent of their Part B and ADAP base awards unobligated at the  end of the grant year incur a penalty. RWTMA requires HRSA to reduce the  amount of those grants by the same amount as the unobligated balance for  the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which HRSA obtains  the information necessary for determining the unobligated balance. The  grant funds that become available as a result of these reductions are also  to be made available as supplemental grants.", "RWTMA\u2019s authorization of appropriations for base and supplemental  grants under Parts A and B provided that amounts appropriated for a fiscal  year would be available for obligation until the end of the second  succeeding fiscal year. Further, under appropriations acts enacted since  RWTMA, funds for grants under Parts A and B, to which the unobligated  balance provisions apply, are available for obligation for a 3-year period.  In fiscal year 2007, for example, funds were made available for obligation  until September 30, 2009\u2014the end of the 2009 federal fiscal year. Thus, as  HRSA recognized in its guidance regarding the unobligated balance  provisions, the initial obligation of funds, cancellation of unobligated  balances, return of amounts disbursed to grantees, and the recompetition  and redistribution of supplemental grants would need to occur within the  3-year window.", "In order to implement the RWTMA unobligated balance provisions, HRSA  created a multistep process for grantees and issued a policy notice to  grantees explaining this process. HRSA\u2019s process for implementing the  unobligated balance provisions in grant year 2007 included five steps.  First, a grantee wishing to carry over funds was required to submit a  carryover request to HRSA with an estimated unobligated balance of base  grant funds 60 days prior to the end of the grant year. In addition to the  estimated unobligated balance, the initial carryover request also had to  contain a viable plan and detailed budget for the use of the funds, and a  description of the grantee\u2019s capacity to utilize the funds within one-grant  year. Part A grantees had to submit their initial carryover request to HRSA  by January 1, 2008. Part B grantees had to submit their initial carryover  request to HRSA by February 1, 2008.", "The second step of the 2007 grant year process was the evaluation of the  initial carryover requests. HRSA authorized grantees that obtained  approval before the end of the 2007 grant year to carryover 50 percent of  the amount they requested in this initial carryover request. To authorize  the use of the carryover funds, HRSA issued these grantees a notice of  grant award that explained to the grantees that HRSA had effectively  transferred the carryover funds from their grant year 2007 account into  their grant year 2008 account, though balances remained, in effect,  available to the grantees for obligation until the end of grant year 2007.  HRSA officials explained that they did not authorize the full amount of the  initial carryover request because they believed it was possible that the  grantees that requested waivers would incur obligations greater than  anticipated in the 60-day estimate. HRSA officials stated that they wanted  to authorize the carryover of a portion of the unobligated balance so that  grantees with approved carryover requests would have a longer period of  time to obligate the carried over funds.", "For step three of HRSA\u2019s 2007 grant year unobligated balance process,  grantees were required by HRSA to submit a Financial Status Report  (FSR) 90 days after the end of the grant year. The FSR contains, among  other things, a grantee\u2019s actual unobligated balance. For Part A grantees,  FSRs were due on June 1, 2008. For Part B grantees, FSRs were due on  June 30, 2008. HRSA can extend the deadlines for grantees for submission  of their FSRs and granted extensions for 30 to 180 days.", "For step four of the process, although not required by HRSA for grant year  2007, grantees could submit a final carryover request based on their actual  unobligated balances. Those grantees that had their initial carryover  requests approved and had been authorized by HRSA to carry over   50 percent of their unobligated balances at that time, could apply for the  remaining funds (the difference between the 50 percent they had already  been authorized to carry over by HRSA and their actual unobligated  balance). HRSA then authorized the use of the additional amount of  carryover funds by issuing a notice of grant award.", "For step five of this process, grantees with unobligated balances of greater  than 2 percent of their grant year 2007 Part A, Part B, and ADAP base  grants were assessed a penalty. This penalty was a corresponding  reduction in grant year 2009 funds. In addition, Part A and B grantees  with unobligated balances of greater than 2 percent for grant year 2007  were ineligible to receive supplemental grants in grant year 2009. For   Part A grantees this meant that they were not eligible to receive grant year  2009 Part A supplemental grants. For Part B base grantees this resulted in  ineligibility to receive grant year 2009 Part B supplemental grants. For   Part B ADAP grantees, an unobligated balance of greater than 2 percent  does not result in ineligibility for ADAP supplemental grants. Instead,  ineligibility for the ADAP supplemental grant occurs when a grantee has  not obligated at least 75 percent of its ADAP grant award within 120 days  of the award.", "Figure 1 shows a timeline for Part A and B grant distribution and the  distribution and the  unobligated balance provisions.  unobligated balance provisions.", "HRSA cancelled and recovered $13,764,295 in combined grant year 2007  Part B base and supplemental unobligated balances from 16 Part B  grantees with unobligated balances of greater than 2 percent.

HRSA officials stated that the implementation  of procedures to process, approve, and authorize carryover funding  required significant staff time from the HRSA project officer, grants  management staff, and program managers. The HRSA process called for  staff to review these initial carryover requests, approve them, and  authorize carryover funding to be transferred from the grantees\u2019 2007  accounts into their 2008 accounts. HRSA officials stated that the multiple  grantee submissions, which often included revised proposals, resulted in  processing delays and confusion for HRSA staff. On average, it took HRSA  staff 3 months to complete processing of Part A grantees\u2019 initial  unobligated balance carryover requests and 4 months for Part B grantees.  Because grantees were only given until the end of grant year 2008 to  expend carry over funds, grantees who received authorization to carryover  funds after the start of the grant year did not have the entire grant year to  expend these funds.", "In light of HRSA\u2019s difficulty implementing procedures related to the  submission of initial carryover requests and the differences between  grantees\u2019 estimated and actual unobligated balances, HRSA has decided to  discontinue its process of approving initial carryover waiver requests  based on estimated unobligated balances."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HRSA Has Taken Actions to Collect Client-Level Data, but Some Grantees Did Not Submit Initial Reports by the Deadline", "paragraphs": ["HRSA has taken actions to collect client-level data by implementing a new  data collection and reporting system.

Topics discussed included data collection  and reporting barriers, data elements to be collected, how the data would  be used, and the technical assistance that would be available from HRSA.  Using information from these sessions, HRSA finalized the Ryan White  HIV/AIDS Program Services Report (RSR), its client-level data collection  and reporting system. RSR consists of three reports: the Grantee Report,  the Service Provider Report, and the Client Report. RSR was submitted to  the Office of Management and Budget for approval in November 2008,  which granted approval for HRSA to collect data from grantees and  service providers using RSR in March 2009.", "HRSA stated that RSR will improve information on the clients served, the  services provided to clients, and the outcomes of the services provided.  RSR is designed to provide HRSA with a more accurate measure of the  number of unique clients receiving CARE Act-funded services by assigning  each individual an encrypted Unique Client Identifier thereby allowing the  tracking of individuals who receive services from multiple providers.  Because RSR will contain client-specific data, HRSA will be able to  determine the services each client received and the outcomes of these  services.", "RSR is part of a process through which HRSA plans to collect information,  including client-level data, from grantees and service providers funded  under CARE Act Parts A, B, C, D, and F. First, the grantees and service  providers collect data using their own data collection systems. Second, the  grantees and service providers report the data to HRSA in specified  reports using RSR. HRSA has stated that it intends to use the data  collected through RSR to generate reports on the use of CARE Act funds  and the providers that receive them. HRSA reports are expected to provide  client-level information on the characteristics of the clients served, the  types of services they received from the provider, and their current health  status.

There are grantees who  must develop new systems while other grantees\u2019 systems require  modification to enable them to generate data compatible with the  requirements of RSR. HRSA administered a Special Projects of National  Significance (SPNS) initiative in fiscal year 2008 and another in fiscal year  2009 to provide funds to support CARE Act grantees in developing client- level data systems that could be used to report information to RSR.  Under the fiscal year 2008 SPNS initiative, HRSA awarded 17 grants  ranging from $87,000 to $200,000 to all 17 CARE Act Parts A and B  grantees that applied for funding. Under the fiscal year 2009 SPNS  initiative, HRSA awarded a total of approximately $4 million to all 57   Parts C and D grantees that applied for funding.

In addition to the  SPNS funds, HRSA has made other funding available for infrastructure  development. In 2008, HRSA provided a total of more than $1 million to 15  CARE Act Part C grantees that included funds for them to develop their  client-level data systems. As of April 2009, HRSA was reviewing 72  applications for infrastructure development grants.", "HRSA also provided technical assistance to CARE Act grantees and  service providers to develop client-level data collection and reporting  systems. HRSA established the Technical Assistance Resources, Guidance,  Education & Training Web site to provide information and resources, such  as help desk support. HRSA conducted training sessions and webcasts to  provide information on issues relating to implementing a client-level data  system. Additionally, HRSA established the RSR Triage Committee to  monitor and address the technical assistance needs of grantees. The  committee meets weekly to discuss technical assistance concerns of  grantees and monitors contractors charged with addressing technical  concerns on behalf of HRSA.
