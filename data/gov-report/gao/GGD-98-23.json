DC plans provide retirement benefits that are based on employer and/or employee contributions to individual employee accounts and the investment experience of those accounts. Specifically, this report describes patterns in the plans\u2019 (1) eligibility requirements for employee participation, (2) arrangements for employer and participant contributions, (3) eligibility requirements for employee rights to accrued benefits, (4) employee investment options, (5) loan and other provisions for participant access to plan assets while still employed, and (6) options for withdrawal of benefits upon separation or retirement. Consistent with the Subcommittee\u2019s interest, this report also presents information on the six features for the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)\u2014the defined contribution plan component of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)\u2014for comparison. Also as agreed, this report summarizes the explanations provided in retirement literature and by pension experts with whom we consulted on why employers might decide to sponsor more than one pension plan for the same groups of employees.", "We developed data on the features of pension plans sponsored by a representative sample of private employers with 100 or more employees that sponsored only single-employer DC plans in 1993 by reviewing summary plan descriptions (SPD)\u2014documents describing plans\u2019 features that private employers were to file with the Department of Labor (DOL) for each pension plan they sponsored. We also report on the subset of employers with 10,000 or more employees because these employers may provide a more relevant comparison with the federal government. Using a computerized research database maintained by DOL, we also developed information on the number of plans offered by all employers with two or more employees that sponsored only single-employer DC plans in 1993 as well as other information useful for our analysis. All the numbers presented in this report are point estimates of population values and have an associated sampling error of not more than 10 percent at the 95-percent confidence level unless otherwise specified. As agreed with the Subcommittee, because we obtained our plan information from published SPDs rather than directly from employers, we generally were able to describe how employers structured their DC plans to the extent that the information was available in these descriptions, and we were not able to provide the rationale behind the employers\u2019 decisions regarding plan design. We gathered the information on TSP that is presented in this report from published documents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Employer-sponsored pension plans, in combination with Social Security and personal savings, provide millions of retirees and their families with retirement income. As we reported in our October 1996 report, most employers that sponsor pension plans provide benefits using a DC plan.For a DC plan, the employer establishes an individual account for each eligible employee and generally promises to make a specified contribution to that account each year. Employee contributions are also often allowed or required and can be made on either a pretax or after-tax basis. Pretax contributions are not taxed in the year they are earned, but rather, they are taxed when withdrawn from the employee\u2019s account. After-tax contributions are taxable in the year that they are earned as part of the employee\u2019s annual income. Employers can make \u201cmatching\u201d contributions, which are made only if employees also contribute to their accounts, and/or \u201cnonmatching\u201d contributions that are made regardless of whether or not employees contribute to their accounts. The employee\u2019s retirement benefits depend on the total of employer and employee contributions to the account as well as the account\u2019s investment gains and losses.", "In the early 1980s, Congress began to consider a new retirement system for federal civilian employees that would be more like private sector retirement systems and include a DC plan component. As a result, in 1986 the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act was enacted, which closed the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to new entrants and established FERS for employees generally hired after December 31, 1983. FERS is a three-tiered program that includes a basic annuity in addition to the defined contribution TSP and Social Security. Although FERS provides an annuity in addition to Social Security and DC pension benefits, many financial planners believe that under current market conditions income from participant and government contributions to TSP alone could generate 50 percent or more of the retirement income available to most FERS participants. Thus, it may be useful for policymakers to know how the features of TSP compare with the features of private sector DC plans.", "In comparing the features of private and public sector pension plans, it is important to consider key differences between private and public employers. Notably, private sector employers can deduct the cost of providing pension benefits from their taxable revenues. To qualify for these tax advantages, however, private employers must be in compliance with complex and frequently changing laws and regulations. Public employers need not comply with all of the rules that private employers face in designing and modifying their pension systems. Public sector pension benefits must be legislated, and changes to retirement programs for public employees involve political as well as business, financial, and human resource management issues.", "Notwithstanding the different environments in which private and public pensions evolve, it is also important to recognize that all employers that sponsor pension and other employee benefit programs do so for the same underlying business and financial reasons, which include to (1) attract and maintain an effective workforce in a competitive marketplace, (2) motivate employees to work towards meeting their employers\u2019 goals, and (3) manage the transition of older employees from work to retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To provide the requested information on patterns in plans\u2019 features, we reviewed SPDs\u2014documents that all private employers were to file with DOL for each pension plan they sponsored\u2014for a sample of private sector employers with 100 or more employees that sponsored only single-employer DC plans to supplement their employees\u2019 Social Security retirement benefits. We stratified our sample by employer size using 3 groups\u2014employers with 100 to 999 employees, 1,000 to 9,999 employees, and 10,000 or more employees. Because of the larger sampling error associated with the first two strata, we reported on two groups\u2014all the employers in our sample and the subset of larger employers with 10,000 or more employees, the one stratum for which our sample included the entire population of such employers. Because DOL officials told us that the Department would not be able to provide SPDs for all the employers in our sample, we requested SPDs from DOL and directly from the employers. As a result, we were able to obtain and analyze 281 SPDs\u201467 percent of the 419 employers in our sample. In considering the representativeness of the sample of employers for which we had obtained SPDs, we found that the 281 employers were generally comparable to our universe of 3,297 employers, in terms of employer size, industry type, and geographic region.", "We also analyzed pension plan information that was available from DOL\u2019s research database from which we had selected our sample of employers to provide additional information on the plans\u2019 features.

Also as agreed, our review included the largest primary plan offered by private employers that sponsored only DC plans in 1993, the most recent data available at the time of our review. We included only single-employer plans in our analyses, because the research database did not identify all of the employers associated with each multiemployer plan.

Moreover, we could not confirm that the SPDs provided by DOL represented the most up-to-date information for each DC plan in our sample. Lastly, due to differences such as those described in the background section of this report, pension plan experiences in the private sector may not be applicable to the federal government.", "To provide information on the use of multiple plans, we used the DOL research database to identify the number of private employers with two or more employees that sponsored more than one DC plan to provide benefits for the same groups of employees in 1993. We did not independently verify DOL\u2019s criteria for identifying plans in their research database as primary versus supplementary. To obtain insights on what factors employers may consider in deciding whether to sponsor multiple plans, we reviewed retirement-related literature and consulted with pension experts, which we selected on the basis of prior work we had done on private sector pensions.", "Appendixes I and II provide more detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology and the results obtained, respectively.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of Labor.

These eligibility requirements allow employers to reduce the administrative costs associated with establishing individual accounts for employees. Flexibility to establish minimum participation requirements may be especially useful to employers facing high turnover rates. Such requirements allow employers to use their resources to benefit employees who are more likely to remain with the employer for the long term. Under ERISA, as amended, employers cannot require employees to be over age 21 or to have completed more than 1 year of service with the employer. However, an exception applies to plans where participants immediately own all employer contributions made to individual accounts\u2014employers may require that employees complete 2 years of service to be eligible to participate in these plans.", "Of the 3,297 employers with 100 or more employees that sponsored only single-employer DC plans in 1993, 51 percent (1,673 employers) reported using some combination of age and length of service to determine when an employee was eligible to participate in the plan. The most common combination, which was used by 73 percent of these 1,673 employers, was that an employee must be age 21 with 1 year of service\u2014the legal limit. For the 100 larger employers, 55 percent used only length of service to determine eligibility (with most requiring 1 year of service), while 28 percent used a combination of age and service (with 93 percent requiring an age of 21 and 1 year of service). Figure 1 shows the distribution of employers according to the type of eligibility requirement used.", "Although the summary plan documents did not provide information on the rate of participation among covered employees, we were able to determine the percentage of employees with active accounts in 1993 for 2,127 (or 65 percent) of the employers in our review using DOL\u2019s research database. For these employers, 74 percent had a participation rate of 76 to 100 percent, 18 percent had 51 to 75 percent participation, 4 percent had 26 to 50 percent participation, and 4 percent had 25 percent participation or less.

A high or low rate of participation may be a reflection of whether or not employers contributed to their plans. According to experts with whom we consulted, employers that reported 100 percent participation generally made contributions automatically to participant accounts.", "Newly hired federal employees covered by FERS are eligible to participate in TSP during the second open season after they are hired. Two open seasons are held each year (May 15 to July 31 and November 15 to January 31); thus, the minimum service required to participate ranges from 6 to 12 months.

Employer contributions can be based on the amount a participant contributes (i.e., matching contributions), on some other criteria unrelated to participant contributions (i.e., nonmatching contributions), or on some combination of the two. For example, an employer could make matching contributions by providing $1 for each dollar a participant contributes up to a specified maximum. Alternatively, an employer could make nonmatching contributions determined on the basis of annual profitability or a specified percentage of participant compensation.", "In addition to employer matching and nonmatching contributions, participants may be allowed or required to contribute to their DC plan. Plans can provide for participant contributions to be made on a pretax or after-tax basis or on some combination of the two. For pretax contributions, employers generally reduce a participant\u2019s salary by an agreed upon amount and contribute these funds directly to the participant\u2019s DC account, thereby allowing the participant to defer paying income taxes on this portion of their salary until the funds are withdrawn from the account, presumably at or during retirement.", "Regardless of the type(s) of contributions employers and/or participants make to the plan, each employer must ensure that total contributions to participant accounts do not exceed certain legal limits set by ERISA, as amended. Specifically, the annual dollar contribution limit to a DC participant account is the lesser of $30,000, or 25 percent of participant compensation. Moreover, participant pretax contributions are limited to $9,500 per year and participant after-tax contributions may be limited to allow employers to satisfy certain nondiscrimination rules.

For the 100 larger employers, 94 percent provided for employer contributions, and 6 percent provided only for participant contributions to the plan. Thus, most employers that sponsor only DC plans contribute towards their employees\u2019 retirement benefits rather than require that their employees bear the entire cost. As shown in figure 2, 85 percent of the 3,297 employers provided for employer nonmatching, 43 percent for employer matching, 50 percent for participant pretax, and 16 percent for participant after-tax contributions.

It is important to note that employers that sponsor supplementary pension plans do not necessarily offer more comprehensive or \u201cgenerous\u201d retirement benefits than employers that offer only a primary plan.

One expert with whom we consulted suggested that a greater proportion of larger employers may sponsor supplementary plans, because these employers are more likely to have initially sponsored plans that were later supplemented with a 401(k) plan to compete with other employers. This same expert also noted that smaller employers were better able to cope with managing multiple plans during the period before computer technology was readily available.", "The proportion of employers that sponsored multiple plans covering the same groups of employees were also fairly evenly distributed across different industry categories, although employers in the services industry were about 30 percent more likely to sponsor supplementary plans, on average. Employers in the mining, communications, and utilities industries as well as tax-exempt employers were the least likely to sponsor supplementary plans. Appendix III provides more detailed information on the number of employers that sponsored primary and supplementary plans in 1993, stratified by employer size and industry group.", "Pension experts with whom we consulted and pension-related literature suggested various factors that may explain why some employers might choose to offer more than one pension plan to their employees. According to these sources, employers that sponsor pension plans are primarily concerned with controlling benefit costs, maximizing the federal tax incentives for providing pensions, and meeting the legal requirements of ERISA, as amended. Employers must also design their compensation and benefit packages to support their overall business and financial goals. For example, employers may use multiple pension plans to (1) recruit and retain certain groups of employees while also satisfying longer-tenured employees, (2) enhance productivity and employee morale, (3) reduce pension liabilities by shifting a portion of pension contributions to employees, and/or (4) link compensation to performance for higher paid employees, as described in more detail below. These sources also said that computer technology has made it possible for more employers to manage multiple pension plans than would have been practical using only paper records. As a result, employers may choose to sponsor multiple plans that provide different combinations of pay and benefits to different groups of employees.", "According to the experts, employers must meet industry benefit standards to remain competitive in attracting new employees and encouraging those employees to stay with the company. By providing more than one pension plan, employers can encourage career employment while meeting the needs of younger, more mobile, workers with desired skills. For example, younger and more mobile workers may demand a 401(k) plan in their benefits packages to allow them to build up retirement benefits that are fully portable should they change jobs. On the other hand, a basic annuity (or \u201cdefined benefit\u201d) plan may provide better benefits for employees who remain with an employer for the long term. By offering a pension program consisting of both these types of plans, employers can satisfy the needs of both groups of employees.", "Employers may sponsor employee stock option plans (ESOP) and profit sharing plans for a variety of reasons, only one of which is to provide employees with primary or supplementary retirement benefits. These plans can enhance employee productivity by increasing employee identification with the company and providing a more direct incentive for improved job performance. These plans also give employers the option of whether to contribute to the plan in any given year, depending on company profitability. For an ESOP, other benefits can include creating a more liquid market for closely held stock, raising new capital, obtaining financing at below-market interest rates, and sheltering profits from corporate income taxes.", "New retirement programs that include one or more DC plans may reflect a cultural shift away from benefits paid solely by the employer towards a partnership relationship between the employer and employees. By offering a combination of pension plans, employers allow employees to influence their own level of benefits according to their participation and investment choices. Employers that offer a combination of a basic annuity and a DC plan can guarantee a certain minimum level of retirement benefits, while employees can choose the extent to which they participate in supplementary plans to increase their potential benefits upon retirement.", "Employers can increase the benefits available to their senior executives and other highly paid employees by sponsoring supplementary plans that are not covered by ERISA and benefit only selected groups of employees. Although these \u201cnonqualified\u201d plans are not accorded preferential tax treatment, and therefore do not provide employers with tax benefits, employers can use them to motivate executives by linking the amount of benefits to some measurable level of performance, such as total sales.
