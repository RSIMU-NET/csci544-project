Its Customs Division, within the American Samoa Department of Treasury, inspects passengers, baggage, and cargo, and collects excise taxes. The immigration program is administered by the Immigration Office and the Immigration Board, which both report to the American Samoa Attorney General. The Immigration Office is responsible for document issuance, operations, and enforcement, while the Immigration Board holds hearings to decide on issues such as alien work authorization. The Office of the Attorney General is responsible for, among other things, issuing Certificates of Identity (CI), which American Samoans may use to demonstrate their nationality when traveling to the rest of the United States. American Samoa and U.S. government agencies report that American Samoa's operations of its customs and immigration programs may pose risks to American Samoa and the rest of the United States, but U.S. agencies have not conducted a risk assessment. Regarding customs, potential risks to American Samoa are lost revenues and the possible aiding of criminal activities. While the Customs Division has written policies and procedures to govern duties and responsibilities, American Samoa and U.S. law enforcement officials are concerned that American Samoa Customs officials have accepted bribes for improperly inspecting containers, which could result in lost tax revenues. American Samoan and U.S. officials have identified no concerns to the rest of the United States from American Samoa's operations of its customs program. Regarding immigration, the principal concern to American Samoa is that current enforcement practices of immigration laws have led to the potential for alien exploitation and human trafficking. The American Samoa legislature is proposing changes that may address these issues, but it is too soon to tell what impact these changes, if passed, will have. U.S. officials state that the potential risk to the rest of the United States from American Samoa's current immigration operations is illegal immigration into the rest of the United States as a result of travelers obtaining false documentation, such as a CI, in American Samoa. While Department of State officials are aware of allegations of illegal immigration from aliens fraudulently obtaining CIs, and are working with law enforcement officials in American Samoa on an ongoing investigation into such allegations, this investigation will address the security of the process for obtaining U.S. passports and will not address the reported vulnerabilities in the process for issuing CIs. U.S. agencies have not performeda risk assessment to determine the threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences associated with aliens using false documents to travel to the rest of the United States from American Samoa. Performing a risk assessment could better position U.S. agencies to understand the extent of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences associated with the use of CIs, and better inform decisions on which documents would be considered acceptable for those wishing to travel to the rest of the United States from American Samoa."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American Samoa, a U.S. insular area, operates both its customs and  immigration programs independent of the United States government.

In late September 2009, one of American Samoa\u2019s two tuna  canneries closed operations and American Samoa also experienced an  earthquake and tsunami, which caused considerable damage.", "American Samoa According to the latest data available, American Samoa had a population  of about 63,780 in 2005. At that time, the foreign-born population (non- U.S. citizens or nationals), mostly from the independent state of Samoa,  comprised approximately one-third of American Samoa\u2019s total population  (see fig. 2). The American Samoa Department of Commerce estimated  that in 2008, 45 percent to 55 percent of the total population was foreign  born. Unlike residents born in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents born and raised in  American Samoa are U.S. nationals and not U.S. citizens, though they may  become naturalized U.S. citizens. Like residents of these other insular  areas, though, residents of American Samoa have many of the rights of  citizens of the 50 states, but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections and  do not have voting representation in the final approval of legislation by the  full Congress.

In these deeds, the United States pledged to promote  peace and welfare, to establish a good and sound government, and to  preserve the rights and property of the people. The U.S. Navy was initially  responsible for federal governance of American Samoa. Then, in 1951,  federal governance was transferred to the Secretary of the Interior, which  continues today. The Secretary of the Interior exercises broad powers  with regard to American Samoa, including \u201call civil, judicial, and military  powers\u201d of government in American Samoa. American Samoa has had its  own constitution since 1960, and since 1983, the local American Samoa  constitution may only be amended by an act of Congress. The American  Samoa constitution provides for three separate branches of government\u2014 the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. Nearly 40 American Samoa  departments, offices, and other entities within the executive branch of the  American Samoa government provide public safety, public works,  education, health, commerce, and other services.

According to these  officials, potential risks to the government of American Samoa from its  customs operations include lost revenues and the possible aiding of  criminal activities based on allegations of inadequate enforcement.  Regarding American Samoa\u2019s immigration program, U.S. and American  Samoan government officials stated their principal concerns are that  current enforcement practices may lead to (1) exploitation of aliens by  sponsors, (2) incidents of human trafficking, (3) overstays by aliens, and  (4) exceeding numerical limits of aliens. In contrast, the potential risks  identified by U.S. officials for the rest of the United States are more  limited.

Another effect of  inadequate enforcement of customs laws is that there is the potential for  lost revenues for the government if proper excise taxes are not collected  on goods imported in each imported cargo container. While the Customs  Division has written policies and procedures, and also has certain internal  controls in place\u2014such as rotating staffs\u2019 responsibilities so that the same  customs officers do not always inspect containers at the same  businesses\u2014there is no automated computer system within the Customs  Division to track cargo manifests, container inspections, verification of  deposits, parcel taxes at the post office, or interisland ferry excise taxes.

Additionally,  American Samoa government\u2019s 2005 threat assessment reported a lack of  management and oversight control by immigration officials with regard to  the enforcement of policies and procedures.", "As of March 31, 2010, the Immigration Office reported 20,282 aliens in  American Samoa for employment reasons, which is about 58 percent of  the estimated 34,874 aliens in American Samoa. In general, aliens entering  and remaining in American Samoa, including those who enter for  employment reasons, must have a sponsor. According to FBI and  American Samoa government officials, there are instances in which  employment sponsors exploit aliens under the threat of revoking their  sponsorship and having them deported. As reported in the 2005 threat  assessment, a number of immigrants from Taiwan, China, and the  Philippines, were pursuing employment opportunities and allowed to enter  American Samoa under the sponsorship of owners of a variety of  businesses, and were forced into servitude or prostitution once they  arrived (i.e. human trafficking).", "Among the most notable cases of human trafficking in American Samoa is  U.S. v. Lee, which was one of the largest human trafficking cases ever  prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. This 2001 case involved  about 200 Chinese and Vietnamese victims who were recruited to work in  an American Samoa garment factory. In 2003, Lee was convicted in the  U.S. District Court of Hawaii of involuntary servitude, conspiring to violate  civil rights, extortion, and money laundering. The 2005 threat assessment  reported that the full dimension of the problem of human trafficking in  American Samoa is difficult to measure, but noted that intelligence  showed there continue to be victims of human trafficking in American  Samoa and that human trafficking is a major source of profit for organized  crime syndicates. According to the threat assessment, human trafficking is  a difficult issue for local law enforcement because there is no American  Samoa human trafficking law or avenue for prosecution locally. The  legislature in American Samoa is considering legislation to criminalize  human trafficking and categorize it as a felony in American Samoa law but,  to date, no such legislation has been enacted.", "According to FBI and American Samoan government officials, there are  also instances in which numerical limits on aliens are not adequately  enforced and aliens overstay their visits. Immigration law in American  Samoa allows for 12 separate classifications of aliens to reside in  American Samoa for more than 30 days; however, some of the categories  are subject to numerical limits. The extent of this issue is unknown, as the  Immigration Office does not have documented policies and procedures  that define how the office is to enforce the numerical limits. If an alien  enters American Samoa on a 30-day entry permit and stays longer than the  30-day period, he or she is tracked in the Immigration Office database as  an overstayer, according to Immigration Office officials. According to data  from the Immigration Office, there were over 2,600 alien overstayers for  fiscal year 2009. Immigration Office officials explained that often the  overstayers expect to have their residency authorized within that 30-day  time frame, but they do not understand that it takes longer. Additionally,  7,572 aliens had expired ID cards as of March 2010, which means the  aliens\u2019 ID cards had expired and had not been renewed. Immigration  officials told us they track these individuals, make contact with their  sponsors, and try to determine the reason they have not renewed their  cards.", "The American Samoa legislature, in addition to its actions on human  trafficking legislation, is also considering draft legislation that will make  changes to existing immigration law. Some of the proposed changes  include creating a Department of Immigration as its own stand-alone  department, outside of the Department of Legal Affairs, and to make it  subject to annual audits by the territorial auditor. The draft legislation also  includes reductions to the numerical limits on aliens. Further, the  standards for sponsoring an alien for employment reasons would change  to require additional proof of the need for the alien workers and a written  contract defining the agreement between sponsors and aliens. While these  legislative efforts would appear to address some of the concerns identified  by American Samoan and U.S. law enforcement officials, the legislation is  not final and so it is too soon to tell what impact the legislation, if passed,  will have on addressing the identified concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Government Officials Report a Potential Risk Is Aliens Unlawfully Gaining Entry to the Rest of the United States via American Samoa", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government officials we met with representing DHS, the Department  of State, and the FBI stated that a potential risk to the United States  associated with American Samoa administering its own customs and  immigration programs is illegal immigration into the rest of the United  States as a result of travelers obtaining false documentation in American  Samoa. The potential for illegal entry by aliens into the rest of the United  States from American Samoa raises questions as to whether current  practices in American Samoa can be used by criminals and terrorists to  jeopardize the security of the United States. As stated in CBP\u2019s Fiscal Year  2009-2014 Strategic Plan, illegal immigration compromises national  security as aliens unlawfully gaining entry to the United States create a  pathway for illegal entry and a demand for false documentation and  identities. This is a threat to national security as terrorists might exploit  the same vulnerabilities that such aliens currently use. Furthermore, a  January 2010 presidential memorandum stated that DHS should  aggressively pursue enhanced screening technology, protocols, and  procedures, especially in regard to aviation and other transportation  sectors, and strengthen international partnerships and coordination on  aviation security issues.", "According to data provided by the American Samoa Department of Legal  Affairs, as shown in table 1, while a majority of U.S. nationals and citizens  traveling to Hawaii from American Samoa during the past 3 years have  traveled with a U.S. passport (an average of 72.2 percent), the second most  commonly used document for travel by U.S. nationals and citizens was the  CI (an average of 19.5 percent).", "Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only location within the United States to which  flights from American Samoa arrive. Upon arrival in Honolulu, passengers  from American Samoa are inspected by CBP to establish their identity and  nationality, and if the passenger is an alien, admissibility. For U.S. citizens  and noncitizen nationals, identity and nationality may be established, to  the satisfaction of a CBP officer, through the use of one or more  documents, such as a U.S.-issued passport or military ID, a birth certificate  with photo ID, or an American Samoa-issued CI. In addition, the CBP  officers use other techniques to verify a person\u2019s identity and nationality,  including asking questions and observing behavioral cues. According to  CBP, once a U.S. citizen or noncitizen national has sufficiently  demonstrated his or her identity and nationality to the CBP officer, he or  she is no longer subject to inspection for admissibility. As with other  airline passengers who arrive from outside the United States and have not  been previously screened by CBP, if there is any suspicion of fraudulent  documents or intent, CBP officers may investigate the travelers from  American Samoa further and refer the travelers for additional, more in- depth questioning by CBP, or additional investigation by U.S. Immigration  and Customs Enforcement or Department of State officers. Honolulu- based CBP officers we spoke with who screen passengers arriving from  American Samoa could not identify any incidents in recent years in which  a passenger from American Samoa was determined to be traveling with a  fraudulent CI, or of a passenger being referred for additional inspection  because of a suspected fraudulent CI. The CBP officers also stated that  they have not identified any counterfeit U.S. passports used by passengers  arriving from American Samoa. However, while a CI or U.S. passport may  appear legitimate, it could have been improperly obtained through the use  of fraudulent identity documents, such as a false birth certificate or  driver\u2019s license, as reported to us by American Samoan and U.S. law  enforcement officials, and such instances would be difficult for CBP to  detect.", "In November 2009, charges were filed in the High Court of American  Samoa against the Manager of the Office of Motor Vehicles for conspiracy  to commit forgery based on evidence that driver\u2019s licenses had been issued  fraudulently. Additionally, the American Samoa Department of Homeland  Security and Office of Independent Prosecutor, with assistance from the  resident FBI agent, initiated a full-scale investigation centered on alleged  improprieties in the Office of the Attorney General and the Immigration  Office. In January 2010, the Office of the Attorney General and the  Immigration Office were served search warrants to provide investigators  with records related to certain aliens in American Samoa, including all  ledgers related to CIs. While CBP has no direct knowledge of problems  regarding the use of CIs or passports that may have been obtained using  fraudulent documents, the Department of State has recently changed its  passport adjudication procedures as a result of these allegations.  Department of State officials we spoke with told us that the potential for  fraudulently obtaining CIs appeared to be a vulnerability within the  passport application process and, as a result, they no longer accept CIs as  the only form of identification to support a U.S. passport application.  Applicants may submit their locally-issued American Samoa identification,  but they will also need to provide additional documentation. Additionally,  the Department of State no longer allows the Office of the Attorney  General to serve as a location for accepting passport applications. Rather,  applications for U.S. passports are only accepted through passport  acceptance agents at the U.S. Post Office in Pago Pago. Moreover, as a  result of evidence from the Independent Prosecutor\u2019s investigation, the  Department of State has undertaken an investigation to determine whether  passports were issued to individuals living in American Samoa in recent  years who are neither U.S. citizens nor noncitizen nationals.

Additionally,  risk management plays an important role in homeland security. Federal  law has charged DHS with coordinating homeland security programs  through the application of a risk management framework. DHS, within its  National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), established criteria for  risk assessments. Risk assessments help decision makers identify and  evaluate potential risks so that countermeasures can be designed and  implemented to prevent or mitigate the potential effects of the risks. The  NIPP characterizes risk assessment as a function of three elements          (1) threat\u2014the likelihood that a particular asset, system, or network will  suffer an attack or an incident; (2) vulnerability\u2014the likelihood that a  characteristic of, or flaw in, an asset, system, or network\u2019s design,  location, security posture, process, or operation renders it susceptible to  destruction, incapacitation, or exploitation by terrorist or other intentional  acts, mechanical failures, and natural hazards; and (3) consequence\u2014the  negative effects on public health and safety, the economy, public  confidence in institutions, and the functioning of government, both direct  and indirect, which can be expected if an asset, system, or network is  damaged, destroyed, or disrupted by a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or  other incident.
