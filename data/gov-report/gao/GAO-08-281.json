During this period, the portion of depository institutions income derived from noninterest sources--including fees on savings and checking accounts--varied but increased overall from 24 percent to 27 percent. Changes in both consumer behavior, such as making more payments electronically, and practices of depository institutions are likely influencing trends in fees, but their exact effects are unknown. Federal banking regulators address fees associated with checking and savings accounts primarily by examining depository institutions' compliance with requirements, under the Truth in Savings Act (TISA) and its implementing regulations, to disclose fee information so that consumers can compare institutions. They also review customer complaints but do not assess whether fees are reasonable. The regulators received relatively fewer consumer complaints about fees and related disclosures--less than 5 percent of all complaints from 2002 to 2006--than about other bank products. During the same period, they cited 1,674 violations of fee-related disclosure regulations--about 335 annually among the 17,000 institutions they oversee. GAO's visits to 185 branches of 154 depository institutions suggest that, despite the disclosure requirements, consumers may find it difficult to obtain information about checking and savings account fees. GAO staff posing as customers were unable to obtain detailed fee information and account terms and conditions at over one-fifth of visited branches and also could not find this information on many institutions' Web sites. Federal regulators examine institutions' written policies, procedures, and documents but do not determine whether consumers actually receive disclosure documents. While consumers may consider factors besides costs when shopping for accounts, an inability to obtain information about terms, conditions, and fees hinders their ability to compare institutions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, consumers paid over $36 billion in various fees associated with  checking and savings accounts at depository institutions\u2014banks, thrifts,  and credit unions.

Additionally, some have  questioned how regulators address fee practices in their oversight of  depository institutions and whether consumers, prior to opening a  checking or savings account, are able to obtain information on fees and  depository institution practices that influence when fees are assessed.", "The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve)  has established regulations for checking and savings accounts that require  depository institutions to disclose certain information about the fees they  charge. Specifically, Regulation DD, which implements the Truth in Savings  Act (TISA), requires depository institutions to disclose (among other  things) the amount of any fee that may be imposed in connection with an  account and the conditions under which such fees are imposed.  Regulation E\u2014the other primary federal regulation governing checking and  savings account fees\u2014implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and  establishes the basic rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of consumers  who use electronic fund transfer services and of financial institutions that  offer these services. To ensure compliance with these and other relevant  laws and regulations, banks, thrifts, and credit unions are subject to  oversight at the federal and state level. This oversight includes on-site  examinations and other steps to ensure compliance with the laws and  regulations. In 2005, partly in response to concerns about the marketing,  implementation, and fees of overdraft protection programs being offered  by depository institutions, the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC and NCUA  jointly and the OTS separately issued guidance (interagency guidance)  outlining \u201cbest practices\u201d that address, among other things, communicating  the features of these programs to customers.", "You requested that we examine a number of issues related to the fees that  consumers pay on their checking and savings accounts.

We interviewed representatives of these two firms to understand  their methodology for collecting the data and ensuring its integrity. In  addition, we conducted reasonableness checks on the data we received to  identify any missing, erroneous, or outlying data and concluded that the  data were sufficiently reliable for use in our report. To determine the role  that these fees have played in depository institutions\u2019 revenues, we also  obtained and analyzed quarterly financial data submitted by federally  insured banks, thrifts, and credit unions and maintained by FDIC and  NCUA. In our past work, we have found the quarterly financial data  maintained by FDIC and NCUA to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our reports. We also reviewed the literature for studies or information on  the characteristics of consumers who might be likely to incur such fees and  interviewed representatives of the federal banking regulators about this  issue. To determine how federal and selected state banking regulators  address fees associated with checking and deposit accounts as part of their  oversight of depository institutions, we obtained and reviewed  examination manuals and guidance used by the five federal banking  regulators and state regulators in six states. We obtained and reviewed a  sample of 25 reports on examinations conducted during 2006 to identify  how these regulators carried out examinations for compliance with  Regulations DD and E. In addition, we obtained data from each of the  federal banking regulators on violations they cited for institutions\u2019  noncompliance with Regulation DD and Regulation E disclosure-related  provisions, as well as enforcement actions that each regulator took against  institutions from 2002 to 2006. We also obtained annual data on consumer  complaints concerning checking and savings accounts at depository  institutions\u2014particularly complaints related to fees and disclosures\u2014as  well as complaints for other major products (credit cards and mortgage  loans) referred to these regulators from 2002 to 2006.

Finally, we  interviewed officials from each of the federal banking regulators and from  six state banking regulators about these issues.", "To assess the extent to which consumers are able to obtain account terms  and conditions and disclosures of fees, we used direct observation  techniques and reviewed studies and reports by government agencies,  consumer groups, and other researchers. We also reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and guidance issued by the federal banking regulators.  For direct observation, GAO employees posed as consumers shopping for  checking and savings accounts and visited 185 branches of 154 banks,  thrifts, and credit unions throughout the nation to request documents on  the fees associated with basic checking and savings accounts. We selected  these institutions to ensure a mix of institution type (bank, thrift, and credit  union) and size; however, the results cannot be generalized to all  institutions. These employees also reviewed information from the  institutions\u2019 Web sites. To obtain information on issues related to providing  consumers with real-time account information during debit card  transactions at point-of-sale terminals and automated teller machines, we  reviewed available literature from the Federal Reserve and other sources  and met with officials from depository institutions, card associations, third- party processors, and trade organizations.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2007 to January 2008,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, the ability to accept deposits transferable by  checks and other means has allowed depository institutions to become  principal agents or middlemen in many financial transactions and in the  nation\u2019s payment system. Depository institutions typically offer a variety of  savings and checking accounts, such as ordinary savings, certificates of  deposits, interest-bearing checking, and noninterest-bearing checking  accounts. Also, the same institutions may offer credit cards, home equity  lines of credit, real estate mortgage loans, mutual funds, and other financial  products.", "In the United States, regulation of depository institutions depends on the  type of charter the institution chooses. The various types of charters can  be obtained at the state or national level and cover: (1) commercial banks,  which originally focused on the banking needs of businesses but over time  broadened their services; (2) thrifts, which include savings banks, savings  associations, and savings and loans and which were originally created to  serve the needs\u2014particularly the mortgage needs\u2014of those not served by  commercial banks; and (3) credit unions, which are member-owned  cooperatives run by member-elected boards with a historic emphasis on  serving people of modest means.", "All depository institutions have a primary federal regulator if their deposits  are federally insured.

The purpose of the act and its implementing  regulations is to enable consumers to make informed decisions about their  accounts at depository institutions through the use of uniform disclosure  documents. These disclosure documents are intended to help consumers  \u201ccomparison shop\u201d by providing information about fees, annual percentage  yields, interest rates, and other terms for deposit accounts. The regulation  is supplemented by \u201cstaff commentary,\u201d which contains official Federal  Reserve staff interpretations of Regulation DD. Since the initial  implementation date for Regulation DD, several amendments have been  made to the regulation and the corresponding staff commentary. For  example, the Federal Reserve made changes to Regulation DD, effective  July 1, 2006, to address concerns about the uniformity and adequacy of  information provided to consumers when they overdraw their deposit  accounts. Credit unions are governed by a substantially similar regulation  issued by NCUA.", "Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, became  effective in May 1980. The primary objective of the act and Regulation E is  the protection of individual consumers engaging in electronic funds  transfers (EFT). Regulation E provides a basic framework that establishes  the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund  transfer systems such as ATM transfers, telephone bill-payment services,  point-of-sale terminal transfers in stores, and preauthorized transfers from  or to consumer's bank accounts (such as direct deposit and Social Security  payments). The term \u201celectronic fund transfer\u201d generally refers to a  transaction initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer,  or magnetic tape that instructs a financial institution either to credit or to  debit a consumer's asset account. Regulation E requires financial  institutions to provide consumers with initial disclosures of the terms and  conditions of EFT services. The regulation allows financial institutions to  combine the disclosure information required by the regulation with that  required by other laws such as TISA as long as the information is clear and  understandable and is available in a written form that consumers can keep.", "Paying or honoring customers\u2019 occasional or inadvertent overdrafts of their  demand deposit accounts has long been an established practice at  depository institutions. As shown in figure 1, depository institutions have  four options when a customer attempts to withdraw or access funds from  an account that does not have enough money in it to cover the transaction,  and fees can be assessed for each of these options. The institution can (1)  cover the amount of the overdraft by tapping a linked account (savings,  money market, or credit card) established by the customer; (2) charge the  overdraft to a linked line of credit; (3) approve the transaction (if  electronic) or honor the customer\u2019s check by providing an ad hoc or  \u201ccourtesy\u201d overdraft; or (4) deny the transaction or decline to honor the  customer\u2019s check. The first two options require that customers have  created and linked to the primary checking account one or more other  accounts or a line of credit in order to avoid overdrafts. The depository  institution typically waives fees or may charge a small fee for transferring  money into the primary account (a transfer fee). Depository institutions  typically charge the same amount for a courtesy overdraft (an overdraft  fee) as they do for denying a transaction for insufficient funds (an  insufficient funds fee).", "In addition to fees associated with insufficient funds transactions,  institutions may charge a number of other fees for checking and savings  account services and transactions.

For example,  the average insufficient funds fee among the institutions surveyed by  Moebs $ervices in 2006 was $24.02, while among the institutions surveyed  by Informa Research Services it was $26.07. Data from Informa Research  Services also indicated that since 2004 a small number of institutions  (mainly large banks) have been applying tiered fees to certain transactions,  such as overdrafts. For example, an institution may charge one amount for  the first three overdrafts in a year (tier 1), a higher rate for overdrafts four  to six of that year (tier 2), and an even higher rate for overdrafts seven and  beyond in a single year (tier 3). Of the institutions that applied tiered fees in  2006, the average overdraft fees were $26.74, $32.53, and $34.74 for tiers 1,  2, and 3, respectively.", "The data from these vendors also indicate that fee amounts for some  transactions or services varied or generally declined during this period. For  example:  The average ATM surcharge fee (assessed by a depository institution  when its ATM is used by a nonaccount holder) among institutions  surveyed by Moebs $ervices was $0.95 in 2000, rising to $1.41 in 2003,  and declining to $1.34 in 2006. This variability was also evident in the  fees charged by institutions surveyed by Informa Research Services.", "The average foreign ATM fee (assessed by a depository institution when  its account holders use another institution\u2019s ATM) generally declined,  from $0.92 in 2000 to $0.61 in 2006 among institutions surveyed by  Moebs $ervices and from $1.83 to $1.14 over the same period among  institutions surveyed by Informa Research Services.", "The average monthly maintenance fees on standard noninterest bearing  checking accounts decreased from $6.81 in 2000 to $5.41 in 2006 among  institutions surveyed by Informa Research Services (Moebs $ervices did  not provide data on this fee). Additionally, an increasing number of the  surveyed institutions offered free checking accounts (with a minimum  balance required to open the account) over this period. For example, in  2001 almost 30 percent of the institutions offered free checking  accounts, while in 2006 the number grew to about 60 percent of  institutions.", "Finally, some fees declined in amount, as well as in terms of their  prevalence. For example, Moebs $ervices reported that the institutions it  surveyed charged annual ATM fees, generally for issuing a card to  customers for their use strictly at ATMs, ranging from an average of $1.37 in  2000 to $1.14 in 2003. However, Moebs $ervices stopped collecting data on  this fee because, according to a Moeb\u2019s official, fewer and fewer  institutions reported charging the fee. Similarly, Moebs $ervices reported  that the institutions it surveyed charged an annual debit card fee, generally  for issuing a card to customers for their use at ATMs, averaging from $0.94  in 2000 to $1.00 in 2003; but, it stopped collecting this data as well. (Informa  Research Services reported data on these fees through 2006, when they  averaged $0.44 and $0.74, respectively.) Appendix III contains further  details on the data reported by Moebs $ervices and Informa Research  Services, in both nominal and real dollars.", "A number of factors may explain why some fees increased while others  decreased. For example, greater use of automation and lower cost of  technology may explain why certain ATM fees have decreased or been  eliminated altogether. Additionally, competition among depository  institutions for customers likely has contributed to the decrease in monthly  maintenance fees and the increased prevalence of \u201cfree checking\u201d  accounts. Factors that may be influencing trends in fees overall are  discussed subsequently in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fees Generally Varied by Type and Size of Institution", "paragraphs": ["Using data supplied by the two vendors, we compared the fees for checking  and savings accounts by type of institution and found that, on average,  banks and thrifts charged more than credit unions for almost all of them  (the exception was the fee for returns of deposited items). For example,  banks and thrifts charged on average roughly three dollars more than credit  unions for insufficient funds and overdraft fees throughout the period.  However, on average credit unions charged almost $6.00 more than banks  and thrifts on returns of deposited items.", "The amounts institutions charged for certain transactions also varied by  the institution\u2019s size, as measured by assets. Large institutions\u2014those with  more than $1 billion in assets\u2014on average charged more for the majority of  fees than midsized or small institutions\u2014those with assets of $100 million  to $1 billion and less than $100 million, respectively. Large institutions on  average charged between $4.00 and $5.00 more for insufficient funds and  overdraft fees than smaller institutions. Further, on average, large banks  and thrifts consistently charged the highest insufficient funds and overdraft  fees, while small credit unions consistently charged the lowest.  Specifically, in 2007 large banks and thrifts charged an average fee of about  $28.00 for insufficient funds and overdraft fees, while small credit unions  charged an average fee of around $22.00. While large institutions in general  had higher fees than other sized institutions, smaller institutions charged  considerably more for returns of deposited items. The results of our  analysis are consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2003 report on bank fees,  which showed that large institutions charged more than medium- and  small-sized institutions (banks and thrifts combined) for most fees.", "Our analysis of Informa Research Services data also showed that,  controlling for both institution type and size, institutions in some regions of  the country, on average, charged more for some fees, such as insufficient  funds and overdraft fees, than others. For example, in 2006 the average  overdraft fee in the southern region was $28.18, compared with a national  average of $26.74 and a western region average of $24.94."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Institutions\u2019 Income from Noninterest Sources, Including Fees, Has Increased since 2000", "paragraphs": ["Between 2000 and 2006, the portion of depository institutions\u2019 income from  noninterest sources, including income generated from bank fees, varied but  generally increased. As shown in figure 3, banks\u2019 and thrifts\u2019 noninterest  income rose from 24 to 27 percent of total income between 2000 and 2006  (peaking at 33 percent in 2004) and credit unions\u2019 noninterest income rose  from 11 to 14 percent (peaking at 20 percent in 2004). The percent of  noninterest income appeared to have an inverse relationship to changes in  the federal funds rate\u2014the interest rate at which depository institutions  lend balances at the Federal Reserve to other depository institutions\u2014 which is an indicator of interest rate changes during the period. Low  interest rates combined with increased competition from other lenders can  make it difficult for banking institutions to generate revenues from interest  rate \u201cspreads,\u201d or differences between the interest rates that can be  charged for loans and the rates paid to depositors and other sources of  funds.", "However, noninterest income includes revenue derived from a number of  fee-based banking services, not all of them associated with checking and  savings accounts. For example, fees from credit cards, as well as fees from  mutual funds sales commissions, are included in noninterest income. Thus,  noninterest income cannot be used to specifically identify either the extent  of fee revenue being generated, or the portion that is attributable to any  specific fee.", "Among other financial information, banks and thrifts are required to report  data on service charges on deposit accounts (SCDA), which includes most  of the fees associated with checking and deposit accounts. Specifically,  SCDA includes, among other things, account maintenance fees, charges for  failing to maintain a minimum balance, some ATM fees, insufficient funds  fees, and charges for stop payment orders. As figure 4 shows, banks\u2019 and  thrifts\u2019 SCDA, and to a somewhat greater extent credit union\u2019s fee income  as a percentage of total income, increased overall during the period, with a  slight decline in recent years. However, it should be noted that credit union  fee income includes income generated from both deposit accounts and  other products that credit unions offer, such as fees for credit cards and  noncustomer use of proprietary ATMs; thus, the percentage of fee income  they report is not directly comparable to the service charges reported by  banks and thrifts.", "Because institutions do not have to report SCDA by line item, it is difficult  to estimate the extent to which specific fees on checking and deposit  accounts contributed to institutions\u2019 revenues or how these contributions  have changed over the years. Further, some fees that banking customers  incur may not be covered by SCDA. For example, institutions report  monthly account maintenance fee income as SCDA, but not income earned  from fees charged to a noncustomer, such as fees for the use of its  proprietary ATMs. Similarly, credit unions\u2019 reported fee income cannot be  used to identify fee revenues from specific checking and savings account  fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Consumer Behavior and Depository Institution Practices May Affect Trends in Bank Fees", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1990s, consumers have increasingly used electronic forms of  payment such as debit cards for many transactions, from retail purchases  to bill payment. By 2006 more than two-thirds of all U.S. noncash payments  were made by electronic payments (including credit cards, debit cards,  automated clearing house, and electronic benefit transfers), while the  number of paper payments (e.g., checks) has decreased due to the rapid  growth in the use of debit cards. Generally, these electronic payments are  processed more quickly than traditional paper checks. For example, debit  card transactions result in funds leaving customer\u2019s checking accounts  during or shortly after the transaction, as opposed to checks, which may  not be debited from a customer\u2019s account for a few days (although  depository institutions have also begun to process checks faster, in part, as  a result of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21 Act) and  implementing regulations, which became effective in late 2004). Despite  this overall shortening of time or \u201cfloat\u201d between the payment transaction  and the debiting of funds from a consumer\u2019s account, depository  institutions can hold certain nonlocal checks deposited by a consumer for  up to 11 days. According to consumer groups and bank representatives,  this creates the potential for increased incidences of overdrafts if funds are  debited from a consumers account faster than deposits are made available  for withdrawal. The shift in consumer payment preferences has occurred  rather quickly, and we identified little research on the extent to which the  increased use of electronic payments, such as debit cards, has affected the  prevalence of specific deposit account fees, such as overdraft or  insufficient fund fees.", "Additionally, some institutions have internal policies for posting deposits to  and withdrawals from customer accounts that can affect the incidence of  fees. For example, consumer group representatives, bank representatives,  and federal regulatory officials told us that many institutions process the  largest (highest dollar amount) debit transaction before the smallest one  regardless of the order in which the customers initiated the transactions.  This practice can affect the number of overdraft fees charged to a  customer. For example, if a customer had only $600 available in their  account, processing a payment for $590 first before three transactions of  $25 each would result in three instances of overdrafts, whereas reversing  the order of processing payments from smallest to largest would result in  one instance of overdraft. Banking officials said that this processing of  largest to smallest transactions first ensures that consumers\u2019 larger, and  presumably more important payments, such as mortgage payments, are  made. One of the federal banking regulators\u2014OTS\u2014issued guidance in  2005 stating that institutions it regulates should not manipulate transaction  clearing steps (including check clearing and batch debit processing) to  inflate fees. We were unable to identify comprehensive information  regarding the extent to which institutions were using this or other methods  (chronological, smallest-to-largest, etc.) of processing payments.", "Further, some depository institutions have automated the process used to  approve overdrafts and have increasingly marketed the availability of  overdraft protection programs to their customers. Historically, depository  institutions have used their discretion to pay overdrafts for consumers,  usually imposing a fee. Over the years, to reduce the costs of reviewing  individual items, some institutions have established policies and automated  the process for deciding whether to honor overdrafts, but generally  institutions are not required to inform customers about internal policies for  determining whether an item will be honored or denied. In addition, third- party vendors have developed and sold automated programs to institutions,  particularly to smaller institutions, to handle overdrafts. According to the  Federal Reserve, what distinguishes the vendor programs from in-house  automated processes is the addition of marketing plans that appear  designed to (1) promote the generation of fee income by disclosing to  account holders the dollar amount that the consumer typically will be  allowed to overdraw their account and (2) encourage consumers to use the  service to meet short-term borrowing needs. An FDIC official noted that  some vendor contracts tied the vendor\u2019s compensation to an increase in the  depository institution\u2019s fee revenues.", "We were unable to identify information on the extent to which institutions  were using automated overdraft programs developed and sold by third- party vendors or the criteria that these programs used. Representatives  from a few large depository institutions told us that they are using software  programs developed in-house to determine which account holders would  have overdrafts approved. According to consumer groups and federal  banking regulators, software vendors appear to be primarily marketing  automated overdraft programs to small and midsized institutions.

However, the results of this study cannot be generalized to the  larger population because the small institution used was not statistically  representative of all depository institutions. The consumer group study,  which relied on a survey in which individuals with bank accounts were  interviewed, found that those bank customers who had had two or more  overdrafts in the 6 months before the date of the interview were more often  low income, single, and nonwhite.

We were unable to  obtain detailed information about fees and account terms and conditions at  over one-fifth of the branches we visited and, in many cases, we found  inconsistencies among branches of the same depository institution.  Because the federal banking regulators, in their compliance examinations,  do not assess the extent to which consumers actually receive required  disclosure documents before opening an account, they are not in a position  to know how widespread this problem may be among the institutions they  supervise, or the reasons for it.

For the complaint resolution data, we obtained information about  the resolution (outcomes) of complaints and the banking products or  services involved.

One of the  reasons for this is that, while a depository institution may attempt to get as  close to a real-time balance as possible, it may be unable to capture all of  the transactions associated with the account as they occur throughout the  day. For example, one depository institution official told us that it updates  its customers\u2019 account balances throughout each day; it refers to these  updated balances as a customer\u2019s \u201cavailable balance.\u201d This available  balance is updated throughout the day to reflect debit card transactions at  point-of-sale terminals and ATMs, as well as other transactions such as  those that occur online. This balance, however, might not take into account  checks that will be clearing that day, deposits made at a foreign ATM, or  some transactions that would come in via the Automated Clearing House  (ACH). An example of the latter is a transaction in which a consumer  electronically transfers funds from a mutual fund to a checking account.  The net result of the inability to provide consumers with a real-time  balance is that the consumer may be presented with a balance that is not  reflective of all the transactions that will be processed as of that day.", "Another reason why a depository institution may be unable to provide  consumers with a real-time balance is that the institution may not update  balances throughout the day.

The following  day, the institutions update the customer\u2019s account balance for debit card  authorizations and certain other transactions that occur throughout the  day. However, according to a card association, some small banks only post  the account balance from the batch process to the customer\u2019s account and  do not update account balances as transactions occur throughout the day.", "Finally, if a depository institution uses a third-party processor to authorize  debit card transactions, the balance that the third-party processor uses may  also not reflect all the transactions that occur throughout the day. For  example, transactions involving a bank teller, such as deposits or  withdrawals, do not require a third-party processor to authorize  transactions, thus the processor would not be able to update its balance to  reflect these transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Associated with Privacy and Security Issues", "paragraphs": ["One of the major concerns raised by the debit card industry representatives  we spoke with regarding providing consumers with real-time balances at  point-of-sale terminals was a concern over privacy. Unlike ATM  transactions, which are transactions between a consumer and the machine,  under which consumers tend to be cognizant of the need for privacy, point- of-sale terminals are generally more visible to others, according to these  representatives. For example, the balance on a point-of-sale terminal could  be visible to the cashier and customers in line at a merchant location. In  addition, at restaurants, the waiter or other staff could view this  information out of sight of the consumer. The industry representatives  stated that most consumers would likely be uncomfortable having their  account balance information visible to others.", "Another related concern raised by these representatives was one of  security, in that cashiers or possibly other customers might be able to view  a consumer\u2019s account balance. Thus, the industry representatives stated  that providing balances at a point-of-sale terminal could increase the risk of  fraud. One industry representative told us that providing a balance at a  point-of-sale terminal would be a departure from current privacy and  security approaches with point-of-sale transactions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Related to Increased Transaction Processing Time", "paragraphs": ["Industry representatives explained that allowing consumers to accept or  decline a transaction once they have viewed their balance would likely  increase the time it takes to get customers through a check-out line.  According to a retail merchant\u2019s trade association that we contacted,  merchants depend on moving customers quickly through check-out lines.  The retail merchants\u2019 trade association stated that adding a step in the  check-out process would add time, resulting in lower sales volume per unit  of time for each cashier, and potentially greater costs associated with  adding cashiers to maintain the same volume of transactions.", "Industry officials also stated that there were some circumstances during a  point-of-sale transaction for which providing consumers with real-time  balances would not be possible or would be problematic. For example,  during \u201cstand-in\u201d situations, such as when a card issuer\u2019s systems are  offline for maintenance, EFT networks review and authorize (or deny)  transactions in accordance with instructions from the issuer. The networks  would not have real-time access to account balance information when the  issuer\u2019s system is down. Another example would be merchants, such as fast  food outlets, who perform quick swipes of debit cards for low dollar  transactions. At the time of the swipe, the merchant has not actually routed  the transaction to the card issuer and thus has not yet accessed the  consumer\u2019s account balance. In these cases, the merchant has accepted the  risk of not being paid if there are insufficient funds in the account in order  to move customers through lines more quickly. Finally, one industry  representative questioned how the industry would be able to provide  consumers with real-time balances if consumers make debit card  purchases online or over the telephone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Options Short of Providing Real-Time Account Balance Information at Point-of-Sale Terminals or ATMs Have Their Challenges and Limitations", "paragraphs": ["There are other options short of providing real-time account balances at  point-of-sale terminals and ATMs that might assist in warning consumers of  a potential overdraft, but each of these options has challenges and  limitations. For example, one option involves sending a warning with the  authorization message instead of a real-time balance. The warning would  indicate that the transaction could result in an overdraft. As indicated  above, one of the banks we met with currently provides a similar warning  on its proprietary ATMs. The consumer would then have the option to  accept or deny the transaction. This option would require two messages to  complete a debit card transaction rather than one message. Further, under  this option, depository institutions would still be unable to base their  authorization decisions on a real-time balance because of the various types  of transactions that may occur in a day, and thus no warning message  would be triggered\u2014yet once the institution reconciles all accounts, a  consumer could be faced with an overdraft fee. This option would also  likely slow down transactions and raise costs for merchants. However,  unlike providing real-time account balance information at a point-of-sale  terminal, this option would not present privacy or security concerns  because the balance in the consumer\u2019s account would not be transmitted.", "Another option short of providing consumers with real-time account  balance information is printing a consumer\u2019s available balance on a receipt  after a transaction has been completed. This is currently possible when  consumers use their card issuers\u2019 proprietary ATMs and some foreign  ATMs, according to industry representatives. Under this option, the  consumer would not receive a warning that the transaction could subject  them to an overdraft, and they would not have a choice to accept or decline  the transaction. Further, under this option, the consumer would not be  provided his or her account balance until after the transaction was  completed. However, once consumers obtained their balance, they could  change their spending behavior to avoid a fee on subsequent transactions.  This option would entail certain costs for upgrading terminals or software  in order to print the consumer\u2019s real-time balance on the receipt, as well as  costs of upgrading software to transmit the real-time balance from the  card-issuing institution to the merchant terminal. The option would not  address an institution\u2019s ability to provide an actual real-time balance and  would introduce privacy and security concerns because if the receipt were  inadvertently dropped, others could view the balance. However, this option  would not slow down the time it takes to complete a transaction because  the consumer would not be given the option of accepting or declining a  transaction.", "Finally, industry representatives noted that consumers currently have a  number of ways to check their account balances (e.g., by phone and  Internet), which might help them avoid overdraft fees. According to  Federal Reserve officials, this would require \u201cnear-time\u201d processing and a  system that synchronizes the balance information reported through the  phone and Internet banking systems with the balance information that is  transmitted by the institution to the ATM/EFT network. Three of the four  large banks we spoke with stated that their customers currently have the  ability to sign up for a feature in which the bank will send a message to the  consumers\u2019 e-mail accounts or cell phones\u2014\u201cE-alerts\u201d\u2014when their  balances reach a designated \u201cthreshold\u201d amount. Under this option,  consumers receiving an E-alert could change their spending patterns to  avoid incurring an overdraft situation and fees.
