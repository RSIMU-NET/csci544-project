GAO's analysis shows that through Medicaid, a joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, states made three types of payments that helped offset uncompensated care in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 totaling over $35 billion annually. Medicare, a federal program for aged and certain disabled individuals, made two types of payments in 2013 and three in 2014\u2014including a new type called Medicare Uncompensated Care (UC) payments\u2014totaling over $14 billion annually.

As shown in the table, however, the payment types are based on similar factors\u2014generally hospitals' costs or workloads related to providing services to Medicaid, uninsured, or low-income Medicare patients, or some combination of these.", "Medicare's UC payments are not well aligned with hospital uncompensated care costs for two reasons. First, payments are largely based on hospitals' Medicaid workload rather than actual hospital uncompensated care costs. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) officials acknowledge this could result in payments not aligned with uncompensated costs, particularly in states that have expanded Medicaid resulting in fewer uninsured individuals and lower uncompensated costs. In an April 2016 proposed rule, the agency announced that it is considering using hospitals' actual uncompensated care costs as the basis for making Medicare UC payments. Second, CMS does not account for hospitals' Medicaid payments that offset uncompensated care costs when making Medicare UC payments, even though the bulk of Medicare's payments\u2014about 85 percent or $7.7 billion in 2014\u2014were made on the basis of hospitals' Medicaid workloads, for which hospitals may have also received Medicaid payments. CMS officials said that the Medicaid and Medicare programs are operated separately.

These programs include  Medicaid, the joint federal-state partnership health coverage program for  low-income and medically needy individuals, and Medicare, the federal  health coverage program for the elderly and certain disabled individuals.  At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees  state Medicaid programs and administers the Medicare program. For  Medicaid, CMS provides guidance to states on federal requirements for  Medicaid hospital uncompensated care payments and oversees  compliance with these requirements. States are responsible for day to  day administration of the program, including determining payment  amounts to individual hospitals consistent with any applicable federal  limits. For Medicare, CMS administers Medicare payment policies,  including making Medicare payments to hospitals for uncompensated  care.", "Legislative changes made under the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act (PPACA), enacted on March 23, 2010, have implications for the  amount of uncompensated care hospitals provide, as well as for the  amount and allocation of federal support for hospital uncompensated care  costs. Under PPACA, states have the option to expand their Medicaid  programs to cover nearly all adults with incomes at or below 133 percent  of the federal poverty level. PPACA also required the establishment of  health insurance exchanges by January 1, 2014\u2014marketplaces offering  private health insurance coverage\u2014and provided for federal subsidies to  qualified individuals and families who purchase health insurance through  the exchanges. As a result of these changes, the number of people with  health insurance has increased. For example, the Congressional Budget  Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have estimated that the  number of uninsured individuals would decline by 12 million in 2014.  Given that increases in the number of people with health insurance could  significantly lower the amount of uncompensated care hospitals provide,  PPACA also made changes intended to more closely align certain  Medicare and Medicaid funds with hospital uncompensated care costs.  For example, PPACA redirected some existing Medicare funds paid to  hospitals serving a disproportionate share of the nation\u2019s low-income  individuals in order to establish a Medicare Uncompensated Care (UC)  payment specifically to offset hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs,  including the cost of treating uninsured patients.

At the same time, uncompensated care  costs in these hospitals may be declining due to a reduction in the  number of uninsured individuals in the state. Conversely, hospitals in  states that have not expanded Medicaid will continue to have relatively  higher levels of uninsured individuals and thus higher uncompensated  care costs, but these hospitals will likely have fewer Medicaid patient  days and will thus receive a smaller share of Medicare UC payments  under CMS\u2019s current calculation.", "CMS officials acknowledged that using Medicaid patient days as a basis  for Medicare UC payments could result in hospitals located in Medicaid  expansion states receiving disproportionately higher payments. Officials  stated that the effect of using Medicaid patient days rather than actual  uncompensated care costs was somewhat mitigated because CMS had,  for purposes of fiscal year 2014 Medicare UC payments, used data from  fiscal years 2010 or 2011 to estimate hospitals\u2019 proportions of Medicaid  patient days\u2014a time period before when most states expanded their  Medicaid programs in response to PPACA. However, hospitals in states  that had broader Medicaid eligibility requirements in 2010 or 2011 (and  therefore higher numbers of Medicaid patient days) would receive higher  payments than those in states with more restrictive requirements in those  same years, despite potentially having to provide less uncompensated  care. In addition, the hospitals in seven states that had expanded their  Medicaid programs prior to 2014 may have also received higher Medicare  UC payments through CMS\u2019s use of Medicaid patient days to calculate  Medicare UC payments. Directing a larger portion of the Medicare UC  payments, which are intended to reimburse hospital uncompensated care  costs, to hospitals where hospital uncompensated care is declining is not  consistent with CMS\u2019s role as an efficient payer of health care services.", "CMS has for several years considered options for defining and using  hospital uncompensated care costs to make Medicare UC payments, but  has not yet implemented plans to do so. In a May 2013 notice of  proposed rulemaking, CMS stated that the definition of hospital  uncompensated care costs for purposes of making Medicare UC  payments could comprise charity care and bad debt costs (for both  Medicare and non-Medicare patients), since these were commonly  identified as sources of hospital uncompensated care by various  stakeholders, including federal and state programs, and provider  associations. CMS also identified a potential data source for actual  hospital uncompensated care costs\u2014an uncompensated care worksheet  in the Hospital Cost Report\u2014that is the only national data source for  charity care and bad debt costs. CMS did not propose at the time to use  this definition or the data in the uncompensated care worksheet because  of concerns by certain stakeholders about the worksheet\u2019s reliability. In  an April 2016 proposed rule, CMS proposed transitioning away from  using Medicaid days as the basis for UC payments, and instead using  hospital uncompensated care costs from the uncompensated  worksheet. Under the proposed rule, Medicare UC payments made in  fiscal year 2020 would be entirely based on hospital uncompensated care  costs, which CMS proposes to define as charity care and non-Medicare  bad debt. In its proposed rule, CMS requested public comments on its  proposed definition of hospital uncompensated care costs and use of the  uncompensated care worksheet to determine these costs, among other  things."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Determining Medicare UC Payments, CMS Does Not Consider Medicaid Payments That Offset Uncompensated Care Costs", "paragraphs": ["Although the majority of Medicare UC payments to individual hospitals  are based on Medicaid patient days, CMS does not adjust these  payments to reflect payments hospitals receive from Medicaid. Hospitals  could potentially receive significant amounts of payments that help offset  uncompensated care costs from both the Medicare and Medicaid  programs. A relatively large portion of the Medicare UC payments are  determined in the Medicare UC formula by hospitals\u2019 Medicaid patient  days; similarly, a large portion of the Medicaid payments that help offset  hospital uncompensated care costs are distributed, in part, on the basis of  payment limits determined by those hospitals\u2019 Medicaid workloads. We  estimate, for example, that in fiscal year 2014 about $7.7 billion of  Medicare UC payments to hospitals were based on Medicaid patient days  and about $14.1 billion of Medicaid payments to hospitals were based on  services provided to Medicaid patients.", "CMS officials told us that Medicare and Medicaid are separate programs  administered under different statutory and regulatory rules under which  hospitals can qualify for, and receive, both Medicare UC payments and  Medicaid payments that help offset hospital uncompensated care costs.", "When determining hospital uncompensated care costs for purposes of  Medicaid DSH payments, states are required to consider Medicare  payments made on behalf of patients covered by both Medicare and  Medicaid. While the law does not require CMS to take into account  Medicaid payments that offset uninsured costs when calculating Medicare  UC payments, CMS officials confirmed they have authority to consider  such payments but have not taken steps to do so.", "Transitioning away from using Medicaid patient days and instead basing  Medicare UC payments on data showing actual hospital uncompensated  care costs, would result in a better alignment of Medicare UC payments  with actual hospital uncompensated care costs. However, this change on  its own would not be sufficient to account for the fact that hospitals  eligible to receive UC payments may also be eligible for Medicaid DSH  payments to offset these same costs. Although the Medicare and  Medicaid programs define uncompensated care costs somewhat  differently, a common and significant cost in their definitions is the  uncompensated care costs for uninsured individuals. As a result, in  determining Medicare UC payments, it is important that CMS, in fulfilling  its role as an efficient payer of health care services, take into account the  Medicaid payments eligible hospitals have received for these costs to  ensure that Medicare UC payments are most effectively aligned with  hospitals\u2019 actual uncompensated care costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Hospital uncompensated care costs are a longstanding concern that have  the potential to weaken some hospitals\u2019 financial stability and undermine  their ability to provide care and serve their community. Recognizing the  importance of financially stable hospitals, certain Medicare and Medicaid  payments and federal tax laws were established to support hospitals  providing uncompensated care. The amount of uncompensated care  incurred by individual hospitals varies across the thousands of hospitals  in our nation, including private for-profit, private nonprofit, and state and  local government hospitals. The expansion of health insurance coverage  as a result of PPACA has and will continue to alter the amount of  uncompensated care incurred by hospitals. Hospitals in states and  communities where the number of uninsured individuals has declined are  likely to incur lower uncompensated care costs.", "In view of the changing landscape of hospital uncompensated care,  Congress reduced the amount of federal support to offset hospital  uncompensated care costs and also required federal spending to be  aligned with hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs. In particular, a large  amount of existing federal funding was redirected to establish Medicare  UC payments, which will decline as the number of uninsured individuals  declines nationally. CMS was directed to distribute these payments on the  basis of each hospital\u2019s uncompensated care costs. While CMS was  given flexibility to identify appropriate data for determining such costs, the  agency\u2019s use of Medicaid patient days as the basis for distributing  Medicare UC payments to hospitals results in poor alignment of payments  to hospital uncompensated care costs. Poor alignment results because  relatively large shares of Medicare UC payment amounts will be  distributed to hospitals where Medicaid expansion has lowered their  uncompensated care costs. Particularly in view of the changing  landscape of health care coverage, including some but not all states  expanding Medicaid and the impact of such choices on hospital  uncompensated care costs in different states, CMS has the responsibility  to use the best data available to allocate payments based on hospitals\u2019  actual uncompensated costs of providing care. In an April 2016 proposed  rule, the agency announced that it is considering using hospitals\u2019 actual  uncompensated care costs as the sole basis for making Medicare UC  payments by fiscal year 2020  Additional steps will be needed to ensure that Medicare UC payments are  aligned with hospital uncompensated care costs, including taking into  account Medicaid payments that hospitals receive for treating the  uninsured. Neither the current poor alignment of Medicare UC payments  with hospital uncompensated care costs nor the lack of accounting for  reductions in hospital uncompensated care costs for uninsured patients  resulting from Medicaid payments are consistent with Medicare\u2019s role as  a prudent payer of health care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure efficient use of federal resources, we recommend that the  Administrator of CMS take the following two actions:  1.", "Improve alignment of Medicare UC payments with hospital uncompensated care costs by basing these payments on hospital uncompensated care costs; and 2.

HHS agreed that it is important to align uncompensated care  payments with actual uncompensated care costs and that doing so would  help ensure that HHS is directing the payments to hospitals appropriately.   HHS stated that the Department would continue to review the definition of  uncompensated care as appropriate, particularly in the event it finalizes  the proposal to begin using uncompensated care cost data to determine  the distribution of these payments.
