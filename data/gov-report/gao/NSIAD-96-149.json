Consequently, the Congress enacted base realignment and closure (BRAC) legislation that instituted base closure rounds in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. The authority under this legislation has expired. Property disposals resulting from base closures and realignments are governed by various base closure and realignment laws and other laws relating to the disposal of surplus government property, homeless assistance, and environmental concerns.", "Once property is no longer required by a federal agency to discharge its responsibilities, the property is declared excess to that agency and then offered to other federal agencies to satisfy their requirements. If no other agency has a requirement for the property, it is declared surplus to the federal government. At that point, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 authorizes disposal through a variety of means such as public or negotiated sale and transfers to states and local governments for public benefit purposes such as education, public health, recreation, airport, wildlife conservation, and historic monuments. In addition, the base closure legislation authorizes surplus real property from closing bases to be transferred to local redevelopment authorities under economic development conveyances for economic development and job creation purposes. To use this authority, however, requires a showing that economic development and job creation cannot be accomplished under established sales or public benefit transfers. As shown in figure 1, local reuse authorities generally seek surplus property under one of the public benefit transfer authorities first because these can be no-cost acquisitions, then through economic development conveyances because these can be no-cost or no-initial cost acquisitions, and lastly through negotiated sale because they can negotiate the terms and do not have to compete with other interested parties. Any surplus property that remains is available for sale to the general public. (See app. II for a more detailed discussion of the laws and regulations affecting the base closure process.)", "At the beginning of the base closure process, DOD expected that land sales would help pay for the costs of closing bases.

(See fig. 2.) The 23 bases were selected because DOD considered these bases the major closures and assigned on-site base transition coordinators to them as of January 1994.

Developing reuse plans and developing and implementing service disposal plans can be a lengthy process.

The low percentage of land sold to the public is a result of the disposal process, which allows communities to plan the reuse of most base property.", "Communities are requesting surplus property predominately through no-cost public benefit transfers or economic development conveyances. The economic development conveyance was established by law in response to President Clinton\u2019s Five Point Program to revitalize base closure communities, announced in July 1993. Section 2903 of title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 established the basis for the economic development conveyance. The new mechanism is a special tool created to enable communities to act as master developers by obtaining property under more flexible finance and payment terms than previously existed. For example, a community can request property at less than fair market value if it can show the discount is needed for economic development and job creation.", "Regulations promulgated by DOD to implement title XXIX also give local communities the authority to recommend the land use of surplus property, taking into consideration feasible reuse alternatives and notices of interest from homeless assistance providers. The services consider these reuse plans when making their disposal decisions. However, they are not obligated to follow the reuse plans, nor is a community granted the authority to make disposal decisions.", "The disposal of property by public benefit transfer or economic development conveyance rather than sale reduces the immediate economic return to the government. For example, the golf course at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base is to be conveyed through a public benefit transfer to the city of Myrtle Beach.

During negotiations, two appraisals were conducted. The property\u2019s value decreased significantly from the first appraisal to the second. According to an Air Force official, a major cause for the decrease in the property\u2019s appraised value was its deterioration. Family housing at the base is shown in figures 3 and 4. In addition, the director of the local reuse authority cited the need for significant upgrades to the houses to make them habitable.", "Deterioration also occurred to 1,271 family housing units at Mather Air Force Base. The housing has been vacant for over 2 years as the Air Force and the local reuse authority negotiate the terms of the sale. During this time, a number of units were damaged by inclement weather, vandalism, and thefts. In December 1995, a major storm felled 40 trees in the housing area damaging roofs and flooring. Since May 1995, 76 air-conditioning units have been stolen from the housing area. As an Air Force official noted, one of the reasons for the appraisal value\u2019s decline from the first to the last appraisal was the property\u2019s deterioration.

Even so, the federal government may lose revenue if the property is resold at a price above what the state or local government paid for it. To avoid this loss, the regulation requires that the conveyance documents resulting from the negotiated sales to public agencies contain an excess profits clause. This clause entitles the federal government to receive all subsequent sales proceeds that exceed the purchase price and other specified costs allowed to the state or local government if the property is sold within a specified time period. According to the Director of the Air Force Base Conversion Agency, the specified period is based on the time that it will take the housing to be absorbed into the market. In the case of the Mather housing, the local reuse authority states it will take about 10 years for the property to be absorbed, while pursuing a 3-year excess profits clause in the sales contract. In January 1995, both the General Services Administration and the Air Force concurred that the interest of the federal government would not be protected by a 3-year excess profits clause. This issue remains unresolved.", "The government also may lose revenue when the estimated fair market value of surplus property declines during protracted negotiations. At Myrtle Beach, the Air Force has been negotiating the sale of 777 units of family housing for over 24 months, although a private party offered to purchase them even before they were declared surplus. The reuse authority has offered substantially less than the $11.1 million offer once made by a private party. In both cases, the property\u2019s use would remain the same\u2014housing. Similarly, at Mather Air Force Base, negotiations between the Air Force and the local reuse authority for 1,271 family housing units have been ongoing since 1993.

DOD\u2019s implementation manual states that the initial maintenance level at a base will normally be sustained for a maximum of 1 year after operational closure or 180 days after a formal disposal decision is made. These limits can be extended if a local reuse authority is actively implementing a reuse plan and the initial or adjusted levels are justified. According to an Air Force official, the only two instances (levels five and six) in which the services do not incur costs to maintain and protect property are (1) when property is leased and the tenant provides for the protection and maintenance and (2) when property is abandoned. Neither the Army nor the Navy compiled information on the average cost to protect and maintain their closed bases.

Through the initiative of local base officials, government civilian families were allowed to rent a limited number of the nearly 1,200 family housing units in order to keep a presence in 3 housing tracts. Fort Ord officials, using the Corps of Engineers\u2019 estimates of fair market rental value, entered into rental agreements with the families. The families were assigned only to ground floor units of every other building so that anyone in upstairs units would be noticed and reported to security. According to former installation officials, the rent more than offset the protection and maintenance costs for the entire 1,200 units, and theft, vandalism, fire, and other forms of deterioration were limited to a minor theft and a few instances of graffiti that was quickly removed by housing officials. Many people voluntarily maintained the lawns of adjacent empty buildings, an unexpected benefit. The program was considered a success, and it is being continued by the university that acquired ownership.", "The services could also preserve property values and reduce protection and maintenance costs by limiting the amount of time for negotiating the terms of either an economic development conveyance or a negotiated sale to a state or local jurisdiction. When disposing of surplus real property at closed military bases, the services are required to follow the laws and regulations that establish the terms under which the sale of surplus property is conducted. While the regulations provide direction on how and when sales can occur, they do not establish how long negotiations may continue. Communities may prolong the negotiation period in the hopes of obtaining more favorable terms, but they end up with property in much poorer condition. Negotiations unconstrained by time limits work to neither party\u2019s advantage. Property deterioration during the course of negotiations causes a loss of value to the government, and, if negotiations are successful, receipt of property by the local government that is less expensive but probably in poorer condition than when negotiations started. If time for negotiations was limited to a set period, such as  9 months (the amount of time an appraisal is valid), then property values could be more easily preserved, protection and maintenance costs would be limited, and only one appraisal would be required for the negotiations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Base Reuse Shifts From the Federal Sector to Communities", "paragraphs": ["Current plans call for the federal government to retain about 16 percent of the land at the 23 closing military bases to satisfy agency requirements or to comply with decisions made by the BRAC Commission or by legislation.

It said that it is rare that the property lies in a single political jurisdiction and therefore base reuse planning was an extrordinary intergovernmental consensus building challenge.", "With regard to our recommendation that reasonable time frames be established for concluding negotiated sales of surplus property, DOD partially concurred, stating that placing arbitrary limitations on the time frame for negotiations of sales and economic development conveyances was probably not practical, but it would look at establishing time frames where circumstances permit.

These include the leasing of facilities at Alameda Naval Air Station, Treasure Island Naval Station, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, and the Dayton Defense Electronics Supply Center and the renting of family housing at Fort Ord. 3. We believe our recommendation is practical for bases in urban areas. Fort Ord had more housing units than any other BRAC closure and it was located in a small urban community. Yet, the Army was successful in renting enough of the housing to pay for the protection and maintenance costs for all of the vacated housing. However, in rural areas this approach may not be practical and we revised our final report to reflect this point."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Laws and Regulations Affecting Base Closure", "paragraphs": ["The principal legal authorities governing base closure and reuse are the (1) 1988 Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990; (2) Title XXIX, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994; (3) Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949; (4) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; (5) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980; (6) 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act; and (7) Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994. Since the initial round of closures was announced, the disposal process has undergone a number of changes to enhance the possibility that reuse and economic development will result from the closed bases.", "The 1988 Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, collectively referred to as the base realignment and closure acts or BRAC acts, provide the Secretary of Defense with authority to close military bases and dispose of excess property. In July 1993, the President announced a five-part program to speed economic recovery at communities where military bases are slated to close. Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 amended the BRAC acts to enable local redevelopment authorities to receive government property at no initial cost if the property is used for economic development and job creation. In July 1995, DOD issued a final rule impacting the disposal process. The rule implements the act by establishing the process for conveying property at estimated fair market value or less to facilitate property transfers and foster economic recovery in the affected community (referred to as economic development conveyances).", "The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 establishes the process of disposing of property deemed excess to an agency\u2019s needs or surplus to the government\u2019s requirements. In the case of base closures, property considered excess to the needs of one military service may be requested by the other military services and federal agencies to satisfy program requirements. If no government requirements exist, the property is declared surplus to the government and is available for conveyance at no cost through various public benefit discount programs, negotiated sale at fair market value to state governments or their instrumentalities, public sale at fair market value, or conveyed to communities at fair market value or less for economic development and job creation.", "The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires that the federal government assess the potential environmental impacts of its proposed action to dispose of surplus federal property prior to making a final disposal decision.", "Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, DOD is responsible for environmental restoration on bases recommended for closure or realignment. The level of cleanup required by the act is dependent upon the future use of the site. In fact, surplus property cannot be deeded until it has been determined that the property is environmentally suitable for its intended purposes. However, section 2908, title XXIX, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 makes it possible for the services to transfer a parcel of land exchange for cleanup at a closing base.", "The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act provides homeless service providers access to surplus property. Initially, homeless providers were given priority over local communities for requests of excess property. However, the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994 amended the BRAC acts and the McKinney Act, in essence eliminating the priority that homeless providers had. As a result of the amendments, homeless providers\u2019 needs are now considered in concert with the community\u2019s reuse planning process.", "To support both the communities and the services in their efforts to expedite the disposal and reuse of closing military bases, DOD issued two reference manuals. In May 1995, DOD released the Community Guide to Base Reuse as a resource for communities. The guide describes the base closure and reuse processes; catalogs the many assistance programs available to communities, which are administered by DOD and others; and summarizes lessons learned from other communities that have been affected by base closures and realignments. In July 1995, DOD issued the Base Reuse Implementation Manual to provide common guidance for the service implementors of the Base Closure Assistance Act of 1993 and the Base Closure Community Redevelopment and Homeless Assistance Act of 1994."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Federal Uses of Property at 23 Bases Closed in the 1993 BRAC Round", "paragraphs": ["Charleston
