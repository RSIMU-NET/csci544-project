A small number of U.S.-flagged vessels and ships have been among those affected. As Somalia lacks a functioning government and is unable to repress piracy in its waters, the National Security Council (NSC) developed the interagency Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa: Partnership and Action Plan (Action Plan) in December 2008 to prevent, disrupt, and prosecute piracy off the Horn of Africa in collaboration with international and industry partners. GAO was asked to evaluate the extent to which U.S. agencies (1) have implemented the plan, and any challenges they face in doing so, and (2) have collaborated with partners in counterpiracy efforts. GAO examined counterpiracy plans, activities, collaborative practices, and data, and interviewed industry and international partners and officials at U.S. agencies and the Combined Maritime Forces in Bahrain."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has made progress in implementing its Action Plan, in collaboration with international and industry partners, but pirates have adapted their tactics and expanded their area of operations, almost doubling the number of reported attacks from 2008 to 2009, and the U.S. government has yet to evaluate the costs, benefits, or effectiveness of its efforts or update its plan accordingly. The United States has advised industry partners on self-protection measures, contributed leadership and assets to an international coalition patrolling pirate-infested waters, and concluded prosecution arrangements with Kenya and the Seychelles. Officials credit collaborative efforts with reducing the pirates' rate of success in boarding ships and hijacking vessels in 2009. However, from 2007 to 2009, the most recent year for which complete data were available, the total number of hijackings reported to the International Maritime Bureau increased, ransoms paid by the shipping industry increased sharply, and attacks spread from the heavily patrolled Gulf of Aden--the focus of the Action Plan--to the vast Indian Ocean. The Action Plan's objective is to repress piracy as effectively as possible, but the effectiveness of U.S. resources applied to counterpiracy is unclear because the interagency group responsible for monitoring the Action Plan's implementation has not tracked the cost of U.S. activities--such as operating ships and aircraft and prosecuting suspected pirates--nor systematically evaluated the relative benefits or effectiveness of the Action Plan's tasks. GAO's prior work has shown that federal agencies engaged in collaborative efforts need to evaluate their activities to identify areas for improvement. Moreover, as pirates have adapted their tactics, the Action Plan has not been revised. Without a plan that reflects new developments and assesses the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of U.S. efforts, decision makers will lack information that could be used to target limited resources to provide the greatest benefit, commensurate with U.S. interests in the region. The U.S. government has collaborated with international and industry partners to counter piracy, but it has not implemented some key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration among U.S. agencies. According to U.S. and international stakeholders, the U.S. government has shared information with partners for military coordination. However, agencies have made less progress on several key efforts that involve multiple agencies--such as those to address piracy through strategic communications, disrupt pirate finances, and hold pirates accountable--in part because the Action Plan does not designate which agencies should lead or carry out 13 of the 14 tasks. For instance, the Departments of Defense, Justice, State, and the Treasury all collect information on pirate finances, but none has lead responsibility for analyzing that information to build a case against pirate leaders or financiers. The NSC, the President's principal arm for coordinating national security policy among government agencies, could bolster interagency collaboration and the U.S. contribution to counterpiracy efforts by clarifying agency roles and responsibilities and encouraging the agencies to develop joint guidance to implement their efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the NSC reassess and update its Action Plan; identify metrics; assess the costs, benefits, and effectiveness of U.S. counterpiracy activities; and clarify agency roles and responsibilities.

Since 2007, more than 450 ships have reported pirate attacks in this  area, and Somali pirates have taken nearly 2,400 hostages and received  over $100 million in ransom payments. Although only a few U.S.-flagged  vessels\u2014notably the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009\u2014have been  attacked, pirates have attacked or attempted attacks on chemical and oil  tankers, freighters, cruise ships, fishing vessels, and even warships. In  addition to jeopardizing the lives and welfare of the citizens of many  nations, piracy contributes to regional instability and creates challenges  for shipping and freedom of navigation. With Somalia\u2019s lack of a  functioning government, this illicit but profitable activity has raised  concerns that piracy ransom proceeds may undermine regional security  and contribute to other threats, including terrorism.", "The international community has taken several steps to respond to the  growing piracy problem. The United Nations Security Council has adopted  several resolutions addressing an international response to piracy off the  Horn of Africa. In 2008, the United States, the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, the European Union, regional naval forces, and others began  patrolling waters near Somalia. In January 2009, a multinational naval task  force\u2014Combined Task Force 151\u2014was established under the U.S.-led  Combined Maritime Forces with a specific mission to conduct  counterpiracy operations. Additionally, in January 2009, a multilateral  Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (Contact Group) was  formed pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1851 to  coordinate international counterpiracy efforts.", "Recognizing that vibrant maritime commerce underpins global economic  security and is a vital national security issue, the United States has  developed policies and plans to collaborate with its international and  interagency partners to address piracy off the Horn of Africa and to  mobilize an interagency U.S. response. In December 2008, the National  Security Council (NSC) published the Countering Piracy off the Horn of  Africa: Partnership and Action Plan (Action Plan). This plan  implements the National Strategy for Maritime Security (September  2005) and the Policy for the Repression of Piracy and other Criminal  Acts of Violence at Sea (June 2007) as applied to piracy off the Horn of  Africa. Consistent with the U.S. policy to continue to lead and support  international efforts to repress piracy and to urge other states to take  decisive action both individually and through international efforts, the  Action Plan seeks to involve all nations, international organizations,  industry, and other entities with an interest in maritime security to take  steps to repress piracy off the Horn of Africa. The interagency initiatives  of the Action Plan are to be coordinated and undertaken by the U.S.  Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, State,  Transportation, and the Treasury, and the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence, subject to the availability of resources.", "Over the last few years, we have completed a number of reviews that  examine issues related to piracy off the Horn of Africa. In December 2007,  we reported that the vast areas at risk for piracy off the Horn of Africa  combined with the small number of ships available for patrolling them  make protecting energy tankers and other commercial vessels difficult. In  February 2008, we reported that several challenges limit U.S. and  international stabilization, humanitarian, and development efforts in  Somalia and recommended that the United States develop a more detailed  strategy to address these challenges. In June 2008, we evaluated the  National Strategy for Maritime Security and its supporting plans and  determined that the implementation status of the eight supporting plans  varied. In September 2009, we reported on the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s collaboration with interagency partners to safeguard the  financial system against illicit use and combat national security threats,  and recommended mechanisms to improve interagency collaboration.  Also in September 2009, we reported on the key actions agencies need to  take to enhance interagency collaboration on national security issues. A  list of our related GAO products is included at the end of this report.", "Interested in U.S. efforts to respond to piracy, your offices asked us to  review the extent to which the U.S. government agencies: (1) have made  progress in implementing the Action Plan to counter piracy off the Horn  of Africa and any challenges they face; and (2) are collaborating with each  other, and with international and industry partners to counter piracy off  the Horn of Africa.", "To assess U.S. government progress and challenges in implementing the  Action Plan for countering piracy off the Horn of Africa, we reviewed the  Action Plan, the 2007 Policy for the Repression of Piracy and other  Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea, relevant U.S. laws, and United Nations  Security Council resolutions. We also reviewed program documents,  analyzed data on the incidents of piracy off the Horn of Africa for the years  2007 through June 2010, and interviewed officials from the Departments of  Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, and the  Treasury, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as well as  component agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),  Coast Guard, and National Maritime Intelligence Center to discuss  implementation of the Action Plan and collaboration with partners in  counterpiracy efforts. We selected these departments and agencies  because the Action Plan states they shall contribute to, coordinate, and  undertake initiatives in accordance with the plan. We also reviewed prior  GAO work related to results-oriented government and evaluated the extent  to which the interagency Counter-Piracy Steering Group followed select  key practices for achieving results. In addition, we met with international  and industry partners involved in developing best practices for protecting  ships from pirate attack, working with the international Contact Group,  and participating in naval patrols off the Horn of Africa. We discussed  data-collection methods, processes for data entry, and the steps taken to  ensure reasonable accuracy of the data with both the International  Maritime Bureau and the Combined Maritime Forces. We determined the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To identify the extent to which U.S. government agencies are collaborating  with each other, and with international and industry partners, we  evaluated the extent to which department and agency actions incorporate  key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration on complex  national security issues. In addition, we observed information sharing  forums; reviewed program documents; and interviewed agency,  international, and industry officials about collaboration efforts. We  conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to September 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. The scope and methodology used in our  review are described in further detail in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The 1958 Geneva Convention on the High Seas and the United Nations  Convention on the Law of the Sea share the same definition of piracy, and,  under that definition, piracy consists of any of several acts, including any  illegal act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed  for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship and  directed against another ship, aircraft, persons, or property onboard  another ship on the high seas; or against a ship, persons or property in a  place outside the jurisdiction of any state. Additionally, according to both  conventions, all states have the duty to cooperate to the fullest extent  possible in the repression of piracy on the high seas or in any other place  outside the jurisdiction of any state. Furthermore, both conventions  authorize states to seize pirate ships or a ship under the control of pirates  and arrest the persons and seize the property onboard, on the high seas or  in any other place outside the jurisdiction of any state. In addition, a single  piratical attack often affects the interests of numerous countries, including  the flag state of the vessel, various states of nationality of the seafarers  taken hostage, regional coastal states, owner states, and cargo owner,  transshipment, and destination states.", "Somali pirates attack and harass vessels transiting the Indian Ocean and in  the Gulf of Aden, a natural chokepoint that provides access to the Red Sea  and the Suez Canal and through which over 33,000 ships transit each  year. Pirates operate from land-based enclaves along the 1,880-mile  coastline of Somalia, which is roughly equivalent to the distance from  Portland, Maine, to Miami, Florida. Figure 1 illustrates the vast area in  which incidents of piracy are occurring, 1,000 nautical miles from  Somalia's coast. Figure 1 also shows the location of the Internationally  Recommended Transit Corridor in the Gulf of Aden, where coalition  forces have established naval patrols to help ensure safe passage for  transiting vessels.", "To conduct their attacks, Somali pirates generally use small skiffs,  carrying between four and eight persons armed with AK-47 rifles or similar  light arms and, at times, with rocket-propelled grenades. Once they target  a vessel, pirates typically coordinate a simultaneous two- or three-pronged  attack from multiple directions. Depending on the characteristics and  acquiescence of the victim vessel, pirates can board and commandeer a  vessel in less than 20 minutes. Pirate vessels usually are equipped with  grappling hooks, ladders, and other equipment to assist the boarding of a  larger craft. Pirate vessels vary in sea-worthiness and speed with some  able to travel at speeds between 25 and 30 knots and operate in high sea  conditions, while others have more restricted capabilities. According to  the Office of Naval Intelligence, Somali pirates do not typically target  specific vessels for any reason other than how easily the vessel can be  boarded. Pirates patrol an area and wait for a target of opportunity.  Vessels that travel through the high-risk area at a speed of less than 15  knots and have access points close to the waterline are at higher risk of  being boarded and hijacked.  According to a June 2010 self-protection  guide published by maritime industry organizations, there have been no  reports of pirates boarding ships proceeding at speeds over 18 knots.   Figure 2 shows U.S. authorities boarding a suspected pirate skiff.", "Unlike pirates in other parts of the world, Somali pirates kidnap hostages  for ransom and, up to this point, have not tended to harm captives, steal  cargo, or reuse pirated ships for purposes other than temporarily as  mother ships. Mother ships are typically larger fishing vessels often  acquired or commandeered by acts of piracy that pirates use to store fuel  and supplies, and tow skiffs, which allow them to operate and launch  attacks further off shore. This \u201chostage-for-ransom\u201d business model is  possible in part because the pirates have bases on land in ungoverned  Somalia where they can bring seized vessels, cargoes, and crews and have  access to food, water, weapons, ammunition, and other resources during  ransom negotiations. In an ungoverned state with widespread poverty, the  potential for high profits with low costs and relatively little risk of  consequences has ensured that Somali pirate groups do not lack for  recruits and support. Moreover, some U.S. and international officials  suspect that Somali businessmen and international support networks may  provide financing, supplies, and intelligence to pirate organizations in  exchange for shares of ransom payments.", "In addition to posing a threat to the lives and welfare of seafarers, piracy  imposes a number of economic costs on shippers and on governments.  Costs to shippers include ransom payments, damage to ships and cargoes,  delays in delivering cargoes, increased maritime insurance rates, rerouting  vessels, and hardening merchant ships against attack. According to  officials at the Departments of State and Defense, governments incur costs  by conducting naval patrols, as well as the costs of transporting,  prosecuting, and incarcerating suspected and convicted pirates.", "The United States\u2019 National Strategy for Maritime Security, issued in  2005, declares that the United States has a vital national interest in  maritime security. The strategy recognizes that nations have a common  interest in facilitating the vibrant maritime commerce that underpins  economic security, and in protecting against ocean-related terrorist,  hostile, criminal, and dangerous acts, including piracy. The National  Strategy for Maritime Security also requires full and complete national  and international coordination, cooperation, and intelligence and  information sharing among public and private entities to protect and  secure the maritime domain. The 2007 Policy for the Repression of Piracy  and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea states that it is the policy of  the United States to \u201ccontinue to lead and support international efforts to  repress piracy and urge other states to take decisive action both  individually and through international efforts.\u201d", "In December 2008, the NSC developed the Countering Piracy off the Horn  of Africa: Partnership and Action Plan (Action Plan) to implement the  2005 strategy and the 2007 policy as applied to piracy off the Horn of  Africa. The Action Plan establishes three main lines of action for  interagency stakeholders to take to repress piracy in collaboration with  industry and international partners: (1) prevent pirate attacks by reducing  the vulnerability of the maritime domain to piracy; (2) disrupt acts of  piracy consistent with international law and the rights and responsibilities  of coastal and flag states; and (3) ensure that those who commit acts of  piracy are held accountable for their actions by facilitating the prosecution  of suspected pirates by flag, victim, and coastal states, and, in appropriate  cases, the United States. The NSC\u2014including the Maritime Security  Interagency Policy Committee\u2014develops policy for the U.S. response to  piracy off the Horn of Africa. The Action Plan directed the Secretary of  State and Secretary of Defense to establish a high-level interagency,  operational task force\u2014the Counter-Piracy Steering Group\u2014to  coordinate, implement, and monitor the actions centered in the Action  Plan. In addition, the NSC directed that the Departments of Defense,  Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, and the Treasury and  the Office of the Director of National Intelligence contribute to,  coordinate, and undertake initiatives in accordance with the Action Plan,  subject to available resources. Figure 3 shows the U.S. departments and  agencies involved in implementing the three lines of action contained in  the Action Plan.", "The Department of State (State) is involved in efforts to prevent acts of  piracy and hold pirates accountable, primarily by leading U.S. interaction  with international partners working through the Contact Group, building  regional judicial capacity to prosecute suspected pirates, and encouraging  states to prosecute when their interests are involved. Additionally, State is  involved in efforts to disrupt acts of piracy by tracking ransom payments  and following financing issues related to piracy. Within Defense, U.S.  Naval Forces Central Command is involved in prevention, interdiction, and  prosecution efforts by contributing forces to the Combined Maritime  Forces, an international maritime coalition. Within the Combined Maritime  Forces, Combined Task Force 151 conducts counterpiracy operations in  international waters, including the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of  Oman, the Arabian Gulf and the waters off the Somali coast in the Indian  Ocean. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service supports and assists  interdiction and prosecution efforts by conducting incident investigations,  supervising detention of suspected pirates, assisting U.S. and international  prosecutions, debriefing released crews, and providing criminal  intelligence information. U.S. Africa Command assists in preventing piracy  through strategic communication efforts and building partner capacity in  regional states and would plan and, if authorized, conduct any land-based  military activities in Somalia to interrupt pirate operations. U.S. Africa  Command also conducts counterpiracy naval patrols and interdiction  efforts in its area of responsibility. Treasury is involved in disrupting  pirates\u2019 revenue sources by examining pirate financial activity and  implementing an executive order to block the assets of certain persons.  Justice is involved in holding pirates accountable through prosecution as  well as judicial capacity-building in African states. The Coast Guard, under  Homeland Security, helps prevent piracy through its work with and  regulation of the U.S. shipping industry and assists in interrupting piracy  by providing law enforcement units and boarding teams on Navy vessels.  Transportation\u2019s Maritime Administration assists with preventing piracy  by working with the shipping industry to develop best practices for the  industry to protect itself from piracy. In addition, within the intelligence  community, the Office of Naval Intelligence\u2013as part of the National  Maritime Intelligence Center\u2014provides maritime intelligence assistance.", "The international community, shipping industry, and international military  forces also have been involved in taking steps to prevent and disrupt acts  of piracy off the Horn of Africa, and facilitate prosecutions of suspected  pirates. Over the past few years, the United Nations adopted a number of  United Nations Security Council resolutions related to countering piracy in  the Horn of Africa region, including resolutions 1816 which authorizes  states to enter the territorial waters of Somalia in coordination with the  Somali Transitional Federal Government, for the purpose of repressing  acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea, and to use all necessary and  appropriate means to repress acts of piracy and armed robbery within  Somali territorial waters. In January 2009, the Contact Group on Piracy  off the Coast of Somalia (Contact Group) formed under the auspices of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1851, and facilitates  discussion and coordination of actions among states and organizations to  suppress piracy off the coast of Somalia. In addition, in February 2009  organizations representing the interests of ship owners, seafarers, and  marine insurance companies worked to publish the first version of  voluntary commercial vessel self-protection measures to avoid and  respond to pirate attacks, referred to as \u201cbest management practices.\u201d In  May and September 2009, 10 countries signed the New York Declaration,  and committed to (1) promulgate the internationally recognized best  management practices for self-protection to vessels on their registry and  (2) ensure that vessels on their registry have adopted and documented  appropriate self-protection measures in their ship security plans when  carrying out their obligations under an existing international agreement.", "The United States also has provided forces and leadership to the  Combined Maritime Forces, which is a coalition of 25 contributing nations  that are working to conduct maritime security operations in the region. In  January 2009, the Combined Maritime Forces established Combined Task  Force 151, a multinational naval task force with the sole mission of  conducting counterpiracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and the waters  off the Somali coast in the Indian Ocean. That role previously had been  filled by Combined Task Force 150, which continues to perform  counterterrorism and other maritime security operations as it has since  2001. There are 11 nations that have participated and several others that  have agreed to send ships or aircraft or both to participate in Combined  Task Force 151. In addition, the United States has contributed assets to the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s counterpiracy effort since its  inception. Its current effort, Operation Ocean Shield, focuses on at-sea  counterpiracy operations and offers assistance to regional countries in  developing their own capacity to combat piracy activities. Moreover, as  part of the Combined Maritime Forces, the United States also works with  the European Union, which conducts counterpiracy operations and  escorts World Food Programme vessels delivering humanitarian aid to  countries in the region, as well as independent deployers not part of the  coalition that escort vessels and patrol area waters.", "Figure 4 shows many of the key international and industry partners  involved in the response to piracy off the Horn of Africa with whom the  United States collaborates and coordinates. More information on  international and shipping-industry partners is included in appendix III.", "According to officials at State and Justice, the United States will consider  prosecuting suspected pirates in appropriate cases when U.S. interests are  directly affected, such as what occurred when suspected pirates attacked  the U.S.-flagged ships MV Maersk Alabama, USS Nicholas, and USS  Ashland. When suspected pirates are captured by U.S. forces and Justice  determines not to prosecute the case in the United States, the United  States works with the affected states and regional partners to find a  suitable venue for prosecution. In January 2006, 10 suspected pirates were  captured by U.S. forces after they hijacked the Indian-flagged dhow Safina  al Bisarat and used it to attack the Greek-owned and Bahamian-flagged  Delta Ranger. This was the first incident where U.S. forces captured  suspected pirates in the region and transferred them into the custody of  Kenya. As of July 2010, the United States had formalized two arrangements  with regional states\u2014Kenya and the Seychelles\u2014to facilitate the transfer  and prosecution of suspected pirates.

However, the U.S. government has had  less success in other areas. For example, the United States has not  disrupted pirate bases on shore, and the international community has  made only limited progress to disrupt pirates\u2019 revenue and prosecute  suspected pirates. While many stakeholders credit international, industry,  and U.S. government efforts with contributing to a decline in the  percentage of successful attacks that resulted in a vessel boarding or  hijacking, since 2007 pirates have increased their total number of attacks,  become more organized, and greatly expanded their area of operations.

The Action Plan establishes the U.S. role in countering piracy as a  collaborative one, seeking to involve all countries and shipping-industry  partners with an interest in maritime security. For U.S. agencies, the  Action Plan states that, subject to available resources, the Departments of  Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, and the  Treasury, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will  contribute to, coordinate, and undertake initiatives in accordance with the  Action Plan. The NSC also establishes some limits to the scope of the plan  by focusing on immediate measures to reduce the incidents of piracy,  rather than longer-term stabilization of Somalia that the Action Plan  asserts is needed to fully repress piracy.", "Our review focused on the steps U.S. agencies have made to repress piracy  off the Horn of Africa, but given the international nature of the issue, our  analysis frequently refers to the related efforts of international and  industry partners. We found that, of the 14 total tasks established within  the three lines of action in the Action Plan, substantial progress has been  made in implementing 4 tasks, the majority of which are related to  preventing piracy. The United States has made some progress toward  implementing 8 other tasks, including all of the tasks involved in  facilitating the prosecution of suspected pirates. Little or no progress has  been made with regard to 1 task that relates to disrupting acts of piracy,  and we did not assess 1 task because agencies decided it would duplicate  the efforts of international partners and should not be implemented.  Figure 5 summarizes the results of our assessment. For more detailed  information about U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the Action Plan and  our analysis of their progress, see appendix II.", "In collaboration with its international and industry partners, the U.S.  government has made substantial progress overall toward implementing  Action Plan tasks aimed at preventing acts of piracy. First, the United  States has been a key contributor among the 49 countries participating in  the Contact Group, including leading a working group on industry self- protection. Second, State, Defense, Coast Guard, and the Maritime  Administration, in collaboration with international and industry partners,  also have made substantial progress on the second task to encourage  commercial vessels to transit high-risk waters through the Maritime  Security Patrol Area, which includes the Internationally Recommended  Transit Corridor patrolled by international naval forces. Third, the U.S.  government has made substantial progress to ensure shippers update U.S.- flagged vessels\u2019 ship security plans to address the pirate threat, and in  encouraging the crews of commercial vessels to use industry-developed  self-protection measures to prevent piracy, often referred to as \u201cbest  management practices.\u201d These practices include adding physical barriers  to obstruct pirates from boarding a vessel and taking evasive maneuvers to  fend off attack.", "Despite these and other actions to prevent attacks, U.S. government and  shipping industry officials stated that ensuring all vessels transiting the  area implement best management practices remains a challenge. The  Coast Guard has developed regulations mandating self-protection  measures, but these regulations only apply to U.S.-flagged vessels, which  comprise a small portion of the total shipping traffic transiting the region.  The shipping industry has developed a document outlining self-protection  measures, but implementation is voluntary. While government and  shipping industry officials lack data on the extent to which best  management practices are used, they estimate that about a quarter of the  vessels are not using one of the easiest and least costly of the best  practices, registering their passage with a naval coordination center in the  region, which raises questions about the extent of their implementation of  the other practices. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, and  shipping industry officials stated it may be challenging to find additional  ways to encourage the remaining vessels to self-protect from attack.", "Regarding the Action Plan\u2019s fourth task aimed at preventing piracy, we  determined that U.S. agencies have made some progress on strategic  communication, described in the Action Plan as a global information  campaign to highlight the destructive elements of piracy and the  international efforts to coordinate a response to the problem. While U.S.  agencies have taken steps in this area, State has yet to finalize a strategic  communication plan to coordinate interagency communications efforts to  counter piracy. Defense officials stated that the lack of a U.S. presence in  Somalia presents additional challenges to efforts to communicate with the  Somali population to discourage piracy and for measuring the  effectiveness of U.S. communication efforts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Agency Efforts to Disrupt Acts of Piracy", "paragraphs": ["While the United States and its international partners have made  substantial progress overall on the task of providing forces and assets  capable of interdicting pirates off the Horn of Africa and have made some  progress on the tasks related to seizing and destroying pirate vessels,  supporting regional arrangements to counter piracy, and disrupting pirate  revenue, U.S. agencies have made little or no progress toward  implementing the task related to disrupting and dismantling pirate bases.  We found that the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard have made substantial  progress contributing assets and leadership to coalition forces patrolling  the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. According to Defense officials,  typically, more than 30 ships from coalition, European Union, North  Atlantic Treaty Organization, and independent forces patrol the region at  any given time, with the United States contributing between 4 and 5 ships  per day on average. In addition, consistent with the Action Plan, U.S.  forces have responded to and successfully interdicted pirate attacks. For  example, in April 2009, U.S. forces successfully terminated the hostage  situation that occurred when pirates attacked the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk  Alabama and kidnapped the vessel\u2019s captain. U.S. forces intervened and  freed the captain after killing all but one of the pirates conducting the  attack.", "However, as pirate activity has expanded to the larger Indian Ocean, U.S.  and international military officials stated that providing an interdiction  capable force similar to that provided in the Gulf of Aden is not feasible.  Though coalition forces developed guidance for improving coordination of  forces in the Indian Ocean, Defense officials emphasized that there are not  enough naval vessels among all of the combined navies in the world to  adequately patrol this expansive area for pirates. Moreover, Defense  officials acknowledged that there are other competing U.S. national  interests in the region, such as the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as  well as counterterrorism missions that require the use of the limited naval  and air assets that are used to monitor and gather intelligence for  counterpiracy operations.", "In addition, the U.S. government has made some progress to seize and  destroy pirate vessels and equipment, and deliver suspected pirates for  prosecution. For example, U.S. forces have contributed to coalition forces  that confiscated or destroyed almost 100 pirate vessels. However, U.S.  forces have encountered more difficulty in delivering captured suspected  pirates to states willing and able to ensure they are considered for  prosecution. From August 2008 to June 2010, international forces  subsequently released 638 of 1,129 suspected pirates, almost 57 percent of  those captured, in part because of the difficulty finding countries that  were willing or able to prosecute them. Further, the United States has  made some progress on the task to disrupt pirate revenue. In April 2010,  President Obama signed an executive order that blocks assets of certain  persons, including two suspected pirates, who have engaged in acts that  threatened the peace, security or stability of Somalia. However,  according to officials at Treasury, the department charged with  implementation, the executive order applies only to assets subject to U.S.  jurisdiction, and U.S. efforts to track and block pirates\u2019 finances in  Somalia are hampered by the lack of government and formal banking  institutions there and resulting gaps in intelligence.", "The U.S. government has made some progress on the task to support  \u201cshiprider\u201d programs and other agreements. The United States has  supported some bilateral and regional counterpiracy arrangements, most  notably the International Maritime Organization\u2019s effort to conclude a  regional arrangement, generally referred to as the Djibouti Code of  Conduct. This arrangement contains provisions related to information  sharing regarding pirate activity among the signatories, reviews of national  legislation related to piracy, and provision of assistance between  signatories. However, U.S. agencies have made little progress on the  second part of this task to develop shiprider programs, in which regional  law enforcement officials accompany naval patrols to collect evidence to  support successful prosecutions. Justice officials explained that the  potential benefits do not warrant the resource investment the programs  would require. Specifically, the presence of shipriders would not  significantly enhance the ability of regional countries to prosecute  suspected pirates.", "State and Defense officials report that no steps have been made to disrupt  and dismantle pirate bases ashore in part because the President has not  authorized this action, the United States has other interests in the region  that compete for resources, and long-standing concerns about security  hinder the presence of U.S. military and government officials in Somalia.  While the United States has not supported the creation of a Counter-Piracy  Coordination Center, as called for in the Action Plan, we did not provide a  progress assessment for this task since government and industry officials  have stated that existing organizations and coordination centers  currently fulfill the incident reporting and monitoring functions, and that  establishing a new center would duplicate those efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agency Efforts to Facilitate Prosecution of Suspected Pirates", "paragraphs": ["While the United States has made some progress on implementing the  tasks established in the Action Plan to hold pirates accountable, the  United States and its international partners have only prosecuted a small  number of pirates overall for a variety of reasons. As of July 2010, Kenya  and the Seychelles were the only regional partners that accepted transfers  of suspected pirates from U.S. forces for purposes of prosecution.  According to officials from State, the reluctance of affected states to  prosecute and limited judicial capacity in the region are barriers to the  ability of the U.S. government to make substantial progress on the task of  concluding prosecution arrangements. Officials also noted that the facts  and circumstances of each encounter differ, with not all cases eliciting  evidence that could be brought to court. As already described, these  factors contributed to the release of almost 57 percent of the suspected  Somali pirates that international forces encountered from August 2008 to  June 2010. The United States has made some progress on the task to  support and encourage the exercise of jurisdiction under the Convention  for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime  Navigation as a framework to prosecute suspected pirates. For example,  the United States has used the convention while prosecuting one pirate in  the United States. The U.S. government has also supported and  encouraged the use of other applicable conventions and laws by  exercising jurisdiction over 11 suspected pirates who attempted an attack  on U.S. warships. However, Defense, State, and Justice officials reported  that the United States and its international partners have faced significant  challenges in encouraging countries to prosecute pirates, due to a lack of  political will or judicial capacity, such as an inadequate number of  attorneys to prosecute the cases. Lastly, on the task to enhance the  capabilities of regional states to accept suspected pirates for prosecution,  the U.S. government has provided assistance to several regional states,  and the United States has contributed to international efforts to build  regional judicial capacity. For example, according to State officials, the  United States has worked with the government of Tanzania to allow  pirates to be prosecuted there even when cases lack a domestic  connection. However, regional states continue to have a limited capacity  to prosecute suspected pirates and incarcerate convicted pirates."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pirates Have Increased the Number of Attacks, Expanded Their Area of Operations, and Become More Organized", "paragraphs": ["While many stakeholders anecdotally credit international, industry, and  U.S. government efforts with preventing and disrupting piracy off the Horn  of Africa, from 2007 through the first half of 2010 piracy has evolved in  many ways\u2014pirates increased their attacks, claimed more hostages and  revenue from shipping industry\u2019s ransom payments, expanded their area  of operations, and became more organized. As figure 6 illustrates, the total  number of reported pirate attacks increased from 30 in 2007 to 218 in 2009.  These reported attacks include four attempts on U.S.-flagged vessels in  2009, one of which was successful\u2014the attack on the MV Maersk  Alabama.", "However, the rate of successful attacks, or the proportion of total reported  attacks that resulted in vessel boardings or hijackings, decreased from  around 40 percent in 2008 to 22 percent in 2009. U.S. and international  officials interpret this as a sign that the efforts of the shipping industry,  governments, and the international naval patrols to prevent or disrupt  attacks are having a positive effect on the situation. In addition, in the first  6 months of 2010, reports of total attacks declined to about 100 attacks, as  compared with 149 attacks during the first half of 2009. However, other  data show that piracy remains a persistent problem. For example, as figure  7 shows, the number of hostages of various nationalities captured by  Somali pirates from 2007 to 2009 more than quintupled. The total number  of hostages includes 21 hostages from the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk  Alabama in 2009. Furthermore, in the first half of 2010, pirates took 529  hostages compared to 510 in the first half of 2009.", "In addition, pirates have expanded their area of operations with an  increasing number of attacks occurring in the Indian Ocean, an area much  larger to patrol than the Gulf of Aden. By the end of 2008, when the NSC  issued its Action Plan, approximately 83 percent of the 111 reported pirate  attacks off the Horn of Africa that year took place in the Gulf of Aden, an  area just over 100,000 square miles, with the remainder off the coast of  Somalia. However, just a year later in 2009, only 53 percent of the 218 total  attacks occurred in the Gulf of Aden as Somali pirates expanded their area  of operations to the broader Indian Ocean. Pirates now threaten an area of  nearly 2 million square nautical miles in the Somali Basin, Gulf of Aden,  and Northern Arabian Sea. Figure 8 shows the number and location of  pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa reported to the International Maritime  Bureau in 2007, 2008, 2009, and the first half of 2010.", "While the Action Plan cites attacks as far as 450 miles from Somalia\u2019s  coast, in April 2010 the International Maritime Bureau reported that  pirates had increased their capability to attack and hijack vessels to more  than 1,000 nautical miles from Somalia using mother ships, from which  they launch smaller boats to conduct the attacks. International officials  stated that piracy in the Indian Ocean is more challenging due to the great  expanse of water, and requires a different approach than that used in the  Gulf of Aden. One U.S. Navy analysis estimated that 1,000 ships equipped  with helicopters would be required to provide the same level of coverage  in the Indian Ocean that is currently provided in the Gulf of Aden\u2014an  approach that is clearly infeasible.", "Although U.S. and international officials have expressed concern that  international support networks may be providing pirate groups with  financing, supplies, and intelligence in return for shares of ransom  payments, as of March 2010 the intelligence community assessed that  Somali pirates are not receiving funding or coordination from non-U.S.  foreign sources outside Somalia, aside from ransom payments. Defense  supports FBI and Treasury efforts to monitor whether there is U.S.-based  support for piracy. Figure 9 shows that from 2007 to 2009 the estimated  amount of total ransom payments paid to pirates by the shipping industry  increased from about $3 million to $74 million, with the average amount of  ransoms paid per vessel increasing from $300,000 to more than $2  million.", "A December 2008 United Nations report revealed characteristics of  structural organization in piracy operations, including evidence of pirate  leaders and financiers who supply the equipment and provisions for other  pirates to carry out the attacks, and that ransom payments are distributed  according to organizational roles. In addition, State, Defense, and FBI  officials observed that piracy off the Horn of Africa has become more  organized, and Defense officials said that gathering more information  about pirate organizations that could be used to identify pirate leaders  would be beneficial. FBI officials noted that pirate organizations lack the  sophistication associated with other types of organized crime, such as the  American mafia. These officials stated that the FBI continues to  investigate potential ties Somali pirates may have to individuals outside of  Somalia. Moreover, U.S. officials have expressed repeated concerns that  funds generated by piracy have the potential to attract extremists or  terrorists located in the region to become involved in piracy. Treasury,  Justice, State, and Defense are monitoring piracy on an ongoing basis to  determine if there is a link between pirates and extremist organizations,  but as of July 2010 had found no credible link."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Government Has Not Evaluated the Costs, Benefits, or Effectiveness of Its Counterpiracy Efforts, Reported Results, or Updated Its Action Plan Accordingly", "paragraphs": ["The Action Plan\u2019s objective is to repress piracy in the interest of the global  economy, among other things, but the effectiveness of U.S. resources  applied to counterpiracy is unclear because the interagency group  responsible for monitoring the Action Plan\u2019s implementation was not  specifically charged with tracking the cost of U.S. activities or  systematically evaluating the relative benefits or effectiveness of the  Action Plan\u2019s tasks and neither the interagency steering group nor the  federal agencies involved have performed these tasks. Our prior work has  shown that federal agencies engaged in collaborative efforts need to  evaluate activities to identify areas for improvement. Moreover, as pirates  have adapted their tactics, the Action Plan has not been revised.", "The U.S. government is not systematically tracking the costs or the  benefits and effectiveness of its counterpiracy activities to determine  whether its investment has achieved the desired results or should be  revised. According to officials at State and Defense, the interagency  Counter-Piracy Steering Group, which is jointly led by these two agencies  and charged with monitoring implementation of the Action Plan, has not  been systematically monitoring the cost or evaluating the benefits or  effectiveness of U.S. counterpiracy efforts. In commenting on a draft of  this report, Defense stated that the interagency group was not performing  these functions because it was not specifically charged to do so in the  Action Plan. Instead, State officials told us the group primarily provides a  forum for U.S. agencies to coordinate efforts before multilateral Contact  Group meetings or discuss ongoing initiatives such as the development of  the April 2010 executive order on Somalia. Officials from Justice,  Treasury, Coast Guard, and State reported that the NSC\u2019s Maritime  Security Interagency Policy Committee, a high-level interagency group that  is focused on maritime issues, generally tracks U.S. progress toward  implementing the Action Plan and discusses status updates on piracy  provided from the various agencies. However, the officials were not aware  of systematic efforts to track the costs, or evaluate the benefits or  effectiveness of U.S. counterpiracy activities. Table 1 describes selected  costs we identified that may be incurred by U.S. agencies for  counterpiracy efforts.", "While most of the agencies involved had not systematically tracked the  cost of their counterpiracy efforts, Defense developed a partial estimate.  Defense officials estimated that U.S. Central Command\u2019s counterpiracy  operations for fiscal year 2009 totaled approximately $64 million for costs  associated with 773 U.S. Navy ship steaming days, flight hours to support  ships operating in the area, port costs, and those related to detaining and  delivering suspected pirates to proper authorities. However, officials said  this estimate does not include estimates for costs incurred for  counterpiracy operations by other combatant commands such as U.S.  Africa Command. In addition, Defense officials noted the deployment of  naval forces in support of the counterpiracy operations takes the ships,  crew, aircraft, intelligence assets, and other forces away from other global  missions such as counterterrorism and counternarcotics efforts.", "In addition to not tracking the costs of U.S. counterpiracy efforts, U.S.  agencies also are not evaluating the benefits of U.S. counterpiracy efforts  to U.S. interests. While the Action Plan discusses the United States\u2019  national security interest in maintaining freedom of navigation of the seas  in order to facilitate vibrant maritime commerce, the extent to which  counterpiracy benefits U.S. interests and maritime commerce has not been  evaluated. The Maritime Administration reports that piracy may pose costs  to the maritime industry for protecting vessels from being attacked or  hijacked. For example, industry may incur costs for rerouting ships to  avoid pirate-infested waters, higher insurance premiums, or enhancing  vessel security by hiring private security guards or installing nonlethal  deterrent equipment. Ultimately, according to the Maritime  Administration, any costs incurred would be passed along to the taxpayer  and the consumer. However, agencies are not systematically evaluating  the extent to which the U.S. investment in counterpiracy operations is  benefiting maritime commerce or weighing these benefits against the costs  incurred to conduct counterpiracy operations. In addition, data show that  the number of U.S. ships operating in the region is low. The Coast Guard  reports that, at any given time, there are about six to eight U.S.-flagged  vessels operating in the region and the chance of a commercial vessel  being attacked by pirates in the Gulf of Aden is estimated to be less than 1  percent. Furthermore, according to the Maritime Administration, vessels  carrying commerce to the United States are less susceptible to piracy  given their high speed. Moreover, in 2009, the Congressional Research  Service reported that despite the increased threats and estimates of rising  costs associated with piracy off the Horn of Africa, the effect on the  insurance industry appeared negligible and U.S. insurance rates had not  changed.", "The Action Plan also establishes objectives related to repressing piracy  and reducing incidents of piracy, but it does not define measures of  effectiveness that can be used to evaluate progress toward reaching those  objectives, or assess the relative benefits or effectiveness of the Action  Plan\u2019s tasks to prevent, disrupt, and prosecute acts of piracy. Further, the  Action Plan does not specify what information the NSC or other  designated interagency groups should use to monitor or evaluate to  determine progress, or assess benefits or effectiveness. Agency officials  have cited several challenges associated with measuring the effectiveness  of U.S. efforts, including the complexity of the piracy problem, difficulty in  establishing a desired end-state for counterpiracy efforts, and difficulty in  distinguishing the effect of U.S. efforts from those of its international and  industry partners. Nevertheless, U.S., international, and industry officials  we spoke with attributed the decrease in the pirates\u2019 rate of successful  attacks in 2009 and shift to the Indian Ocean to U.S. and international  prevention and interdiction efforts. We previously have reported that  performance information is essential to the ability of decision makers to  make informed decisions, and that specifying performance metrics can be  one tool in evaluating the effectiveness of government efforts in a  changing environment. Identifying measures of effectiveness and  systematically evaluating the effectiveness of agency efforts could assist  the U.S. government in determining the costs and benefits of their  activities to ensure that resources devoted to counterpiracy efforts are  being targeted most effectively, and whether adjustments to plans are  required.", "Without information on the magnitude of U.S. resources devoted to  counterpiracy operations, or the benefits or effectiveness of its actions,  the U.S. government is limited in its ability to weigh its investment of  resources to counter piracy off the Horn of Africa against its other  interests in the region. The lack of systematic evaluation of costs, benefits,  and effectiveness also makes it difficult for agencies to target and  prioritize their activities to achieve the greatest benefits. We have  previously reported that agencies should identify the human, information  technology, physical, and financial resources needed to initiate or sustain  a joint effort among multiple agencies, as one means of enhancing  interagency collaboration. In addition, a discussion of resources,  investments, and risk management is an important characteristic of  national strategies that can enhance their usefulness to resource and  policy decision makers and resource managers.", "Moreover, despite the expansion of pirate attacks over a vastly larger  geographic area, increased ransom demands and payments, and better  organized pirate activities since the Action Plan was written, according to  U.S. government officials, there are no plans to reassess the Action Plan in  order to determine whether it should be revised. Currently, the Action  Plan does not specifically address how to counter pirates in the broader  Indian Ocean or what methods to use to meet its objective of  apprehending leaders of pirate organizations and their financiers. U.S.  agencies have reported taking some steps to respond to the changing  methods and location of pirate attacks. For example, the Navy issues  weekly updates on piracy incidents to inform mariners and naval forces,  which in 2010 have cautioned that pirates are operating at considerable  distances off the coast of Somalia. Defense officials also have worked with  coalition partners to develop a coordination guide for operations in the  Somali Basin and have described measures they have taken to interdict  and destroy pirate mother ships. However, according to Coast Guard,  Treasury, and Justice officials, as of April 2010, the Maritime Security  Interagency Policy Committee affirmed the overall course of U.S.  counterpiracy efforts and did not identify a need to modify the current  approach to countering piracy. Furthermore, the Action Plan contains  tasks such as those to create a Counter-Piracy Coordination Center and  support shiprider programs that are no longer being pursued by U.S.  agencies because they have determined that these tasks are not needed or  would not be beneficial. We have established in prior work that federal  efforts are implemented in dynamic environments in which needs must be  constantly reassessed, and that agencies can enhance and sustain  collaborative efforts by, among other things, developing mechanisms to  report on results. By continually evaluating its approach to countering  piracy off the Horn of Africa and reporting on results of its counterpiracy  efforts to key stakeholders, the United States may be in a better position to  hold agencies accountable for results and achieve its ultimate goal of  repressing piracy."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Have Worked Collaboratively with Partners but Could Take Key Steps to Enhance and Sustain Collaboration in Counterpiracy Efforts", "paragraphs": ["U.S. agencies have generally collaborated well with international and  industry partners to counter piracy, but they could implement other key  collaborative practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration among  U.S. interagency partners.

As previously discussed, the Action Plan directed  U.S. agencies to establish and maintain a Contact Group, which serves as  an international forum for countries contributing to the counterpiracy  effort to share information. State orchestrates U.S. participation in the  Contact Group, coordinating with officials from Defense, Justice,  Homeland Security, Transportation, and Treasury. As part of the Contact  Group, the United States has participated in six plenary meetings with  international partners in counter piracy efforts since January 2009. These  meetings have facilitated international military coordination, provided  guidance to international efforts, and established a trust fund to support  counterpiracy efforts. As part of the Contact Group\u2019s efforts, the Coast  Guard and the Maritime Administration cochair a working group focusing  on coordinating with the shipping industry, which has reviewed and  updated best management practices for industry self-protection,  encouraged continued communication between industry and government  organizations such as the Maritime Security Centre\u2013Horn of Africa, and is  developing guidance for seafarer training regarding pirate attacks. In  addition, officials told us that State has participated in the working group  on strategic communication and assisted in developing draft strategic  communication documents considered by the group.", "The United States also has worked to establish collaborative  organizations, share information, and develop joint guidance for  international military partners working to counter piracy. As the leader of  the Combined Maritime Forces, in 2008 the U.S. Navy, along with other  international partners, established the Shared Awareness and  Deconfliction meetings that are intended to provide a mechanism for  militaries active in the region to share information on their movements  and make efficient use of the limited naval assets patrolling pirate-infested  waters. We observed one of these meetings that occur every 4 to 6 weeks  with representatives from the European Union, North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, and the shipping industry, as well as with nontraditional  partners from countries such as Russia and China. According to U.S. and  international officials, these meetings have improved coordination and led  to the creation of the Internationally Recommended Transit Corridor  within the Maritime Security Patrol Area as well as coordination guides for  military operations in the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Basin. The  coordination guides provide joint guidance to participating international  forces intended to ensure the most effective use of the military assets in  the region by outlining shared practices and procedures.", "The United States has also worked to support information sharing efforts  on investigative and prosecutorial techniques. In July, 2010, the Naval  Criminal Investigative Service hosted a workshop on counterpiracy  investigations that was attended by over 50 representatives from the  United States, international military, law enforcement, and industry  organizations. According to Defense officials, this workshop facilitated  development of a draft investigators manual designed to help standardize  counterpiracy operations.", "U.S. agencies, primarily the Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration,  have worked with industry partners to facilitate collaborative forums,  share information, and develop joint guidance for implementing  counterpiracy efforts. Industry partners play an important role in  preventing and deterring pirate attacks since they are responsible for  implementing self -protection measures on commercial vessels. According  to officials, in late 2008 the Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration  encouraged industry groups to develop best practices for industry to  counter piracy and hosted several meetings with U.S. and international  industry groups. According to U.S. and shipping industry officials, these  meetings resulted in the industry-published best management practices  guide. This document has provided critical guidance to ship owners and  operators on how to protect themselves from pirate attacks. In addition,  for those ship owners who choose or are required to carry armed security  teams, the Coast Guard and State have worked to identify viable methods  for doing so in accordance with applicable U.S., international, and port- state laws. The Coast Guard has communicated methods for taking arms  on ships and the responses from international partners to the shipping  industry through two port security advisories. As the U.S. agency  responsible for implementing national and international maritime security  regulations on U.S.-flagged vessels, the Coast Guard also has hosted four  collaborative forums with industry partners to address piracy issues since  April 2009. These meetings have provided a forum to discuss changes  required to ship security plans to address the piracy threat, the evolving  piracy situation, and U.S. efforts to assist in protecting U.S.-flagged  vessels. For example, the Coast Guard facilitated a meeting with industry  representatives and officials from State and Treasury in April 2010 to  discuss the executive order on Somalia, which has implications for the  shipping industry\u2019s ability to pay ransoms to secure the release of captive  crews. Further, the Maritime Administration developed training courses to  inform vessel crews about how to help prevent piracy and steps to take if  taken hostage.", "In addition, the Maritime Administration and the Military Sealift Command  have created a new collaborative mechanism for working with industry in  the form of Anti-Piracy Assistance Teams. When requested by the owner of  a U.S.-flagged vessel, a team consisting of the Maritime Administration and  the Naval Criminal Investigative Service personnel will assess a ship\u2019s  security and offer advice on ways to improve. When the teams visit a  vessel, Maritime Administration officials meet with company officials to  discuss their security efforts and document these efforts so they can be  shared with other ship operators. Lastly, U.S. Central Command has used  the Maritime Liaison Office based in Bahrain as an additional mechanism  to exchange information between naval forces and industry. This office  serves as a conduit for information focused on safety of shipping and  conducts outreach with the shipping industry, such as through newsletters  to encourage the use of self-protection measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Have Implemented Some Collaborative Practices but Could Enhance Efforts by Incorporating Others", "paragraphs": ["U.S. government agencies have implemented some collaborative practices  in working with interagency partners to counter piracy but could enhance  efforts where less progress has been made by incorporating other key  practices. Several key practices than can enhance interagency  collaboration include developing an overarching strategy, establishing  collaborative mechanisms to share information with partners, assigning  roles and responsibilities, and developing joint guidance to implement  interagency efforts. Consistent with key practices, the NSC established its  Action Plan, which serves an overarching strategy to guide U.S.  interagency efforts and provides a framework for interagency  collaboration. The Action Plan creates an interagency task force that is  intended to coordinate, implement, and monitor the actions contained in  the plan.", "In addition, the U.S. departments and multiple component agencies  involved in counterpiracy efforts have also implemented another key  practice\u2014using collaborative organizations to share information.  Collaborative organizations that provide adequate coordination  mechanisms to facilitate interagency collaboration and achieve an  integrated approach are particularly important when differences exist  between agencies that can impede collaboration and progress toward  shared goals by potentially wasting scarce resources and limiting  effectiveness. Within the NSC, which includes committees with agency  secretaries, deputy secretaries, and assistant secretaries, are existing  forums for discussing and coordinating interagency efforts that officials  have reported discuss counterpiracy efforts. Additionally, as called for in  the Action Plan, State and Defense established the Counter-Piracy  Steering Group, which includes representatives from the U.S. departments  and component agencies involved in counterpiracy efforts.", "Furthermore, in certain circumstances, such as a pirate attack on a U.S.- flagged vessel, the U.S. government uses the existing Maritime Operational  Threat Response process to facilitate a discussion among U.S. agencies  and decide on courses of action, which is outlined in an October 2006 plan  that is part of the National Strategy for Maritime Security. For example,  when the MV Maersk Alabama was attacked in April 2009, facilitators  utilized established protocols to activate the process and bring together  the appropriate government officials. Figure 10 shows U.S. authorities  responding to the MV Maersk Alabama incident in 2009. According to U.S.  and Maersk officials involved, over the course of several meetings\u2014some  of which included Maersk representatives\u2014U.S. officials decided on  actions to take in response to the attack, resulting in the release of a U.S.  merchant marine captain that had been taken hostage by pirates. U.S. and  Maersk officials considered the outcome of the Alabama incident to be a  success. Officials from Defense, State, Coast Guard, the Maritime  Administration, and Justice have reported that this process has been an  effective tool in responding to this and other piracy incidents. In addition,  the Coast Guard established a new collaboration mechanism\u2014a weekly  interagency conference call\u2014to coordinate operational efforts among the  agency partners working to counter piracy, which we observed during this  review.", "Although the NSC and U.S. agencies have taken these collaborative steps,  the NSC could incorporate two other key practices\u2014assigning roles and  responsibilities and developing joint implementation guidance\u2014to further  enhance interagency collaboration in counterpiracy efforts. As of July  2010, the NSC had only assigned roles and responsibilities for  implementing 1 of the 14 Action Plan tasks. The Action Plan recognizes  that, consistent with other U.S. mission requirements, the U.S. Navy and  the Coast Guard provide persistent interdiction through their presence and  can conduct maritime counterpiracy operations. In addition, the Action  Plan states that those forces shall coordinate counterpiracy activities with  other forces operating in the region to the extent practicable and sets out a  number of specific actions to be taken in various piracy situations.  Although the Action Plan states that the Departments of Defense,  Homeland Security, Justice, State, Transportation, and the Treasury, and  the Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall contribute to,  coordinate, and undertake initiatives in accordance with the Action Plan,  the NSC did not clearly identify roles and responsibilities for specific  agencies that will ensure the implementation of the other 13 tasks in the  Action Plan. Establishing roles and responsibilities can help agencies  clarify which agencies will lead or participate in activities, help organize  their joint and individual efforts, and facilitate decision making.", "Agencies could enhance collaboration by developing joint guidance to  implement and coordinate actions on several Action Plan tasks. Joint  guidance helps ensure that agencies involved in collaborative efforts work  together efficiently and effectively by establishing policies, procedures,  information-sharing mechanisms, and other means to operate across  agency boundaries.

For example, State, which has the  authority and capability to work with international partners in establishing  the Contact Group, has made substantial progress toward implementing  that task. Furthermore, the Action Plan calls for commercial vessels to  review and update their ship security plans in order to prevent and deter  pirate attacks. Officials explained that because the Coast Guard has  responsibility for enforcing U.S.-regulated commercial-vessel compliance  with maritime security requirements, the agency took the lead on  implementing this task and has made substantial progress. Similarly,  Defense has primary responsibility for providing a persistent interdiction- capable presence in the region and has made substantial progress as lead  on that task.", "In contrast, there are several tasks in the Action Plan for which multiple  agencies have relevant authorities, capabilities, or interests, and on which  less progress has been made. The NSC did not identify roles and  responsibilities for implementing these tasks and officials have  acknowledged that the agencies have not developed joint guidance to  ensure their efforts work together efficiently and effectively. For example,  the NSC included efforts related to developing a strategic communications  strategy, disrupting pirate revenue, and holding pirates accountable as  essential to implementing the Action Plan.", "Strategic communication: The Action Plan calls for the United States  to lead and support a global public information and diplomatic  campaign to highlight, among other things, the international  cooperation undertaken to repress piracy off the Horn of Africa, as  well as piracy\u2019s destructive effects on trade, human and maritime  security, and the rule of law. In addition, according to the Action Plan,  any strategic communication strategy must also convey concerns  about the risks associated with paying ransoms demands. Multiple  agencies are involved in communicating with various audiences about  piracy. State communicates with international partners about  international cooperation; Defense communicates with military  partners about international military cooperation and with African  audiences to discourage piracy; the Naval Criminal Investigative  Service communicates with U.S. and international law enforcement  partners about law enforcement, investigative, and analytical  cooperation; and the Coast Guard and the Maritime Administration  communicate with the shipping industry about self-protection  measures and ransom concerns. However, there is no governmentwide  strategic communication plan in place to guide agency efforts,  optimize effects, and enhance the achievement of goals. According to  State officials, State has drafted a governmentwide counterpiracy  strategic communication plan for interagency review but as of July  2010, the department was still awaiting comments from interagency  partners and did not have an estimated date for when the plan would  be finalized, though Treasury officials had provided comments.  Meanwhile agencies have taken varying approaches to strategic  communication. Defense has developed a classified plan for its  activities, and according to Coast Guard officials, the Coast Guard  suspended its effort to develop a plan upon learning that State was  drafting a governmentwide plan. As a result, U.S. agencies have not  implemented all the strategic communication efforts called for by the  Action Plan, and it is not clear that the agencies\u2019 efforts are  coordinated or as effective as possible in communicating the intended  messages about piracy.", "Disrupting pirate revenue: According to the Action Plan, the goal for  disrupting pirate revenue is to trace ransom payments and apprehend  leaders of pirate organizations and their enablers. Multiple agencies  are involved in collecting information on pirate finances. Justice  collects information on financial assets entering the United States  related to piracy. According to officials, Treasury examines financial  activities and reviews intelligence, law enforcement, and publicly  available information, to map illicit financial networks and to  determine appropriate action, including potential designation of an  individual or entity pursuant to the April 2010 executive order on  Somalia. State officials described their work with international  partners to gather information on illicit financial networks, while  Defense officials told us they collect intelligence on pirate financial  activities by questioning captured pirate suspects. However, the NSC  did not clearly identify any agency with specific responsibility for  disrupting pirate revenue. As a result, officials at Justice, State, and  Defense agree that information their agencies gather on pirate finances  is not being systematically analyzed, and it is unclear if any agency is  using it to identify and apprehend pirate leaders or financiers. In  addition, though Justice, State, and Defense officials reported that  Somali piracy exhibits characteristics of international organized crime,  currently pirate attacks prosecuted by the United States are not  investigated by the FBI\u2019s Organized Crime Section but instead by the  Violent Crimes Section. In the absence of clearly identified roles and  responsibilities, and with competing priorities, officials indicated  agencies have not taken initiative to develop joint guidance to ensure  these disparate efforts work together efficiently and effectively.  Similarly, officials acknowledged there is no supporting plan or joint  guidance to direct U.S. interagency efforts to collect and analyze  criminal intelligence on pirates. However, State is in the process of  creating a Counter-piracy Finance Working Group intended to  facilitate closer interagency coordination of efforts to combat the  financial flows and support networks of piracy off Somalia. According  to Justice officials, as of July 2010, the United States has not  apprehended or prosecuted the leaders of any pirate organizations or  their enablers as called for in the Action Plan.", "Facilitating prosecution of suspected pirates: The Action Plan  contains several tasks related to facilitating the prosecution of  suspected pirates by parties with an interest in prosecution, but it does  not identify clear roles and responsibilities for U.S. agencies needed to  ensure implementation of these tasks. In some cases, U.S. officials said  roles are apparent where an agency\u2019s mission aligns with the Action  Plan\u2019s tasks, such as State\u2019s diplomatic work with regional partners to  conclude prosecution arrangements. However, a lack of defined roles  and joint guidance to implement U.S. efforts to facilitate prosecutions  poses challenges for prosecuting suspected pirates when each  agency\u2019s role is less clear. For example, absent defined roles and  responsibilities and interagency guidance, U.S. officials explained that  they had to dedicate time during a high-level interagency meeting of  the Maritime Security Interagency Policy Committee to arrange details,  including cost sharing, for the transportation of suspects after the  spring 2010 pirate attacks on the USS Ashland and USS Nicholas. State  officials told us that prior to these attacks the U.S. government had  limited experience being involved with the prosecution of Somali  pirates and had not established the necessary interagency procedures  for transferring suspects and sharing costs among the agencies  involved.", "By enhancing interagency collaboration, the NSC can reduce the risk of  leaving gaps in its counterpiracy efforts or the risk that agency efforts may  overlap, which could waste resources that could be applied to combat  other threats to national security, such as terrorism. Clarifying roles and  responsibilities and developing joint implementing guidance could also  help agency officials\u2014who must balance their time and resources among  many competing priorities\u2014more fully and effectively carry out their roles  in helping to repress piracy and avoid duplication of effort."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that the President identified piracy as a threat to U.S. national  security interests and that it is a complex problem that affects a variety of  stakeholders, the U.S. government has taken a collaborative approach in  its counterpiracy plans. The U.S. government has taken many steps to  implement the Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa: Partnership  and Action Plan (Action Plan), but still faces a number of challenges to  meeting the Action Plan\u2019s objective of repressing piracy, including  inherent limits on its ability to influence industry and international  partners and persuade other states to consider prosecuting suspected  pirates. In addition, the United States must address the problem of piracy  in an environment in which counterpiracy efforts compete with other high- priority U.S. interests in the region, and the NSC acknowledges that  longer-term efforts to stabilize Somalia are needed to fully address the  root causes of piracy. In the face of such challenges, the NSC\u2019s Action  Plan provides a roadmap for federal departments and agencies to follow in  implementing efforts to counter piracy. However, the U.S. government is  not tracking the costs, benefits, or effectiveness of its counterpiracy  activities and thus lacks information needed to weigh resource  investments. In addition, without a systematic evaluation of interagency  efforts to compare the relative effectiveness of various Action Plan tasks,  key stakeholders lack a clear picture of what effect, if any, its efforts have  had. Establishing performance measures or other mechanisms to judge  progress and evaluating performance information could provide U.S.  government stakeholders with more specific information to update the  Action Plan and better direct the course of U.S. government plans and  activities to repress piracy. Without updating U.S. government plans and  efforts to reflect performance information and the dynamic nature of  piracy, the U.S. government is limited in its ability to ensure that efforts  and resources are being targeted toward the areas of greatest national  interest.", "Federal agencies have made great strides to collaborate with each other  and with international and shipping-industry partners, but could benefit  from greater specificity in the Action Plan about their roles and  responsibilities and development of joint implementing guidance,  especially with regard to those Action Plan tasks that require a variety of  stakeholders to implement. Without specific roles and responsibilities for  essential aspects of its Action Plan\u2014including developing a U.S.  government strategic communication plan, disrupting pirate revenue, or  facilitating prosecution of suspected pirates\u2014U.S. agencies have either  developed their own approaches to these tasks or developed no approach  at all.

We did not state that the  percent of suspects delivered for prosecution was an appropriate measure  of program success.

We met with and gathered information from officials  representing the various agencies tasked with implementing the Action  Plan and who participate on the committees within the NSC. We also  conducted work with international and industry partners involved in the  response to piracy off the Horn of Africa.", "To assess the extent to which the U.S. government has made progress in  countering piracy off the Horn of Africa and the challenges it faces, we  reviewed the Action Plan, the 2007 Policy for the Repression of Piracy  and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea, the 2005 National Strategy  for Maritime Security, relevant U.S. laws, United Nations Security  Council resolutions on piracy off the Horn of Africa, as well as our prior  work related to Somalia, maritime security, interagency collaboration, and  combating illicit financing. To assess the implementation status of the  actions called for in the Action Plan, we reviewed program documents,  analyzed data, and interviewed agency officials. Our assessments are  based on data from multiple sources, are qualitative in nature, and are  derived from consensus judgments. We assessed \u201csubstantial progress\u201d for  those tasks where all components specified by the Action Plan were  implemented; \u201csome progress\u201d for tasks where components were partially  implemented or agencies had taken steps toward implementation; and  \u201clittle or no progress\u201d where agencies had made minimal or no effort  toward implementing the components of the task. We provided a \u201cnot  applicable\u201d assessment for one task in the Action Plan that agency  officials and our analysis revealed to have been overtaken by events and  no longer relevant for U.S. counterpiracy efforts. We provided a summary  of our progress assessments to the agencies and incorporated their  comments as appropriate. We also reviewed our prior work related to  results-oriented government and evaluated the extent to which the  interagency Counter-Piracy Steering Group charged with coordinating,  implementing, and monitoring the actions in the NSC plan followed select  key practices for achieving results including monitoring and evaluating  efforts, using performance information to improve efforts and revise plans  as needed, and reporting on results. In addition, we met with international  and industry partners involved in developing best practices for protecting  ships from pirate attack, working with the international Contact Group,  and participating in naval patrols off the Horn of Africa to gain their  perspective on the challenges and progress in countering piracy, the  effectiveness of counterpiracy actions, implementation of best  management practices for protecting ships, and how conditions off the  Horn of Africa are evolving. To gain insight on trends in pirate activity  since the United States and coalition partners began counterpiracy  operations, we obtained and analyzed data on the incidents of piracy off  the Horn of Africa for the years 2007 through June 2010 from the  International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s International Maritime Bureau. The  International Maritime Bureau operates a Piracy Reporting Center that  collects data on pirate attacks worldwide. According to its officials, there  are some limitations with International Maritime Bureau data because they  rely on ship officials to provide the information, which can vary, and some  information is not provided due to sovereignty issues regarding  investigations. However, we reviewed internal controls and measures used  by the bureau to protect the reliability and accuracy of their data on pirate  attacks and attempted attacks and discussed the reliability of the bureau\u2019s  data with international, industry, and government subject-matter experts  involved in counterpiracy operations and determined that the bureau\u2019s  data were the best data available on pirate attacks and attempted attacks.  Therefore, we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of describing the context of piracy as a threat to seafarers and the  geographical scope of pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa. To identify the  results of interdiction efforts led and supported by the United States we  obtained and reviewed data from the Combined Maritime Forces for the  years 2008 to June 2010. There are some limitations with Combined  Maritime Forces\u2019 data because these data are compiled from military and  nonmilitary sources and reporting. Although efforts are made to correlate  and confirm the accuracy of these data, Combined Maritime Forces cannot  fully guarantee their accuracy. We discussed data-collection methods,  processes for data entry, and the steps taken to ensure reasonable  accuracy of the data with both the International Maritime Bureau and the  Combined Maritime Forces. We determined the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. To identify the amount of ransoms  being paid to Somali pirates we reviewed monthly ransom data from the  Office of Naval Intelligence for 2007 through 2009. Due to the classified  nature of the sources and methods used to develop this data, we did not  independently verify the reliability of this information.", "To identify the extent to which U.S. government agencies are collaborating  with each other and with international and industry partners, we  synthesized key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration on  complex national security issues from our prior work.

According to data from the U.S.-led Combined Maritime Forces, coalition  and other international partners destroyed or confiscated nearly 100 pirate  vessels and confiscated more than 380 weapons, including small arms and  rocket propelled grenades between August 2008 and June 2010. Coalition  forces also report that international partners confiscated approximately  140 items of pirate paraphernalia, including automatic weapons, grappling  hooks, ladders, and global positioning system devices in that same time  period.", "According to military officials, interdicting forces determine a vessel to be  potentially used for piracy upon sight, given the presence of certain gear  and weaponry and the absence of typical fishing gear. Military officials  also told us that, once piracy equipment is seized and destroyed, U.S.  forces follow international protocols and, in the event suspects are not  detained, release the vessel and those onboard with sufficient fuel and  provisions to reach shore. According to international military officials,  European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces also are  monitoring pirate bases on shore from warships, and then seizing and  destroying pirate skiffs and equipment as they leave bases. However,  military and international officials told us that the seizing of pirate  paraphernalia provides only a temporary obstacle to pirate operations.  U.S. efforts to deliver suspected pirates to states for prosecution are  hampered by a lack of states that are willing and able to prosecute. The  Action Plan states the U.S. government will deliver suspected pirates to  states that are willing and able to prosecute in those cases where pirate  vessels are seized or destroyed. As of June 2010, international forces had  encountered more than 1,100 suspected Somali pirates since August 2008  but had delivered only approximately 40 percent to states for prosecution.  According to a report issued by the Department of Defense in May 2010,  U.S. military forces have transferred 24 suspected pirates for prosecution  to Kenya, the only country with which the United States had an  arrangement to accept pirate transfers at the time. According to State and  Department of Justice (Justice) officials, Kenya is only willing to accept  cases with strong evidence, such as cases in which suspects are caught in  the act of committing piracy. According to Combined Maritime Forces  officials, when suspected pirates are interdicted at sea and are not  engaged in an act of piracy, but are in possession of pirate equipment,  interdicting forces typically will detain the suspected pirates, confiscate  their equipment, and then release the suspects. Additionally, officials  stated that because of evidence standards and the limited options for  prosecution, interdicting forces are left with little choice but to catch and  release the suspected pirates.", "As of June 2010, approximately 57 percent of the suspects that  international forces encountered were caught and released. Furthermore,  military officials told us there have been cases of suspects being  encountered multiple times at sea, so the practice of catching and  releasing suspects could allow multiple attempts at piracy. Although  Defense officials we spoke with had varied opinions on whether repeat  offenders were a credible issue, since biometric data\u2014such as  fingerprints\u2014are not systematically gathered to track such cases, U.S. and  international forces cannot determine whether they are finding repeat  offenders.", "Although, as noted in the Action Plan, piracy is a universal crime that any  state could potentially prosecute, most states, including the United States,  in practice will consider prosecuting suspected pirates in appropriate  cases when it is in their national interest to do so. However, according to  State officials, some countries lack sufficient domestic law to support  prosecution of suspected pirates. Others may have the domestic legal  frameworks, but lack the resources or political will to take action. State  officials also told us that logistical difficulties exist in prosecuting piracy  cases such as evidence collection and preservation at sea, bringing in  merchant mariners or naval personnel to provide testimony and difficulty  proving intent in cases where suspects were not caught in the act. Finally,  some countries that might otherwise provide a venue for prosecution may  also have concerns that acquitted suspects or convicted pirates who are  released after serving a prison sentence may seek asylum. Officials from  State told us the U.S. government has prosecuted cases against every  suspected pirate captured who attempted an attack on a U.S. vessel.  Currently, a total of 12 suspects from attacks on the MV Maersk Alabama  (April 2009), USS Nicholas (March 2010) and USS Ashland (April 2010) are  being tried in the United States. The U.S. government will approach other  affected states for prosecution in cases interdicted by U.S. forces where  there is no interest for the U.S. government to prosecute.

According to the  Action Plan, the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard forces operating in the region  provide persistent interdiction through presence, can conduct maritime  counterpiracy operations, and shall coordinate counterpiracy activities  with other forces to prevent, respond to, and disrupt pirate attacks. Since  the Combined Maritime Forces\u2019 counterpiracy task force was established  in January 2009, the U.S. Navy has provided patrol ships, aircraft,  surveillance assets, medical response units, as well as leadership for the  international naval coalition conducting counter piracy operations in the  Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. According to Defense officials, from June  2009 to June 2010, the U.S. Navy had an average of four to five ships  present daily in the Horn of Africa, with two or three of those ships having  embarked air assets. Defense officials told us as many as eight U.S. Navy  ships could be present on any given day, with Navy ships supporting  Combined Maritime Forces and North Atlantic Treaty Organization  counterpiracy operations, and other maritime coalition and U.S. national  efforts. For example, U.S. Marine Corps aviation units have provided  support to counterpiracy operations during transits of the area and,  according to agency officials, the Coast Guard has assigned deployable  specialized forces and a cutter to the combatant commander to support  counterpiracy operations. In addition, the Naval Criminal Investigative  Service also supports maritime counterpiracy operations by providing  special agents afloat to assist boarding teams and lead immediate  investigations into piracy incidents on the high seas.", "U.S., international, and industry officials credit the reduction in the rate of  successful pirate attacks from approximately 40 percent in 2008 to 22  percent in 2009, in part, to international patrols in the Gulf of Aden. The  U.S. military also initiated and contributes to tactical military coordination  and information sharing with international partners through Shared  Awareness and Deconfliction meetings that optimize patrol coverage of  the transit corridor in the Gulf of Aden and aid with coordination of  coalition and independently deployed counterpiracy forces. However,  coalition officials acknowledge U.S. and international forces face  challenges in interdicting pirate incidents as pirates have adapted their  tactics and expanded their area of activity to the much larger and harder- to-patrol Indian Ocean. Pirates have attacked several vessels more than  1,000 nautical miles from Somalia and now threaten an area of nearly 2  million square nautical miles. Analytic estimates from Defense officials  show that full coverage of the area affected by piracy would require more  than 1,000 ships equipped with helicopters\u2014a level of support Defense  officials say is beyond the means of the world\u2019s navies to provide. With  current resources, Combined Maritime Forces officials estimate 25 to 30  international ships conduct counterpiracy patrols in the Horn of Africa at  any given time. In addition, military officials noted it is hard to predict how  long countries will sustain counterpiracy investments, since countries  participate in Combined Maritime Forces patrols at will.

Shiprider arrangements  would allow foreign law enforcement officials to operate from U.S. naval  vessels and facilitate the prosecution of suspected pirates. For example,  shipriders from the country that would prosecute suspected pirates would  be able to arrest the suspects and collect evidence directly, thereby  facilitating the prosecution of the suspected pirates.", "According to officials at State, they determined, in discussion with Kenyan  officals, that a shiprider program would not facilitate prosecution of  suspected pirates in Kenya because Kenyan law requires suspects to be  presented before a magistrate within 24 hours of being taken into custody  by a Kenyan official, including a shiprider. This requirement would be  challenging to meet when suspected pirates are interdicted far out in the  Indian Ocean. A shiprider provision was therefore not included in the  prosecution arrangement facilitating transfer of suspects between the  United States and Kenya for prosecution. According to officials at State,  the Seychelles has a similar law and therefore a shiprider provision was  not included in its arrangement with the United States. While State and  Justice officials told us there are ongoing discussions regarding  arrangements with other countries, such as Mauritius and the Philippines,  the U.S. government faces challenges in finding willing partners for such  programs. Officials acknowledged that shiprider programs may not be as  beneficial for counterpiracy efforts as the authors of the Action Plan  intended.", "The U.S. government also has been involved in the International Maritime  Organization\u2019s effort to conclude a regional arrangement, called the  Djibouti Code of Conduct.
