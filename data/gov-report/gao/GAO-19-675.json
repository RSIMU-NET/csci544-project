Noting the importance of protecting critical infrastructure from such risks, in 2013 DHS updated its risk management guidance for enhancing infrastructure resilience\u2014which is the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb and recover from, or successfully adapt to adverse events.", "GAO was asked to review Coast Guard efforts to improve the resilience of its shore infrastructure. This report (1) describes Coast Guard actions to improve shore infrastructure resilience since 2005, and (2) examines the extent to which its processes to improve shore infrastructure resilience follow DHS's key steps for critical infrastructure risk management. GAO reviewed and analyzed Coast Guard guidance and data on assessed infrastructure and interviewed Coast Guard officials.

The Coast Guard has received more than $2 billion in supplemental appropriations since 2005 to improve resilience after severe storms (see figure). The Coast Guard has also developed new guidance requiring that repairs and new construction meet higher building standards to make it more resilient. Further, in 2015, the Coast Guard began an assessment of certain occupied buildings to identify their vulnerabilities to ten natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. As of 2018, this assessment covered approximately 16 percent of the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure. The Coast Guard aims to complete the assessment in 2025.", "Coast Guard processes to improve shore infrastructure resilience do not fully align with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) key steps for critical infrastructure risk management. These steps are described in DHS's Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework, which recommends that DHS components, among other things, identify critical infrastructure, assess risks, and implement risk management activities. While the Coast Guard has identified some vulnerable shore infrastructure through its ongoing assessment, it has not identified all shore assets that may be vulnerable, such as piers and runways; or assessed operational risks affecting its ability to complete missions with these assets. In addition, the Coast Guard has not taken steps to develop mitigation strategies for buildings already identified as vulnerable. Moreover, Coast Guard data show a growing backlog of at least $2.6 billion in recapitalization, new construction, and deferred maintenance projects that compete for finite funding. However, Coast Guard officials were unable to verify that they have consistently selected projects to also enhance resilience. Coast Guard officials stated that they have not used the DHS framework and have instead focused on implementing their ongoing vulnerability assessment.

For example,  hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in 2005 caused significant damage to  Coast Guard facilities, and repairing this damage required an  appropriation of $266 million. More recent hurricanes, such as Harvey,  Irma, and Maria in 2017 have also severely damaged Coast Guard  facilities. Such events recently prompted Congress to direct the Coast  Guard to identify natural disaster risks and develop a plan to mitigate the  identified risks and improve the resiliency of stations. Further, the effects  of climate change may continue to damage infrastructure in the future and  result in increased costs to the Coast Guard. According to the U.S. Global  Change Research Program\u2019s Fourth National Climate Assessment, the  observed and projected effects of climate change include increases in the  incidence of extremely high temperatures, heavy precipitation events, and  high tide flooding events along the coastline. The assessment states that  such effects are already being felt in the United States and are projected  to intensify in the future.", "Over many years, we and others, such as the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies), have  reported on climate change issues. We have recommended enhancing  climate resilience as one strategy to help limit the federal government\u2019s  fiscal exposure to disasters related to climate change. While enhancing  climate resilience can create additional costs up front, it could also reduce  potential future costs resulting from climate-related events. For example,  in a 2018 report, we found that investments in disaster resilience reduced  the damage and costs of subsequent severe weather events such as  hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Similarly, the Congressional Budget  Office reported in April 2019 that the federal government could reduce the  damage caused by natural disasters by increasing the stringency of  building codes, by for example, requiring elevated buildings or placing  heating and cooling equipment on roofs in areas that are at risk of  flooding from extreme weather events.", "DHS also recognized the importance of protecting critical infrastructure  from these and other risks. In 2013, it updated its National Infrastructure  Protection Plan (NIPP) guidance for critical infrastructure owners and  operators to emphasize security and resilience as the primary aim of  homeland security planning efforts for critical infrastructure. As part of  the NIPP, DHS established a five step risk management framework for  assessing critical infrastructure (DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk  Management Framework) and recommended that owners and operators  of critical infrastructure, whether private or public, use the framework to  identify priorities, articulate clear goals, mitigate risk, measure progress,  and adapt based on feedback and the changing environment.", "You requested that we assess Coast Guard actions and processes to  improve the resilience of its shore infrastructure to better manage future  damage from extreme weather events.

For  example, the Coast Guard did not include structures in Phase I of the  Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment, such as aircraft runways,  and therefore has not determined whether such structures are vulnerable  to flooding following a severe storm, or which ones are at greatest risk for  such flooding. Phase II is also not expected to include these assets, as  Civil Engineering program officials stated it is not intended to identify any  additional infrastructure. Rather, in Phase II for example, Civil  Engineering program officials will determine whether roughly 45 percent  of the buildings on the West Coast that were screened in Phase I, are  vulnerable to earthquakes, as the results of Phase I were inconclusive for  these buildings.", "This DHS framework step recommends that stakeholders identify assets  and networks that contribute to critical functionality and analyze their  dependencies and interdependencies. The Coast Guard has two such  measures to help identify the criticality of its shore infrastructure for  conducting its missions. The Mission Essentiality Index measure  classifies shore infrastructure assets into one of four tiers based on the  degree to which they are mission critical. Similarly, the Mission  Dependency Index scores building criticality based on how quickly the  loss of utilities would impact operations, and how difficult it would be to  relocate operations in advance of a natural disaster. Coast Guard  officials told us they used Mission Dependency Index scores to help  identify which buildings to include first during Phase II of the Shore  Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment. However, they did not consider  either of these measures when they conducted the initial screening for  Phase I, which prevented operational risks from being fully considered.  Using this information at the beginning of its Shore Infrastructure  Vulnerability Assessment process could have provided the Coast Guard  with useful information to help it assess its critical infrastructure, as the  DHS framework recommends.", "Coast Guard officials stated in July 2019 that they believe that the  mission critical assets collocated with the assessed buildings would have  the same vulnerabilities given their geographic proximity. While this may  be the case for structures that are collocated with assessed buildings,  unoccupied structures (such as piers and runways) may be built with  different requirements and building codes; consequently, they may differ  in the extent of their vulnerabilities to the same natural hazard threats.  Furthermore, the Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment Phase I  report did not demonstrate the extent to which Coast Guard structure are  collocated with the occupied buildings the Coast Guard analyzed. They  also told us that the Coast Guard has not tracked the performance of its  infrastructure, particularly piers and runways, because it has always been  able to find alternative means to continue operations. However, by  identifying all of its mission critical infrastructure that may be vulnerable to  natural disasters, the Coast Guard would be more fully informed of the  possible scenarios that could affect their capabilities in the event of a  natural disaster, and which infrastructure facilities are most likely to be  affected. Such information could also better position the Coast Guard to  plan for and execute mission operations from alternative locations if  needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assess and Analyze Risks", "paragraphs": ["According to the third step of the DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk  Management Framework, organizations should assess and analyze risks  to understand infrastructure vulnerabilities and threats, as well as the  potential consequences of an incident or known vulnerabilities (see text  box).", "DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework\u2014Step 3  Organizations should assess and analyze risks, taking into consideration  the potential direct and indirect consequences of an incident, known  vulnerabilities to various potential threats or hazards, and general or  specific threat information.

This step supports an  assessment strategy that results in sound, scenario-based consequence  and vulnerability estimates, as well as an assessment of the likelihood  that the given threat or hazard will occur. Organizations should consider  potential harm to operations and impacts on mission in executing a  critical infrastructure risk management approach.", "The Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment process is the Coast  Guard\u2019s main action to formally assess and analyze its shore  infrastructure, according to Civil Engineering program officials. This  process was intended to help contingency planners anticipate which  infrastructure is likely to remain operational following a natural disaster,  and assist with operational and future capital investment decisions,  according to a senior Coast Guard official. We found that through this  process, the Coast Guard assessed and analyzed certain elements of risk  for its shore infrastructure, such as potential vulnerabilities of certain  infrastructure to multiple natural disasters\u2014information which could help  inform its processes to improve resilience. However, the Coast Guard has  not identified the potential direct and indirect consequences posed by  natural disasters on its infrastructure, or the consequences associated  with its operational risks\u2014that is, risks affecting its ability to carry out its  missions if shore infrastructure is damaged. Specifically:", "Through Phase I of the Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment  process, the Coast Guard determined that its personnel and  operations are generally more vulnerable to certain threats. For  example, Phase I determined that about 880 assessed buildings may  be vulnerable to earthquakes, which according to the Coast Guard,  represent approximately 45 percent of its assessed buildings on the  West Coast. Similarly, it also identified about 800 buildings that may  be vulnerable to tornadoes and approximately 1,000 buildings  vulnerable to hurricanes. However, the Coast Guard has not analyzed  the potential consequences of damage to the infrastructure that it  identified as vulnerable. For example, it has not assessed the  economic losses associated with potential catastrophic disasters,  such as costs for rebuilding assets or taking other actions to respond  to and recover from natural disasters. Additionally, the Coast Guard  has not assessed long-term costs that could result from environmental  damage to its property caused by these events. Without also  determining consequence information, the Coast Guard is not  positioned to provide decision makers with the type of information the  DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework  recommends for making cost effective risk management decisions.", "As the Coast Guard begins to conduct Phase II, it is unclear whether it  will include information on potential consequences in its assessment.  The Coast Guard initiated Phase II in September 2018 and intends to  assess about 1,500 buildings for vulnerabilities to natural disasters by  2025. Coast Guard officials stated that Phase II would entail following  civil engineering standards for conducting the assessments. These  assessments are expected to entail on-site contractor assessments of  about 1,500 buildings. In 2018, the first year of Phase II, the Coast  Guard contracted for an assessment of 15 buildings, and Shore  Infrastructure Logistics Center officials said they expect this  assessment to be completed in 2021. According to Civil Engineering  program officials, the purpose of Phase II is to understand whether  1,500 buildings identified in Phase I as inconclusive are indeed  vulnerable to certain natural hazards. This information can help Coast  Guard officials better understand the likelihood that vulnerabilities  exist, but the plan for Phase II does not support an assessment  strategy that results in sound, scenario-based consequence and  vulnerability estimates, as well as an assessment of the likelihood that  the given threat or hazard will occur or the operational risks that may  be affected, as this step recommends."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implement Risk Management Activities", "paragraphs": ["According to the fourth step of the DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk  Management Framework, organizations should implement risk  management activities by evaluating risk reduction methods that consider  countermeasures that result in controlling, accepting, transferring, or  avoiding risks (see text box).", "DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Framework\u2014Step 4  Organizations should evaluate risk reduction methods by considering  countermeasures that result in controlling, accepting, transferring, or  avoiding risks. Approaches can include prevention, protection,  mitigation, response, and recovery activities.

However, the  Coast Guard has not taken action to mitigate risks for those buildings with  confirmed vulnerabilities. Our analysis of Phase I results showed that of  the 3,214 buildings the Coast Guard analyzed, 32 percent had two or  more identified vulnerabilities and an average Mission Dependency Index  of 34, and 10 percent had three or more identified vulnerabilities with an  average Mission Dependency Index of 38. The average Mission  Dependency Index score for all 3,214 buildings was 30. These results  indicate that the Coast Guard has data on buildings that may be more  vulnerable than others and have relatively greater mission value. Despite  the availability of this information, the Coast Guard has not taken steps to  develop a mitigation strategy for these buildings, as the DHS Critical  Infrastructure Risk Management Framework recommends. Coast Guard  officials stated that they had sufficient information from Phase I about how  their facilities would perform against eight of the ten disasters, so they  elected to further study those buildings with inconclusive results on  earthquakes and wind.", "According to the DHS Critical Infrastructure Risk Management  Framework, risk assessments are to inform the selection and  implementation of mitigation activities and the establishment of risk  management priorities for organizations. Effective risk management  activities are comprehensive, coordinated, and cost-effective. The  framework further states that risk management decisions should be made  based on an analysis of the costs and other impacts, as well as the  projected benefits of identified courses of action\u2014including the no-action  alternative if a risk is considered to be effectively managed already.", "However, it is unclear whether and to what extent the civil engineering  staff and other decision makers consider the Shore Infrastructure  Vulnerability Assessment results as part of the planning board processes  where decisions are made about which infrastructure projects will be  prioritized for funding. Civil Engineering program officials told us that  hazard mitigation strategies will be employed for buildings determined to  be vulnerable, as the Coast Guard plans and executes major construction  and recapitalization projects through its existing planning board  processes. They also provided us with updated planning board guidance,  issued in March 2019, which directs Coast Guard officials to consider  improving shore infrastructure resilience as a significant factor in the  decision-making process. They also noted that the Coast Guard\u2019s  updated policy described earlier requires compliance with higher building  standards, which helps ensure that newly constructed facilities will be  more resilient than the ones they replace.", "Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center officials, however, were unable to  provide us with documentation showing whether and to what extent risk  reduction methods were considered during past planning board  processes. Furthermore, since they are not required to incorporate Shore  Infrastructure Vulnerability Assessment results into future planning board  decisions, it is unclear whether future Coast Guard planning boards will  be focused on addressing the most critical risks, or will consider resilience  as a factor when choosing projects to fund.

For example, the Coast Guard established metrics to count the number  and dollar value of certain projects to improve resilience, such as seismic  improvement or floodplain adaptation projects, that the Civil Engineering  program plans and accomplishes each year. While these measures can  be useful to account for actions taken and funds invested in these  particular actions, they do not indicate whether the resilience of Coast  Guard shore infrastructure has improved or is improving as a result of the  actions being measured.", "Coast Guard officials told us that they have not used the DHS Critical  Infrastructure Risk Management Framework to guide actions to improve  the resilience of its critical infrastructure because they have instead  focused on implementing the Shore Infrastructure Vulnerability  Assessment to provide them information they intend to use to influence  resource investment decisions in the future.
