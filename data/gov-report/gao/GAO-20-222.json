These practices could help  OCWR better manage expectations and prioritize high-risk work. Further,  establishing results-oriented performance goals and measures and  collecting and using performance information could help OCWR evaluate  and better focus its education and outreach efforts, as well as assess  progress toward its strategic goals.", "Finally, OCWR should use its strategic planning process to clearly  articulate how its IT initiatives support its organizational goals, such as  how the electronic claims reporting system supports a more efficient and  effective ADR program. Establishing performance measures and  monitoring actual-versus-expected performance of those measures can  help determine whether IT is making a difference in improving  performance, and in turn whether OCWR is better serving the legislative  community. Additionally, OCWR needs to evaluate its human capital  management strategies to ensure that it can recruit and retain staff with  the appropriate skills to plan and manage IT projects, as part of a larger  effort to conduct IT planning."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following six recommendations to OCWR:  The Executive Director of OCWR, in collaboration with relevant  managers, should establish a policy that requires a schedule of tasks to  be developed, documented, and updated throughout the lifetime of IT  system projects.

To  meet this objective, we reviewed applicable laws and identified the new  requirements. We reviewed the Reform Act and grouped Reform Act  requirements into seven categories of activities based on similar  characteristics, such as requirements related to amending the claims  process, and how these requirements aligned with OCWR\u2019s task teams  working on these requirements. We also collected and reviewed  documentation on OCWR\u2019s implementation process and management  practices, such as OCWR\u2019s list of tasks and task teams, task team  meeting notes, progress reports, agreements with outside vendors, and  email communications.", "Our second objective was to assess how OCWR is incorporating key  management practices to implement the Reform Act\u2019s new requirements.  To meet this objective, we analyzed OCWR\u2019s implementation of new  requirements against key practices for organizational change  management we identified in our 2003 report, Results-Oriented Cultures:  Implementation Steps to Assist Mergers and Organizational  Transformations (GAO-03-669) and key practices for project  management from the Project Management Institute Inc.\u2019s A Guide to the  Project Management Body of Knowledge, PMBOK Guide\u00ae. We  determined which key practices and related implementation steps were  applicable to OCWR based on the following factors: (1) if the practices  aligned with the scope and nature of OCWR\u2019s work, and (2) if the  practices applied to OCWR\u2019s implementation timeline given Reform Act  deadlines. We shared these key management practices with OCWR.", "Our third objective was to determine the extent to which OCWR  implemented recommendations from our 2004 report, Office of  Compliance: Status of Management Control Efforts to Improve  Effectiveness (GAO-04-400). To meet this objective, we reviewed  OCWR\u2019s plans and documentation of its activities, such as strategic plans  and annual reports, to address the recommendations. We then assessed  OCWR\u2019s plans and activities against our original recommendations and  the recommendations\u2019 implementation status to determine the extent to  which OCWR implemented the recommendations in the past and has  continued to take similar actions.", "For all three objectives, we interviewed OCWR officials and conducted  semi-structured interviews with a nonprobability sample of key  stakeholders and officials from offices covered by the Reform Act.  Although results from these interviews are not generalizable to all  stakeholders or offices covered by the act, they provided views and  illustrative examples about OCWR\u2019s efforts to address new Reform Act  requirements, OCWR\u2019s efforts to incorporate key management practices  to implement those new requirements, and the extent to which OCWR  implemented some of our previous recommendations. These  stakeholders and offices include the Architect of the Capitol, Senate Chief  Counsel for Employment, and Office of House Employment Counsel. To  obtain perspectives from a range of stakeholders and offices, we  considered the following factors in our selection:  size of the office or agency by number of employees; extent to which offices/agencies are involved in outreach by number  of Administrative Dispute Resolution cases and Occupational Health  and Safety Inspections/Americans with Disabilities Act inspections; past interviews with offices/agencies discussing OCWR outreach for balance of perspective (e.g., both chambers of Congress).", "We also interviewed the House Office of Employee Advocacy and the  House Office of the Chief Administrative Officer safety team to obtain  additional views on their interactions with OCWR.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2019 to December  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
