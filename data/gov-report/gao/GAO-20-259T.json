In light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse. However, GAO found oversight gaps that may limit the agency's ability to do so. Specifically, GAO found:", "(1) Information on abuse and perpetrator types is not readily available. CMS's data do not allow for the type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency. Specifically, CMS does not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type and, when this information is recorded, it cannot be easily analyzed by CMS. GAO made a recommendation that CMS require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation.", "(2) Facility-reported incidents lack key information. Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of abuse and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents, CMS has not provided guidance to nursing homes on what information they should include in facility-reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for state survey agencies and delays in their investigations. GAO made a recommendation that CMS develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report and HHS concurred.

Specifically, this statement discusses GAO\u2019s recent  report on the abuse of nursing home residents and the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) oversight. Nationwide, about 1.4  million elderly or disabled individuals receive care in more than 15,500  nursing homes. These nursing home residents often have physical or  cognitive limitations that can leave them particularly vulnerable to abuse.  Abuse of nursing home residents can occur in many forms\u2014including  physical, mental, verbal, and sexual\u2014and can be committed by staff,  residents, or others in the nursing home. Any incident of abuse is a  serious occurrence and can result in potentially devastating  consequences for residents, including lasting mental anguish, serious  injury, or death. News stories in recent years have noted disturbing  examples of nursing home residents who have been sexually assaulted  and physically abused. However, little is known about the full scope of  nursing home abuse, as incidents of abuse may be underreported.", "Federal law mandates that nursing homes receiving Medicare or  Medicaid payments ensure that residents are free from abuse. To help  ensure this, CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS), defines the quality standards that nursing homes must  meet in order to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. To  monitor compliance with these standards, CMS enters into agreements  with agencies in each state government\u2014known as state survey  agencies\u2014and oversees the work the state survey agencies do. This  work includes conducting required, comprehensive, on-site standard  surveys of every nursing home approximately once each year and  investigating both complaints from the public and incidents self-reported  by the nursing home (referred to as facility-reported incidents) regarding  resident care or safety. If a surveyor determines that a nursing home  violated a federal standard during a survey or investigation, then the  home receives a deficiency citation, also known as a deficiency. In  addition to state survey agencies, there are other state and local agencies  that may be involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes, including  Adult Protective Services, local law enforcement, and Medicaid Fraud  Control Units (MFCU) in each state, which are tasked with investigating  and prosecuting a variety of health care-related crimes.", "We have previously reported on problems in nursing home quality,  including challenges protecting residents from abuse and weaknesses in  CMS\u2019s oversight. For example, in multiple reports dating back to 1998, we  have identified weaknesses in federal and state activities designed to  correct quality problems in nursing homes. Specifically, in a 2002 report,  we found that CMS needed to do more to protect nursing home residents  from abuse, and we made five recommendations to help CMS facilitate  the reporting, investigation, and prevention of abuse in nursing homes.  More recently, in April 2019 we reported that CMS had failed to address  gaps in federal oversight of nursing home abuse investigations in  Oregon\u2014an issue that we uncovered during the course of our broader  work on nursing home resident abuse. Further, reports by the HHS  Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have also reviewed incidents of  resident abuse and raised concerns about CMS\u2019s procedures.", "This statement highlights key findings and recommendations from our  June 2019 report, which examined:  1.  the trends and types of abuse occurring in nursing homes in recent  2.  the risk factors for abuse and challenges facing stakeholder agencies  involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes, and  3.  CMS\u2019s oversight intended to ensure that nursing home residents are  free from abuse.", "In this statement, we include information on the status, as of November  2019, of HHS\u2019s efforts to implement the recommendations in our June  2019 report. In appendix I, we also include a summary of findings and  recommendations from prior GAO reports that examined the health and  welfare of the elderly in multiple settings, such as abuse in nursing  homes, assisted living facilities, and in the community. A list of related  GAO reports from our larger body of work examining federal oversight of  the quality of care and the safety of older adults receiving care in these  settings is included at the end of this statement.", "To conduct the work for our June 2019 report, we reviewed federal laws  and CMS guidance, analyzed CMS data, and interviewed stakeholders  from selected states. First, we reviewed federal laws and CMS guidance  to determine the federal standards and associated deficiency codes  related to resident abuse. Second, we analyzed data provided by CMS to  identify the number and severity of abuse deficiencies cited by surveyors  in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., between 2013 and 2017. Because  abuse and perpetrator type are not readily identifiable in CMS\u2019s data, we  identified this information by reviewing a randomly selected  representative sample of 400 CMS abuse deficiency narratives written by  state surveyors from 2016 through 2017 that describe the substantiated  abuse. Finally, we interviewed CMS officials and officials from a non- generalizable sample of survey agencies from five states\u2014Delaware,  Georgia, Ohio, Oregon, and Virginia. We also interviewed other  stakeholders in these states, including officials from each state\u2019s long- term care ombudsmen, law enforcement, MFCUs, and, when appropriate,  Adult Protective Services. We also visited nursing homes and spoke to  administrators and clinical staff in each of these states. We assessed  CMS\u2019s oversight activities in the context of the federal standards for  internal control. (Further details on our scope and methodology are  included in our report). To determine the status of the recommendations  we made in our June 2019 report, we obtained information from CMS  officials in November 2019.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Specifically, abuse deficiencies comprised less than 1 percent of the total  deficiencies in each of the years we examined, which is likely  conservative. Abuse in nursing homes is often underreported by  residents, family, staff, and the state survey agency, according to CMS  officials and stakeholders we interviewed. However, abuse deficiencies  more than doubled\u2014from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017\u2014over the 5-year  period. (See appendix II.) In addition, abuse deficiencies cited in 2017  were more likely to be categorized at the highest levels of severity\u2014 deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in  immediate jeopardy\u2014than they were in 2013. In light of the increased  number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have  strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse;  however, we found oversight gaps that may limit the agency\u2019s ability to do  so. Specifically, we found that CMS: (1) cannot readily access data on the  type of abuse or type of perpetrator, (2) has not provided guidance on  what information nursing homes should include in facility-reported  incidents, and (3) has numerous gaps in its referral process that can  result in delayed and missed referrals to law enforcement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information on Abuse and Perpetrator Types Is Not Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["In our June 2019 report, we found that CMS\u2019s data do not allow for the  type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency.  Specifically, CMS does not require the state survey agencies to record  abuse and perpetrator type and, when this information is recorded, it  cannot be easily analyzed by CMS. Therefore, we reviewed a  representative sample of 400 CMS narrative descriptions\u2014written by  state surveyors\u2014associated with abuse deficiencies cited in 2016 and  2017 to identify the most common types of abuse and perpetrators. From  this review, we found that physical abuse (46 percent) and mental/verbal  abuse (44 percent) occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by  sexual abuse (18 percent). Furthermore, staff, which includes those  working in any part of the nursing home, were more often the perpetrators  (58 percent) of abuse in deficiency narratives, followed by resident  perpetrators (30 percent) and other types of perpetrators (2 percent).  (See appendix III for examples from our abuse deficiency narrative  review.)", "CMS officials told us they have not conducted a systematic review to  gather information on abuse and perpetrator type. Further, based on  professional experience, literature, and ad hoc analyses of deficiency  narrative descriptions, CMS officials told us they believe the majority of  abuse is committed by nursing home residents and that physical and  sexual abuse were the most common types. This understanding does  not align with our findings on the most common types of abuse and  perpetrators represented in CMS\u2019s data on deficiencies cited as abuse.  Without the systematic collection and monitoring of specific abuse and  perpetrator data, CMS lacks key information and, therefore, cannot take  actions\u2014such as tailoring prevention and investigation activities\u2014to  address the most prevalent types of abuse or perpetrators. To address  this, we recommended that CMS require state survey agencies to report  abuse and perpetrator type in CMS\u2019s databases for deficiency, complaint,  and facility-reported incident data and that CMS systematically assess  trends in these data. HHS concurred with our recommendation and stated  that it plans to implement changes in response.

Specifically, officials  from each of the five state survey agencies told us that the documentation  they receive from nursing homes for facility-reported incidents can lack  key information that affects their ability to triage incidents and determine  whether an investigation should occur and, if so, how soon. For example,  officials from two state survey agencies we interviewed said they  sometimes have to conduct significant follow-up with the nursing homes  to obtain the information they need to prioritize the incident for  investigation\u2014follow-up that delays and potentially negatively affects  investigations. Incomplete incident reports from nursing homes are  particularly problematic given that nearly half of abuse deficiencies cited  between 2013 and 2017 were identified through facility-reported  incidents, which is dramatically different than the approximately 5 percent  of all types of deficiencies that were identified in this manner. Therefore, facility-reported incidents play a unique and significant role in identifying  abuse deficiencies in nursing homes, making it critical that incident  reports provided by nursing homes include the information necessary for  state survey agencies to prioritize and investigate. To address this issue,  we recommended that CMS develop and disseminate guidance\u2014 including a standardized form\u2014to all state survey agencies on the  information nursing homes and covered individuals should include on  facility-reported incidents.

As of November 2019, HHS had not  implemented these recommendations.", "One of the gaps in CMS\u2019s process is related to referring abuse to law  enforcement in a timely manner. For example, law enforcement  investigations can be significantly delayed because CMS requires a state  survey agency to make referrals to law enforcement only after abuse is  substantiated\u2014a process that can often take weeks or months. Officials  from one law enforcement agency and two MFCUs we interviewed told us  the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence and  prosecute cases\u2014for example, bedding associated with potential sexual  abuse may have been washed, and a victim\u2019s wounds may have  healed. As such, we recommended that CMS require state survey  agencies to immediately refer to law enforcement any reasonable  suspicion of a crime against a resident. HHS concurred with our  recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in  response.
