This appropriation funds a diverse range of programs and activities that include salaries and benefits for most civilian DOD employees; depot maintenance activities; fuel purchases; flying hours; environmental restoration; base operations; consumable supplies; and health care for active duty service personnel, dependents of active duty personnel, and retirees and their dependents. Moreover, each service and DOD agency spends O&M funds.", "Under DOD\u2019s measurement of infrastructure, O&M funds approximately half of DOD\u2019s infrastructure costs that can be clearly identified in DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Because DOD wants to decrease infrastructure costs to help pay for modern weapon systems, it must look at this appropriation group for some of the intended savings. Infrastructure comprises activities that provide support services to mission programs and primarily operate from fixed locations.", "O&M funding is affected by civilian and military personnel levels. DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget includes funds for about 800,000 civilians and 1.5 million active duty and full-time National Guard and Reserve military personnel. Civilian personnel levels have a direct effect because the majority of civilian salaries and benefits are funded by O&M. Although O&M does not fund military pay and allowances, the appropriation group supports many readiness activities and quality-of-life programs that are affected by the number of military personnel.", "We examined trends in annual O&M funds and personnel levels and identified the activities funded by O&M appropriations using DOD\u2019s FYDP. The FYDP is an authoritative record of current and projected force structure, costs, and personnel levels that have been approved by the Secretary of Defense. The FYDP displays resources and personnel levels by programs and activities known as program elements. There are about 3,800 program elements in the FYDPs between fiscal years 1985 and 2001. We analyzed FYDP data from several different perspectives: aggregate O&M, federal budget account structure, DOD organization, DOD\u2019s Infrastructure Category and Defense Mission Category (DMC) analytical frameworks, and DOD\u2019s major defense program structure.

Further, in annual authorization and appropriation acts, Congress can impose direction to carry out particular activities or programs and can limit or prohibit spending for other activities.

Between fiscal years 1985 and 1990, the Army\u2019s portion of funding increased by 4 percent, while Army military personnel levels fell by almost 3 percent and Army civilian personnel levels fell by about 9 percent. The Army received an additional increase of 5 percent in its share of annual O&M funds between fiscal years 1990 and 1991, but this surge in fiscal  year 1991 funding was due to an infusion of O&M money for the Army for the Persian Gulf War.", "After fiscal year 1991, DOD centralized funding for health programs into a Defense-wide O&M appropriation by shifting the funds for the program from the services\u2019 O&M appropriations.

Base operations and management headquarters activities have received and are planned to continue to receive the largest portion of annual O&M funds for this mission category, although its portion of the training mission\u2019s O&M funds has declined.", "Figure II.23 shows that military personnel training (mostly general skills training and support of the training establishment) has declined as the active force declined, and funding for this activity is planned to remain fairly constant from fiscal year 1996 to 2001 when military personnel levels are projected to stabilize. O&M funding for flight training activities (mostly undergraduate pilot training), though, has not changed much over the 17 years covered by this report.", "Figure II.23: Annual O&M Funding for Selected Training Mission Activities for Fiscal Years 1985-2001 (Constant 1997 dollars in billions)", "Since civilian and Guard and Reserve personnel training accounts for a very small portion of the total training mission, we focused our analysis of O&M funding for the mission by service on active military personnel training only. As displayed in figure II.24, the Army has received and plans to continue to receive more annual training mission O&M funds than either the Air Force or the Navy/Marine Corps, although the Army\u2019s share of annual O&M funds for this mission has decreased along with its force structure. The Army is projected to receive 35 percent fewer annual training O&M funds in fiscal year 2001 than it received in fiscal year 1985. This decline is due mostly to planned declines in military personnel training (general skills training) and training base operations and management headquarters. The only Army training area that received an infusion of O&M funds in the fiscal year 1985 to 1996 period was flight training, but after fiscal year 1996, funds for this training are projected to decline by almost 7 percent. For the projected period through fiscal  year 2001, only the military personnel training area is expected to receive an increase in O&M funds.", "Figure II.24: Annual O&M Funding by Service for Active Military Training Mission Activities for Fiscal Years 1985-2001 (Constant 1997 dollars in billions)", "Figure II.24 also shows that O&M training funds for the Navy/Marine Corps and the Air Force have declined between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 in concert with declines in their force structure, but similar to the Army, funding levels are expected to remain fairly stable in the out-years. Between fiscal years 1985 and 1996, the Navy/Marine Corps O&M training mission funds decreased by 24 percent and the Air Force\u2019s funding level decreased by 16 percent. After fiscal year 1996, O&M funding for the Navy/Marine Corps training base operations is projected to continue to decrease. However, O&M funding for Navy/Marine Corps military personnel, flight, and intelligence skill training is expected to grow. Flight training is the only area that is planned to receive an increase (12 percent) in O&M funds for the Air Force during the fiscal year 1996 through 2001 period.", "O&M funding for the training mission per full-time military and DOD civilians declined by 8 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1993, but after fiscal year 1993 grew annually through fiscal year 1996, as presented in  figure II.25. It is projected to remain stable after fiscal year 1996 until fiscal years 2000 and 2001 when funding per person will increase by approximately 2 percent per year.", "If base operations and management headquarters is removed from overall O&M funding of the training mission, the O&M funding per full-time military and DOD civilians remained fairly stable at about $1,200 per year through fiscal year 1993, when it began to increase annually. The level of O&M funding per person is projected to increase to over $1,400 by fiscal  year 2001.", "Figure II.25: Per Person Annual O&M Funding for Training Activities for Fiscal Years 1985-2001 (Constant 1997 dollars in thousands)", "Figure II.26 shows that the pattern of O&M funding per person for the training mission for each service\u2019s active military differs. The O&M funding level per person for active Air Force training grew the most (over 30 percent) between fiscal years 1985 and 1996 and peaked at $3,300 per person by fiscal year 1996. Our analysis of FYDP data shows that this level of funding per person is projected to be reached again in fiscal years 1998 and 2001. Although the O&M funding for training per active Army military person fell to its lowest level in fiscal year 1994, it increased annually during fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and will increase annually again in fiscal years 2000 and 2001, when it will peak at $4,500 per person. The Navy/Marine Corps O&M funding per person for active military training fell by 15 percent between fiscal years 1985 and 1993 but is projected to increase annually through fiscal year 1997, and fall slightly in fiscal  year 1998, when it will increase about 1 percent per year again until it reaches $2,600 per year in fiscal year 2000.", "Figure II.26: Per Person Annual O&M Funding by Service for Active Military Training Activities for Fiscal Years 1985-2001 (Constant 1997 dollars in thousands)", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
