The two reactors under construction were expected to yield another 200 kilograms of plutonium annually\u2014enough plutonium for about 50 atomic bombs per year. The reprocessing facility separates weapons-grade plutonium-239 from the reactor\u2019s spent fuel. The reactor facilities reportedly were not attached to a power grid, increasing concern that the facilities were intended to produce material for making nuclear weapons rather than for producing electricity.", "Under the Agreed Framework, North Korea made a commitment to, among other things, (1) remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\u2014a treaty aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons; (2) freeze the operation and construction of its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities, including the reprocessing plant, and eventually dismantle them; and (3) cooperate with the United States to safely store and dispose of the spent fuel in its possession. In return for these concessions, the United States agreed to, among other things, create an international consortium of member countries to (1) replace North Korea\u2019s graphite-moderated reactors with a light-water reactor project by a target date of 2003 and (2) supply North Korea with energy\u2014heavy oil for heating and electricity production\u2014pending the completion of the first light-water reactor. (App. I provides additional information about the contents of the agreement.)", "According to State and other administration sources, the agreement to replace North Korea\u2019s 5-MW(e) reactor and the two larger reactors under construction was needed because, unlike light-water reactors, the North Korean reactors and related nuclear facilities were particularly well suited to produce nuclear materials. In addition, if the two nuclear reactors had been completed, North Korea would have vastly increased the amount of nuclear material in its possession. Finally, North Korea was believed to be doubling its plutonium separation capacity.

In connection with the language used in the Agreed Framework, State maintains that the most important indicator of the parties\u2019 intent is the absence of the word \u201cagreed\u201d and the use, instead, of the word \u201cdecided\u201d in the agreement\u2019s preamble.", "In our view, the language of the Agreed Framework is not entirely clear about the intent of the United States and North Korea to establish a nonbinding political agreement.

The agreement consists of four general pledges, all of which are consistent with the kind of broad declaration of goals and principles that characterize nonbinding international agreements. Furthermore, the agreement omits provisions\u2014such as provisions on the process for amending the agreement and for resolving disputes\u2014that would normally be included in a binding agreement.", "The subsequent actions by the United States and North Korea also suggest that the Agreed Framework was intended to be a nonbinding, preliminary arrangement.

Thus, once North Korea assumes control over the reactors, North Korea and the operator of the reactors would likely become the primary targets of claims for nuclear damage incurred outside of the country. Nevertheless, lawsuits could also be brought against KEDO and its members. To address this possibility, the supply agreement requires North Korea to (1) enter into an agreement for indemnifying KEDO and (2) secure nuclear liability insurance or other financial security to protect KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors from any claims by third parties resulting from a nuclear incident at the North Korean reactors. Also, as discussed earlier, the KEDO agreement contains a general limitation-of-liability provision that appears to cover nuclear damage liability for lawsuits brought outside of North Korea.", "The provision requiring indemnification and insurance protections is intended to provide KEDO with adequate protection against suits brought in courts outside of North Korea. Even so, as the provision is written, the indemnity and insurance protections extend only to KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors and not, specifically, to KEDO\u2019s members. Thus, it is not clear that these protections would cover possible awards by foreign courts against individual KEDO members, including the United States. Furthermore, the supply agreement does not address the extent of the indemnity and insurance protections that North Korea must provide, leaving questions about whether North Korea will be required to indemnify KEDO (1) for the entire amount of any damage awards obtained in foreign courts or for some fixed, lesser amount and (2) if North Korea\u2019s insurance and other financial security do not cover all claims.", "KEDO is aware of these issues and, as a result, plans to build upon the foundation of the existing coverage to fully shield KEDO and its members from possible nuclear liability claims by third parties. For example, in a future agreement\u2014termed a \u201cprotocol\u201d\u2014KEDO intends to ensure that the specific indemnity and insurance protections that it negotiates also extend to KEDO\u2019s members.

The act was intended to establish a procedure for regularly informing the Congress about the foreign affairs activities of the executive branch. The act specifically authorizes the Secretary of State to determine if a particular U.S. undertaking constitutes an international agreement.", "Neither the Case-Zablocki Act nor its legislative history provides concrete guidance about which international agreements must be submitted to the Congress. Not long after the act\u2019s passage, Senator Case requested the Department of State to clarify the types of agreements covered by the act. The State Department replied that the act \u201cis intended to include every international agreement other than a treaty brought into force with respect to the United States . . . regardless of its form, name or designation, or subject matter.\u201d", "In 1981, the State Department issued regulations describing, among other things, its criteria for assessing whether a U.S. undertaking constitutes an international agreement within the context of the act. According to State\u2019s regulations, an undertaking constitutes an international agreement if (1) the parties to the agreement intend the undertaking to be legally binding; (2) it involves a \u201csignificant\u201d arrangement or undertaking; (3) the language describing the undertaking is precise and specific; and (4) it necessitates the involvement of two or more other parties.", "State\u2019s regulations also provide for the consideration of the agreement\u2019s form\u2014specifically, the extent to which a U.S. agreement follows the structure, or form, customarily used in international agreements. A failure to use the customary form for international agreements constitutes evidence of the parties\u2019 intent not to be bound by the arrangement. However, an agreement\u2019s form may not be relevant if the agreement\u2019s content and context reveal that the parties actually intended to create a binding international agreement.", "Consistent with State\u2019s regulations, several authorities on international law have suggested that the intent of the countries involved is the critical factor in determining whether a particular arrangement establishes either a nonbinding political agreement or a legally binding international agreement. Because countries are generally reluctant to explicitly state in an international agreement that the agreement is nonbinding or that it lacks legal force, inferences about the parties\u2019 intent must be drawn from, among other things, (1) the language used in the agreement; (2) the subsequent actions or statements of the parties; and (3) the negotiating history, to the extent that an agreement is ambiguous. Agreements containing general goals or broad declarations of principles are usually considered too indefinite to create enforceable obligations.", "Department of State officials said that both the United States and North Korea intended the Agreed Framework to be a political arrangement that would not create binding legal obligations under international law. State officials said that the United States executed a nonbinding political agreement because it would not have been in the United States\u2019 interest to accept an internationally binding legal obligation to provide nuclear reactors and alternative energy to North Korea. Instead, they said that the United States wanted the flexibility to respond to North Korea\u2019s policies and actions in implementing the Agreed Framework\u2014flexibility that a binding international agreement, such as a treaty, would not have provided.", "According to State Department officials, the Department provided the text of the Agreed Framework to the Congress informally rather than under the Case-Zablocki Act because it considered the arrangement to be a nonbinding political agreement that did not meet all of the criteria established for notifying the Congress. Specifically, although the Agreed Framework (1) necessitates the involvement of two or more parties and (2) involves a significant undertaking, it does not satisfy State\u2019s three other criteria. According to State, its position that the agreement is nonbinding is supported by (1) the agreement\u2019s language and form, which are not typical of binding international agreements, and (2) the fact that neither side has since acted in a manner that is inconsistent with such an understanding.", "In connection with the language used in the Agreed Framework, State maintains that the most important indicator of the parties\u2019 intent, concerning the document\u2019s legal status, is the choice of the phrase introducing the document\u2019s operative clauses. Specifically, the parties used the phrase \u201cdecided to take the following actions\u201d instead of the word \u201cagreed.\u201d State says that its treaty experts carefully chose this language because the word \u201cdecided\u201d is routinely used in connection with nonbinding political agreements (e.g., the Nuclear Suppliers Group Guidelines, the Missile Technology Control Regime), whereas the word \u201cagreed\u201d is used before the operative clauses when the intent is to create a legally binding agreement. State also notes that the language of the operative clauses generally does not create specific commitments, but rather general objectives toward which the two sides are working. Such general language is typical of political agreements. According to State, the language of the Agreed Framework was specifically crafted on the basis of the precedents established in other nonbinding political accords, in a manner that leaves no ambiguity whatsoever as to the intent of the two sides to create a nonbinding political agreement.", "While we appreciate State\u2019s position, in our view, the language of the Agreed Framework is not entirely clear about the intent of the United States and North Korea to establish a nonbinding political agreement. Although several of the agreement\u2019s provisions contemplate the need for future agreements, others are expressed in more concrete and even directive language. For example, the Agreed Framework specifies that the United States, through a consortium, \u201cwill make arrangements to offset the energy foregone due to the freeze of the DPRK\u2019s  graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities, pending completion of the first LWR  unit.\u201d Furthermore, a subsection describing this responsibility states that \u201clternative energy will be provided in the form of heavy oil for heating and electricity production\u201d and that \u201celiveries of heavy oil will begin within three months of the date of  and will reach a rate of 500,000 tons annually, in accordance with an agreed schedule of deliveries.\u201d Finally, the agreement does not explicitly discuss the parties\u2019 intentions, and we are not aware of anything in the negotiating history of the agreement that clearly delineates the parties\u2019 intentions.", "Nevertheless, the Agreed Framework\u2019s tone and form, and particularly the subsequent actions of the United States and North Korea, suggest that the Agreed Framework was not intended to be a binding international agreement. The agreement consists of four general pledges, all of which are consistent with the kind of broad declaration of goals and principles that characterize nonbinding international agreements. Furthermore, as pointed out by the State Department, the agreement omits provisions that would normally be included in a binding agreement. The omitted provisions include a provision on the agreement\u2019s entry into force and the process for amending the agreement and for resolving disputes.", "The subsequent actions by the United States and North Korea also suggest that the Agreed Framework was intended to be a nonbinding, preliminary arrangement. In a joint press statement on June 13, 1995, at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the two countries reaffirmed their \u201cpolitical commitments to implement the . . . Agreed Framework.\u201d Although this appears to be a clear expression of the parties\u2019 intent, the statement alone may not be of major significance since it was made nearly 8 months after the agreement was signed and communicated informally. Of greater significance was the conclusion of two binding international agreements between (1) the United States, South Korea, and Japan establishing the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) and (2) KEDO and North Korea for supplying the reactors and alternative energy. Taken together, these binding international agreements\u2014described in concrete and specific terms\u2014effectively incorporate the Agreed Framework\u2019s provisions on providing the reactors and alternative energy to North Korea.", "In view of the above, we believe that the Agreed Framework can properly be described as a nonbinding political agreement. We are also mindful of the broad authority accorded the executive branch in the area of foreign affairs and believe that the State Department\u2019s determination that the Agreed Framework is a nonbinding political agreement is a proper exercise of that authority.

Indeed, for fiscal year 1996, the Congress established conditions on the provision of funds for KEDO that require the President to make certain determinations about the light-water reactor project and to certify the determinations in writing to the appropriations committees.The Congress can also enact resolutions or bills expressing its position on the Agreed Framework and, for areas within its authority, enact legislation that would supersede the provisions with which it disagrees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of the Agreed Framework Had It Been Structured as a Treaty or Other Binding International Agreement", "paragraphs": ["If the Agreed Framework had been structured as a treaty or some other form of binding international agreement, it would have been subjected to greater formal congressional oversight.

Nevertheless, our assessment of the liability provisions in the KEDO and supply agreements and KEDO\u2019s plan to secure additional protections, suggests that KEDO and its members\u2014including the United States\u2014will be adequately protected against nuclear damage claims from North Korea and third-party countries.

In the next few years, KEDO intends to help North Korea draft the required legislation and to monitor North Korea\u2019s efforts to establish the financial mechanism for paying possible nuclear damage claims.", "The supply agreement also contains a second provision that precludes North Korea from bringing any nuclear damage or loss claims against KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors. The scope of this provision is broad and, according to KEDO, covers claims for nuclear damage caused both before and after the reactors have been turned over to North Korea. Third, the supply agreement explicitly states that North Korea shall seek recovery solely from the property and assets of KEDO for any claims arising (1) under the supply agreement or (2) from any actions of KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors. Correspondingly, the KEDO agreement states that \u201co member shall be liable, by reason of its status or participation as a Member, for acts, omissions, or obligations of the Organization.\u201d", "Taken together, the described provisions appear to bar North Korea from making any nuclear claims against KEDO\u2019s member countries\u2014including the United States\u2014in North Korean courts. However, none of the existing provisions explicitly precludes claims by North Korean nationals or North Korean nongovernmental entities.

Unlike the Paris and Vienna Conventions\u2014the principal international conventions on third-party nuclear liability\u2014which include provisions limiting the jurisdiction for hearing claims to the courts in the country where the nuclear incident occurs, the supply agreement does not preclude claims from being brought in jurisdictions outside of North Korea.", "Although there does not appear to be any clear principle of international customary law governing the extent of a country\u2019s liability for nuclear damage, it is generally recognized that a country is liable for damage caused to the environment of another country. Thus, once North Korea assumes control over the reactors, North Korea and the operator of the reactors would likely become the primary targets of claims for nuclear damage incurred outside of the country. Nevertheless, lawsuits could also be brought against KEDO and its members. To help address this possibility, the supply agreement requires North Korea to (1) enter into an agreement for indemnifying KEDO and (2) secure nuclear liability insurance or other financial security to protect KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors from any third-party claims in any court or forum resulting from a nuclear incident from the North Korean reactors. Also, as discussed earlier, the KEDO agreement contains a general limitation-of-liability provision which specifies that KEDO members are not liable for the actions or obligations of KEDO. This provision also appears to cover nuclear damage liability for lawsuits brought outside of North Korea.", "The provision requiring indemnification and insurance is intended to provide KEDO with adequate protection against suits brought in courts outside of North Korea. Even so, as the provision is written, the indemnity and insurance protections extend only to KEDO and its contractors and subcontractors, not specifically, to KEDO\u2019s members. Thus, it is not clear that these protections would cover possible awards by foreign courts against individual KEDO members, including the United States. Furthermore, the supply agreement does not address the extent of the indemnity and insurance protections that must be obtained, leaving questions about whether North Korea will be required to indemnify KEDO (1) for the entire amount of any damage awards obtained in foreign courts or for some fixed, lesser amount and (2) if North Korea\u2019s insurance and other financial security do not cover all claims.", "In addition to the indemnity and insurance protections that the United States will have as a member of KEDO, even if a foreign court entertained a nuclear damage claim against the United States, the United States could assert the defense of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d as a bar to the court\u2019s hearing the claim. Moreover, consistent with choice of law principles, a foreign court could choose to apply North Korean law in nuclear damage claim actions. As discussed earlier, this would be the prospective channeling legislation that, with few exceptions, would make the North Korean operator absolutely liable for nuclear damages.", "The issue of whether KEDO\u2019s members could be found liable in foreign courts for KEDO\u2019s activities depends, in large part, on whether KEDO would be recognized as (1) a separate international entity with its own \u201clegal personality\u201d or (2) an entity of the United States, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), and Japan\u2014the three original KEDO members. If the former, presumably lawsuits would be directed exclusively against KEDO; but if the latter, lawsuits could be directed against individual KEDO members.", "According to the International Court of Justice, an international organization is viewed as having a separate legal personality or identity from its creators if the organization (1) is capable of possessing and asserting international rights and duties, (2) has its own organizational structure, and (3) cannot discharge its functions without a separate legal identity. In this connection, one authority on international law has written that when the legal personality of an international organization is questioned, some of the issues that must be addressed are whether the organization (1) was set up by countries for an independent activity related to the functioning of the international community; (2) has specific functions that are consistent with the realization of that purpose; and (3) is independent of the directions of the organization\u2019s member countries.", "Much of the contents of the KEDO agreement suggest that KEDO was intended to be an international organization with a separate and distinct legal personality. First, the agreement was concluded by the United States, Japan, and South Korea for the purpose of carrying out the light-water reactor project\u2014a project arguably of importance to the international community. Second, each of the original KEDO members has equal representation on KEDO\u2019s Executive Board\u2014the body authorized to carry out KEDO\u2019s functions\u2014and the agreement contemplates that additional countries may become members. Third, the agreement clearly anticipates the involvement of other countries and international entities to carry out the light-water reactor project. For example, the agreement authorizes KEDO to (1) receive funds from other countries; (2) coordinate with public entities\u2014including countries and national and international institutions; and (3) conclude agreements, contracts, and other arrangements with international organizations for the purpose of implementing the project. Finally, the agreement provides that the executive director\u2014KEDO\u2019s chief administrative officer and his staff\u2014shall (1) \u201cnot seek or receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the Organization\u201d and (2) \u201crefrain from any action that might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization;\u201d calls upon \u201cach Member . . . to respect the exclusively international character of the responsibilities of the Executive Director and the staff . . . .;\u201d and confers on KEDO functions that are characteristic of an entity with a separate legal personality. For example, the agreement states that KEDO \u201cshall possess legal capacity, and, in particular, the capacity to: (1) contract; (2) lease or rent real property; (3) acquire and dispose of personal property; and (4) institute legal proceedings.\u201d", "Taken together, the provisions in the KEDO agreement provide strong support that KEDO is an international organization with separate legal status. We reach this conclusion notwithstanding that certain aspects of the KEDO agreement suggest the contrary. First, unlike the work of many international organizations, KEDO\u2019s purpose is specific, intended to be relatively short-lived, and, as reflected in the Agreed Framework, substantially initiated by one party\u2014the United States. Moreover, although the supply agreement between KEDO and North Korea specifically recognizes KEDO as an international organization with an identity separate from its members, North Korea\u2014the principal beneficiary of the reactor project\u2014is the only other party to that agreement. Furthermore, while other countries can join KEDO, they cannot become members of KEDO\u2019s Executive Board. And, finally, the KEDO agreement does not state that (1) KEDO is intended to be an international organization with a separate legal personality or (2) the agreement is to be governed by international law.", "The argument that KEDO could be viewed as essentially a U.S. entity is also supported by KEDO\u2019s personnel structure. The KEDO agreement confers broad authority on KEDO\u2019s executive director to carry out KEDO\u2019s activities.The executive director is currently a United States citizen, and if a replacement is needed, the new executive director would likely be a United States citizen. Furthermore, U.S. citizens occupy almost half of the high-level positions in KEDO\u2019s organizational structure. The supply agreement also specifies that the architectural and engineering firm that KEDO will use to oversee the light-water reactor project will be a U.S. firm.", "On balance, we believe that the reasons for finding KEDO to be an international organization with separate and distinct legal status from its members outweigh the reasons to the contrary. As a result, we believe that foreign courts should uphold KEDO\u2019s status as an independent entity and, thus, not allow suits against individual KEDO members\u2014including the United States. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how foreign courts would decide\u2014a caveat that also applies to the general limitation-of-liability provision in the KEDO agreement. As discussed earlier, this provision precludes the liability of KEDO\u2019s members for the actions of KEDO. However, foreign courts in those countries that are not bound by the KEDO agreement could choose not to apply the protection for nuclear damage claims. This issue could be significant, for example, in suits brought in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Russia\u2014third-party countries that would appear to be the most likely to suffer damage from a nuclear incident in North Korea.", "KEDO recognizes that it must build upon the foundation of coverage already provided in the supply and KEDO agreements to fully shield itself and its members from possible third-party nuclear liability claims.

In addition, according to KEDO, the protocol will establish the level of indemnity protection to be provided\u2014an amount which, at a minimum, will be consistent with international norms.Finally, KEDO plans to negotiate additional liability, indemnification, and insurance protections in its future contracts with contractors and subcontractors. According to KEDO, \u201cnless and until KEDO and its members consider that all aspects of the risk management program are in place, KEDO will not ship any fuel assemblies to the DPRK  or allow commissioning of the LWR  plants\u2014without which there can be no possibility of nuclear liability for KEDO, or for its members.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "KEDO Also Plans to Address Other Sources of Potential Nuclear Liability", "paragraphs": ["At least two other sources of potential nuclear liability could affect the United States as a KEDO member. These include liability for nuclear damage occurring before the transfer of the reactors to North Korea and from nuclear waste disposal activities in North Korea.", "First, KEDO is responsible for overseeing the light-water reactor project prior to transferring the completed reactors to North Korea. KEDO\u2019s obligations include (1) ensuring that the design, manufacture, construction, testing, and commissioning of the light-water reactor plants are done safely and (2) testing the reactors before North Korea\u2019s takeover. KEDO recognizes that a nuclear incident could occur during the reactors\u2019 commissioning and testing period. However, it contends that the radiological effects of any discharges or omissions would be minimal, unlikely to give rise to substantial claims, and, in all likelihood, limited to North Korea.", "The supply agreement does not specifically deal with nuclear liabilities arising before the reactors are transferred to North Korea. However, as discussed earlier, the agreement prohibits North Korea from bringing any nuclear damage or loss claims against KEDO\u2014a prohibition that KEDO and State believe covers such liabilities. KEDO still wants to ensure that it is never the \u201coperator\u201d of the reactors since it lacks the technical capability to perform the testing and because it wants to avoid potential liabilities that could flow to the \u201coperator\u201d under the channeling legislation. Thus, KEDO plans to structure the arrangements for the reactors\u2019 testing so that North Korea, a North Korean entity, or a KEDO contractor is the operator during the testing period. While the respective views of these entities is not known, it seems unlikely that another party would assume the responsibility for testing the reactors without being compensated by KEDO.", "A second area of potential liability involves the disposal of nuclear waste. As specified in the Agreed Framework, North Korea is primarily responsible for the safe storage and disposal of radioactive wastes and spent fuel\u2014the by-product of the reactors. As a result, in the event of nuclear damage outside of North Korea, North Korea would likely be the primary target for damage claims. However, the agreement also requires KEDO to cooperate with North Korea to ensure the safe storage and disposition of the light-water reactors\u2019 spent fuel\u2014a role that could expose KEDO and its members to liability. According to KEDO, its authority under the supply agreement to require North Korea to relinquish ownership of the nuclear waste from the light-water reactors and to transport the fuel out of North Korea, as well as the future agreement between KEDO and North Korea on the safe disposal of the waste, will allow KEDO to structure the waste disposal arrangements to avoid any liability on the part of KEDO.
