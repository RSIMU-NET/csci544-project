One such tier, the specialty tier, is designed for high-cost drugs whose prices exceed a certain threshold set by CMS. Beneficiaries who use these drugs typically face higher out-of-pocket costs than beneficiaries who use only lower-cost drugs. GAO was asked to provide information about high-cost drugs eligible for a specialty tier. This report provides information on these drugs including spending under Medicare Part D in 2007, the most recent year for which claims data were available; how different cost-sharing structures could be expected to affect beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; how negotiated drug prices could be expected to affect beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; and information Part D plan sponsors reported on their ability to negotiate price concessions and to manage utilization. GAO examined CMS data, including 2007 claims data, negotiated price and out-of-pocket cost data for selected drugs--including the 10 highest-utilization specialty tier-eligible drugs in 2007--and plans from 2006 through 2009, and formulary information provided to CMS by plan sponsors.

Specialty tier-eligible drugs accounted for 10 percent, or $5.6 billion, of the $54.4 billion in total prescription drug spending under Medicare Part D plans in 2007. Medicare beneficiaries who received a low-income subsidy (LIS) accounted for most of the spending on specialty tier-eligible drugs--$4.0 billion, or 70 percent of the total. Among all beneficiaries who used at least one specialty tier-eligible drug in 2007, 55 percent reached the catastrophic coverage threshold, after which Medicare pays at least 80 percent of all drug costs. In contrast, only 8 percent of all Part D beneficiaries who did not use a specialty tier-eligible drug reached this threshold in 2007. Differences in plans' cost-sharing structures--flat copayments or coinsurance rates--can be expected to result in varying out-of-pocket costs for non-LIS beneficiaries only until they reach the catastrophic coverage threshold, which 31 percent of non-LIS beneficiaries did in 2007. After that point, non-LIS beneficiaries' annual out-of-pocket costs for a given drug are likely to be similar regardless of their plans' cost-sharing structures. LIS beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs are generally not affected by their plans' cost-sharing structures because Medicare sets fixed limits on the cost-sharing amounts for these beneficiaries and pays any difference between these fixed amounts and the amount required under the plans' cost-sharing structures. Variations in negotiated drug prices--between different drugs, across plans for the same drug, and over time--can affect out-of-pocket costs. For example, the average negotiated price for Gleevec across our sample of plans increased by 46 percent between 2006 and 2009, from about $31,200 per year to about $45,500 per year. Correspondingly, the average out-of-pocket cost for a non-LIS beneficiary taking Gleevec for the entire year could have been expected to rise from about $4,900 in 2006 to more than $6,300 in 2009. Plan sponsors reported having little leverage to negotiate price concessions from manufacturers for most specialty tier-eligible drugs, although sponsors were more often able to negotiate price concessions for drugs with more competitors on the market--such as for drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. One factor sponsors cited for this limited leverage was CMS requirements limiting sponsors' ability to exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competing drugs. Finally, plan sponsors employ practices such as prior authorization to manage beneficiaries' utilization of specialty tier-eligible drugs, and sponsors reported employing those practices somewhat more frequently for these drugs than for lower-cost Part D drugs. GAO provided a draft of this report to CMS. CMS agreed with portions of GAO's findings and suggested additional information for us to include in our report, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program that serves about   45 million elderly and disabled individuals\u2014offers an outpatient  prescription drug benefit known as Medicare Part D. According to the  2009 Medicare Trustees\u2019 Report, federal spending on Part D totaled   $49.3 billion in 2008\u2014accounting for nearly 11 percent of total Medicare  expenditures. Part D spending depends on several factors, including the  number of Part D beneficiaries, their health status and extent of drug  utilization, the number of beneficiaries who receive Part D\u2019s low-income  subsidy (LIS), and the cost of drugs covered by Part D. Some drugs  covered by Part D have particularly high costs\u2014sometimes exceeding tens  of thousands of dollars per year\u2014and may be responsible for a significant  share of this spending.", "Under Part D, coverage and beneficiary cost sharing can vary. Medicare  beneficiaries obtain Part D drug coverage by choosing from multiple  competing plans offered by plan sponsors\u2014often private insurers\u2014that  contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in  order to offer the prescription drug benefit. Part D plan sponsors can  offer a range of plans with either a defined standard benefit or an  actuarially equivalent alternative, or plans with enhanced benefits. Plans  can vary in the coverage provided, monthly premiums, and cost-sharing  arrangements such as copayments and coinsurance. For 2009, the Part D  standard benefit included an initial coverage period with 25 percent  beneficiary coinsurance, a coverage gap during which beneficiaries paid  100 percent of total drug costs, and a catastrophic coverage phase during  which Medicare paid 80 percent of costs.", "Part D plan sponsors have several options available to them to manage  drug spending and utilization. For example, rather than requiring   25 percent coinsurance for all drugs, plan sponsors can modify the  standard benefit by assigning covered drugs to distinct tiers, such as  separate tiers for generic and brand-name drugs. These tiers often have  increasing levels of cost sharing in order to encourage beneficiaries to  utilize less costly drugs such as generics. CMS also allows Part D plans to  establish a \u201cspecialty tier\u201d for high-cost drugs when the total cost for a  drug\u2014as determined through negotiations between the plan and  pharmacies\u2014exceeds a certain threshold, set by CMS at $500 per month  for 2007 and $600 per month for 2008 through 2010. Drugs eligible to be  placed on specialty tiers are among the most expensive drugs on the  market at costs that may exceed tens of thousands of dollars per year.  Beneficiaries who use these very expensive drugs typically face higher  cost sharing and therefore higher annual out-of-pocket costs than  beneficiaries who use only lower-cost drugs.", "In addition, plans have some flexibility in the drugs they place on their  formularies. Plan sponsors may be able to manage drug spending by  negotiating price concessions with manufacturers or price discounts with  pharmacies when deciding which drugs to place on their formularies.", "Plan sponsors can also employ various practices\u2014referred to as utiliza management\u2014that place restrictions on the usage of certain drugs on a  plan\u2019s formulary.", "You raised concerns that the costs associated with Part D coverage for  these high-cost drugs may lead to significant premium increases and  increased government spending. You also expressed interest in obtaining  information on Part D plan coverage, spending, and utilization; out-of- pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries; and cost management approaches  related to these drugs in Part D plans. This report provides information on  (1) spending under Medicare Part D on specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs  covered in 2007, the most recent year for which claims data were  available; (2) how the different cost-sharing structures used by Part D  plans for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs could be expected to affect  beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; (3) how prices negotiated with  pharmacies for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs could be expected to affect  beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; and (4) the ability of Part D plans to  negotiate price concessions from manufacturers for specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs, and the approaches plans reported using from 2006 through 2009 to  manage utilization of these drugs compared to other covered Part D drugs.", "To determine spending on specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs covered under   Part D in 2007, we examined CMS\u2019s Prescription Drug Event (PDE) claims  data from 2007 for Medicare Advantage prescription drug (MA-PD) plans  and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDP). We analyzed these claims  data to identify drugs eligible to be placed on a Part D plan\u2019s specialty tier.  For the purposes of this study, we considered specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs  to be all drugs with claims reimbursed under Part D with a median  negotiated cost of at least $500 for a 30-day supply (i.e., where at least half  of the claims for these drugs in 2007 met or exceeded the CMS cost  threshold of $500 per month). We then determined the total amount of  Part D spending for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs by Medicare, MA-PD and  PDP plans, and beneficiaries in 2007. We also used 2007 PDE data to  determine the utilization, in the aggregate, of the specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs we identified\u2014based on the number of 30-day prescriptions and the  number of beneficiaries taking the drug. Finally, we determined the  number of beneficiaries taking the drug who reached the catastrophic  coverage portion of the Part D benefit\u2014the portion where Medicare  assumes 80 percent of total drug costs. We also conducted each of these  analyses separately for LIS and non-LIS beneficiaries. We performed the  same analyses for all Part D covered drugs, regardless of cost, in order to  compare spending and utilization for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs to  spending and utilization for all drugs covered under Part D.", "To determine how the different cost-sharing structures used by Part D  plans for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs could be expected to affect  beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, we examined out-of-pocket costs under a  $50 flat monthly copayment and different coinsurance rates (25 percent  and 33 percent) for a hypothetical drug with a monthly negotiated price of  $1,100. We selected these cost-sharing structures because some plans  charge a flat monthly copayment for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs while  others charge a coinsurance rate. We analyzed the effect of each of these  typical cost-sharing structures on beneficiary out-of-pocket costs in each  phase of the Part D benefit. The results of this analysis can be generalized  to Part D beneficiaries taking any specialty tier\u2013eligible drug across most  plans.", "In order to estimate how negotiated drug prices could be expected to  affect beneficiary out-of-pocket costs and the trends in these expected  costs from 2006 to 2009, we chose a judgmental sample of 20 specialty  tier\u2013eligible drugs and also selected a sample of 36 high-enrollment MA-PD  and PDP plans from six counties based on enrollment as of March 2008.", "Our sample of drugs included those used to treat selected chronic  conditions as well as the 10 most heavily utilized specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs based on the number of 30-day prescriptions in 2007.

We used CMS negotiated  price data and CMS estimates of beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for our  sample of drugs in 35 of the 36 selected plans to analyze how negotiated  drug prices could be expected to affect beneficiary out-of-pocket costs  from 2006 through 2009.

In addition to our interviews, seven of the plan  sponsors we interviewed provided price concession data for our sample of  20 specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs for 2006 through 2008. These seven plan  sponsors represented 51 percent of all MA-PD enrollment and 67 percent  of all PDP enrollment in 2008. In addition, we analyzed data from the Part  D Formulary, Pharmacy Network, and Pricing Information files to  determine utilization management approaches reported by all Part D plans  for 2007.

We checked the negotiated price data for 2006 through 2008  provided by the plan sponsors through the data collection instrument for  internal consistency by comparing these data, when possible, to data the  plan sponsors had previously provided to CMS. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted our work  from March 2009 through December 2009 in accordance with all sections  of GAO\u2019s quality assurance framework that are relevant to our objectives.

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)  has reported that most Part D beneficiaries are in plans that use different  drug tiers. CMS also allows plans participating in Part D to use a  specialty tier in their formulary for high-cost drugs with negotiated prices  exceeding a certain threshold, set at $500 per month in 2007 and $600 permonth in 2008 through 2010.

Specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs represent a limited number of drugs used by a  small proportion of beneficiaries and commonly include  immunosuppressant drugs, those used to treat cancer, and antiviral drugs.  Although Part D beneficiaries using a drug on a nonpreferred brand-name  drug tier may seek an exception to obtain the drug at the lower cost- sharing terms applicable to drugs in another tier, plans are not obligated to  provide an exception for drugs placed on a plan\u2019s specialty tier even if no  other drug is available to treat a beneficiary\u2019s condition.", "In addition to establishing different cost-sharing tiers, Part D plan  sponsors have several options available to them to help contain drug  spending.

Since 2006, average  negotiated prices for the specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs in our sample have  risen across our sample of plans; the increases averaged 36 percent over  the 3-year period. These increases, in turn, led to higher estimated  beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for these drugs in 2009 compared to 2006.  For example, the average negotiated price for a 1-year supply of Gleevec  across our sample of plans increased by 46 percent, from about $31,200 in  2006 to about $45,500 in 2009. Correspondingly, the average out-of-pocket  cost for a non-LIS beneficiary taking Gleevec for an entire year could have  been expected to rise from about $4,900 in 2006 to more than $6,300 in  2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "For Most LIS Beneficiaries, Variations in Negotiated Drug Prices Do Not Affect Out-of-Pocket Costs", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the situation for non-LIS beneficiaries, differences in  negotiated drug prices do not affect out-of-pocket costs for full subsidy  LIS beneficiaries, and affect out-of-pocket costs for partial subsidy LIS  beneficiaries only until they reach the catastrophic coverage threshold.", "Negotiated drug prices do not affect out-of-pocket costs for full subsidy  LIS beneficiaries because they pay a flat monthly copayment (between  $1.10 and $6.00 per drug in 2009) until they reach the catastrophic  coverage threshold and pay no out-of-pocket costs for the remainder of  the calendar year. On the other hand, partial subsidy LIS beneficiaries are  affected by negotiated drug prices until they reach the catastrophic  coverage threshold, because they pay 15 percent of a drug\u2019s negotiated  cost. Therefore, variations in the negotiated price between drugs, across  plans for the same drug, and from year to year affect the amount that  partial subsidy LIS beneficiaries pay out of pocket. However, once these  beneficiaries reach the catastrophic coverage threshold, their out-of- pocket costs are no longer affected by negotiated drug costs because they  pay a flat monthly copayment (between $2.40 and $6.00 per drug in 2009)  for the remainder of the calendar year."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Plan Sponsors Report Having a Limited Ability to Negotiate Price Concessions for Specialty Tier\u2013 Eligible Drugs but Frequently Use Practices to Manage Utilization", "paragraphs": ["All of the Part D plan sponsors we interviewed, including the seven that  provided price concession data for our sample of specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs, reported having a limited ability to negotiate price concessions with  manufacturers of specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs.

However, plan sponsors are able to employ practices, such as  prior authorization, to manage beneficiaries\u2019 utilization of specialty tier\u2013 eligible drugs, and they employ these practices somewhat more often for  specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs than for other drugs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Part D Plan Sponsors Report Three Main Reasons Why They Have a Limited Ability to Negotiate Price Concessions with Manufacturers for Many Specialty Tier\u2013Eligible Drugs", "paragraphs": ["The eight Part D plan sponsors we interviewed told us that they have little  leverage in negotiating price concessions for most specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs. All seven of the plan sponsors we surveyed reported that they were  unable to obtain price concessions from manufacturers on 8 of the 20  specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs in our sample between 2006 and 2008. For  most of the remaining 12 drugs in our sample, plan sponsors who were  able to negotiate price concessions reported that they were only able to  obtain price concessions that averaged 10 percent or less, when weighted  by utilization, between 2006 and 2008. (See app. III for a drug-by-drug  comparison of the average price concessions negotiated by the plan  sponsors we surveyed, for our sample of 20 drugs, from 2006 to 2008.)", "The plan sponsors we interviewed often cited three main reasons why they  have typically had a limited ability to negotiate price concessions for  specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs. First, they stated that pharmaceutical  manufacturers have little incentive to offer price concessions when a given  drug has few competitors on the market, as is the case for drugs used to  treat cancer. For Gleevec and Tarceva, two drugs in our sample that are  used to treat certain types of cancer, plan sponsors reported that they  were not able to negotiate any price concessions between 2006 and 2008.  In contrast, plan sponsors told us that they were more often able to  negotiate price concessions for drugs in classes where there are more  competing drugs on the market\u2014such as for drugs used to treat  rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and anemia. The anemia drug  Procrit was the only drug in our sample for which all of the plan sponsors  we surveyed reported that they were able to obtain price concessions each  year between 2006 and 2008.", "Second, plan sponsors told us that even when there are competing drugs,  CMS may require plans to include all or most drugs in a therapeutic class  on their formularies, and such requirements limit the leverage a plan  sponsor has when negotiating price concessions. When negotiating price  concessions with pharmaceutical manufacturers, the ability to exclude a  drug from a plan\u2019s formulary in favor of a therapeutic alternative is often a  significant source of leverage available to a plan sponsor. However, many  specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs belong to one of the six classes of clinical  concern for which CMS requires Part D plan sponsors to include all or  substantially all drugs on their formularies, eliminating formulary  exclusion as a source of negotiating leverage. We found that specialty  tier\u2013eligible drugs were more than twice as likely to be in one of the six  classes of clinical concern compared with lower-cost drugs in 2009.  Additionally, among the 8 drugs in our sample of 20 specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs for which the plan sponsors we surveyed reported they were unable  to obtain price concessions between 2006 and 2008, 4 drugs were in one of  the six classes of clinical concern. Plan sponsors are also required to  include at least two therapeutic alternatives from each of the other  therapeutic classes on their formularies.", "Third, plan sponsors told us that they have limited ability to negotiate  price concessions for certain specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs because they  account for a relatively limited share of total prescription drug utilization  among Part D beneficiaries. For some drugs in our sample, such as  Zavesca, a drug used to treat a rare enzyme disorder called Gaucher  disease, the plan sponsors we surveyed had very few beneficiary claims  between 2006 and 2008. None of the plan sponsors we surveyed reported  price concessions for this drug during this period. Plan sponsors told us  that utilization volume is usually a source of leverage when negotiating  price concessions with manufacturers for Part D drugs. For some specialty  tier\u2013eligible drugs like Zavesca, however, the total number of individuals  using the drug may be so limited that plans are not able to enroll a  significant enough share of the total users to entice the manufacturer to  offer a price concession."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Part D Plans Employ Utilization Management Practices Somewhat More Frequently for Specialty Tier\u2013Eligible Drugs Than for Other Covered Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Plan sponsors employ various practices to manage beneficiaries\u2019  utilization of Part D drugs. According to plan sponsors that we interviewed  and our analysis of CMS data, these practices are somewhat more  common for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs than for lower-cost drugs. For  example, based on our analysis of certain drugs and plans, one or more  plans placed at least one utilization management requirement on 99  percent of specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs in 2007, while they placed at least  one utilization management requirement on a smaller percentage\u2014  89 percent\u2014of nonspecialty tier\u2013eligible Part D drugs. According to the  plan sponsors we interviewed, prior authorization is the most common of  the various utilization management practices employed for specialty tier\u2013 eligible drugs. Based on our analysis, one or more plans placed a prior  authorization requirement on 95 percent of specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs in  2007. Quantity limits and step therapy were used less often, with one or  more plans placing quantity limits on 58 percent of specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs and a step therapy requirement on 14 percent of specialty tier\u2013 eligible drugs.", "Most of the plan sponsors we interviewed described utilization  management as a strategy for promoting patient safety and limiting  inappropriate use of Part D drugs, including specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs.  One plan sponsor explained that specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs often have a  more serious side-effect profile than other drugs covered under Part D  and, as a result, plans may employ prior authorization to minimize the  potential for adverse effects among beneficiaries who are prescribed these  drugs. Plan sponsors also told us that they often use prior authorization to  ensure that beneficiaries who have been prescribed specialty tier\u2013eligible  drugs are using them for a medically-accepted indication.", "Some plan sponsors explained that it is more difficult to employ certain  utilization management practices, like quantity limits and step therapy,  with specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs than with other Part D drugs, which is  why these practices are used less often than prior authorization. For  example, plan sponsors said that because there are often few, if any,  therapeutic equivalents or alternatives for specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs,  plans do not have many opportunities to promote the use of less costly  drugs through a step therapy protocol.

Also, consistent with our finding that  different cost-sharing structures used by plans can initially affect  beneficiary out-of-pocket costs, CMS noted that a plan requiring   25 percent coinsurance plus a $295 deductible would initially result in  higher beneficiary out-of-pocket costs than a plan requiring 33 percent  coinsurance with no deductible. CMS did not agree with the   $295 deductible we included in figure 5 of our draft report to illustrate  certain cost-sharing scenarios. In its comments, CMS pointed out that a  $295 deductible does not apply in scenarios in which plans charge   33 percent coinsurance, because CMS has a requirement that plans cannot  charge such a deductible when using 33 percent coinsurance for specialty  tier drugs. Although CMS does have such a requirement, we included the  $295 deductible in our scenario because plans may also place specialty  tier\u2013eligible drugs on nonspecialty tiers that include both a $295  deductible and a coinsurance rate above 25 percent (e.g., 33 percent or   42 percent). Our analysis identified a number of plans requiring such cost- sharing combinations for the 20 specialty tier\u2013eligible drugs in our sample.  We included the $295 deductible for illustrative purposes to clearly  demonstrate how differences in the coinsurance percentage or copayment  amount would affect beneficiary out-of-pocket costs. However, using  different deductible amount\u2014for example, $0\u2014for one or more scenarios  would not change our overall finding: different cost-sharing structures can  be expected to result in out-of-pocket costs that vary initially but become  similar once beneficiaries reach the catastrophic coverage threshold.", "In its written comments, CMS suggested that we report changes in  negotiated drug prices over time in the context of changes to the drug\u2019s  average wholesale price (AWP). However, we chose to report changes to  actual negotiated prices as reported to CMS by plan sponsors because they  are a better reflection of prices paid by beneficiaries, who may pay a  percentage of the negotiated price during the initial coverage period and  often pay the entire negotiated price during the coverage gap. Additionally,  CMS questioned our statement comparing the proportion of specialty tier\u2013 eligible drugs and lower-cost drugs that belong to one of the six classes of  clinical concern and requested more information about our methodology.
