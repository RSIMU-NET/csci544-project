Specifically, this report (1) discusses the scope and disposition of China's compliance problems, (2) reviews the U.S. government's bilateral and multilateral approaches for resolving these problems, (3) assesses the key agencies' strategies and plans for ensuring compliance, and (4) assesses how the agencies have adapted their staff resources to conduct compliance activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["China has successfully implemented many of its numerous WTO commitments, but USTR reported that over 100 separate compliance problems arose in 2002 and 2003. These problems ranged from specific, relatively simple issues to broader, more systemic concerns. Most problems continued from 2002 to 2003, an indication that China was able to address the more easily resolvable problems, while the more complex issues persisted. Furthermore, new problems emerged, with many arising from phased-in commitments that China was due to implement in 2003. The U.S. government continued to pursue resolution of compliance problems in 2004, and the agencies noted the successful resolution of several major issues of economic importance to U.S. companies. The key U.S. agencies have done much to ensure China's compliance, but GAO found three areas in which these key agencies could take steps to improve their efforts: First, U.S. efforts to address compliance problems emphasized high-level bilateral engagement with China in 2003, with increased senior-level delegations to China and elevated participation in formal consultative mechanisms. U.S. multilateral engagement with China in 2003 reflected more emphasis on working through regular WTO committee business, because the WTO's annual review of China's implementation, the Transitional Review Mechanism (TRM), has ongoing limitations. Nevertheless, the TRM has benefits and these could be enhanced by increased member participation and earlier U.S. submissions, which would maximize the potential for full and informed responses from China. Second, although interagency and intra-agency coordination on policy and high level compliance strategies was generally effective, GAO found various performance management limitations that make it difficult to clearly measure and assess the outcome of the key agencies' China-WTO compliance efforts. GAO found that the specific units within the agencies that are most directly involved with these efforts could improve how the agencies measure and report the results of their activities. Furthermore, developing clearer linkages between unit-level results and agency goals that are established in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 could enhance the effectiveness of these units' activities. Third, turnover and lack of training limited the effectiveness of increased staff resources for China-WTO compliance activities. New staff members were called upon to take up complex monitoring and enforcement activities while relying primarily on on-the-job training, which was complicated by high and often predictable staff turnover. Attention to human capital management is particularly important, given the long-term challenges associated with ensuring China's compliance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["China\u2019s 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) raised  expectations with Congress and the private sector about the prospects for  China to reform its markets and allow greater access to foreign goods and  services.

This  growing deficit, together with ongoing concern over China\u2019s adherence to  WTO rules, has sharpened the focus on the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to  ensure that U.S. firms secure the benefits of China\u2019s membership in the  global trading system.", "As part of your request that we undertake a long-term body of work related  to China\u2019s membership in the WTO, we reviewed how the U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) and the Departments of Commerce, State, and  Agriculture (USDA) were positioned to monitor and enforce China\u2019s  compliance with its WTO commitments in 2003.

To assess U.S.  bilateral and multilateral monitoring and enforcement efforts, we reviewed  agency and WTO documents and interviewed agency officials both in  Washington, D.C., and Beijing, as well as WTO Secretariat and other  member government officials. To assess agency strategies, plans,  resources, and other activities related to China\u2019s compliance, we reviewed  planning documents, budget and staffing data, and information on training  from the four key agencies.

These compliance problems fell within all nine broad areas of  China\u2019s trade regime and varied from import regulation to export regulation  (see table 3 and app. II for descriptions of these nine areas). China\u2019s WTO  commitments are broad and complex, and compliance problems also  ranged in scope from specific issues to more general concerns. For  example, some commitments require a specific action from China, such as  reporting information about China\u2019s import-licensing requirements to the  WTO. Other commitments are less specific in nature, such as those that  confirm China\u2019s general obligation to adhere to WTO principles of  nondiscrimination in the treatment of foreign and domestic enterprises.

Specifically,  the WTO\u2019s annual TRM was intended to be a thorough review of China\u2019s  implementation, but many U.S., WTO, and foreign officials agree that the  mechanism has limitations. Nevertheless, the TRM and the benefits it  provides could be enhanced by increased member participation and more  timely U.S. preparation, which would improve the chances for full and  informed responses from Chinese officials and maximize the potential  exchange of information. Thus, even with a continued U.S. emphasis on  bilateral and other multilateral engagement, the TRM can continue to  provide an important avenue to pursue U.S. trade interests.", "Second, the U.S. government\u2019s China-WTO compliance efforts would  benefit from increased emphasis on planning and performance  management within each of the key agencies. While we acknowledge that  unit managers need to be flexible when reacting to compliance problems,  setting clear unit priorities and measurable goals that support overall  agency objectives need not reduce their flexibility. To the contrary, GPRA  and our substantial body work on planning emphasizes the importance and  usefulness of developing unit and program-level plans and measures that  are connected to an agency\u2019s overall mission. We acknowledge the  challenges of developing measurable goals, given the extent to which  external factors can influence agencies\u2019 trade compliance efforts; however,  we believe that it is possible to better measure results annually.", "Third, we found that these agencies have opportunities to better manage  their human capital involved in the U.S. government\u2019s China-compliance  activities. Specifically, in an environment of high and regular staff turnover,  new staff are called upon to take up monitoring and enforcement activities  that involve complex, long-term issues. New staffs\u2019 effectiveness and  efficiency is reduced when no formal training is available to help them with  their day-to-day activities, and when staffing gaps mean they cannot learn  from their more experienced predecessors. Increased management  attention to providing an adequate mix of OJT and formal training can help  ensure that new employees have the necessary tools for doing their jobs  well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve multilateral engagement with China on WTO compliance  issues, we recommend that the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) take  steps to maximize the potential benefits of the Transitional Review  Mechanism (TRM).

Specifically, USTR should set annual measurable  predetermined targets related to its China compliance performance  measures and assess the results in its annual performance reports. The  Secretary of Commerce should take further steps to improve the accuracy  of the data used to measure results for the agency\u2019s trade compliance- related goals. The Secretary of State should require the China mission to  assess results in meeting their goals and report this information as part of  the annual mission performance plan. The Secretary of USDA should  further examine the external factors that may affect agency\u2019s progress  toward achieving its trade-related goals and present the agency\u2019s strategies  for mitigating those potential effects. Furthermore, the head of each agency  should direct their main China compliance units to set forth unit plans that  are clearly linked to agency performance goals and measures, establish  unit priorities for their activities, and annually assess unit results to better  manage their resources.", "Further, we recommend that USTR and the Secretaries of Commerce,  State, and USDA undertake actions to mitigate the effects of both  anticipated and unplanned staff turnover within the agencies\u2019 main China- WTO compliance units by identifying China compliance-related training  needs and taking steps to ensure that staff have adequate opportunity to  acquire the necessary training. These actions could include determining  which of the agencies\u2019 existing courses would be appropriate for staff,  determining what types of external training are available, developing  training courses on relevant issues, and establishing a plan and timelines  for existing and new staff to receive training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to the Office of the U.S. Trade  Representative, and the Departments of Commerce, State, and Agriculture,  and we received written comments from all four agencies (the agencies\u2019  comments and our specific responses are reproduced in appendixes IV  through VII). USTR and Commerce also provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In general, the agencies noted they would consider our recommendations,  but they raised various concerns and provided additional information for  our consideration. USTR, Commerce, and State expressed similar concerns  about our analysis of the scope and disposition of the compliance problems  presented in USTR\u2019s 2002 and 2003 reports on China\u2019s WTO compliance.  The agencies emphasized the importance of developments in resolving  compliance problems that occurred in 2004 and believed that our  characterization of the disposition of compliance problems was potentially  misleading. We generally agreed with these comments and updated the  report to provide more equal treatment of 2004 developments and modified  the presentation of our analysis of the disposition of China\u2019s compliance  problems. Our responses to the agencies\u2019 specific concerns on these issues  are presented in appendixes IV through VI.", "USTR, Commerce, and USDA also made specific comments that our report  did not adequately reflect extensive high-level strategic coordination  efforts among the key agencies, and they provided additional information  regarding these efforts. We modified the report to include further  discussion of high-level strategic planning efforts and clarified that our  assessment and recommendations focus on the agencies\u2019 performance  management efforts. The agencies expressed related concerns about the  challenges associated with quantitatively measuring performance of their  monitoring and enforcement efforts. State and USDA indicated that efforts  are under way in those agencies to improve aspects of their performance  planning and measurement, while USTR responded that their performance  measurements were adequate and complied with GPRA and OMB  guidance. We maintain that our assessments of the agencies\u2019 performance  management are accurate, especially in light of OMB guidance (set forth in  OMB Circular No. A-11), and that moreover our recommendations, if  implemented, would aid in better management of the U.S. government\u2019s  efforts to ensure China\u2019s compliance.", "USTR commented that our discussion of the TRM overlooked the U.S.  government\u2019s efforts to engage China outside of the TRM through the  regular WTO committee structure, and disagreed with our conclusion that  greater lead time for U.S. TRM submissions to China would increase the  potential for fuller oral responses from China. We amplified our discussion  of U.S. multilateral efforts in the WTO, but we continue to believe that  USTR should take steps to maximize the potential of the TRM, which  would include providing greater lead time in submitting TRM questions to  China.", "Commerce, State, and USDA indicated that training is a priority and that  training opportunities exist for staff in the agencies China units.  Furthermore, State believed our criticisms concerning training were  overstated and did not take into account various structural constraints  faced by that department. USTR said that USTR staff did not require  training since the agency only hires experienced staff. We acknowledge  that training opportunities, including OJT, do exist in the agencies and that  many staff have extensive backgrounds on China trade issues.  Nevertheless, we continue to believe that a more cohesive approach to  training can help alleviate the effects of turnover and maximize staff  effectiveness. Lastly, some of the agencies provided additional information  regarding various activities and other contextual information associated  with ensuring China\u2019s compliance.

Specifically, in this report, we (1) examined the scope and disposition of  China-WTO compliance problems that the U.S. government is working to  resolve; (2) reviewed the U.S. government\u2019s bilateral and multilateral  approaches for resolving compliance problems; (3) assessed the agencies\u2019  strategies, plans, and measures for ensuring China\u2019s compliance; and (4)  assessed how the U.S. government has adapted its staff resources to  monitor and resolve China compliance problems.", "To examine the scope and disposition of compliance problems, we  reviewed the USTR\u2019s Report to Congress on China\u2019s WTO Compliance  from 2002 and 2003. These annual reports, mandated in conjunction with  China\u2019s 2001 accession to the WTO, incorporate a broad range of input  from key federal agencies as well as the business community. We  systematically cross-checked the reports with testimony and reports  submitted to the Trade Policy Staff Committee, Subcommittee on China- WTO Compliance as part of its 2002 and 2003 hearings on China-WTO  compliance and other relevant reports. Other reports included those issued  by the U.S.-China Business Council and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  which represent a broad cross-section of U.S. industries and companies  doing business in China. We found the USTR reports to be a generally fair  and complete representation of U.S. industry concerns. After verifying the  content of USTR\u2019s reports to the extent possible, we quantified the number  of compliance problems in each area of China\u2019s WTO commitment based  on the report\u2019s narrative descriptions of China\u2019s compliance problems.", "To analyze the disposition of the compliance problems, we again relied  extensively on the narrative descriptions provided in the reports to make a  determination and assigned three broad categories to describe the  disposition of the problems: No progress noted, some progress noted, and  resolved. The determination that there was \u201cno progress noted\u201d on a  particular problem was based on the fact that the report did not indicate  that China took any action to resolve the issue after a range of enforcement  strategies carried out by USTR and the other key agencies. If the reports  indicated that China had undertaken actions to resolve a compliance  problem, we coded this as \u201csome progress noted.\u201d The assessment of  \u201csome progress noted\u201d included a range of steps that China took to address  U.S. concerns, from delaying the implementation of problematic measures  to exempting certain industries from WTO-inconsistent restrictions. We  coded problems as \u201cresolved\u201d only if the report language clearly indicated  that the compliance problem was resolved and the U.S. government was no  longer pursuing a resolution of that particular problem. Although we note  in the report that the U.S. government has indicated positive developments  in resolving some of the problems in 2004, our analysis focused only on the  issues raised in the 2002 and 2003 reports. Several of our staff reviewed  these analyses to ensure consistency and consensus. See table 9 for our  assessment criteria and examples.", "To assess U.S. bilateral and multilateral engagement strategies, we  reviewed agency and WTO documents and interviewed agency officials  both in Washington, D.C., and Beijing, China, as well as WTO Secretariat  and other member governments in Geneva, Switzerland, and Brussels,  Belgium. To assess overall U.S. government strategy, we interviewed USTR  officials in Geneva and Washington D.C., and reviewed official testimony.  Our review of the Transitional Review Mechanism (TRM) is based on  analysis of official WTO documents, which include minutes and questions  or comments submitted by member countries, as well as interviews with  U.S. officials and with member countries officials in Geneva.", "To assess USTR, Commerce, State, and USDA strategies and plans, we  examined planning documents such as annual performance reports, budget  documents, and annual reviews. We reviewed each agency\u2019s most recent  performance and strategic plans to determine how China WTO monitoring  and enforcement is incorporated into the agencies\u2019 planning process. Our  evaluation of agency planning efforts was informed by our previous studies  on the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA). We  enhanced our review of this information by interviewing agency officials  regarding agency wide and unit-level planning and evaluation efforts. To  gather staff and management perspectives on planning and performance  measures, we conducted standardized interviews within all four agencies.", "To assess agency resources and other activities related to China\u2019s  compliance, we reviewed the four key agencies\u2019 planning documents,  budget and staffing data, and information on training. Our evaluation was  informed by past GAO studies on human capital management issues. We  asked each agency to provide us with the actual number of FTE staff and  staff attrition rates in key units involved in China-WTO compliance efforts  for fiscal years 2002 and 2003. In some cases, agencies were unable to  provide us with actual staffing numbers because some staff did not work  on China issues full-time. In those instances, we asked agency officials to  estimate FTE staff working solely on China compliance. To ensure that the  data were reliable to the extent possible and necessary for our review, we  discussed criteria for making estimates with the agencies to ensure that the  estimates were consistent between agencies. We compared agency  information on staffing with information we received for previous reviews  and discussed changes in staffing levels with cognizant agency officials. We  determined that the staffing information was sufficiently reliable for our  review. We asked each agency to supply us with training documents or  manuals and minutes or records from coordinating meetings. We  supplemented our review of this information by conducting individual  interviews with over 50 staff and unit managers from the four key agencies  that had China compliance as a main portion of their work portfolio. These  were standardized interviews conducted individually, with the exception of  USTR, which required a group interview. We were able to interview over  two-thirds of U.S. government staff in the main units at the four key  agencies who work primarily on China-WTO compliance.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., Beijing, China, Geneva,  Switzerland, and Brussels, Belgium.

However, we still demonstrate the scope of compliance  problems, how China\u2019s compliance problems can persist for 2 years or  more, and the extent to which China\u2019s progress in resolving these issues  has been mixed.  2. We amplified our discussion of other multilateral engagement through  regular WTO committees in order to put the TRM in better context.  Nevertheless, after reviewing the minutes of the various TRM meetings,  we continue to believe that earlier U.S. submission of questions to  China in advance of the TRM meetings could increase the chances for  more thorough oral responses from the Chinese delegation.

We  noted that USTR has described numerical indicators in its performance  plan, yet has not set targets or measured the agency\u2019s performance  against these indicators. Although we agree that USTR has some  flexibility under GPRA to establish performance measures that are not  strictly quantitative, the agency specifically sets forth numerical  measures in its performance plan. Accordingly, USTR should have  specifically addressed these measures in its results report. Additionally,  while USTR states that its approach was approved by OMB and was in  compliance with GPRA, the OMB guidance requires all agencies to  report a comparison of actual performance with projected, target levels  of performance; without establishing targets, we believe USTR is not  able to make this required comparison. We revised our draft report to  clarify and further emphasize our assessment. 4.
