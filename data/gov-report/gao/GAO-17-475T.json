VHA provided care to about 6.7  million veterans in fiscal year 2015 and the demand for its services is  expected to grow in the coming years due, in part, to service members  returning from the United States\u2019 military operations in Afghanistan and  Iraq and the growing needs of an aging veteran population.

In these occupations, other  reasons\u2014primarily expiration of their appointments\u2014averaged about 35  and 33 percent of losses, respectively. According to VHA officials,  expirations of appointments occur when a nonpermanent, time-limited  appointment ends due to the expiration of the work or the funds available  for the position. For physical therapists and psychologists, the use of  trainees, such as interns or post-doctoral fellows, accounted for the  majority of losses due to expirations of appointments.

VHA identified a number of  key initiatives it offered to help medical centers recruit and retain nurses,  which focused primarily on providing (1) education and training, and (2)  financial benefits and incentives. VA medical centers generally had  discretion in offering these initiatives.", "The four medical centers in our review varied in the number of initiatives  they offered, and three of these medical centers developed local  recruitment and retention initiatives in addition to those offered by VHA.  While three of the four medical centers reported VHA\u2019s initiatives  improved their ability to recruit and retain nurses, they also reported  challenges. The challenges included insufficient HR support for medical  centers, competition with private sector medical facilities, a reduced pool  of advanced training nurses in rural locations, and employee  dissatisfaction.", "In our 2015 report we also found that VHA provided limited oversight of its  key system-wide nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. Specifically,  VHA conducted limited monitoring of medical centers\u2019 compliance with its  initiatives. For example, in the past, VHA conducted site visits in response  to a medical center reporting difficulty with implementation of one of its  initiatives and to assess compliance with program policies, but VHA  stopped conducting these visits. Consistent with federal internal control  standards, monitoring should be ongoing and should identify performance  gaps in a policy or procedure. With limited monitoring, VHA lacks  assurance that its medical centers are complying with its nurse  recruitment and retention initiatives, and that any problems are identified  and resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.", "In addition, VHA has not evaluated the training resources provided to  nurse recruiters at VA medical centers or the overall effectiveness of the  initiatives in meeting its nurse recruitment and retention goals, or whether  any changes are needed. Consistent with federal internal control  standards, measuring performance tracks progress toward program goals  and objectives and provides important information to make management  decisions and resolve any problems or program weaknesses. For  example, we found that VHA did not know whether medical centers had  sufficient training to support nurse recruitment and retention initiatives. In  particular, VHA did not provide face-to-face training specifically for nurse  recruiters, but regular training was available to those assigned to a HR  office as part of training available to all HR staff.", "Representatives from a national nursing organization reported that clinical  nurse recruiters at VA medical centers often feel less prepared for the  position than those assigned to HR offices, but VHA has not evaluated  this disparity or its effects. Without evaluations of its collective system- wide initiatives, VHA is unable to determine how effectively the initiatives  are meeting VHA policies and the provisions of the Veterans Access,  Choice, and Accountability Act.

In comparison, attrition for all VHA employees was generally  consistent during the same period, from 8.4 percent in fiscal year 2013 to  9 percent at the end of fiscal year 2015 (see figure 3).", "Most of the turnover is due to transfers to other federal agencies, followed  by resignations and voluntary retirement. In fiscal year 2015 HR  specialists transferred to other federal agencies at a rate six times higher  than all VHA employees.", "We found that between fiscal years 2011 and 2015, the majority of  medical centers fell short of VHA\u2019s HR staffing goals, even with new hires  to partially offset annual attrition (see figure 4). VHA established a target  HR staffing ratio of 1 HR staff to 60 VHA employees to manage  consistent, accurate, and timely delivery of HR services. However, in  fiscal year 2015 about 83 percent (116 of 139) of medical centers did not  meet this target. Of these 116 medical centers, about half had a staffing  ratio of 1 HR staff to 80 VHA employees or worse. In other words, each  HR employee at those medical centers was serving 20 to 80 more  employees than recommended by VHA\u2019s target staffing ratio. According  to the HR staff we interviewed, this has reduced HR employees\u2019 ability to  keep pace with work demands and has led to such issues as delays in  the hiring process, problems with addressing important clinical hiring  initiatives, and an increased risk of personnel processing and coding  errors.", "In addition, VHA\u2019s All Employee Survey results from 2015 indicate that  HR staff reported feeling more burned out and less satisfied with their  amount of work compared to the VHA-wide average in these areas.

However, the  broad list of exemptions, ranging from physicians to housekeeping staff,  did not include HR specialists, even though VHA ranked HR management  as third on a list of mission critical occupations in its 2016 Workforce and  Succession Strategic Plan. Given the attrition rate that we identified  among HR specialists and the HR staffing shortfalls at many VA medical  centers, a prolonged hiring freeze could further erode VHA\u2019s capacity to  provide needed HR functions.", "In our 1982 report on hiring freezes under prior administrations, we  concluded that government-wide freezes are not an effective means of  controlling federal employment because they ignored individual agencies\u2019  missions, workload, and staffing requirements and could thus disrupt  agency operations.

Federal standards for internal controls require agencies to (1) establish  an organizational structure that includes appropriate lines of  accountability and authority, (2) evaluate the competencies of HR staff  and ensure they have been appropriately trained to do their jobs, and (3) design information systems to meet operational needs and use valid and  reliable data to support the agency\u2019s mission. We found shortfalls in  each of these practices at VHA. Moreover, as shown in figure 5, the twin  challenges of weak internal controls and limited HR capacity have had a  compounding effect, creating an environment that undermines VHA\u2019s HR  operations and impedes its ability to improve delivery of health care  services to veterans.", "We reported that key areas for improvement include the following:  Strengthen oversight of HR offices. VHA is structured so that the  central HR offices at VA and VHA have inadequate oversight of medical  center HR offices in order to hold them accountable. This lack of  oversight contributes to issues with VHA\u2019s capacity to provide HR  functions and limits VHA\u2019s ability to monitor HR improvement efforts and  ensure that HR offices apply policies consistently. Our Standards for  Internal Control requires an agency\u2019s organizational structure to provide a  framework for planning, directing, and controlling operations to achieve  agency objectives. VA and VHA\u2019s central HR offices are primarily  responsible for developing HR policy, guidance, and training, while VISN  and medical center HR offices are responsible for implementing HR  policies and managing daily HR operations. However, as shown in figure  6, there is not a direct line of authority between the VISN and medical  center HR offices and the central HR offices in VA and VHA.", "According to the director of VA\u2019s Office of Oversight and Effectiveness,  the department\u2019s organizational structure enables medical center  directors to effectively respond to the needs of veterans and other clients  using available resources. However, VA and VHA HR officials with whom  we spoke said that the organizational structure limits the department\u2019s  ability to oversee individual HR offices, improve hiring processes, train  HR staff, and implement consistent classification processes.", "Identify and address critical competency gaps. Federal standards for  internal control require an agency to ensure that its workforce is  competent to carry out assigned responsibilities in order to achieve the  agency\u2019s mission. Additionally, our prior work has identified principles for  human capital planning that recommend an agency identify skills gaps  within its workforce, implement strategies to address these gaps, and  monitor its progress. However, VA and VHA\u2019s model for assessing the  competencies of HR staff is incomplete and fragmented. As one example,  VHA\u2019s internal human capital reviews have consistently found that HR  staff competencies are not being assessed and HR staff lack the  necessary skills to deliver high-quality services. Further, although both VA  and VHA provide a variety of training programs, HR staff with whom we  spoke described barriers to completing them, including a lack of time to  take training and train new hires, limited course offerings, and lengthy  waiting lists for courses.", "Address long-standing information technology challenges. To have  an effective internal control system, agencies should design their  information systems to obtain and process information to meet  operational needs. Likewise, our prior work on strategic human capital  management notes that high-performing organizations leverage modern  technology to automate and streamline personnel processes to meet  customer needs. Data that are valid and reliable are critical to assessing  an agency\u2019s workforce requirements. However, VA faces long-standing,  significant information technology (IT) challenges that include outdated,  inefficient IT systems and fragmented systems that are not  interoperable. With respect to HR IT systems, in May 2016 we reported  that VA\u2019s department-wide HR system, Personnel and Accounting  Integrated Data (PAID), is one of the federal government\u2019s oldest IT  systems and that VA is in the process of replacing it.", "As part of efforts to replace PAID, VA is developing and implementing an  enterprise-wide, modern web-based system called HR Smart. VA  officials told us that HR Smart will be implemented in phases across the  department. According to agency documentation, HR Smart will enable  HR staff to better manage information on employee benefits and  compensation; electronically initiate, route, and receive approval for  personnel actions; monitor workforce planning efforts and vacancies by  medical center and across the department; and generate reports and  queries.", "As VA continues to develop and implement its new HR system, VHA HR  staff must rely on several separate enterprise-wide IT systems to handle  core HR activities such as managing personnel actions and hiring and  recruiting efforts. HR staff with whom we spoke stated that the amount of  time they spent entering duplicate data into four or more non- interoperable systems and reconciling data between the systems has  made their jobs more difficult and has taken time away from performing  other critical HR duties. According to VA officials, once HR Smart is fully  implemented, it should reduce HR offices\u2019 reliance on multiple HR  systems and local tools and help to streamline HR processes. For  example, according to program documentation, VA plans to implement  functionality in HR Smart that will allow managers to initiate, review, and  approve basic personnel actions independently. In these cases, HR staff  would no longer be responsible for data entry.", "In conclusion, VHA\u2019s challenges recruiting and retaining clinical and HR  employees are making it difficult for VHA to meet the health care needs of  our nation\u2019s veterans. The prior reports on which this testimony is based  made three recommendations to VA aimed at improving the oversight of  nurse recruitment and retention initiatives and seven recommendations  directed at strengthening VHA\u2019s HR capacity. Key recommendations  included developing a process to help monitor medical centers\u2019  compliance with key nurse recruitment and retention initiatives and  establishing clear lines of authority between VA and VHA\u2019s central  personnel offices and those offices in individual medical centers to hold  them accountable for improving HR functions.
