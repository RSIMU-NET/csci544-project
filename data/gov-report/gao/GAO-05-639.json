In implementing this performance-based funding system, Global Fund officials are to periodically assess whether the grant's principal recipient has made sufficient progress to warrant its next disbursement. After 2 years, the Global Fund is to determine whether to continue funding the grant for an additional 3 years. In making an assessment, officials consider several information sources, including the recipient's reports on its performance and expenditures and an independent agent's verification of the recipient's reports. Recipient countries' capacity to implement grants has been an underlying factor in grant performance, according to Global Fund and other knowledgeable officials. These officials, as well as principal recipients, also cited guidance, coordination, planning, and contracting and procurement as factors associated with challenges or successes in grant performance. For example, recipients in three countries reported that they could not meet their targets because they had not received national treatment guidelines. However, several grant recipients reported that, under certain circumstances, Global Fund guidance allowed them to quickly redirect funds, thereby enabling them to meet their targets. GAO found problems associated with the information sources that the Global Fund uses in making performance-based funding decisions. For example, the limited monitoring and evaluation capabilities of many recipients raise questions about the accuracy of their reporting. Moreover, the Global Fund has not consistently documented its determinations that recipients' performance warranted additional funding. For instance, the Global Fund's documentation did not explain its decisions to disburse funds to some recipients who reported that they had met few targets. Further, the Global Fund does not track or publicly document denied disbursement requests. The Global Fund is taking steps to address challenges to grant performance and improve the overall management of grants, including (1) reorganizing and strengthening its staff; (2) developing a risk assessment mechanism and early warning system to identify poorly performing grants; (3) streamlining reporting and funding procedures; (4) working with partners to strengthen recipient capacity; and (5) clarifying certain guidance for the country coordinating mechanism--the entity in each country responsible for developing grant proposals, nominating grant recipients, monitoring grant implementation, and advising the Global Fund on the viability of grants for continued funding.

Global Fund grant managers said that in many cases, grants  experienced early delays because of weaknesses in recipients\u2019 financial,  procurement, and monitoring and evaluation systems. For example,  Indonesia\u2019s local fund agent found the principal recipient\u2019s management  and financial plans to be insufficient and asked the recipient to rework  them seven times before the local fund agent recommended grant  disbursements. Also in Indonesia, TB spending increased fivefold, greatly  straining capacity, particularly for monitoring and evaluating activities at  the district level. In Kenya, a lack of designated, adequately trained staff at  the principal recipient (the ministry of finance) and immediate  subrecipients (the ministry of health and the National AIDS Control  Council) slowed disbursements from the principal recipient and from the  immediate subrecipients to implementing organizations. Ethiopia has been  slow in implementing its first three grants, particularly those for TB and  malaria, owing to lack of monitoring and reporting capacity within the  ministry of health, delays in recruiting staff to manage financial systems,  slow decision-making processes, delays in starting the procurement  process, and cumbersome procurement procedures.", "Despite limited overall capacity in recipient countries, we found instances  where recipient governments had worked with development partners to  strengthen capacity in the health sector, thus facilitating grant  performance. For example, according to the Indonesian government and  WHO officials, the Global Fund grant in Indonesia is building on a strong  foundation, using the country\u2019s 5-year strategic plan for TB, a joint effort of  the Indonesian government and WHO. Between 2000 and 2003, the Dutch  government helped train TB \u201csoldiers\u201d in Indonesian provinces, which  improved outreach and case-detection efforts under the Global Fund grant;  Indonesia\u2019s ministry of health had already established mechanisms to  quickly disburse funds to districts. In addition, the Zambian government  has worked with donors and other development partners to strengthen its  health sector financing mechanisms. As a result, donors, including the  Global Fund, contribute directly to an existing mechanism, the pooled  health sector \u201cbasket,\u201d and use the health sector donor group overseeing  these funds to monitor and evaluate grant progress in meeting targets.", "Zambia\u2019s health sector also has mechanisms in place to quickly channel  funds to the country\u2019s more than 70 districts. In Mongolia, the local fund  agent reported that the principal recipient and subrecipients had adequate  financial management systems in place to account for funds and that the  principal recipient could immediately start implementing the program with  little, if any, technical assistance.

For example, recipients in three countries reported  that they could not meet their targets because they had not received  approved national treatment guidelines. Indonesia\u2019s ministry of health did  not have guidelines ready for the voluntary counseling and testing  component of its HIV grant, delaying distribution of information to the  provinces. Senegal\u2019s ministry of health, another principal recipient, did not  have treatment plans needed for implementing its malaria grant, preventing  the principal recipient from receiving antimalarial medication. In addition,  some stakeholders reported that guidance from the Global Fund was  lacking or unclear or that they encountered difficulties with Global Fund  grant policies. For example, in at least one instance, U.S. government  officials reported that spending delays in Kenya resulted from unclear  guidance from the Global Fund regarding altering programs to allow the  use of newer, more effective but expensive malaria drugs. The Global Fund  recognized that procedures for early grants were unclear and that this lack  of clarity caused program delays. Further, WHO officials and at least one  recipient voiced concerns over lack of flexibility when recipients sought to  modify grant activities. For example, one subrecipient in Thailand  expressed concern that it could not use Global Fund money to build or  maintain a shelter for HIV-positive women because this type of activity was  not written into the grant. Grant recipients also said that continued staff  turnover in the Global Fund\u2019s grant management teams made it difficult to  receive clear, consistent guidance. For example, recipients in Thailand said  that they had worked with four different grant managers over the life of  their grants and that this turnover had complicated communication.", "However, several grant recipients reported that, under certain  circumstances, Global Fund guidance allowed them to quickly redirect  funds to meet existing targets. For example, the principal recipient in  Indonesia cited grant flexibility as a factor positively affecting performance  in both its TB and HIV/AIDS round-1 grants, because this flexibility allowed  it to adjust its funding priorities in line with its targets.

Similarly, in  Kenya, one NGO principal recipient leveraged the activities of other groups  providing HIV care kits. Another recipient in Kenya exceeded its targets for  condom distribution by working with local intermediaries to increase  demand by approaching new types of clients, such as shoe shiners, open  vehicle cleaners, security officers, staff at petrol stations, and young men at  salons. In Indonesia, a grant subrecipient was able to provide treatment to  a larger number of TB patients by partnering with private physicians,  because a significant number of patients sought treatment at private  clinics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Planning Difficulties Made It Hard to Meet Targets, but Adept Planning Made Them Attainable", "paragraphs": ["Planning difficulties affected some recipients\u2019 ability to meet grant targets.  Recipients reported that they sometimes did not achieve targets for a  variety of reasons, including not budgeting sufficient time or money to  complete targets, or scheduling activities for the wrong time period. One  recipient in Zambia underestimated the time needed to analyze baseline  data on constituent needs prior to the planned distribution of educational  materials on malaria prevention to 1,000 households. The recipient  eventually printed the materials but did not reach the targeted households  within the planned time frame. In Sri Lanka, a malaria grant recipient  underestimated the cost of establishing a community center and had to  redesign its program plan to remain within the grant budget. According to  the progress report, the principal recipient established new targets to use  the funds originally budgeted to build the center, delaying grant  implementation. Further, a recipient in Kenya did not conduct 3,000  planned community education skits aimed at preventing HIV during one  disbursement period and attributed the shortfall to a conflict with annual  school examinations. The Global Fund recognized that recipients\u2019 difficulty  in setting targets for the initial grants derived in part from the fact that it  was developing procedures and guidelines at the same time that it was  approving and signing round-1 and round-2 grants.", "Conversely, in some cases, adept planning positively affected grant  performance. In Indonesia, several grant recipients reported that effective  planning for TB treatment allowed various districts to complete work plans  early in the grant, in turn allowing the provinces that oversee those districts  to meet their target of developing budgets on time.

For example, UNDP, a principal recipient in Haiti, was unable to hold a  planned HIV conference because of delays in signing a contract with a  subrecipient. Delays in selecting and reaching contracts with subrecipients  caused the Argentine grant to start slowly, the Global Fund secretariat  reported. In Thailand, the ministry of public health recipient could not  establish TB treatment services because of a subrecipient delay in selecting  a site and contract. Grant recipients and the Global Fund secretariat also  cited procurement delays as reasons for missing quarterly targets. For  example, recipients of malaria grants in Tanzania and Zambia reported that  they did not distribute the targeted number of bed nets due to lengthy  government procurement processes. In addition, during our visit to  Zambia, we found that local spending restrictions also affected recipients\u2019  ability to meet and report on targets. A district health director explained  that spending restrictions delayed her purchase of a new hard drive for her  office\u2019s computer, which slowed the district\u2019s grant activities and reports to the principal recipient. In Kenya, we found that the limited capacity of the  Kenyan health ministry\u2019s procurement agency and the ministry\u2019s reluctance  to contract with outside procurement experts led to delays and, as a result,  to gaps in the supply of HIV test kits, which bilateral donors had to fill. In  Ghana, according to the Global Fund secretariat, the government\u2019s slow,  bureaucratic procurement processes caused delays that contributed to the  grant\u2019s poor performance in reaching people with HIV/AIDS and  opportunistic infections.", "However, the Global Fund secretariat reported that some principal  recipients\u2019 efficient procurement helped them meet their targets. For  example, a principal recipient in Madagascar managed procurement  exceptionally well throughout the grant and, as a result, exceeded its  targets for distributing bed nets.

First, we selected 13 countries that had grants with a first  disbursement on or before December 31, 2003, to allow for at least 1 year of  performance, and that had grants covering more than one principal  recipient. In addition, all but 4 of these countries had grants covering more  than one disease. We reviewed Global Fund dossiers for 38 grants to  recipients in these countries and categorized reasons given for deviation  from performance targets. (Our initial scope included the 45 grants to these  countries, but for 7 of the grants there were no disbursement requests  available during the period of our review.) We found 75 progress  reports/disbursement requests and 51 local fund agent assessments  associated with 24 of the 38 grants. These 38 grants represent 29 percent of  the 130 grants that had received a first disbursement by the end of 2003.", "Starting with the grant\u2019s second disbursement, we included all  disbursement requests from each grant that were available on the Global  Fund Web site as of November, 2005, and a few that we received  subsequently from the Global Fund. We requested full disbursement  dossiers from the Global Fund. These dossiers contained principal  recipients\u2019 progress reports and cash-flow/expenditure data, local fund  agents\u2019 reviews of the recipients\u2019 information and recommendations about  further disbursements, and, in most cases, additional documents such as  correspondence between the Global Fund secretariat and the principal  recipient. Using this information, we coded reasons given for deviation  from grantees\u2019 agreed-upon performance targets into 1 of about 30  categories. We grouped this information into 5 major categories\u2014 resources or capacity; coordination; programmatic problems, needs, or  changes; procurement; and factors beyond recipients\u2019 control. Within these  categories, we developed specific subcategories such as guidance,  decisions or plans not made, done, or available; signing of contracts or  agreements delayed or not done; and limited trained human resources.", "As in any exercise of this type, the categories developed can vary when  produced by different analysts. To address this issue, two GAO analysts  reviewed a sample of the progress reports and independently proposed  categories, separately identifying major factors and then agreeing on a  common set of subcategories. We refined these subcategories during the  coding exercise that followed. We then analyzed the reasons for deviations  from all of the recipients\u2019 progress reports and placed them into one of the  subcategories. When information in the progress reports was insufficient to  determine how to code a reason, we consulted the local fund agents\u2019  reports. We tallied the counts in each subcategory and identified the  subcategories mentioned in the greatest number of grants.", "The information in the disbursement requests varied in detail and quality.  The two analysts, together with a methodologist, therefore discussed and  documented categorization criteria and procedures throughout the  analysis, and the methodologist reviewed the entire analysis as a final step.  As a validity check on our document analysis and to identify frequently  cited factors that affected grant performance, we compared the  information in the subcategories mentioned in the most grants to  information available from our fieldwork (see below) and determined that  both sources of information reported similar findings.", "In addition, we reviewed the 75 progress reports/disbursement requests  associated with these 38 grants and tallied the total number of targets in  each request. We ranked each target using the same numeric rating system the Global Fund uses for phase 2 (see fig. 3). Because many of the total  1,125 targets were nonnumeric (e.g., developing a monitoring and  evaluation plan), we did the following: (1) if the principal recipient clearly  met the target, we ranked the target as met (\u201cmeeting or exceeding  expectations\u201d) and included it with the numeric targets that fell into that  category; (2) if the principal recipient clearly showed no progress toward  meeting the target, we ranked it as not met (\u201cunacceptable\u201d) and included  it with the numeric targets in that category; and (3) if the principal recipient  partially met the target, we gave it a separate ranking\u2014\u201cpartially met  nonnumeric target,\u201d and characterized it as partially met, along with the  partially met numeric targets. To arrive at percentages for the targets in  each category, we first calculated the percentage for each progress  report/disbursement request and then averaged the percentages for the  category from all the reports. Because the number of targets in each report  varied greatly, we averaged the percentages rather than the numbers of  targets to ensure that each report was given equal weight. We excluded  from our calculations those few targets for which the information available  was not adequate to determine whether or to what extent the target was  met.", "Second, we reviewed documents obtained from field visits to four  countries\u2014Indonesia, Kenya, Thailand, and Zambia\u2014and interviewed a  wide variety of government, civil society, and bilateral and multilateral  development officials in these countries involved in grant implementation  or oversight. All four of these countries received more than $36 million in  committed funds for several grants that covered more than one disease,  and three of them (Kenya, Thailand, and Zambia) also have grants that  cover both government and civil society recipients. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the Global Fund, World Health Organization  (WHO), and the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in  Washington, D.C., and Geneva, Switzerland.", "Finally, to determine whether the percentage of funds disbursed for each  grant (after the first disbursement) and the timeliness of the disbursements  were associated with grant characteristics such as type of principal  recipient, grant size, or disease targeted, we analyzed 130 grants with first  disbursements on or before December 31, 2003. (See app. II for a more  detailed discussion of this methodology.) To assess the reliability of the  Global Fund\u2019s data, we (1) posed a set of standard data reliability questions  to knowledgeable agency officials, (2) performed basic electronic  reasonableness tests, and (3) interviewed officials about a few small  anomalies that we found during our analysis. We found only one minor  limitation, namely that disbursement dates were not reported for less than  5 percent of the disbursements.

The Global Fund  also analyzed grant disbursements, reporting in March 2005 that  disbursements are indicative of performance.

Because the  actual effect of time turns out to be nonlinear\u2014meaning that although time  elapsed since the first disbursement has a significant effect on the  percentage disbursed, that effect decreases over time\u2014we estimated the  effect of time directly before estimating differences in the percentage  disbursed across different types of grants.", "We fit bivariate regression models (models 1-4 in table 4) to estimate and  test the significance of the gross effects of time since first disbursement,  principal recipient type, disease type, and grant size (or the effects of each  of these factors, ignoring all others) and a multivariate regression model  (model 5) to estimate the net effects of each (or the effects of each after  controlling for the effects of the others). Table 4 shows these results.", "Model 1 in table 4 shows the effect that time, or days between the first  disbursement and February 2, 2005, has on the percentage of the grant  disbursed. The significant time-squared term indicates that the effect of  time is nonlinear. This nonlinearity makes the interpretation of the time  coefficients somewhat less straightforward, but the positive time  coefficients in table 4 indicate, not surprisingly, that grants that have had  more time to make disbursements have disbursed a larger percentage of  the 2-year grant amount remaining after the first disbursement. The  negative coefficients associated with the squared term means that over  time, time is less of a factor, or that the difference in the percentage  disbursed between 100 days and 200 days is greater than the difference  between 300 and 400 days. The sizable F-statistic at the base of the column  for model 1 attests to the significance of the effect of time, and this  nonlinear effect of time explains 17 percent of the variation in the amount  disbursed of the total remaining after the first disbursement.", "Models 2, 3, and 4 estimate the gross effects of principal recipient type,  disease type, and grant size on the percentages disbursed, after subtracting  the amount of the first disbursement. These differences are estimated using  dummy variables to indicate the differences between the grant categories  named in the table and the omitted referent category (civil society for  principal recipient type, HIV/AIDS for disease type, and less than $2 million  for grant size). The constants for each of these models reflect the  percentages disbursed for grants in the referent categories, and the  coefficients indicate the differences between the percentages for the  categories in the table and the percentages for the referent categories. The  overall percentage disbursed was 21 points lower for ministry of finance  grants, and roughly 15 points lower for ministry of health grants and other  government grants, than for civil society grants. These differences reflect  the results of ignoring, rather than controlling for, differences in time since  first disbursement, grant size, and disease targeted.", "Model 5 estimates all of these effects simultaneously and, as such, provides  us with net effect estimates, or estimates of each effect, controlling for the  others. It shows that the time each grant has had since its first  disbursement is the principal determinant of the amount disbursed. Grants  that made their first disbursement earlier disbursed larger amounts of their  remaining 2-year awards. After these effects were controlled for, the  differences between principal recipient types in the percentages disbursed  became smaller than they appeared before controls; and the only  difference, which had appeared marginally significant before controls,  became insignificant afterward.
