For fiscal years 1991 through 2000, 10 agencies accounted for 90 percent of all temporary limited employees hired governmentwide. During this period, the number of temporary limited employees hired governmentwide declined by 47 percent--from 282,135 in fiscal year 1991 to 150,395 in fiscal year 2000. Most temporary limited employees were full-time hires in white-collar jobs who received some benefits, including annual pay adjustments and premium pay. A survey done at the 10 agencies indicated that seasonal work was the primary reason for using such employees, followed by peak workloads. The office automation clerical and assistance series was the most often reported occupational series for fiscal year 2000. Recent studies suggest that federal agencies and private sector firms use temporary employees for similar reasons--often staffing flexibility. Because temporary limited employees were serving for years under temporary appointments without the benefits afforded other long-term employees, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) revised its regulations in 1994 to ensure that temporary employees were \"used to meet truly short-term needs.\" The revised regulations created a two-year limit for individual temporary appointments in both the competitive and excepted service. OPM officials said that the Office of Merit Systems Oversight and Effectiveness, when assessing agencies' compliance with personnel laws and regulations, routinely included some individual temporary appointments in its periodic oversight reviews, but generally did not look at the work history of temporary limited employees in those appointments. OPM data show that many temporary limited employees hired in fiscal year 2000 had worked for the federal government for at least five years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request for information on federal civilian  temporary employees.

However, in the early 1990s, there were concerns that agencies were  retaining employees in an ongoing series of temporary appointments for  long periods (8 to 10 years) without benefits or tenure, making  nonpermanent employment quasipermanent for many. In fact, in 1993 a  temporary employee who had worked in an ongoing series of temporary  appointments for 8 years died after suffering a fatal heart attack and his  survivors were not entitled to a pension or government-subsidized health  or life insurance benefits.  In 1994, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) revised its regulations governing the use of temporary appointments  to ensure that temporary employees were used by agencies to meet truly  short-term needs and were not serving for years without many of the  benefits afforded other long-term employees.", "In the competitive service, temporary employees are referred to as  temporary limited employees.  Generally, the appointments of these  employees cannot exceed 1 year but can be extended for an additional year  (for a total of 24 months).

In addition, we agreed to identify steps OPM has taken to  ensure the appropriate use of temporary limited employees and to  determine whether long-term use of temporary limited employees still  exists.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed temporary limited employee data  from OPM\u2019s Central Personal Data File (CPDF) over a 10-year period\u2014 fiscal years 1991 through 2000; sent a questionnaire to the 10 agencies that  were the predominant users of temporary limited employees (see app. I);  reviewed studies on temporary employment, including studies by OPM, the  Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and the Congressional Research  Service (CRS); and interviewed agency officials.

Temporary employees can work on a full-time, part- time, seasonal, or intermittent basis.  Federal employers are prohibited  from using temporary employees to avoid the costs of employee benefits or  ceilings on permanent employment levels.  Federal employers also cannot  use temporary employment as a \u201ctryout\u201d or trial period prior to permanent  employment.  In addition, federal employers cannot circumvent the  competitive examining process by appointing an individual on a temporary  basis when that individual is not among the list of qualified applicants  certified for permanent appointment.  Finally, under OPM regulations,  federal employers generally cannot use a temporary appointment to refill  positions that were previously filled with such an appointment for an  aggregate of 24 months over the preceding 3 years.", "OPM states that although agencies have the basic authority to make  temporary limited appointments, agencies must document the reason for  each such appointment in an employee\u2019s official personnel folder.   Agencies can use the appointing authority to: (1) fill a short-term position  that is not expected to last longer than 1 year; (2) meet an employment  need that is scheduled to be terminated within 24 months for such reasons  as abolition, reorganization, contracting of the function, anticipated  reduction in funding, or completion of a specific project or peak workload;  or (3) fill positions temporarily when the positions are expected to be  needed for the eventual placement of permanent employees who would  otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization.", "Various changes in regulation have been made over the years restricting the  length of service of temporary limited employees.  Beginning in 1938,  temporary employees generally could not continue past 30 days unless  OPM\u2019s predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, approved the extension.   In 1960, the time a temporary appointment could remain in effect was  extended, so that appointments could be made for as long as 1 year.  In  1984, OPM increased the length of time an appointment could remain in  effect, so that agencies could extend a temporary employee\u2019s service for a  total of 4 years from the date of initial appointment without OPM\u2019s  approval.  In response to this change in policy, MSPB reported in 1987 that  although the expanded authority was a positive addition to the  management tools available to federal managers, such flexibility could lead  to poor management practices that result in continuing staffing needs being  met with temporary employees because they were easier to hire  administratively.", "Beginning in 1991, several hearings were held before subcommittees of the  House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service to receive complaints of  temporary employees.  The hearings confirmed that federal agencies were  retaining employees in an ongoing series of temporary appointments for  long periods (8 to 10 years) without benefits or tenure.  In a tragic example,  a National Park Service employee, James A. Hudson, who had worked in an  ongoing series of temporary limited appointments for 8 years, died on July  5, 1993, after suffering a fatal heart attack after working three shifts over a  2-day period during the July 4 weekend.  Mr. Hudson, who was a decorated  Vietnam War veteran, was a full-time temporary worker whose survivors  were not entitled to a pension or government-subsidized health or life  insurance benefits.  In response to his death, the Congress, as part of the  Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of  1994, gave Mr. Hudson\u2019s widow a lump-sum payment of $38,400, the  amount his family would have received as life insurance benefits had he  been a permanent federal employee.", "In 1994, responding to these hearings and information from other sources,  OPM revised its regulations governing agencies\u2019 use of temporary  appointments by reducing the time limit from a maximum of 4 years to 2  years and made the requirements uniform for temporary appointments in  both the competitive and excepted services.

Differences between the sectors include reasons  that are acceptable uses of temporary employees in the private sector (e.g.,  to screen/recruit for filling permanent positions and to save on wage and  benefit costs) but not allowed under the regulations governing temporary  employees in the federal government.

For  example, a 1992 OPM study reported that many nonpermanent seasonal  employees in the land management agencies were \u201cmaking a career\u201d out of  temporary work.

Positions involving seasonal work (i.e., work that  involves annual recurring periods of less than 6 months) or intermittent  work (i.e., work that involves sporadic or irregular intervals) are  exceptions to such limits and restrictions.

The official stated that OPM  monitors agencies\u2019 compliance with temporary limited employment during  the evaluation visits conducted by OMSOE, which assesses agencies\u2019  effectiveness in ensuring compliance with personnel laws and regulations.   According to OMSOE, each of the departmental agencies and independent  agencies with larger numbers of employees is subject to review every 4  years, and each of the smaller independent agencies is reviewed every 5  years.", "An OPM official said that OMSOE routinely includes some individual  temporary appointments in its periodic oversight reviews but generally  does not look at the work history of temporary limited employees serving  in those appointments.  The officials said that unless OMSOE knew in  advance or saw a problem based on prior audit reports or other sources, it  would not focus on temporary limited employees.  Because of the typically  limited nature of its reviews of temporary limited appointments, OMSOE\u2019s  reviews of agencies are unlikely to uncover instances of long-term  temporary limited employment.  In reviewing authorities used by an  agency, OMSOE follows a standard audit procedure of selecting a  judgmental sample of appointments for review.  OMSOE uses a \u201cproblem  oriented\u201d sampling to select appointments.  That means that if OMSOE  officials have identified problems with a specific type of appointment  through such sources as employee complaints and periodic employee  attitude surveys, the audit team will include some of those appointments in  the sample of appointments it reviews.  If temporary limited appointments  were suspected of being a problem area, the review might involve more  work in this area.  For example, because of an indication of possible  inappropriate use of the appointing authority for temporary limited  employees at the Department of the Interior, OMSOE did an assessment of  seasonal employment at the National Park Service.  In 1998, after  completing its review, OMSOE reported that a number of parks in the  Department of the Interior\u2019s National Park Service with seasons lasting  longer than 6 months were improperly filling seasonal positions with  temporary limited appointments.

In its  regulations, OPM recognizes circumstances when agencies may require the  service of temporary limited employees beyond the allowed 2 years.  To  extend a temporary limited appointment in the same position beyond the  maximum of 2 years, agency officials must request and obtain approval  from OPM.  According to OPM, in fiscal year 1998, it approved 110 requests  covering 332 employees; in fiscal year 1999, 165 requests covering 426  employees; and in fiscal year 2000, 180 requests covering 418 employees.", "Moreover, temporary limited employees can serve for continuous years  under different temporary appointments or in the same appointment  without an extension from OPM.  If it involves a break in service of 3 days  or less, an agency can reappoint or convert a temporary limited employee  from one temporary appointment to another temporary appointment many  times over a period of years and not conflict with OPM\u2019s regulations.  In  addition, after 3 days have elapsed after a temporary appointment ends, an  agency can rehire the employee using a new temporary limited  appointment as long as it does not involve the same basic duties, the same  major subdivision of the agency, and the same local commuting area as the  original appointment.  However, the CPDF does not contain the necessary  information to identify whether new temporary appointments were  formerly temporary limited employees.", "As shown in table 3, CPDF data show that from fiscal years 1991 through  2000, between 30 and 46 percent of the temporary limited employees hired  annually governmentwide were conversions within an agency.", "According to an OPM official, there is no limit on the number of times that  an agency can convert a temporary limited employee to another temporary  limited appointment within the same agency as long as two conditions are  met.  First, conversions to competitive temporary appointments must be  accomplished using a competitive selection method or must be based on  noncompetitive eligibility.  Second, the regulatory provisions limiting  appointments to successor positions must be met.", "Finally, agencies can also exceed the general time limits of some temporary  limited employees.  Under OPM regulations, an agency can appoint and  extend an employee in a seasonal or intermittent temporary limited  position without regard to the 2-year general time limit as long as the time  the employee worked annually was less than 6 months, or 1,040 hours.  It is  also permissible for different subunits of an agency to hire the same person  for more than one seasonal appointment lasting for up to 6 months.  Thus, a  seasonal temporary limited employee could work full time for two subunits  in an agency under two different 6-month temporary limited appointments  in the same year.  CPDF data show that from fiscal years 1991 through 2000,  between 25 and 36 percent of temporary limited employees hired had a  seasonal or intermittent work schedule.", "These scenarios could, as OPM reported in 1992, result in nonpermanent  employment\u2014which is intended for short-term staffing needs\u2014becoming  quasipermanent.  In that report, OPM focused on seasonal temporary  employment at land management agencies and stated that many  nonpermanent employees were making a career out of temporary work in  these agencies.  OPM reported that thousands of park rangers on  temporary seasonal appointments work the summer season in one park  and the winter season in another, working virtually full time on temporary  appointments.  An OPM official said that OPM\u2019s oversight policy is to look  at each park as a separate employer.  This would permit such situations to  continue today.", "In addition, OPM reported that more than 20 percent of the temporary  workforce at land management agencies had held 10 or more temporary  appointments or extensions to existing appointments.  According to a  September 1994 MSPB report, retaining temporary employees for extended  periods (8 or 10 years or more) through the use of temporary appointments  is directly contrary to the explicit intent of the temporary employment  authority and denies employees involved many of the benefits available to  other long-term employees.", "We analyzed CPDF data to estimate the extent to which individuals may be  spending long periods in federal service as temporary limited employees  without many of the benefits afforded other long-term employees.  Our  analysis showed that of the temporary limited employees hired in fiscal  year 2000, 78 percent had federal service of 2 years or less.  However, CPDF  data also showed about 16,000, or about 11 percent, had 5 or more years of  federal service.  Table 4 shows a breakdown by type of temporary limited  employee.", "The information in table 4, however, is imprecise because of limitations in  the data available in the CPDF, specifically in service computation dates.  A  service computation date allows OPM and agencies to track an employee\u2019s  creditable years of federal service (civilian and military) toward retirement  and other benefits.  For each federal employee, this date is adjusted with  every transfer, separation, or reinstatement experience over the course of  the employee\u2019s career.  The purpose of having a service computation date is  so that at any point in time there is a reasonably accurate measure of an  employee\u2019s length of service.  The service computation date includes  permanent federal employment as well as temporary service without  regard to when such service was performed.  For example, a current  temporary limited employee\u2019s service computation date indicating 10 years  of service could include years of prior military service, permanent federal  civilian service, and temporary limited employment over an extended  period with substantial gaps between appointments.  Although CPDF data  are the best available information and show that some temporary limited  employees had been working for long periods in federal service, it is not  possible to determine how many temporary limited employees actually  worked for continuous extended periods in temporary limited  appointments.", "Most of the 16,232 temporary limited employees hired in fiscal year 2000  who had 5 or more years in federal service were hired under seasonal  appointments.  As mentioned earlier, as long as employees hired under  seasonal appointments work less than 1,040 hours per appointment, OPM\u2019s  regulations allow agencies to hire and extend such employees for years.   Because agencies reported to us that they were monitoring only individual  appointments, they would not necessarily know whether seasonal or other  temporary limited employees might have been working for 5 or more years.   They also might not know whether employees serving in seasonal  appointments could have been hired for more than one seasonal  appointment in any given year.  As was the case with the park ranger  example cited earlier, such employees could be working on two separate 6- month seasonal appointments\u2014virtually full time on temporary  appointments\u2014without an agency or OPM being aware of it and without  many of the benefits afforded other long-term employees.", "According to officials from OPM and the 10 agencies that we identified as  the predominant users of temporary limited employees, neither OPM nor  the agencies monitor the total length of service for temporary limited  employees.

However, the regulations do not  preclude agencies from hiring temporary limited employees to work in a  series of extensions, reappointments, and appointments.  Thus, there  seems to be an inconsistency between OPM\u2019s stated intent and what is  permissible under the provisions of its regulations.

However, the limitations of these data combined with the fact that neither  OPM nor agencies monitor the total years of temporary employment by  temporary limited employees raise a concern that temporary limited  employees could be serving for many years under a series of appointments.   In addition, OMSOE reviews of agencies are unlikely to uncover incidents  of long-term temporary limited employment because they typically look  only at individual appointments but not the work history of temporary  limited employees serving in those appointments.", "The CPDF data available to OPM and agencies for determining the time  federal employees spend in federal service include all federal service, both  temporary and permanent federal employment, without regard to the total  length of time over which such service was performed. Neither OPM nor  agencies collect the necessary information that would identify whether, in  fact, temporary limited employees were working continuously for years.   There is no way to tell from the CPDF whether employees might be serving  in temporary limited appointments for continuous extended periods or  how many may be receiving benefits, for example, as a result of retiring  from prior federal service.  Identifying the total length of continuous  service of temporary limited employees would require doing a  \u201clongitudinal,\u201d or historical study tracing the service of individual  employees back in time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the director of OPM direct OMSOE to conduct a study  to identify the number of temporary limited employees who have been  working for continuous extended periods in temporary limited  appointments and the reasons and conditions that permitted such cases to  occur.

Therefore, we revised  the draft report to recommend that the director of OPM direct the agency  to conduct a study to identify the number of temporary limited employees  who have been working for continuous extended periods in temporary  limited appointments and the reasons and conditions that permitted such  cases to occur.  We also recommended that the director require OMSOE to  include a sample of temporary limited employees and their work histories  as part of its periodic oversight reviews of agencies.

Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes asked us to gather  information on federal civilian temporary employees, specifically  temporary limited employees.  Our objectives were to (1) identify the  federal agencies that are the predominant users of temporary limited  employees and the job characteristics of such employees (including work  schedules, occupations, grade levels, and benefits); (2) discuss the primary  reasons agencies give for using temporary limited employees; and  (3) compare the federal government\u2019s use of temporary limited employees  with that of the private sector.  In addition, we agreed to identify steps OPM  has taken to ensure the appropriate use of temporary limited employees  and whether long-term use of temporary limited employees still exists.", "To identify the federal agencies that are the predominant users of  temporary limited employees and the job characteristics of such  employees, OPM initially provided us with summary data listing temporary  limited employment by agency on a quarterly basis from March 1999  through March 2000.  On the basis of OPM\u2019s list, we identified agencies as  predominant users of temporary limited employees if they had 1,000 or  more temporary limited employees on-board as of March 30, 2000.  Ten  agencies met our criterion for being predominant users: the departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, HHS, the Interior, Justice, State, the  Treasury, and VA and FEMA.  These 10 agencies accounted for 94 percent  of the executive branch\u2019s temporary limited workforce on-board as of  March 30, 2000, according to data provided by an OPM official.", "We then reviewed temporary limited employment data contained in OPM\u2019s  CPDF, a database that contains personnel data for most of the executive  branch agencies, including all of the cabinet departments, independent  agencies, commissions, and councils.  To analyze CPDF data, we used an  approach that an OPM official said would extract data from the CPDF on  temporary limited employees.  During our analysis, we found that OPM\u2019s  approach extracted data on other types of temporary employees (who can  be appointed for more than 1 year and are entitled to the same benefits as  permanent employees) as well as temporary limited employees.  The OPM  official later confirmed that OPM\u2019s approach captured other types of  temporary employees.", "Because OPM\u2019s approach captured more than just temporary limited  employee data, we had to use another approach and criteria to select data  from the CPDF on competitive service temporary limited employees and  excepted service employees who meet the temporary limited criteria.  As  there is no code in the CPDF to identify which current federal employees  are temporary limited employees, we reviewed temporary limited  appointments and conversions, which are identifiable.  For the competitive  service, we reviewed the nature of action codes (NOAC) and legal  authorities for temporary limited appointments defined in OPM\u2019s Guide to  Processing Personnel Actions and were able to clearly identify the  applicable NOACs and legal authorities for these employees.  We checked  these codes and authorities in our later discussions with OPM and agency  officials and agencies\u2019 responses to our questionnaires.  For the excepted  service employees who met the temporary limited criteria, we identified  the most likely NOACs and legal authorities from information we obtained  from (1) our contacts with OPM and agency officials and (2) agency  responses to our questionnaire in which we asked the agencies to provide  us with NOACs and legal authorities for excepted service temporary  limited employees for fiscal year 2000.  We did not verify the reliability of  the nature of action and legal authority data in the CPDF used to identify  temporary limited employees.", "For the excepted service, we used NOACs and legal authorities reported to  us in the questionnaires except where they appeared to be in error.  This  occurred in a very few instances.  We also reviewed OPM\u2019s Guide to  Processing Personnel Actions to identify any additional NOACs or legal  authorities to include.  We identified no other NOACs.  We included only  those legal authorities with not-to-exceed (NTE) dates, and we excluded  those legal authorities where we could not determine if they were for  permanent or temporary appointments and the authorities were not listed  in the questionnaire responses.", "We analyzed the temporary limited employment data contained in the  CPDF from fiscal year 1991 through 2000, and included those employees  hired throughout the year.  We defined hires to include appointments (i.e.,  when the person is not already an employee of an agency) and conversions  (i.e., appointments when a person is employed by an agency in a different  position or under a different hiring authority).  We did not analyze  employees on-board as of a specific date (e.g., September 30) because such  employees may work for short periods of time, and the end of the fiscal  year would only capture a moment in time, according to agency human  resources officials we interviewed.", "To identify the job characteristics of temporary limited employees  governmentwide, we reviewed data available in the CPDF on work  schedules and grade levels for fiscal years 1991 through 2000 and  occupations for fiscal year 2000.  To identify the benefits available to these  employees, we interviewed OPM officials and reviewed studies from OPM  and MSPB and applicable laws and regulations.", "To identify the primary reasons agencies give for using temporary limited  employees, we designed and pretested with 2 agencies a questionnaire that  we later sent to the 10 agencies that we identified as being the predominant  users of such employees based on data provided by an OPM official.  (See  app. I for a copy of the questionnaire.)  In designing the questionnaire, we  discussed the questionnaire contents with OPM officials and reviewed  reports and studies on temporary employees in the federal government.", "For 7 of the 10 agencies, we asked their five components that were the  largest users of temporary limited employees to respond to the  questionnaire.  For the remaining three agencies, including the four  components of Defense, the questionnaire responses covered the entire  agency.  Table 5 lists the 41 agencies and components to which we sent the  questionnaire.  During the pretests, agency human resource officials told us  that they could not provide the information we were requesting on an  agencywide basis.  We identified the components that were the largest  users of temporary limited employees based on information provided by  OPM officials and CPDF data as of September 30, 1999.  We received  completed questionnaires from all 41 agencies and components.", "The information in this review applies only to those agencies and agency  components to which we sent questionnaires.  For three agencies, the  departments of Defense and State and FEMA, the information applies to  the entire agency.  For seven agencies, their five components comprised 73  to 98 percent of total temporary limited employees hired in fiscal year 2000.   We used this information to represent the 10 agencies surveyed, but the  information cannot be projected to these 7 agencies or governmentwide.   We did not report on the reasons for increases, decreases, or fluctuations in  temporary limited employees hired from fiscal years 1995 through 2000  because the reasons were so varied that an analysis would not be  meaningful.  Only one agency and one agency component reported having  additional agency-specific instructions for their excepted service  temporary limited employees.  We did not verify the accuracy of the data  provided by the agencies.", "To compare the federal government\u2019s use of temporary limited employees  with that of the private sector, we conducted a literature search to identify  studies on federal and private sector uses of temporary employees. To  ensure that we identified all relevant studies, we also contacted OPM,  MSPB, and CRS officials, because their agencies had previously conducted  studies concerning temporary limited employees.  We analyzed the reasons  cited in the studies as to why employers use temporary employees and  compared similarities and differences for both sectors.", "To identify steps OPM has taken to ensure the appropriate use of  temporary limited employees, we analyzed CPDF data, reviewed OPM and  MSPB studies on temporary employment, interviewed OPM officials, and  reviewed current and prior OPM regulations and guidance on temporary  employees.  We also asked the 10 agencies that we identified as being  predominant users of temporary limited employees about the steps they  were taking to ensure the appropriate use of such employees.  For 8 of the  10 agencies, we asked the component that was the largest user of  temporary limited employees in fiscal year 2000 to respond to our inquiries.   The eight agencies\u2019 components were the Forest Service, Bureau of  Census, Defense components other than the military services, National  Institutes of Health, National Park Service, Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys, Internal Revenue Service, and Veterans Health Administration.   The two agencies were the Department of State and FEMA.  All responded  to our inquiries.", "To identify whether long-term use of temporary limited employees still  exists, we first had to determine how many employees appointed to  temporary limited positions had more than 2 years of prior creditable  service; to do so, we used the service computation dates in the CPDF.  We  subtracted military service from the total creditable service.  Because  creditable civilian service includes all prior civilian federal service,  including any permanent federal employment, and because there may be  gaps between federal service, creditable service as reflected in the service  computation date for temporary limited employees cannot be used by itself  to identify continuous years of service under a series of appointments.", "We did our work in Washington, D.C., from October 2000 through February  2002, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Richard W.
