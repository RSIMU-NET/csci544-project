The data in this report present an order-of-magnitude estimate of the annual expenditure required to operate the Northeast Corridor\u2019s infrastructure in a state of good repair, rather than an exact accounting. Each railroad provided us with data based on its own fiscal year, some of which begin in June, October, and January.

Therefore, Amtrak allocated these expenditures evenly over the route-miles of the corridor that it owns. Because the corridor is not in a state of good repair and a repair backlog exists, actual expenditures could understate the true requirement to operate and maintain the corridor in a state of good repair. Therefore, we used Amtrak\u2019s estimate of the expenditures required over the next 15 years to bring the corridor to a state of good repair. We added this estimate to the actual average annual expenditure of all users of the corridor to arrive at the total annual expenditure to operate and maintain the corridor in a state of good repair while continuing capital improvements at their historical rate.", "Amtrak and at least one commuter railroad commingle their revenues with operating subsidies before allocating these funds to various expenditures.

The issue of equity is outside the scope of this report. 2(a). Because equity of each railroad\u2019s contribution is outside the scope of this report, we did not list each railroad\u2019s specific contribution. We stated Metro-North\u2019s expenditures for operations and maintenance because of the corridor\u2019s 12 users (Amtrak, eight commuter railroads, and three freight railroads); the combined Metro-North and Amtrak expenditures provided for 72 percent of the total expenditures for operations and maintenance. 2(b). We did not attempt to determine which portion of improvements was for maintaining the basic railroad and which was for upgrades. We have clearly stated that the expenditures include those for upgrades as well as for regular maintenance. 2(c). Amtrak told us that a major portion of its data, which were organized by corridor segment, was available only through 1993. We requested expenditure data for a 6-year period prior to 1993 to account for variations in annual spending on the corridor. 2(d). We did not independently verify the number of trains operating on the corridor. We attributed this statement, which was made by the Corporation\u2019s President in testimony before the Congress, to Amtrak. 3(a). Our objective was to determine the funding required to operate the corridor in a state of good repair. Past expenditures did not keep pace with repair needs. Therefore, we added Amtrak\u2019s state-of-good-repair estimate to the average annual expenditure of all corridor users from 1988 through 1993.

Officials responded that, with the exception of tunnel upgrades, there were no unmet needs. We have clarified this point in the text of our report. 3(b). We have included a statement that Amtrak\u2019s state of good repair estimate includes the estimated cost of electrification replacement between Washington, D.C., and New Rochelle, New York, and the needed tunnel upgrades. 4(a). We have modified figure 1 and the accompanying note to more clearly show Amtrak\u2019s and commuter railroads\u2019 operations and associated mileage. 4(b). We have corrected the reference to Conrail\u2019s access fee payments. 4(c). The point of the paragraph is to show that commuter railroads carry far more passengers on the corridor than does Amtrak. The discussion shows that two commuter railroads\u2014NJT and Metro-North\u2014each carry more passengers over their respective segments than Amtrak carries over the entire corridor. 4(d). We did not collect data on train-hours, car-miles, or other data needed to allocate costs for a joint-use facility such as the Northeast Corridor because the issue of equity of expenditures versus usage is beyond our scope. 4(e).
