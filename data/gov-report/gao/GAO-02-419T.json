Superior's external auditor, Ernst & Young, also failed to detect the improper valuation of Superior's retained interest until the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and FDIC insisted that the issue be reviewed by the auditor's national office. Federal regulators did not identify and act on the bank's problems early enough to prevent a loss to the deposit insurance fund.

From 1988 to 1992, Superior Bank struggled financially  and relied heavily on an assistance agreement from the Federal Savings  and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Superior\u2019s activities were  limited during the first few years of its operation, but by 1992, most of the  bank\u2019s problems were resolved and the effects of the FSLIC agreement  had diminished.  OTS, the primary regulator of federally chartered savings  institutions, had the lead responsibility for supervising Superior Bank  while FDIC, with responsibility to protect the deposit insurance fund,  acted as Superior\u2019s backup regulator.  By 1993, both OTS and FDIC had  given Superior a composite CAMEL  \u201c2\u201d rating and, at this time, FDIC  began to rely only on off-site monitoring of superior.", "In  1993, Superior\u2019s management began to focus on expanding the bank\u2019s  mortgage lending business by acquiring Alliance Funding Company.  Superior adopted Alliance\u2019s business strategy of targeting borrowers  nationwide with risky credit profiles, such as high debt ratios and credit  histories that included past delinquencies\u2014a practice known as subprime  lending.  In a process known as securitization, Superior then assembled  the loans into pools and sold interest in these pools\u2014such as rights to  principal and/or interest payments\u2014through a trust to investors, primarily  in the form of AAA-rated mortgage securities.  To enhance the value of  these offerings, Superior retained the securities with the greatest amount  of risk and provided other significant credit enhancements for the less  risky securities.  In 1995, Superior expanded its activities to include the  origination and securitization of subprime automobile loans.", "In December 1998, FDIC first raised concerns about Superior\u2019s increasing  levels of high-risk, subprime assets and growth in retained or residual  interests.  However, it was not until January 2000 that OTS and FDIC  conducted a joint exam and downgraded Superior\u2019s CAMELS rating to a  \u201c4,\u201d primarily attributed to the concentration of residual interest holdings.  At the end of 2000, FDIC and OTS noted that the reported values of  Superior\u2019s residual interest assets were overstated and that the bank\u2019s  reporting of its residual interest assets was not in compliance with the  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 125.  Prompted by  concerns from OTS and FDIC, Superior eventually made a number of  adjustments to its financial statements.  In mid-February 2001, OTS issued  a Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) notice to Superior because the bank  was significantly undercapitalized.  On May 24, OTS approved Superior\u2019s  PCA capital plan. Ultimately, the plan was never implemented, and OTS  closed the bank and appointed FDIC as Superior\u2019s receiver on July 27,  2001.

Superior\u2019s business strategy of originating and  securitizing subprime loans appeared to have led to high earnings, but  more importantly its strategy resulted in a high concentration of extremely  risky assets.  This high concentration of risky assets and the improper  valuation of these assets ultimately led to Superior\u2019s failure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concentration of Risky Assets", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, Superior Bank began to originate and securitize subprime home  mortgages in large volumes.  Later, Superior expanded its securitization  activities to include subprime automobile loans.  Although the  securitization process moved the subprime loans off its balance sheet,  Superior retained the riskier interests in the proceeds from the pools of  securities it established.  Superior\u2019s holdings of this retained interest  exceeded its capital levels going as far back as 1995.", "Retained or residual interests are common in asset securitizations and  often represent steps that the loan originator takes to enhance the quality  of the interests in the pools that are offered for sale.  Such enhancements  can be critical to obtaining high credit ratings for the pool\u2019s securities.  Often, the originator will retain the riskiest components of the pool, doing  so to make the other components easier to sell.  The originator\u2019s residual  interests, in general, will represent the rights to cash flows or other assets  after the pool\u2019s obligations to other investors have been satisfied.", "Overcollateralization assets are another type of residual interest that  Superior held.  To decrease risk to investors, the originator may  overcollateralize the securitization trust that holds the assets and is  responsible for paying the investors.  An originator can overcollateralize  by selling the rights to $100 in principal payments, for instance, while  putting assets worth $105 into the trust, essentially providing a cushion, or  credit enhancement, to help ensure that the $100 due investors is paid in  event of defaults in the underlying pool of loans (credit losses). The  originator would receive any payments in excess of the $100 interest that  was sold to investors after credit losses are paid from the  overcollateralized portion.", "As shown in figure 1, Superior\u2019s residual interests represented  approximately 100 percent of tier 1 capital on June 30, 1995. By June 30,  2000, residual interest represented 348 percent of tier 1 capital.  This level  of concentration was particularly risky given the complexities associated  with achieving a reasonable valuation of residual interests.", "Superior\u2019s practice of targeting subprime borrowers increased its risk. By  targeting borrowers with low credit quality, Superior was able to originate  loans with interest rates that were higher than market averages. The high  interest rates reflected, at least in part, the relatively high credit risk  associated with these loans.  When these loans were then pooled and  securitized, their high interest rates relative to the interest rates paid on  the resulting securities, together with the high valuation of the retained  interest, enabled Superior to record gains on the securitization  transactions that drove its apparently high earnings and high capital.  A  significant amount of Superior\u2019s revenue was from the sale of loans in  these transactions, yet more cash was going out rather than coming in  from these activities.", "In addition to the higher risk of default related to subprime lending, there  was also prepayment risk.  Generally, if interest rates decline, a loan  charging an interest rate that is higher than market averages becomes  more valuable to the lender. However, lower interest rates could also  trigger higher than predicted levels of loan prepayment\u2014particularly if the  new lower interest rates enable subprime borrowers to qualify for  refinancing at lower rates.  Higher-than-projected prepayments negatively  impact the future flows of interest payments from the underlying loans in a  securitized portfolio.", "Additionally, Superior expanded its loan origination and securitization  activities to include automobile loans. The credit risk of automobile loans  is inherently higher than that associated with home mortgages, because  these loans are associated with even higher default and loss rates.  Auto  loan underwriting is divided into classes of credit quality (most commonly  A, B, and C).  Some 85 percent of Superior Bank\u2019s auto loans went to  people with B and C ratings.  In Superior\u2019s classification system, these  borrowers had experienced credit problems in the past because of unusual  circumstances beyond their control (such as a major illness, job loss, or  death in the family) but had since resolved their credit problems and  rebuilt their credit ratings to a certain extent.  As with its mortgage  securitizations, Superior Bank was able to maintain a high spread between  the interest rate of the auto loans and the yield that investors paid for the  securities based on the pooled loans.  However, Superior\u2019s loss rates on its  automobile loans as of December 31, 1999 were twice as high as Superior\u2019s  management had anticipated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Valuation of Residual Interests", "paragraphs": ["Superior Bank\u2019s business strategy rested heavily on the value assigned to  the residual interests that resulted from its securitization activities.  However, the valuation of residual interests is extremely complex and  highly dependent on making accurate assumptions regarding a number of  factors.  Superior overvalued its residual interests because it did not  discount to present value the future cash flows that were subject to credit  losses.  When these valuations were ultimately adjusted, at the behest of  the regulators, the bank became significantly undercapitalized and  eventually failed.", "There are significant valuation issues and risks associated with residual  interests.  Generally, the residual interest represents the cash flows from  the underlying mortgages that remain after all payments have been made  to the other classes of securities issued by the trust for the pool, and after  the fees and expenses have been paid. As the loan originator, Superior  Bank was considered to be in the \u201cfirst-loss\u201d position (i.e., Superior would  suffer any credit losses suffered by the pool, before any other investor.)  Credit losses are not the only risks held by the residual interest holder.  The valuation of the residual interest depends critically on how accurately  future interest rates and loan prepayments are forecasted.  Market events  can affect the discount rate, prepayment speed, or performance of the  underlying assets in a securitization transaction and can swiftly and  dramatically alter their value.", "The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recognized the need  for a new accounting approach to address innovations and complex  developments in the financial markets, such as the securitization of loans.  Under FAS No. 125, \u201cAccounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,\u201d which became effective after  December 31, 1996, when a transferor surrenders control over transferred  assets, it should be accounted for as a sale.  The transferor should  recognize that any retained interest in the transferred assets should be  reported in its statement of financial position based on the fair value.  The  best evidence of fair value is a quoted market price in an active market,  but if there is no market price, the value must be estimated. In estimating  the fair value of retained interests, valuation techniques include estimating  the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate  commensurate with the risks involved.  The standard states that those  techniques shall incorporate assumptions that market participants would  use in their estimates of values, future revenues, and future expenses,  including assumptions about interest rates, default, prepayment, and  volatility.  In 1999, FASB explained that when estimating the fair value for  retained interests used as a credit enhancement, it should be discounted  from the date when it is estimated to become available to the transferor.", "Superior Bank did not properly value the residual interest assets it  reported on its financial statements.  Since those assets represented  payments that were to be received in the future only after credit losses  were reimbursed, they needed to be discounted at an appropriate risk- adjusted rate, in order to recognize that a promise to pay in the future is  worth less than a current payment.  Superior did not use discounting  when valuing its residual interest related to overcollateralization.  However, as a credit enhancement, the overcollateralized asset is  restricted in use under the trust and not available to Superior until losses  have been paid under the terms of the credit enhancement.  The result was  that Superior Bank reported assets, earnings, and capital that were far in  excess of their true values.  In addition, there were other issues with  respect to Superior\u2019s compliance with FAS No. 125.  When Superior finally  applied the appropriate valuation techniques and related accounting to the  residual interests in early 2001, at the urging of OTS, Superior was forced  to take a write-off against its capital and became \u201csignificantly  undercapitalized.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators\u2019 Concerns About the Quality of the External Audit", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulators now have serious concerns about the quality of Ernst &  Young\u2019s audit of Superior Bank\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year  ending June 30, 2000.

The regulators  believed the incorrect valuation of the residuals had resulted in a  significant overstatement of Superior\u2019s assets and capital.  Although Ernst  & Young\u2019s local office disagreed with the regulators findings, Ernst &  Young\u2019s national office concurred with the regulators.

These high earnings were also  indicators of the riskiness of the underlying assets and business strategy.  Moreover, Superior had a higher concentration of residual interest assets  than any other thrift under OTS\u2019s supervision.

However, OTS\u2019s  examination reports during this period reflected an optimistic  understanding of the implications for Superior Bank.  The examination  reports consistently noted that the risks associated with such lending and  related residual interest securities were balanced by Superior\u2019s strong  earnings, higher-than-peer leverage capital, and substantial reserves for  loan losses.

As an  illustration of OTS reliance on Superior\u2019s management assurances, OTS  examiners brought to management\u2019s attention in the 1997 and 1999  examinations that underlying mortgage pools had prepayment rates  exceeding those used in the revaluation.

However, many of the deficiencies remained uncorrected even after  repeated examinations.  For example, OTS expressed concerns in its 1994  and 1995 examinations about the improper inclusion of reserves for the  residual interest assets in the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.  This  practice had the net effect of overstating the institution\u2019s total capital  ratio.  OTS apparently relied on management\u2019s assurances that they would  take the appropriate corrective action, because this issue was not  discussed in OTS\u2019s 1996, 1997, or 1999 examination reports.  However,  OTS discovered in its 2000 examination that Superior Bank had not taken  the agreed-upon corrective action, but in fact had continued the practice.

In the 1997 examination, OTS found that not all classified  assets were reported in the TFR and obtained management\u2019s agreement to  ensure the accuracy of subsequent reports.  In the 1999 examination,  however, OTS found that $43.7 million in troubled assets had been shown  as repossessions on the most recent TFR, although a significant portion of  these assets were accorded a \u201closs\u201d classification in internal reports.  As a  result, actual repossessions were only $8.4 million.

However, this reliance  should be predicated on the examiners\u2019 obtaining reasonable assurance  that the audits have been performed in a quality manner and in accordance  with professional standards.  OTS\u2019s Regulatory Handbook recognizes the  limitations of examiners\u2019 reliance on external auditors, noting that  examiners \u201cmay\u201d rely on an external auditor\u2019s findings in low-risk areas.  However, examiners are expected to conduct more in-depth reviews of the  external auditor\u2019s work in high-risk areas.  The handbook also suggests  that a review of the auditor\u2019s workpapers documenting the assumptions  and methodologies used by the institution to value key assets could assist  examiners in performing their examinations.", "In the case of Superior Bank, the external auditor, Ernst & Young, one of  the \u201cBig Five\u201d accounting firms, provided unqualified opinions on the  bank\u2019s financial statements for years.  In a January 2000 meeting with  Superior Bank\u2019s Audit Committee to report the audit results for the fiscal  year ending June 30, 1999, Ernst & Young noted that \u201cafter running their  own model to test the Bank\u2019s model, Ernst & Young believes that the  overall book values of financial receivables as recorded by the Bank are  reasonable considering the Bank\u2019s overall conservative assumptions and  methods.\u201d Not only did Ernst & Young not detect the overvaluation of  Superior\u2019s residual interests, the firm explicitly supported an incorrect  valuation until, at the insistence of the regulators, the Ernst &Young office  that had conducted the audit sought a review of its position on the  valuation by its national office.  Ultimately, it was the incorrect valuation  of these assets that led to the failure of Superior Bank.

However, once Superior\u2019s condition stabilized and its composite  rating was upgraded to a  \u201c2\u201d in 1993, FDIC\u2019s review was limited to off-site  monitoring.  In 1995, 1996, and 1997, FDIC reviewed the annual OTS  examinations and other material, including the bank\u2019s supervisory filings  and audited financial statements.

During this review, FDIC noted\u2014with alarm\u2014that Superior  Bank exhibited a high-risk asset structure.  Specifically, the review noted  that Superior had significant investments in the residual values of  securitized loans.  These investments, by then, were equal to roughly 150  percent of its tier 1 capital.  The review also noted that significant  reporting differences existed between the bank\u2019s audit report and its  quarterly financial statement to regulators, that the bank was a subprime  lender, and had substantial off-balance sheet recourse exposure.", "As noted earlier, however, the bank\u2019s residual assets had been over 100  percent of capital since 1995.  FDIC had been aware of this high  concentration and had noted it in the summary analyses of examination  reports that it completed during off-site monitoring, but FDIC did not  initiate any additional off-site activities or raise any concerns to OTS until  after a 1998 off-site review that it performed.  Although current guidance  would have imposed limits at 25 percent, there was no explicit direction to  the bank\u2019s examiners or analysts on safe limits for residual assets.

The first action, the \u201cPart 570 Safety and Soundness Action,\u201dfollowed the completion of an on-site examination that began in January  2000, with FDIC participation. That formally notified Superior\u2019s Board of  Directors of deficiencies and required that the board take several actions,  including: developing procedures to analyze the valuation of the bank\u2019s residual  interests, including obtaining periodic independent valuations; developing a plan to reduce the level of residual interests to 100 percent of  the bank\u2019s Tier 1 or core capital within 1 year; addressing issues regarding the bank\u2019s automobile loan program; and revising the bank\u2019s policy for allowances for loan losses and maintaining  adequate allowances.", "On July 7, 2000, OTS also officially notified Superior that it had been  designated a \u201cproblem institution.\u201d  This designation placed restrictions on  the institution, including on asset growth.  Superior Bank submitted a  compliance plan, as required, on August 4, 2000. Due to the amount of  time that Superior and OTS took in negotiating the actions required, this  plan was never implemented, but it did serve to get Superior to cease its  securitization activities.", "While Superior and OTS were negotiating over the Part 570 plan, Superior  adjusted the value of its residual interests with a $270 million write-down.

That plan called for  reducing the bank\u2019s exposure to its residual interests and recapitalizing  the bank with a $270 million infusion from the owners. On July16, 2001,  however, the Pritzker interests, one of the two ultimate owners of  Superior Bank, advised OTS that they did not believe that the capital plan  would work and therefore withdrew their support. When efforts to change  their position failed, OTS appointed FDIC as conservator and receiver of  Superior.", "Although a PCA directive was issued when the bank became \u201csignificantly  undercapitalized,\u201d losses to the deposit insurance fund were still  substantial. The reasons for this are related to the design of PCA itself.  First, under PCA, capital is a key factor in determining an institution\u2019s  condition. Superior\u2019s capital did not fall to the \u201csignificantly  undercapitalized\u201d level until it corrected its flawed valuation of its residual  interests.  Incorrect financial reporting, such as was the case with Superior  Bank, will limit the effectiveness of PCA because such reporting limits the  regulators\u2019 ability to accurately measure capital.", "Second, PCA\u2019s current test for \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d is based on the  tangible equity capital ratio, which does not use a risk-based capital  measure.  Thus it only includes on-balance sheet assets and does not fully  encompass off-balance sheet risks, such as those presented in an  institution\u2019s securitization activities. Therefore, an institution might  become undercapitalized using the risk-based capital ratio but would not  fall into the \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d PCA category under the current  capital measure. \u201cPCA is tied to capital levels and capital is a lagging indicator of financial problems.  It is  important that regulators continue to use other supervisory and enforcement tools, to stop  unsafe and unsound practices before they result in losses, reduced capital levels, or  failure.\u201d", "Further, PCA implicitly contemplates that a bank\u2019s deteriorating condition  and capital would take place over time. In some cases, problems  materialize rapidly, or as in Superior\u2019s case, long-developing problems are  identified suddenly.  In such cases, PCA\u2019s requirements for a bank plan to  address the problems can potentially delay other more effective actions.", "It is worth noting that while Section 38 uses capital as a key factor in  determining an institution\u2019s condition, Section 39 gives federal regulators  the authority to establish safety and soundness related management and  operational standards that do not rely on capital, but could be used to  bring corrective actions before problems reach the capital account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Similar Problems had Occurred in Some Previous Bank Failures", "paragraphs": ["The failure of Superior Bank illustrates the possible consequences when  banking supervisors do not recognize that a bank has a particularly  complex and risky portfolio.

These  failures involved FDIC (PTL and BestBank) and the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (Keystone).", "BestBank was a Colorado bank that closed in 1998, costing the insurance  fund approximately $172 million.  Like Superior, it had a business strategy  to target subprime borrowers, who had high delinquency rates.

The bank had to close because it falsified its accounting  records regarding delinquency rates and subsequently was unable to  absorb the estimated losses from these delinquencies.", "Keystone, a West Virginia bank, failed in 1999, costing the insurance fund  approximately $800 million.  While fraud committed by the bank  management was the most important cause of its failure, Keystone\u2019s  business strategy was similar to Superior\u2019s and led to some similar  problems. In 1993, Keystone began purchasing and securitizing Federal  Housing Authority Title I Home Improvement Loans that were originated  throughout the country.  These subprime loans targeted highly leveraged  borrowers with little or no collateral.  The securitization of subprime loans  became Keystone\u2019s main line of business and contributed greatly to its  apparent profitability.  The examiners, however, found that Keystone did  not record its residual interests in these securitizations until September  1997, several months after FAS No. 125 took effect.  Furthermore,  examiners found the residual valuation model deficient, and Keystone had  an unsafe concentration of mortgage products.", "PTL was a California bank that failed in 1999, costing the insurance fund  approximately $52 million.  Like Superior Bank, PTL entered the  securitization market by originating loans for sale to third-party  securitizing entities. While PTL enjoyed high asset and capital growth  rates, valuation was an issue. Also, similar to Superior Bank, the  examiners over-relied on external auditors in the PTL case.
