Also, in 2013, the FAR was amended to require agencies to insert a contract clause to ensure contractors communicate rights to their employees for certain contracts.", "The act also contained a provision for GAO to report on the status of the pilot program. This report: (1) describes the results of the whistleblower pilot program across 14 selected executive departments from July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015 and (2) assesses the extent to which four departments implemented the pilot program. GAO analyzed survey data from 14 executive departments, which are a subset of all entities covered by the legislation; selected four departments based on high and low contract funds awarded to conduct a more detailed review of the pilot program implementation; interviewed agency officials and contractors; and reviewed a non-generalizable sample of contracts included in the pilot program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Whistleblower Protections Pilot Program (pilot program) provides enhanced legal protections to contractor employees who believe that they have experienced reprisal as a result of disclosing certain wrongdoings. Among other enhancements, the act expanded the persons and entities to which a whistleblower could disclose wrongdoing and identified which office within an agency has responsibility for handling complaints. For example, under the pilot program, when the Office of Inspector General (OIG) receives a complaint, it must determine whether a complaint is covered by the pilot program and if covered, conduct an investigation and submit the findings to the agency head, complainant, and contractor. The 14 selected departments that GAO reviewed reported receiving an estimated 1,560 whistleblower reprisal complaints from July 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015. Of these complaints, 127 were submitted by contractor, subcontractor, and grantee employees under the pilot program. The 14 OIGs investigated 44 of the 127 complaints but did not find that reprisal had occurred in any of them. The complaints not investigated by the OIGs were excluded for a variety of reasons, such as the complaint was deemed to be frivolous or was being decided by another judicial authority.", "GAO's in-depth review of four selected departments' implementation of the pilot program found various opportunities for improvement. Specific details follow:", "The pilot program requires findings of investigated reprisal complaints to be forwarded to several entities, including to the agency head for a determination of whether reprisal occurred and, as of December 2015, to the head of the contracting activity. However, at two of the four departments reviewed, the OIGs either did not forward their investigation findings to the appropriate entities or did not forward findings in the necessary format because, according to OIG officials, they were unclear about how to execute the requirement. As a result, at these two departments, the agency heads did not make the determination of whether reprisal occurred as required by the pilot program.", "Contracting officers must insert the required Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) whistleblower clause to be inserted into contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, which is generally $150,000, as a method to communicate with contractors about pilot program requirements. However, while the four selected departments reported that they inserted the clause into the required contracts, GAO found new contracts awarded during the pilot program's timeframe that did not include the required clause. Without effective internal control policies, agencies may continue to omit the required clause.", "Some contractors GAO spoke with were unaware of their obligations under the pilot program. Officials from all four departments reported taking no additional action to communicate to contractors their responsibilities to inform employees of their rights under the pilot program. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards for communication. Without actions to help contractors fully understand their responsibilities under the pilot program, the departments do not have assurance that contractor employees are also aware of the protections afforded by the pilot program legislation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making specific recommendations to the four selected departments to improve whistleblower protections policies and guidance and communication with contractors.

The legislation covers numerous executive agencies,  including 14 executive departments. The pilot program, among other  things, provides enhanced legal protections to contractor employees who  reasonably believe they have experienced reprisal as a result of  disclosing certain wrongdoing as defined in the statute to specified bodies  and individuals.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 also contained a provision for us to  evaluate and report on the implementation of the pilot program.

When we refer to departments, we are referring to the  14 executive departments defined by statute and covered by the  whistleblower protections pilot program that we focused on for our review.  We surveyed the OIGs at the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce,  Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security,  Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State,  Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs and received responses  from the OIGs at all 14 of these departments. Among other things, the  survey collected information about the number of disclosures of fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement as well as reprisal complaints and  mechanisms used by executive departments to implement provisions of  the pilot program.

The survey used for this study is reprinted in appendix I.", "To assess the extent to which departments have implemented the pilot  program, we selected four executive departments based primarily on the  dollar value of their fiscal year 2015 contract funds awarded, the most  recent year available at the time we began our review. To obtain a range  of departments, we included two departments (Homeland Security, State)  with higher contract funds awarded and two departments (Commerce,  Interior) with lower contract funds awarded. At each department, we  focused on the department\u2019s handling of reprisal complaints filed by  contractor and subcontractor employees. We interviewed or obtained  written answers from officials at each department\u2019s OIG, the office of the  agency head, and the acquisitions office about their processes and  practices for the agency duties outlined in the mandate. Where  applicable, we reviewed documentation such as relevant policies,  guidance, and internal reports. To identify whether contracts contained a  required Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause, we requested a  non-generalizable sample of contracts from each of the four selected  departments. To identify an example of a contract without the clause, we  reviewed documentation for a random selection of at least 50 contracts at  each of the four departments. We asked for contract actions awarded in  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 to ensure we were sampling  contracts that are required to have the clause and would be reasonably  accessible by the departments (e.g., they would likely not be archived).  We also reviewed orders awarded during this period. We used the  Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to  generate a sample of contract actions over $150,000, which is generally  the simplified acquisition threshold, that were awarded by the four  departments included in our review in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  2015. We conducted data reliability checks on the FPDS-NG dataset by  comparing it to contract documentation obtained from contract files and  determined it was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "Further, to identify challenges experienced during the implementation of  the pilot program, we conducted interviews with contractors and  whistleblower advocacy groups. We contacted a total of 13 contractors,  including both large and small business contractors based on their  contract obligations from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015, as  reported in FPDS-NG, and we spoke with or received written answers to  our questions from 7.

The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 1987 provided protections for employees of defense contractors,  who were prohibited from discharging, demoting, or otherwise  discriminating against an employee for disclosing certain wrongdoing.  Similar protections were expanded to other executive agencies in 1994,  when legislation provided certain rights for contractor employees at  civilian executive agencies. For example, one right is to have the OIG of  the executive agency conduct an investigation into reprisal complaints  when the contractor employee believes reprisal has occurred as a result  of disclosing certain information to authorized persons or bodies, such as  a member of Congress. In 2013, after the passage of the NDAA for  Fiscal Year 2013, the pilot program went into effect and further expanded  protections to also include employees of subcontractors and grantees and  directs the agency head to make the determination on whether a  contractor employee had been reprised against."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements under the Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["In 2013, the pilot program went into effect and, among other  enhancements, limited the OIG investigation of complaints to 180 days,  whereas previously there was no time limitation on the investigation.

Moreover, in  addition to protections under the previous statute for disclosing certain  information to a Member of Congress or an authorized official of an  executive agency or the Department of Justice, employees are now  protected when disclosing information related to certain wrongdoing to a  broader range of authorized persons or bodies, such as a management  official at the contractor, or to a law enforcement agency.", "Under the pilot program, both the OIG at each executive agency as well  as certain agency officials are responsible for executing provisions of the  pilot program.

Homeland Security officials  we spoke with said this directive is thorough. However, we noted the  directive does not include the FAR 3.908-5 requirement to send the  investigation findings to the head of the contracting activity and  believe there may be opportunity to include more guidance. When we  asked about the FAR requirement, OIG officials said they believed  forwarding findings to the head of the contracting activity is a  responsibility of the agency head which had not previously provided  the proper contact to the OIG.", "Interior OIG officials provided their policy for investigations as the pilot  program guidance. However, we noted that Interior\u2019s OIG  investigations policy document was not specific to the pilot program  processes or protections. Interior OIG officials agreed and reported  that if the pilot is made permanent they plan to make changes to the  policy for investigations to include the pilot program details.", "State OIG officials provided their policy for pilot program  investigations as the pilot program guidance. The policy includes  instructions on obtaining evidence for pilot program investigations, on  the reporting process when an investigation is complete, as well as  identifies levels of review. The policy instructs State officials to share  investigation findings with the agency head; however, we found it  does not specify how that information should be communicated. A  State OIG official said that the report of findings is communicated to  the agency head through a system that allows memoranda to be  submitted as either an action memorandum or information  memorandum. State OIG officials reported that initially, they had  submitted information memoranda because action memoranda  traditionally have a one page limit, which is insufficient to  communicate the findings of an investigation. However, according to  State OIG officials, in 2016, the Office of the Executive Secretariat  (which handles executive communication) requested that OIG put its  whistleblower reports in the form of an action memorandum, but this  change has not been put into guidance. An action memorandum  signals that action by the agency head is required, while an  information memorandum does not. Although a determination by the  agency head is required by law, we noted that the OIG guidance does  not specify that the action memoranda should be sent to the agency  head, signaling action is to be taken.", "According to federal internal control standards, management should  internally communicate the necessary information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives. This can be achieved through clear guidance or policies.  Further, FAR 3.908-5 establishes pilot program requirements, and  department guidance should include the requirements laid out in the FAR,  such as time frames for determinations by the agency head and who  receives copies of the investigation results. Although the four selected  OIGs all provided some level of guidance on executing the pilot program,  it is possible that some steps in this process may be missed because they  do not have detailed guidance that addresses all required elements of the  pilot program. Without providing more details in their guidance, these  departments may be at risk of not fully implementing all the provisions of  the pilot program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two OIGs with Completed Investigations Did Not Fully Implement Pilot Program Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The pilot program statute and implementing regulations require that the  OIG forward a report of its investigation findings to several entities,  including the agency head, the complainant, and the contractor.

Of our four selected  departments, Commerce and Interior reported that they did not have any  investigations finalized during our review period. In contrast, Homeland  Security and State had investigations with findings that were not  forwarded to all appropriate entities to allow the agency head to make a  final determination of whether reprisal occurred.

However, although  OIG officials reported attempting to send the report to the agency  head, department officials reported that the reports did not actually go  to the appropriate contacts. As a result, the reports were not received  by the correct contact in the department, and the agency head did not  make the determination in either case, as required by law. Agency  officials reported that in one case a report was sent to the Office of  General Counsel Labor and Employment division, not the agency  head, and in the other case, the report was forwarded to the  Secretary\u2019s office, but nothing was done with the report. OIG officials  said their implementation of the pilot was an evolving process and that  they were not notified that the reports had gone to the wrong person.", "State OIG officials reported that the five investigations completed by  December 31, 2015, were forwarded to the agency head, and the  results of the OIG investigations were communicated to both the  complainant and the contractor. During the course of our review, a  State OIG official said that he had previously sent the reports to the  relevant contracting activity at each Bureau, as designated by the  Department of State Acquisition Regulation, in an effort to meet the  requirement to provide the investigation results to the head of the  contracting activity. However, starting in October 2016 and going  forward, officials said the OIG plans to send reports to State\u2019s  Procurement Executive, the head of the contracting activity at the  State Department, who has since been designated by the agency  head during the course of this review to make determination of  potential reprisals, as well as provide remedies. For these five cases,  a State OIG official reported that the complaints were unsubstantiated  and the OIG forwarded all findings as information memoranda to the  agency head. The information memoranda include a cover page  indicating the investigation\u2019s findings, and that the Secretary should  review the report for informational purposes, but there is no indication  on the cover page of actions required\u2014including that the agency head  has 30 days to make a determination\u2014because a determination had  been made by the OIG. However, the pilot program requires that even  if the OIG determines the reprisal complaint is unsubstantiated, the  agency head must make the final determination. Officials from the  agency head at State explained that for the five cases in which  information memoranda were provided to report the investigations\u2019  findings, they understood that no action was required, and no action  was taken, however the responsibility to make a final determination of  whether reprisal occurred under the pilot program remained. As a  result, no documentation exists indicating that the agency head  agreed with the investigations\u2019 findings. According to the statute,  however, the agency head, not the OIG, must make the determination  of whether reprisal occurred within 30 days of receiving the report of  investigation findings. During our review, and in part as a result of  ongoing work, in June 2016, OIG officials said State instructed the  OIG to provide the results of its investigations as action memoranda,  rather than information memoranda, for both substantiated and  unsubstantiated investigation findings of a reprisal complaint in order  to indicate action from the agency head is necessary. In addition, the  action memorandum now includes the 30-day requirement for the  agency head to make a determination as to whether the employee  was subjected to a reprisal on the complaint.

As discussed  earlier, the FAR clause instructs contractors to communicate to their  employees, in writing and in the predominant language of their workforce,  their rights under the pilot program. These rights include who an  employee may report an initial disclosure or submit a reprisal complaint  to, their right to an investigation for covered reprisal complaints, and other  rights and remedies. The FAR clause is required to be inserted into new  contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold, generally $150,000, for  any contracts awarded after September 30, 2013, until the close of the  pilot program on July 1, 2017. For commercial item acquisitions,  contracting officers must insert an already-required clause, 52.212-4, that  now requires compliance with the pilot program statute 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 4712.", "Commerce, Homeland Security, Interior, and State contracting officials  reported that they use the FAR clause to inform contractors of their  responsibilities. However, we found that at State, Commerce, and  Homeland Security, contract writing systems may not automatically  include the clause into contracts that are required, and some required a  contracting officer to insert the FAR clause into each contract into which it  is required to be included, rather than through an automated system. At  Interior, officials said the clause would be automatically inserted into new  awards as appropriate, however, we found the clause was not inserted in  all contracts that we reviewed. Internal control standards require that an  entity should establish monitoring activities and evaluate results.  However, we found all four selected departments reported having no  department-wide, regular compliance review that would detect whether  the required FAR clause is included in required contracts. For example,  Commerce officials reported that while they do have a compliance review  that checks for the insertion of mandatory clauses, and a review was  conducted in 2014 and included contract actions from 2011 through 2013,  a review has not been done since; therefore, no department-wide review  has been done on the inclusion of the FAR clause required by the pilot  program. A contracting official from Homeland Security said that all  contracting officers, as part of the review process before a contract is  signed, are required to review contract actions to ensure that all  applicable clauses are included; however, no department-wide review is  done. Contracting officials from Interior said that, while they conduct  contracting compliance reviews, they do not include specific clauses in  those reviews unless the agency has a specific reason to do so, such as  if they determined through risk analysis that the clause may not be  included. To date, according to these officials, Interior has not checked  compliance of the inclusion of the FAR clause. Officials from State report  they rely solely on supervisory review of contract documents and there is  no higher-level compliance review to determine whether the FAR clause  is inserted into new contracts.", "Despite the acknowledgement from all four departments that the required  clause was to be included in new contracts, we found that some contracts  in our review lacked the required whistleblower protections FAR clause  52.203-17 or 52.212-4 for commercial item contracts. The contracts for  Homeland Security, Interior, and State were not commercial item  contracts, but the contract for Commerce was. At Commerce, a contract  awarded in September 2015 of more than $450,000 for computer  hardware and software licenses provided by contractors does not include  the required whistleblower protections FAR clause or the commercial item  contract clause. Further, at Homeland Security, a contract awarded in  September 2015 for over $550,000 for the design and implementation of  security software does not include the required whistleblower protections  FAR clause. In addition, at Interior, a contract awarded in August 2015 of  about $200,000 to perform research and development does not include  the required whistleblower protections FAR clause. At State, a contract  awarded in September 2015 for project development and design services  for over $230,000 also did not include the required whistleblower  protections FAR clause. Without a process in place to ensure the required  contract clause is inserted into new contracts, these clauses may  continue to be excluded.

Homeland Security officials also noted that contracting officers are  encouraged to include the clause in major modifications to required  contracts and task orders. Interior officials reported that it is up to the  bureaus within Interior to decide if the clause is inserted into major  modifications, and there is no department-wide policy. State officials  reported that the clause is added on a case-by-case basis, and  contracting officials are responsible for determining whether it is  necessary to add the clause. Contracting officials at all four departments  said they do not have a policy in place that defines major modification, or  any policy or guidance that instructs contracting officials on how to  determine if a modification would be considered \u201cmajor\u201d or what the  contracting officer should do to make a best effort to include the FAR  clause. Some contracting officials reported that even though there are  requirements in the statute regarding making best efforts, they rely on the  FAR and generally do not seek out additional counsel on the  implementation of the law. However, the requirement to make best efforts  to include the FAR clause into existing contracts (those awarded before  the effective date of the pilot program) during major modifications of those  contracts is not implemented in the FAR.

However, another contractor pointed out that agencies  have followed up and sought confirmation or attestation on other contract  clauses, such as clauses designed to address human trafficking. In  addition, one whistleblower advocacy group we spoke with noted that  contractors\u2019 employees may not be aware of their rights or where to find  more information about the pilot program protections.

Given that  contractors we spoke with stated they were not all aware of the need to  communicate to their employees about their rights in this area,  opportunities for improvements to communications between the two  parties exist. For example, one department in our survey of 14  departments reported conducting external communication beyond  including the FAR clause in new contracting actions by developing new  guidance that will require its contracting staff to obtain email confirmation  from contractors that they have notified their employees of their rights as  reported above.

To fully implement the enhancement of  contractor employee whistleblower protections pilot program, especially  now that it has been made permanent, and to ensure that the review  process does not stop short of the agency head review, OIGs must report  their investigation findings to the agency head. When reports are not  forwarded to the agency head for final determination, the requirement  under the statute is not met.

At the four selected departments reviewed,  confusion among department officials about the pilot program\u2019s processes  and requirements remain, and further guidance may help clarify  responsibilities under the pilot program. Further, opportunities exist for  these four departments to ensure that the necessary FAR clause is  included in all required contracts, and that they make a best effort to  include the FAR clause in major modifications to existing contracts.  Finally, improving communication with contractors, subcontractors, and  grantees to ensure employees are aware of their responsibilities and  rights under the pilot program are important steps for the selected  executive departments\u2019 contracting officials to take.

Specifically, we surveyed the OIGs at the Departments of  Agriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services,  Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice,  Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs. We sent the  survey questionnaire\u2014by e-mail in an attached Microsoft Word form that  respondents could return electronically after completing it\u2014to 14  executive departments on June 15, 2016, and received responses from  the OIGs at all 14 departments.

For each department, we  asked officials to provide information about activities and data related to  whistleblower complaints, including data on complaints that were not  subject to the pilot program. For pilot program-related information, we  requested data on contractor, subcontractor, and grantee employees,  such as the number of complaints received from each group and how  many of the complaints were investigated by the OIG. When necessary,  we performed limited follow-up with all 14 departments to clarify answers  and request relevant documentation; this follow-up took place from July  26, 2016, to December 8, 2016.

We took steps in  developing the survey, collecting the data, and analyzing them to  minimize such nonsampling error. We conducted three telephone pretests  of the survey instrument with officials at three departments to ensure that  questions were clear, comprehensive, and unbiased, and to minimize the  burden the questionnaire placed on respondents. An independent  reviewer within GAO also reviewed a draft of the questionnaire prior to  administration of the survey.

To obtain a range of  experience level with contracting at departments, we included two  departments with higher contract funds awarded (Homeland Security,  State) and two departments with lower contract funds awarded  (Commerce, Interior). To identify these departments, we ranked  department contract funds awarded from highest to lowest, and selected  two departments from the top half of the 14 departments, and two from  the bottom half. Our secondary criteria included the proportion of contract  funds awarded to overall obligations in fiscal year 2015 and whether the  departments\u2019 OIG website included mention of the pilot program. At each  department, we focused on the department\u2019s handling of reprisal  complaints filed by contractor and subcontractor employees. We  interviewed or obtained written answers from department OIG officials,  the office of the agency head, and contracting officials about their  processes and practices for the agency duties outlined in the mandate.

To identify an  example of a contract without the clause, we reviewed documentation for  a random selection of at least 50 contracts at each of the four  departments. We used the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) to generate a sample of contract actions over  $150,000 that were awarded by the four departments included in our  review in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The sample also included  orders awarded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, regardless of the  award date of the associated contract. To avoid selecting contracts where  the underlying base contract was awarded by another department, we  excluded interagency contracts. We asked for contract actions awarded in  the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 to ensure we were sampling  contracts that are required to have the clause and would be reasonably  accessible by the departments (e.g., they would likely not be archived).  To avoid selecting contracts where the underlying base contract was  awarded by another department, we excluded interagency contracts. We  also excluded task or delivery orders awarded using blanket purchase  agreements because we could not consistently determine which  department awarded the underlying base contract based on FPDS-NG  data. For Homeland Security, we excluded contracts awarded by the  Coast Guard because the Coast Guard is not covered under the pilot  program and its contracts would not be required to contain this clause.
