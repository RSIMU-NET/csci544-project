According to Office of the CMO (OCMO) officials, some of the draft documents were provided to the CMO for review and approval as early as August 2018. After providing a draft of this report to the department for comment, GAO learned that the organizational strategy was circulated for department coordination in July 2019, with components expected to provide input by August 2019. However, while the OCMO has set an internal time frame for the organizational strategy, it has not set similar time frames for completing the other four remaining requirements, such as delivering guidance and training on cross-functional teams. GAO previously reported that establishing internal deadlines with key milestones and deliverables is important for tracking progress and implementing actions effectively.", "DOD established a cross-functional team pursuant to section 911 on electromagnetic-spectrum operations (EMSO), but according to a team official, funding for the team was delayed. EMSO refers to those activities consisting of electronic warfare and joint electromagnetic-spectrum management operations used to exploit, attack, protect, and manage the electromagnetic operational environment to achieve the commander's objectives. According to the memorandum establishing the team, the CMO is required to provide administrative support to and coordinate with the team to ensure adequate resources are immediately available. However, team officials stated that this funding was delayed in part because of disagreements over responsibility for funding the team under the terms of this memorandum. Moreover, according to a team official, plans for funding in future fiscal years have not been developed.

However,  DOD has faced organizational, management, and cultural challenges that  can limit effective and efficient collaboration needed to accomplish  departmental objectives. For example, we reported in August 2017 that  DOD\u2019s efforts to implement a hierarchical, portfolio-based approach to  strategically acquire contracted services had not been successful. This  effort failed for various reasons, including that it was met with strong  cultural resistance to changing DOD\u2019s traditional decentralized approach  to managing services. We have highlighted these challenges in additional  reports, including our High-Risk report, which calls attention to agencies  and program areas that are high risk because of their vulnerabilities to  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are most in need of  transformation.", "Section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017 contained multiple requirements to help advance a more  collaborative culture within DOD.

This  section directed the Secretary of Defense to do the following, among  other things:", "Formulate and issue an organizational strategy for DOD that identifies  the critical objectives and other organizational outputs that span  multiple functional boundaries and would benefit from the use of  cross-functional teams to ensure collaboration and integration across  the department.", "Establish cross-functional teams that, among other things, address  the critical objectives and outputs outlined in the department\u2019s  organizational strategy.", "Issue guidance on cross-functional teams and provide training to  members of those established teams and their supervisors on  elements of successful cross-functional teams.", "Provide training on leadership, modern organizational practice,  collaboration, and the operation of cross-functional teams to  individuals who have been appointed by the President and confirmed  by the Senate to a position within the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, or request waivers from this requirement.", "Central to these requirements is the use of cross-functional teams.  According to academic literature and subject-matter experts with whom  we spoke, cross-functional teams rely on individuals with different types  of expertise to work toward a common, well-defined goal, and are thought  to deliver better and faster solutions to complex and fast-moving  problems. As of our January 2019 report, DOD had established one  cross-functional team under section 911, which has since been  disestablished. The team had been responsible for managing the  transfer of background investigations for certain DOD personnel from the  Office of Personnel Management to DOD. Because those responsibilities  were transferred to a newly created Personnel Vetting Transformation  Office within DOD, department officials made the decision to disestablish  the team. According to a DOD official, the team was disestablished as of  January 2019.", "The John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 subsequently introduced  new requirements on DOD\u2019s implementation of section 911. Among other  things, sections 918 and 1053(c) of the act required the Secretary of  Defense to establish a cross-functional team pursuant to section 911 of  the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 on electronic warfare in order to identify  gaps in electronic warfare and joint electromagnetic spectrum operations,  capabilities, and capacities within the department across personnel,  procedural, and equipment areas.", "Section 911 also included a provision for us\u2014every 6 months after the  date of enactment on December 23, 2016, through December 31, 2019\u2014 to submit to the defense committees a report setting forth a  comprehensive assessment of the actions that DOD has taken pursuant  to section 911 during each 6-month period and cumulatively since the  NDAA\u2019s enactment. We have issued four reports to date and made five  recommendations to DOD. In our most recent report, issued in January  2019, we reported that DOD had made limited progress in addressing the  remaining statutory requirements from section 911 and was reducing the  number of cross-functional teams it considered responsive to section  911. We also reported that DOD\u2019s enterprise business reform efforts  were driven by nine cross-functional teams, but progress had been  uneven. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that DOD establish a  process to identify and prioritize funding for implementing these business  reform teams\u2019 initiatives. Appendix I provides information on these four  reports, including the status of DOD\u2019s implementation of  recommendations made in these reports.", "In this report, we describe the extent to which DOD has made progress in  implementing the requirements of section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal  Year 2017, including the establishment of a new cross-functional team on  electromagnetic spectrum operations.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress in implementing the section 911 requirements,  we reviewed documentation and interviewed Office of the Chief  Management Officer (OCMO) officials on DOD\u2019s efforts to finalize its draft  organizational strategy; DOD\u2019s guidance on cross-functional teams; its  training for cross-functional team members, their supervisors, and  presidential appointees; and its report on the successes and failures of  cross-functional teams. We compared DOD\u2019s efforts to the requirements  in section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017. To assess DOD\u2019s efforts  to establish the new cross-functional team on electromagnetic spectrum  operations, we interviewed OCMO and other officials involved in the  establishment of the team to discuss their efforts and reviewed  documentation associated with the establishment of the team. We  evaluated these efforts against the requirements for cross-functional  teams in section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, as well as leading  practices from our prior work on implementing effective cross-functional  teams. To assess the team against these requirements, two analysts  independently reviewed the testimony and documents provided and  compared them to these requirements. In any cases where there was a  disagreement, the analysts discussed any differences. If they were not  resolved, a third analyst reviewed the assessments and made a  determination.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2018 to August  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Issue an organizational strategy: DOD has not issued its  organizational strategy, which as of June 2019 is 21 months past the  statutorily required issuance date of September 1, 2017. In January  2019, we reported that OCMO officials had revised the draft  organizational strategy, incorporating, among other things, the criteria  that distinguish cross-functional teams established under section 911  from other types of cross-functional working groups, committees,  integrated product teams, and task forces, as required by section  918(b) of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019. The  revised draft of the organizational strategy also includes steps DOD  plans to take to advance a collaborative culture. As we reported in our  June 2018 report, these steps, as outlined in the draft strategy, align  with our leading practices for mergers and organizational  transformations, which we recommended that DOD incorporate into  its strategy. Based on our review of OCMO\u2019s current draft of the  organizational strategy, we found that it addresses all required  elements laid out in section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017.  That January 2019 draft strategy, according to an official from  OCMO\u2019s Administration and Organizational Policy Directorate, was  provided to OCMO leadership for review as early as August 2018, but  has not been approved. A senior OCMO official stated that approval  of the draft was delayed to ensure it aligned with the National Defense  Strategy, issued in January 2018, and the National Defense Business  Operations Plan, issued in May 2018, and to incorporate additional  requirements of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019,  which was enacted in August 2018. In addition, according to senior  OCMO and Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense officials, the  Acting CMO and the Deputy Secretary of Defense informally  discussed the draft organizational strategy, but those conversations  did not lead to the Acting CMO formally approving the draft for  department-wide coordination. In May 2019, a senior OCMO official  told us that the Acting CMO was fully committed to completing  department-wide coordination of the draft strategy in June 2019 and  advancing it for issuance by the Secretary of Defense in July 2019.  After providing a draft of this report to the department for comment,  we learned that the organizational strategy was circulated for  department-wide coordination on July 12, 2019, with components  expected to provide input by August 5, 2019.     2.  Issue guidance for cross-functional teams: DOD has not issued  guidance for cross-functional teams, which, as of June 2019, is 20  months past the required date of September 30, 2017. In June 2018,  we reported that OCMO officials had revised the draft guidance to  fully address all section 911 requirements and incorporate leading  practices for effective cross-functional teams in the guidance,  consistent with our February 2018 recommendation. Based on our  review of this draft, we found that it addresses all required elements  from section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, as well as all of  the leading practices for effective cross-functional teams. That draft  guidance, according to an official from OCMO\u2019s Administration and  Organizational Policy Directorate, was provided to OCMO leadership  for review as early as August 2018, but has not been approved by the  CMO.  3.  Provide training to cross-functional team members and their  supervisors: OCMO officials have provided some of the required  training to members and leaders of a recently established cross- functional team described later in this report. The training included  several required elements, including information on the characteristics  of successful cross-functional teams, conflict resolution, and how to  appropriately represent the views and expertise of functional  components. However, OCMO officials have not provided training to  supervisors in team members\u2019 functional organizations as required.", "We reported in February 2018 that DOD had developed a draft  curriculum for this training that addressed the section 911  requirements. An OCMO official told us it has not altered the  curriculum since then, but that the department has still not provided  the training to team members\u2019 supervisors because the curriculum  has not been approved by the Acting CMO or the Secretary of  Defense. Such approval, though not required by statute, would  demonstrate senior leadership support for cross-functional teams, a  leading practice we have identified. Further, according to an OCMO  official, department-wide coordination and approval would serve to  strengthen the effectiveness of the training. However, the need for this  training is evident. For example, when we observed one of the training  sessions, a member of a cross-functional team stated that he did not  believe his supervisors knew what cross-functional teams were.  4.  Provide training to presidential appointees: OCMO has not  provided the required training to individuals filling presidentially  appointed, Senate-confirmed positions in the Office of the Secretary  of Defense. Section 911 requires these individuals to complete the  training within 3 months of their appointment or DOD to request  waivers. As of June 2019, 24 of 36 such officials had been appointed  and in their positions for more than 3 months, and, according to an  OCMO official, none had received their training or been granted a  training waiver. An OCMO official told us in October 2018 he had  revised the draft training curriculum following our February 2018  report to include all the required elements in section 911. However,  as of May 2019, OCMO officials had not provided a copy of the  revised curriculum for our review. After the curriculum is approved, the  officials stated that they plan to recommend to the Secretary of  Defense that all presidential appointees in the Office of the Secretary  of Defense receive the training, rather than request waivers.  5.  Report on successes and failures of cross-functional teams:  OCMO has not completed an analysis of the successes and failures  of DOD\u2019s cross-functional teams, which, as of June 2019, is 3 months  past its required completion date. Section 911 requires that an  analysis of the success and failures of the teams and how to apply  lessons learned from that analysis is completed 18 months after the  establishment of the first cross-functional team. With the  establishment of the first cross-functional team on personnel vetting in  August 2017, the required completion date for the report was  February 25, 2019. An OCMO official stated that OCMO planned to  conduct an analysis on the personnel vetting team, but had not yet  begun and had not set a time frame for doing so.", "DOD has not addressed most of these remaining requirements of section  911 because, according to an OCMO official, the Acting CMO has not  approved the draft documents prepared by OCMO staff to satisfy the  requirements. Moreover, the Acting CMO has not coordinated most of the  documents department-wide and provided them to the Secretary of  Defense for review and issuance. Specifically, according to an OCMO  official, the Acting CMO has not reviewed or approved the guidance on  cross-functional teams or curricula for cross-functional team members,  their supervisors, and presidential appointees. These delays occurred in  part because the department has not established and communicated  internal deadlines for reviewing, coordinating, and approving these  documents. According to OCMO officials, the primary reason they have  not met these other outstanding requirements, including the guidance and  training for cross-functional teams, is that they would like to have the  organizational strategy approved and issued first, so that it can be  reflected in the accompanying materials. However, while the OCMO has  set an internal time frame for the organizational strategy, it has not set  similar time frames for completing the remaining requirements.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasize the  need to establish time frames to implement actions effectively. In  addition, as we reported in June 2018, establishing time frames with key  milestones and deliverables to track implementation progress are  important for agency reform efforts. By not setting and following clear  internal deadlines for meeting the outstanding section 911 requirements,  DOD has continued to fall short in meeting statutory requirements and  missed opportunities to effectively implement its cross-functional teams  and advance a collaborative culture that could bolster broader efforts  within the department, such as reforming its business operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Established a Cross- Functional Team on Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, but the Team\u2019s Efforts Have Been Slowed by Delayed Funding Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Sections 918 and 1053(c) of the John S.

In  addition, section 1053(d) of the act required the electronic warfare cross- functional team to, among other things, (1) update the department\u2019s  Electronic Warfare Strategy in coordination with the Electronic Warfare  Executive Committee by February 9, 2019, and (2) provide assessments  of the electronic warfare capabilities of the Russian Federation and the  People\u2019s Republic of China in consultation with the Director of the  Defense Intelligence Agency by May 10, 2019.", "Section 918 of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 required  the team\u2019s establishment by November 11, 2018; however, DOD did not  establish an electromagnetic spectrum operations cross-functional team  until February 2019, and the team did not begin its work until April 2019.", "An official from the team told us that the standup of the team was delayed  due to the extensive department-wide review of the February 2019  memorandum that established the team. Because of the delayed  establishment of the team, DOD officials estimated that the required  update to DOD\u2019s Electronic Warfare Strategy would be completed by the  end of September 2019\u20147 months after the statutory deadline\u2014and that  the required assessments would be provided by fall 2019. According to  the team\u2019s establishment memorandum, the team will continue its work  until at least fiscal year 2022.", "In addition to the requirements discussed above, section 911 of the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 includes specific requirements for cross- functional teams established under that section, including that each  team\u2019s objectives be clearly established in writing and that the team  should establish a strategy to achieve those objectives. We found that  DOD and the electromagnetic spectrum operations cross-functional team  have addressed 10 of 11 of those requirements for cross-functional  teams. We also found that the team demonstrates several of the leading  practices for cross-functional teams. For example, we found that the  team has a well-defined team structure and well-defined team goals.  However, as previously discussed, DOD has not fully addressed the  section 911 requirement for training for cross-functional team members\u2019  supervisors.", "We were also told by team officials that DOD was delayed in providing  administrative support and funding to support the team\u2019s operations.  According to the memorandum establishing the electromagnetic spectrum  operations team, the CMO is responsible for providing administrative  support to the new team, to include providing the team with office space,  information technology equipment, contracting, human resources,  security, cross-functional team training, and other services, as  appropriate. The memorandum also requires the team to work with the  CMO to develop resource requirements for team operations for fiscal  years 2019 and 2020 to ensure adequate resources are immediately  available.", "However, according to a team official, funding was not provided to the  team until late May 2019\u2014over 3 months after the team was established  and over 1 month after most of the team members were provided by their  home units to work on the team full time. According to a team official, this  funding was to be used for several team requirements, including  dedicated office space, computer systems, travel funds, and contractor  support. This funding was delayed in part because of disagreements over  responsibility for funding the team under the terms of the memorandum  establishing the team. Specifically, according to a team official, OCMO  officials believed that funding should be provided by another organization,  such as the Joint Staff. Team and Joint Staff officials told us that they  believed the OCMO was responsible for this funding based on the  memorandum establishing the team. A team official further stated that  funding was provided only when the Deputy Secretary of Defense  directed that funding be provided to the team. OCMO officials told us that  because the team was not a budgeted activity for fiscal year 2019, the  team was added to DOD\u2019s unfunded requirements list. The Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) identified funds for the team via the  unfunded requirements process at the end of April 2019.", "However, a team official told us funding for the team for future fiscal years  has not been identified and responsibility for providing that funding is still  unclear. OCMO officials told us that the team will continue to rely on the  unfunded requirements process for funding, since the team is not a  budgeted activity for fiscal year 2020, and would need to compete for  funding through DOD\u2019s program budget review process for fiscal year  2021 and later fiscal years. Those officials also told us that the team has  not yet signed a memorandum of agreement that is required to execute  transfer of the funds to the team. A team official told us the team had not  yet signed the memorandum because it believed the memorandum would  transfer responsibility for funding the team from OCMO to the team. As  noted previously, team officials believe the OCMO is responsible for this  funding based on the memorandum establishing the team.", "According to a team official, this delay in funding hampered the team\u2019s  ability to achieve full operating capability. For example, until late May the  team was working from the Pentagon Conference Center and OCMO  conference rooms with only one secure laptop. A team official told us in  June 2019 that though the team has moved into its own office space, that  space does not have the level of security required for the team to work on  a third of its initiatives. As a result, the team was also delayed in  conducting mission analysis, work plan development, organizational  design, and production of executive-level briefings. A team official told us  the team expects to be at full operating capability in late July 2019.", "Leading practices for implementing effective cross-functional teams  highlight the importance of senior management providing teams with  access to resources. In addition, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that agencies\u2019 management should assign  responsibility to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. If DOD does not clarify  roles and responsibilities for providing funding for the new cross- functional team, the Acting CMO and the electromagnetic spectrum  operations team may continue to have delays in funding and those delays  may negatively affect the team\u2019s ability to conduct its work and to meet its  objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 called for organizational  and management reforms to assist DOD in addressing challenges that  have hindered collaboration and integration across the department.
