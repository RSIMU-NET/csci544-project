To meet these new demands, the Army is using the latest technology to develop a series of weapon systems that will be lighter than today's heavy force systems but just as lethal and survivable. The Army's transformation effort will face several challenges. First, the transformation will place additional funding demands on the defense budget. Second, the Army's plans for the transformation assume that weapons systems and equipment can be developed and acquired much faster than in the past. Third, the Army needs to update current acquisition plans to reflect transformation priorities and schedules. The success of this effort depends on the Army's ability to manage transformation acquisitions as leading commercial firms do. By following best practices used in the commercial sector, the Army can better match its needs with its resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A decade after the Cold War, the Army recognizes that its combat force is not well suited to perform the operations it must face today and must plan for in the future.

The Army expects the transformation to be a 30-year process and has not estimated its full cost. It is undertaking an aggressive science and technology program to develop future force capabilities. In April 2003, it plans to decide on which enabling technologies can be incorporated into the future force after which it believes that the cost of the transformation can be more accurately estimated.

Since 1989, the Army has had 53 operational deployments with a majority being small-scale contingency operations such as Somalia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Nevertheless, the National Military Strategy requires the services to be prepared for major regional conflicts. Therefore, the Army must maintain forces appropriate for these larger conflicts as well as for smaller contingencies.", "On October 12, 1999, the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army announced plans to radically transform the Army into a lighter, but lethal and survivable, force that can respond to a broad range of operations\u2014from peacekeeping, to regional conflicts, to major theater wars. Specifically, the goal of the Army\u2019s transformation plan is to build the objective force. This force includes advanced command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; future reconnaissance, attack, and lift aircraft; and revolutionary weapon systems\u2014called Future Combat Systems\u2014that are expected to be as lethal and survivable as the current heavy weapon systems and light enough to be transported in a C-130-type aircraft. Objective force units using these systems would be able to engage in the full spectrum of conflicts ranging from various small-scale contingencies to major theater wars.", "While transitioning to the objective force, the Army believes that it needs to improve the capabilities of its existing force so that it can better respond to small-scale contingencies. As a result, the Army\u2019s transformation plans include improving portions of its current force by transforming from five to eight units into Interim Brigade Combat Teams and equipping them with new vehicles that are expected to make the teams more lethal, mobile, and survivable than current light forces while maintaining the current light force\u2019s responsiveness and deployability capabilities. The Army calls this force the \u201cinterim force\u201d because it is designed to fill a near-term capabilities gap between today\u2019s heavy and light forces. The Army intends to phase out the interim force as it fields its objective force.", "Also, while it is developing the objective force and establishing the interim force, the Army plans to sustain, recapitalize (upgrade and rebuild), and modernize selected portions of its current heavy force to maintain the force\u2019s overmatch capability. The Army calls its current force the \u201clegacy force\u201d in its transformation plan. It expects to phase out the legacy force as it fields the objective force.

The unmanned vehicles could be equipped with such weapons as direct- and indirect-fire guns, non-line-of-sight rockets, and antitank missiles. In addition, the manned command and control vehicle would be networked with other reconnaissance systems not under its direct control including other airborne and spaceborne systems. The resulting configuration is expected to allow the commander of the command and control vehicle to operate from a position of concealment and, using the data received from the reconnaissance systems, to   be aware of the tactical situation,  identify and target opponent systems,   select the engagement position and method that best assures success, and   send unmanned weapon systems to carry out the engagement and destroy the opponent\u2019s systems.", "This concept\u2019s success depends upon mature technologies to allow the Army to design secure networks that cannot be jammed or taken over by the opponent; robotic vehicles that would make some decisions on their own; smaller weapons delivery platforms; and a command and control vehicle that escapes detection.", "The Future Combat Systems program is in its initial 2-year concept design phase. On May 9, 2000, DARPA and the Army selected four contractor teams to develop Future Combat Systems design concepts to provide the required objective force deployability, lethality, and survivability.

During a major war, the Army does not expect the Interim Brigade Combat Teams to directly replace heavy combat units for all missions, but rather to perform a broad range of missions suitable to their capabilities and characteristics, thereby supplementing the specialized capabilities of heavy units with their own specialized features and assets when appropriate.", "The Army plans to establish the new teams in two phases. Over the next 2 years, the Army plans to form two Initial Brigade Combat Teams using light armored surrogate vehicles on loan from Canada and other countries and other Army vehicles.

However, the Army provided room for its transformation plans within the request by terminating and restructuring ongoing weapon system programs. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) approved these changes to the Army\u2019s budget request on December 27, 1999. The Congress added a total of $864.5 million to the Army\u2019s request for transformation funding, increasing the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2001 appropriations to (1) $259.3 million in research and development funds for the Family of Interim Armored Vehicles, (2) $937 million in procurement for the Family of Interim Armored Vehicles, (3) $156.9 million in research and development funds for the Future Combat Systems, and (4) $268.6 million in procurement funds for other equipment needed for the transformation.", "Because of funding constraints, the Army has also changed some of its transformation plans.

On September 6, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) said that the Army required $23 billion to modernize its legacy force in fiscal years 2002 to 2007, but projected that it will only have about $15.5 billion for that purpose, a $7.5 billion shortfall.", "Additionally, some of the improved legacy systems are scheduled to enter the force about the time the Army plans the Future Combat Systems to begin entering the force in fiscal year 2008.

At this weight, the Crusader system will not be transportable in a C130-type aircraft\u2014a key requirement for the Army\u2019s interim and objective forces. The Crusader program is currently in its program definition and risk reduction phase and is not scheduled to be fielded until April 2008.

According to the Crusader project manager, the Army needs to spend over $2.9 billion in research and development funds from fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2008 to redesign and develop the Crusader system. The Army expects to replace the Crusader system with an indirect fire system that is expected to be part of the Future Combat Systems. According to Army officials, Crusader artillery systems will remain in the legacy force until the Army\u2019s conversion to its objective force is complete in 2032 under current plans.", "As part of the modernization of its legacy systems, the Army is also planning to develop a new, more efficient engine for its Abrams tanks. The new engine is needed to reduce the high costs of operating and maintaining the current Abrams tank engine. This engine also would be used in the Crusader system. Like the Crusader, the Abrams tank is expected to be replaced once Future Combat Systems are deployed. The total cost of this common engine program has been reported as nearly $3 billion. On September 20, 2000, the Army awarded a $195.7 million contract for the development and testing of the common engine. The contract is to continue through March 31, 2004. The Army expects to award a production contract in fiscal year 2003 for 2,845 engines for the Abrams tanks and one in fiscal year 2006 for 755 engines for the Crusader vehicles.

The November 16, 2000, contract award was about 3 months behind schedule. In the news conference announcing the award of the contract, the Director of the Army Acquisition Corps stated that the Army might have to add up to 16 months to the interim vehicle schedule. The start of work under that contract was delayed until April 9, 2001, by a formal bid protest. Although the Army has not formally changed its March 2001 date for equipping the first interim brigade, the date has passed and the Army did not direct the contractor to produce interim vehicles until after the protest was resolved.

Some of these advanced technologies have not been developed and others have experienced developmental delays. However, in June 2000, the Army Science Board identified 32 key technologies needed for the Future Combat Systems. The Board considered nine of these technologies key pacing technologies.

The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act establishes a goal for the armed services that one-third of their operational deep strike aircraft be unmanned by 2010 and one-third of their operational ground combat vehicles be unmanned by 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Following Best Practices Will Be Critical To The Army\u2019s Success", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s ability to meet its transformation goals will largely hinge on its ability to manage transformation acquisition efforts as successful commercial firms do. Our best practice reviews show that a commercial firm\u2019s success in developing new systems depends a great deal on balancing requirements against available resources and having the right knowledge at the right decision points for making trade-offs. Such knowledge would include the readiness of technology, accurate cost estimates, and the availability of funding.", "Specifically, our report on incorporating new technologies into programs indicated commercial firms that demonstrate a high level of maturity before new technologies are incorporated into product development programs puts those programs into a better position to succeed. Key to the Army\u2019s implementation of this best practice to develop and acquire objective force weapon systems during its transformation will be its ability to identify the key enabling technologies, determine the current maturity of each key technology, and develop a plan to develop the key technologies and demonstrate that they are at a high level of maturity before entering systems development. If all the key enabling technologies do not reach a high level of maturity when the Army needs to start developing the objective force systems, it may have to consider reaching the planned objective force capabilities in stages. This strategy could provide worthwhile capability increases, but it may also require the Army to continue with its legacy and interim forces longer than anticipated.", "Additionally, our report on setting requirements for new products indicated that commercial firms that keep the product\u2019s requirements flexible prior to the start of the program enables the matching of the requirements with the user\u2019s needs and the developer\u2019s resources making it more likely that the product will be successfully developed\u2014products that are delivered within predicted costs and time frames and that meet the needs of the customers. Key to the Army\u2019s implementation of this best practice is maintaining flexibility in requirements and schedule to enable it to make needed trade-offs. Also, the Army should be in a better position to make those trade-offs if it prioritizes requirements among and within the three forces and determines the importance of meeting the various force schedules within available transformation resources.", "Given the complexity of its organization and its current planning processes, the Army\u2019s chance of successfully implementing best practices will be increased if components are provided service-wide guidance that will ensure that decisions focus on achieving overall transformation acquisition goals. According to Army Staff officials, the Army has recognized the complexity of the task and has begun managing the transformation with the Transformation Campaign Plan. The Plan is a comprehensive approach to ensure integration and synchronization of efforts toward the development and fielding of the objective force.", "Lastly, the Army recognizes and is addressing many of the risks related to these challenges by making trade-off decisions. As such we are not making recommendations in this report. However, it will be important for the Congress to carefully study the Army\u2019s efforts and assess its transformation progress and priorities when deliberating future budget requests and to ensure that the Army is following a knowledge-based approach in making acquisition decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense generally agreed with the report.
