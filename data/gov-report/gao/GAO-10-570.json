Therefore, we believe that such  information could be reported. Finally, we believe that reporting  information on Vet Center spending and workload could enhance  information available for congressional oversight and that this reporting  could be done in a manner that maintains the distinction between services  provided by Vet Centers and VA medical centers.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

As part of this work, we examined VA\u2019s reporting  of its fiscal year 2009 spending and workload information in VA\u2019s fiscal  year 2011 congressional budget justification and whether VA reported this  information in any other publicly available report. To examine VA\u2019s  spending and workload for mental health services that VA provided in VA  medical centers and that VA paid non-VA providers to provide in  community settings, we analyzed national- and network-level data for  fiscal year 2009 obtained from the Veterans Health Administration Office  of Finance. To examine VA\u2019s workload for counseling services to address  mental health issues that are provided by VA Vet Centers, we analyzed  data obtained for fiscal year 2009 from the Veterans Health  Administration\u2019s Readjustment Counseling Service. Fiscal year 2009  spending data were not available for Vet Centers\u2019 counseling services to  address mental health issues. Fiscal year 2009 data were the most recently  available spending and workload data at the time of our review. To help us  understand how VA approaches mental health spending and workload, we  also reviewed VA\u2019s fiscal year 2008 spending and workload data, but we  did not include these data in the report.", "For our analysis of VA mental health spending, we used obligations\u2014VA\u2019s  cost of providing or paying for mental health services, including costs of  administering mental health services, and national overhead, which  includes the operating costs for VA headquarters, networks, and national  programs. We used obligations because VA reports obligations for mental  health services in its annual congressional budget submissions and VA  officials told us they routinely determine VA\u2019s spending for mental health  services using obligations data. Our analysis of VA mental health spending  does not include VA\u2019s costs of providing medications for the treatment of  mental health conditions. For our analysis of VA\u2019s mental health workload  in its medical centers, in community settings where VA pays non-VA  providers to provide mental health services, and in Vet Centers, we used  the following four workload measures: (1) unique patients\u2014unduplicated  count of patients receiving a particular type of service, (2) encounters\u2014 professional contacts between patients and providers for outpatient  services, (3) visits\u2014one or more professional contacts between a patient  and a provider on a single day, and (4) average daily census\u2014the average  number of patients receiving inpatient hospital, residential, or domiciliary  services on any given day during the course of the year. We chose these  measures because VA officials told us that they are key measures that are  relevant for measuring mental health workload.", "To examine variation in spending and workload we identified across VA\u2019s  networks, we conducted phone interviews with officials from a  judgmental sample of four VA networks\u2014Network 3 (Bronx), Network 8  (Bay Pines), Network 17 (Dallas), and Network 22 (Long Beach). We  selected these networks based on variation in geographic location, mental  health spending and workload, and the number of veterans enrolled in the  network. We also visited VA\u2019s Perry Point, Maryland, medical center to  better understand how VA provides and pays for mental health services.  We selected this medical center based on the range of mental health  services it provides and the medical center\u2019s proximity to Washington,  D.C.", "We also interviewed officials from VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration  Office of Finance, Readjustment Counseling Service, Office of Mental  Health Services, Mental Health Enhancement Initiative for Primary Care,  and Mental Health Workload and Data Analysis Workgroup. We  interviewed these officials to obtain information on VA\u2019s efforts to  determine and report complete and accurate information on its spending  and workload for mental health services. We also examined VA\u2019s reporting  of mental health spending and workload in its congressional budget  justifications for fiscal years 2006 through 2011 and whether VA reported  this information in any other publicly available report.", "We assessed the reliability of the national- and network-level data on VA\u2019s  spending and workload for mental health services in several ways. First,  we checked for internal consistency of VA documents detailing VA\u2019s  spending and workload for mental health services for fiscal year 2009.  Second, we compared the fiscal year 2009 spending and workload data we  obtained from VA with the fiscal year 2009 mental health data VA reported  in its fiscal year 2011 congressional budget justification. We also compared  fiscal year 2009 spending and workload data with VA\u2019s fiscal year 2008  spending and workload data. Third, we interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about VA\u2019s mental health services and about VA\u2019s mental  health spending and workload data and the processes used to calculate  them. We determined that the data we used in our analyses were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2009 through May 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, James Musselwhite, Assistant  Director; Janina Austin; Romuladus Azuine; Krister Friday; and Sarah  Harvey made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
