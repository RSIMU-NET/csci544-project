USCIS\u0092s Office of Citizenship (OoC) supports this process mainly through grants to immigrant-serving entities, but also with outreach activities and education materials. Other governmental and nongovernmental entities play a role in immigrant integration as well. GAO was asked to determine (1) the steps USCIS has taken to implement its integration programs and the extent to which it has assessed its grant program in particular, and (2) what federal mechanism exists to coordinate integration efforts. Among other things, GAO examined documentation on mission objectives and performance measures on immigrant integration and conducted interviews with officials in a nongeneralizable sample of cities and community-based organizations as well as senior USCIS officials about their immigrant integration efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USCIS has implemented immigrant integration efforts through outreach activities, educational materials, and a grant program, and established various measures for assessing its grant program, but has not yet set interim milestones for planned evaluations of the program. From 2008 to 2011, OoC reported conducting more than 300 significant outreach events to promote citizenship awareness and civic integration. Further, nearly half of OoC\u0092s funding over the past 3 fiscal years\u0097about $19.8 million\u0097was spent on grants aimed at preparing immigrants for the naturalization process. The grants were made to a myriad of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including public school systems and community and faith-based organizations. OoC has established various measures for assessing grantees\u0092 performance under its grant program. These measures include, for example, the number of participants enrolled in grantees\u0092 citizenship instruction and naturalization preparation programs, the number of participants who passed their naturalization examinations, and the proportion of participants who received grantees\u0092 services and self-reported that they naturalized during the year of the grant program. However, USCIS has identified inherent limitations with these measures, such as that its data were incomplete in part because data were self-reported by program participants, and not all program participants reported to grantees whether they passed the naturalization examination and naturalized. In January 2011, USCIS drafted a statement of work for a contractor to develop an evaluation plan that would allow USCIS to measure the grant program\u0092s performance and long-term impact, and this may help address these limitations. According to USCIS, it did not complete this statement of work or award a contract for an evaluation plan because, at that time, the agency was uncertain whether it would receive appropriations in fiscal year 2011 to continue the grant program, and the program has no authorizing statute. The final fiscal year 2011 law, enacted in April 2011, did allow the use of appropriations to fund the grant program, but USCIS did not proceed with developing an evaluation plan. In November 2011, USCIS reported that it plans to conduct an internal and external evaluation of the program in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively, contingent on appropriations for the grant program. However, USCIS has not yet set interim milestones for these evaluations. Setting such milestones, contingent on the receipt of funding, could help USCIS strengthen its planning for conducting those evaluations, consistent with program management standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USCIS set interim milestones for an internal and external evaluation of its immigrant integration grant program, to the extent that it receives fiscal years 2012 and 2013 appropriations for the program.

In 2009, it was estimated that about 39  million foreign-born individuals lived in the United States, making up more  than 12 percent of the U.S. population\u2014the largest share since 1920. Of  these, approximately 17 million were naturalized citizens; 11 million were  temporary or permanent residents with lawful status; and 11 million were  noncitizens without lawful immigration status. Integrating about 11 million  noncitizens with lawful immigration status into American society, with the  possibility of integrating potentially millions more if Congress passed  comprehensive immigration reform, would be a challenging task and  raises questions about how this would be accomplished and by whom.  Immigrant integration is generally described as a process that helps  immigrants achieve self-sufficiency, political and civic involvement, and  social inclusion in American communities. Numerous governmental and  nongovernmental organizations provide some form of immigrant  integration support. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has responsibility for a key  immigrant integration-related area\u2014the naturalization and citizenship  process. The Office of Citizenship (OoC) within USCIS is responsible for  implementing immigrant integration activities that fall within the  naturalization and citizenship process. The primary focus of these  activities is to prepare lawful permanent residents for citizenship by,  among other things, helping them attain the English language skills and  civics knowledge required for naturalization. OoC aims to accomplish  this by awarding grants to help immigrant-serving organizations with  citizenship preparation programs, conducting outreach and public  education activities to promote integration and citizenship, and developing  educational materials on the naturalization process. The largest single  activity that accounted for nearly half of OoC\u2019s budget over the past 3  years was its Citizenship and Integration Grant Program, which provides  competitive grants to public and private nonprofit organizations to  facilitate their ability to assist lawful permanent residents in becoming  naturalized U.S. citizens. In addition to USCIS, other federal agencies  provide some assistance for immigrant integration. For example, the  Department of Health and Human Services provides economic integration  assistance as part of its Refugee Resettlement program and the  Department of Education provides funding to states to support linguistic  integration in connection with its English language acquisition grants.

However,  according to USCIS, it is not feasible for grantees to obtain data on the  naturalization examination results and naturalization status for all  participants served through grant-funded programs because, among  other things, participants may choose not to report their results to  grantees or may decide not to naturalize. USCIS has instructed grantees  to develop a plan for working to obtain self-reported data for all program  participants, but it acknowledges that grantees may not be able to obtain  complete data from all program participants. Second, while USCIS has  extended the time period for grantees to report program data, USCIS may  not complete the processing of naturalization applications submitted by  program participants near the end of the performance period, given the  average reported application processing time of 4.7 months.", "To further strengthen its measurement of the performance of its grant  programs, USCIS announced its plan to conduct an evaluation of the  Citizenship and Integration Grant Program in the fiscal year 2011 grant  solicitations. However, USCIS has not yet conducted such an evaluation.  In January 2011, USCIS drafted a statement of work for a contractor to  refine the strategic plan for the grant program and develop an evaluation  plan that would allow USCIS to measure the grant program\u2019s  performance and long-term impact, and which may provide options to  help address these limitations. According to USCIS, it did not complete  this statement of work or award a contract for an evaluation plan  because, at that time, the agency was uncertain whether it would receive  appropriations in fiscal year 2011 to continue the grant program. DHS\u2019s  fiscal year 2011 appropriations act, enacted in April 2011, allowed the use  of appropriated funds for the grant program. However, USCIS did not  proceed with finalizing its statement of work or contracting for  development of an evaluation plan because it was unsure of whether it  would receive funding in fiscal year 2012 for the grant program. USCIS  requested about $19.7 million for fiscal year 2012 to fund through  appropriations all OoC\u2019s programs and activities, including the grant  program.", "In November 2011, USCIS reported that it plans to conduct an internal  evaluation of the grant program in fiscal year 2012 by, among other  things, assessing grantee data against stated program goals, program  assumptions, inputs, program activities, output targets, and outcomes.  According to USCIS, these data will be used to determine how resources,  activities, and outputs link together to meet short-term performance  metrics and longer-term outcomes (program goals) of the grant program.  Further, contingent on the availability of funds, USCIS reported that in  fiscal year 2013 it plans to contract for an external evaluation of the  overall grant program. USCIS intends for the contractor to examine how  well the current evaluation methodology measures the program\u2019s success  in meeting its goals, identify what aspects of the program contributed to  those achievements, and discover what barriers exist to the program  achieving its ideal results. Additionally, USCIS intends for the contractor  to make recommendations for improving evaluation methods for the grant  program and the effectiveness of program administration.", "Internal and external evaluations, such as those that USCIS has  announced its intention to implement, could help the agency reassess the  goals, objectives, and measures of its grant program, including helping to  address inherent challenges with USCIS\u2019s current measures, and better  evaluate the extent to which the program is achieving those goals and  objectives. Based on its uncertainty about whether the grant program will  continue to receive funding, USCIS has not yet established interim  milestones for its internal and external evaluations of the grant program,  such as milestones for initiating and completing the evaluations. Although  USCIS has stated its intention to conduct grant program evaluations in  fiscal years 2012 and 2013, USCIS also announced plans for an external  evaluation in fiscal year 2011, but as indicated, did not initiate or complete  that evaluation. Program management standards state that successful  execution of any program includes developing plans that include a  timeline for program deliverables. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government and the Office of Management and Budget also call  for agencies to have performance measures and indicators that are linked  to mission, goals, and objectives to allow for comparisons to be made  among different sets of data so that corrective actions can be taken if  necessary.of the grant program is a good way to objectively determine whether the  current program framework is achieving stated program goals, whether  grantees meet desired performance outcomes, how various program  implementation characteristics might correlate to other indicators of  program success, and whether the grant program should continue. To the   Further, according to USCIS, a program-specific evaluation  extent that USCIS receives funding in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 for the  grant program, initiating the planned internal and external evaluations  could provide USCIS with a mechanism for better evaluating its grant  program.

Immigrant integration efforts are dispersed across federal,  state, and local governments, as well as nongovernmental organizations.  In the absence of federal coordination, officials in city governments and  representatives from nongovernmental organizations told us that they  faced challenges in carrying out their immigrant integration efforts. For  example, one representative of a community-based nongovernmental  organization said that immigrant integration efforts vary in different  regions in the country, and that it would be helpful if the federal  government had better guidelines on what constitutes immigrant  integration and what is expected of organizations providing immigrant  integration services. Another nongovernmental organization  representative noted that a lack of coordination in immigrant integration  has resulted in a number of nonprofit organizations competing for funds,  such as for language classes serving noncitizens with different levels of  English proficiency. Additionally, government officials for three cities  noted that in the absence of federal guidance for immigrant integration,  state and local governments have been setting immigration policies  independently, some of which set a negative tone toward immigrants,  making it difficult to successfully integrate immigrants. Officials in one of  the three cities added that this may adversely affect the attitudes of  immigrant populations toward government, even when the immigrants do  not reside in those places.", "Our previous work has highlighted the benefits of actions that selected  federal agencies have taken to enhance and sustain collaborative efforts,  including the ability to leverage resources, improve quality, and expand  services. All representatives we interviewed from 15 governmental and  nongovernmental offices indicated a need for a national immigrant  integration strategy, federal coordination for immigrant integration efforts,  or both. For example, some representatives said that the federal  government could help stakeholders forge nationwide partnerships and  learn about best practices, and that a national strategy would help  develop a more consistent approach to immigrant integration. Also,  organizations such as the Migration Policy Institute, the National League  of Cities, and the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy  Coalition have called for a federal immigrant integration strategy.", "There has been recognition that improved coordination of immigrant  integration efforts would be beneficial, and there have been calls at the  federal level to develop a national immigrant integration capability. For  example, in 2006, a presidential executive order established a task force,  chaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security and comprising  representatives from 11 federal departments, including DHS, to provide  direction to the federal government and make recommendations to the  President on immigrant integration. The task force was also to provide  direction to executive departments and agencies on integration,  particularly through instruction in English, civics, and history. The task  force\u2019s 2008 report called for a national integration effort and stated that  federal institutionalization of immigrant integration would lend credibility  and support to federal, state, and local governments and other sectors of  society. DHS officials said that DHS facilitated the task force\u2019s activities  and led the effort to produce a final report, but no agency was designated  as the leader for a national immigrant integration effort. The task force,  while still technically active, has not met since the issuance of the report  in December 2008, according to DHS officials. Additionally, DHS\u2019s 2010  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report states that one of DHS\u2019s  goals is to strengthen and effectively administer the immigration system  by promoting the integration of lawful immigrants. This is to be carried out  by providing leadership, support, and opportunities to immigrants to  facilitate their integration into American society. The Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review Report notes that immigrant integration  requires leadership, but it does not delineate a framework for  accomplishing this. Instead, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review  Report notes that homeland security-related functions are dispersed and  decentralized and DHS is just one of several components involved in  carrying out the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review\u2019s strategic  framework. OoC officials told us that coordinating immigrant integration  activities nationwide could help immigrants navigate federal programs,  contribute to the development of a federal strategy and policy guidance,  help set measurable goals for immigrant integration, create opportunities  for the federal government to liaise with state governments and  nongovernmental organizations, and facilitate sharing best practices and  leveraging public-private partnerships.", "We previously reported that achieving meaningful national results in many  policy and program areas requires a combination of coordinated efforts  among various actors across federal agencies and among state, local,   Such coordination requires  and nongovernmental organizations.leadership commitment, agreed-upon goals and strategies, clearly  identified roles and responsibilities, and compatible policies and  procedures to be effective. USCIS officials stated that they believe that  DHS is uniquely situated to coordinate a multiagency effort given its  competencies in areas such as immigration services, immigrant  integration resources, enforcement, community security, among other  things. For example, according to USCIS officials, the agency has access  to all foreign-born individuals going through the U.S. immigration process.  USCIS has also established relationships with a number of  nongovernmental organizations involved in immigrant integration through  OoC\u2019s outreach efforts and its grant program. Further, USCIS has  engaged in dialogue at the local level and established partnerships at the  local level. For example, USCIS and the City of Los Angeles signed a  2010 letter of agreement to promote citizenship awareness, education,  and outreach events throughout the city. USCIS officials acknowledged  that USCIS\u2019s resources and authority for undertaking such an effort are  limited. The officials also said that since the release of the presidential  task force\u2019s 2008 report, DHS\u2019s role in immigrant integration has been  limited to those aspects of civic integration, such as citizenship and  promoting the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, discussed earlier  in this report.", "We were unable to meet with officials from the White House Domestic Policy Council  for the purposes of this report. in June 2010 to assess the roles and activities of the federal government  in promoting immigrant integration and to better coordinate integration  efforts across agencies. According to DHS officials, USCIS is an active  participant but not the lead agency in the council\u2019s meetings. Based on  OoC\u2019s 2010 report to the Office of Management and Budget, the working  group developed recommendations in support of a federal integration  strategy and consolidation of informational resources, programs, and  research through interagency collaboration. OoC\u2019s report to the Office of  Management and Budget also stated that in late 2010, the Domestic  Policy Council disbanded the working group and convened the New  Americans \u2013 Citizenship and Integration Initiative consisting of several  members of the working group, and led by the Interagency Steering  Committee.distilled the recommendations into three key immigrant integration policy  areas: civic integration (naturalization and civic participation), economic  integration (employment and economic advancement opportunities), and  linguistic integration (learning English to facilitate daily life and support  economic and social advancement). The steering committee also  developed a 2011 action plan to guide the development of strategic  initiatives in the three areas. However, according to DHS officials, a  timeline for implementation of the recommendations has not been  finalized, and any associated budget or planning process has not yet  started.

We reviewed the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created USCIS\u2019s Office of  Citizenship (OoC) to promote instruction and training and training on  citizenship responsibilities. We also examined documentation on mission  objectives and performance measures identified by the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and USCIS on immigrant integration, including  DHS\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2008 through 2013, 2010  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report, fiscal years 2011 and  2012 Budget in Brief reports, and annual performance report for fiscal  years 2010 through 2012; USCIS\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2008  through 2012 and fiscal year 2011 strategic goals and select initiatives;  and USCIS\u2019s Citizenship and Integration Grant Program requirements  and guidance. We interviewed DHS senior officials from DHS\u2019s Office of  Policy Development and USCIS offices, including OoC, the Office of  Public Engagement, the Office of Policy and Strategy, and the Field  Operations Directorate, to discuss their roles and responsibilities in how  the department defines and designates immigrant integration activities  and how it identifies and addresses immigrant integration needs. We  reviewed USCIS documentation and educational materials on the U.S.  citizenship and the naturalization process and strategies for outreach  activities in support of immigrant integration, including the Civics and  Citizenship Toolkit and the WelcometoUSA.gov website.", "To identify and observe USCIS\u2019s immigrant integration activities and  community-level efforts by cities and immigrant-serving organizations, we  selected a nonprobability sample of 10 locations for site visits and  telephone interviews. We visited Baltimore, Maryland; Chicago, Illinois;  Washington, D.C.; and Los Angeles, California. We conducted  semistructured telephone interviews with officials in New York, New York;  Boston, Massachusetts; Richmond, Virginia; Seattle, Washington;  Houston, Texas; and Miami, Florida. Using estimates from the U.S.  Census Bureau\u2019s 2010 American Community Survey and data from  DHS\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics, we selected these 10 locations  based on various factors, including the total number of foreign-born  residents, whether the region had a mixture of nationalities, the number  with limited English proficiency, the number of lawful permanent residents  eligible for naturalization, and recognition accorded the locations\u2019  immigrant integration programs. Additionally, we took into account the  proximity of USCIS offices and nongovernmental immigrant-serving  organizations, as well as organizations awarded Citizenship and  Integration Program grant funds in fiscal years 2009 or 2010.", "During our site visits, we interviewed officials in USCIS\u2019s Baltimore,  Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., district offices to identify  the role played by these offices in implementing USCIS local immigrant  integration activities. In these four cities, and via telephone in the other six  cities, we interviewed representatives of 10 community-based  organizations, including grantees and subgrantees, and officials in  government immigrant integration offices about their efforts to foster  immigrant integration and how local efforts benefit from federal immigrant  integration initiatives. Although our site visit and telephone interview  results cannot be generalized to other locations with foreign-born  populations, they provided us with valuable insights about actions USCIS  has taken to support immigrants\u2019 integration, how USCIS grant recipients  are using award funds to support integration, and actions taken by city  governments to address integration needs.", "To identify the steps DHS has taken to assess the results of its immigrant  integration efforts, we reviewed DHS documents with stated immigrant  integration directives and performance targets, and interviewed officials  and staff at the DHS Office of Policy Development and USCIS offices,  including OoC, the Office of Public Engagement, the Office of Policy and  Strategy, and the Field Operations Directorate, to obtain clarification on  DHS\u2019s efforts to delegate responsibilities and capture results of intra- agency actions to promote immigrant integration. We reviewed immigrant  integration accomplishments detailed and summarized in DHS\u2019s Budget  in Brief reports for fiscal years 2011, and 2012. We reviewed OoC\u2019s  tracking information for its citizenship promotion and immigrant integration  activities. We interviewed officials in USCIS district offices in the four  cities we visited to obtain information about their citizenship promotion  and immigrant integration outreach activities and the methods for  capturing activity results. To determine how OoC assesses its immigrant  integration efforts through its Citizenship and Integration Grant Program,  we reviewed grantee performance results during the first funding round in  fiscal year 2009, which had a 1-year performance period. We reviewed  grantees\u2019 reports to OoC on the number of participants registered for  direct services citizenship and English instruction courses, naturalization  applications filed, and participants naturalized, and we also examined  program results reported by grantees and results obtained via OoC staffs\u2019  on-site grantee performance monitoring during this performance period.  We interviewed OoC staff on their performance monitoring methods and  how they supported grantees through guidance and technical assistance.  We corroborated this information in our interviews with select grantees in  the four selected cities. Additionally, we viewed some of the citizenship  instruction programs, obtained grantee performance reports submitted to  OoC, and obtained documentation on the results of OoC\u2019s on-site grantee  monitoring efforts. Lastly, we interviewed some individual program  participants to learn about how the program had affected their progress  toward the goal of becoming naturalized, their perceptions on citizenship,  and their views on integrating into their communities.

We reviewed DHS reports, such as OoC\u2019s 2010  report, Improving Federal Coordination on Immigrant Integration, and its  2004 report, Helping Immigrants Become New Americans: Communities  Discuss the Issues, to identify DHS\u2019s findings on the extent to which  federal leadership is needed, and in what areas. We reviewed DHS\u2019s  Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report and the annual reports  and strategic plans of DHS, USCIS, and OoC to identify DHS\u2019s goals for  providing federal leadership.

The  information from these interviews is not generalizable to all cities or  nongovernmental organizations but provided valuable insights into how  such organizations view the federal government\u2019s support of immigrant  integration. We reviewed laws and proposed legislation to identify existing  and proposed policies for federal leadership in immigrant integration.

Specifically, the National Museum  of American History will provide instructional design and content expertise  for the development of lesson plans and multimedia presentations that  utilize content from the museum and other Smithsonian collections and  will incorporate the civics questions that may be asked during the  naturalization test. Separately, in 2010, USCIS provided funding to the  National Institute for Literacy, for the expansion of the America\u2019s Literacy  Directory, a web-based directory about literacy programs, to incorporate  citizenship preparation programs and classes. Also, as of July 2009,  USCIS and the Department of Education had in place an interagency  agreement to support a web-based tool for lessons in civics-and  citizenship-oriented English language learning, according to Homeland  Security and Educational Officials.", "State and local governments have also taken action to develop policies  and plans to foster immigrant integration. For example, governors in  Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington have  issued executive orders specifically to address immigrant integration  issues. These executive orders called for establishing an advisory body (e.g., a committee or a council) made up of key stakeholders, such as  state and local government officials and representatives of  nongovernmental organizations, to make policy recommendations on  immigrant integration. The advisory bodies have made recommendations  to, among other things, incorporate immigrant integration into state  education, workforce, and financial service programs; promote English  language proficiency and civics education; and centralize information  available to immigrants upon their arrival to the community. A common  objective of these executive orders was to develop policies and plans or  recommendations to provide immigrants with the tools to become self- sufficient and contribute to their communities.", "Local governments have also responded to the needs of immigrants in  their communities in ways that address immigrant integration issues. In  some cases, local officials serve as liaisons between city offices on  activities that foster immigrant integration. For example, the liaisons may  encourage offices to provide information in multiple languages on  workforce training, library services, or other available services or to  incorporate activities geared toward immigrants into local social service  programs. Other local governments provide information clearinghouses  for immigrant communities, referring individuals to local services or  community-based organizations that can assist with various aspects of  immigrant integration, including English and citizenship classes, legal  services, and vocational training.", "Across the country, governmental and nongovernmental organizations\u2014 including community-based groups, social service organizations, ethnic  associations, local public school systems, universities and community  colleges, refugee resettlement agencies, health centers and hospitals,  religious institutions, unions, and law firms\u2014have joined together to form  coalitions to advocate for and serve as resources to immigrants and  promote their integration into American society.
