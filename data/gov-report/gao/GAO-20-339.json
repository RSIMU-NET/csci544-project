In 2019, the F-35 program conducted much of its planned operational testing but extended the schedule by 9 months, which delays the program's full-rate production decision to between September 2020 and March 2021. Over that time, the program will continue to deliver aircraft.", "In addition, while the F-35 program has increased the production rate and negotiated lower aircraft prices, it is not meeting manufacturing leading practices identified by GAO. Specifically, only about 3,000 of the over 10,000 airframe contractor's manufacturing key processes meet predefined design standards for ensuring product quality. Also, the fielded aircraft, over 500 so far, do not meet the program's reliability and maintainability goals. Although the contractor is changing manufacturing processes to address problems and improve efficiency, more remains to be done. Unless the program office evaluates the risks of not meeting these leading practices, the military services and international partners are at risk of not receiving the quality aircraft they purchased.", "In addition, the July 2019 suspension of Turkey from the F-35 program\u2014due to security concerns after its acquisition of Russian defense equipment\u2014is likely to compound production risks. The program has identified new sources for 1,005 parts produced by Turkish suppliers, but the program is assessing the effect of 15 key parts not currently being produced at the needed production rate.", "In 2019, estimated development costs to modernize the F-35's hardware and software systems\u2014known as Block 4\u2014increased by over $1.5 billion. The cost increase puts estimated Block 4 development costs at $12.1 billion. However, the cost estimate did not fully adhere to leading practices, such as including all life cycle costs. In addition, while development will continue through 2026, reports on Block 4 that the program submits to Congress are slated to end in 2023. Without continued Block 4 reporting through the development phase, Congress will lack important oversight information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider extending DOD's reporting requirement for Block 4 modernization beyond 2023.

The F-35\u2019s key capabilities include low-observable, or stealth, technology  combined with advanced sensors and computer networking capabilities.  The F-35\u2019s acquisition cost increased by over $22 billion in 2019, in part  due to the addition of estimated costs for its modernization efforts, or  Block 4.

However, the program still faces risks ahead of that decision. We have  reported on these and other program risks in the past and made  recommendations for improvement. DOD has taken action to address  some, but not all, of our recommendations.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD started the F-35 program in 2001 to develop a fifth-generation  fighter aircraft intended to replace a range of aging aircraft in the U.S.  military services\u2019 inventories and to provide enhanced capabilities to  warfighters that capitalized on technological innovations. Among other  capabilities, the program designed the F-35 aircraft to be difficult to  observe using radar and include sensors that can provide insights into  potential targets and other warfighting information. The program is  producing and delivering three variants of the F-35 aircraft:  the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Air Force,  the F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing variant for the Marine  Corps, and  the F-35C carrier-suitable variant for the Marine Corps and the Navy.", "The characteristics of the services\u2019 variants are similar, but each variant  also has unique operating requirements. For example, the Marine Corps  requires that the F-35B be capable of operating from aircraft carriers,  amphibious ships, and main and austere operating bases alike, requiring  the capability to conduct short takeoffs and vertical landings. Figure 1  shows an F-35B exercising this capability.", "While DOD plans to purchase 2,470 aircraft for the U.S. services, the F- 35 program is acquiring more than just aircraft. The complete F-35 air  system has eight elements, including training and maintenance systems.  Figure 2 shows the eight elements that make up the entire F-35 Air  System and how they each support the aircraft.", "For example, the program intends for the Automated Logistics Information  System (ALIS) to provide the necessary logistics tools to F-35 program  participants as they operate and sustain the F-35 aircraft. To do this, ALIS  consists of multiple software applications designed to support different  squadron activities, such as supply chain management, maintenance,  training management, and mission planning. For the F-35 aircraft to have  full capability, each element of the air system has to be developed and  fielded in sync with the aircraft. However, we found in March 2020 that  problems with ALIS still pose significant challenges to day-to-day F-35  operations. According to DOD, it plans to replace ALIS with a new  system named the Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN).  Furthermore, DOD reports that it is currently developing a strategy for  ODIN, which will include key tasks, milestones and schedule, risks and  opportunities, governance structure, and cost estimates. We concluded  that, as DOD proceeds with replacing ALIS with ODIN, it will be important  for the department to carefully consider and assess the key technical and  programmatic uncertainties that we reported in March 2020. These  include how much of ALIS will be incorporated in ODIN and the extent to  which DOD has access to the data it needs to play a more active role in  the management of the system. These issues are complex, and will  require significant direction and leadership to resolve.", "Further, we reported in March 2020 that the F-35 program office was not  able to provide us with historic costs showing how much the department  had spent on ALIS over the years. Also, because DOD had not answered  key questions about the future of the system, such as the extent to which  the re-design will incorporate current ALIS software, DOD has not been  able to develop accurate cost estimates for the ALIS re-design. We  recommended that DOD develop and implement a strategy for the re- design of ALIS. The strategy should be detailed enough to clearly  identify and assess the goals, key risks or uncertainties, and costs of re- designing the system. DOD concurred with the recommendation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Status of F-35 Program Development and Costs as of April 2019", "paragraphs": ["DOD began development of the F-35 aircraft in 2001 without adequate  knowledge of its critical technologies or a solid design, as we reported in  March 2005.

In our prior work, we identified the F-35 program\u2019s lack of  adequate knowledge and high levels of concurrency as the major drivers  of the program\u2019s eventual significant cost and schedule growth, among  other performance shortfalls.", "Since 2001, the program has been rebaselined with new cost and  schedule estimates three times. DOD initiated the most recent  restructuring in 2010 when the program\u2019s cost estimates for each aircraft  exceeded critical thresholds established by statute\u2014a condition known as  a Nunn-McCurdy breach. DOD then established a new acquisition  program baseline that increased the program\u2019s cost estimates by $162.7  billion and extended delivery schedules 5-6 years into the future. This last  revision is the current program baseline, reflecting the cost and schedule  estimates to deliver the aircraft and systems and to meet the original  program requirements.", "From 2018 to 2019, the total cost estimate of the F-35 acquisition  program increased by $22 billion, from $406 billion to over $428 billion.  This increase was partially due to the addition of the estimated Block 4  modernization costs. Block 4 includes efforts to enhance and add  capabilities\u2014beyond the F-35 baseline program\u2014through hardware and  software upgrades. In April 2019, the F-35 program estimated that Block  4 development and procurement costs would add $13.9 billion to the  program\u2019s total baseline cost. Beyond this Block 4 increase, the F-35  program baseline costs also increased by $8 billion over the program\u2019s  2018 estimate.", "Table 1 outlines the program\u2019s baseline costs, the Block 4 modernization  costs, and the sum total of the baseline and Block 4 cost estimates since  2001.", "In addition to the acquisition costs above, the program estimates that the  sustainment costs to operate and maintain the F-35 fleet for its planned  66-year life cycle are $1.2 trillion, bringing the total cost of the F-35  program to over $1.6 trillion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Testing, Production, and Reliability and Maintainability as of December 2019", "paragraphs": ["The F-35 program office, in coordination with the Director of Operational  Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), received approval to conduct some  preliminary operational testing in January 2018.

The purpose of operational  testing is to assess the effectiveness, suitability, survivability, lethality,  and mission capability of the F-35, including the information systems and  the air vehicle, in an operationally representative environment.", "Operational testing includes cybersecurity assessments, some of which  the program has conducted. The program plans for the remaining testing  to take place through at least September 2020, while the program  continues to produce and deliver aircraft.", "Through 2019, F-35 program test officials had identified over 3,200  deficiencies. Deficiencies represent specific instances where the weapon  system either does not meet requirements or where the safety, suitability,  or effectiveness of the weapon system could be affected. The test  officials categorize deficiencies according to their potential impact on the  aircraft\u2019s performance.", "Category 1 deficiencies are critical and could jeopardize safety,  security, or another requirement.", "Category 2 deficiencies are those that could impede or constrain  successful mission accomplishment.", "In June 2018, we recommended that the program resolve all critical  deficiencies before making a full-rate production decision, in part, to  reduce the potential for additional concurrency costs stemming from  continuing to produce aircraft while testing was ongoing. DOD  concurred with our recommendation and stated that it would resolve  critical deficiencies before full-rate production, currently planned to occur  between September 2020 and March 2021.", "Production of the aircraft began one year after testing started in 2007,  while development was in its early stages. Due to the concurrency of  testing and production, according to an F-35 program official, as many as  550 aircraft delivered through 2020 will need retrofits to fix deficiencies  and design issues found during testing. The program refers to the cost  of these fixes as its concurrency cost, which the program estimates at  $1.4 billion; this estimate did not change with the program\u2019s last update in  2019. Until operational testing is complete, there is a risk that the  program may identify additional deficiencies. As a result, as we have  previously reported, the concurrency costs of retrofitting delivered aircraft  could increase.", "In our June 2018 report, we found that the program was not on track to  meet its reliability and maintainability (R&M) performance targets. R&M  targets indicate how much time the aircraft will be in maintenance rather  than operations. We concluded that the program was missing a prime  opportunity to infuse affordability into the aircraft\u2019s future with better R&M  performance. As a result, we recommended that the F-35 program office  identify what steps it needed to take to ensure the F-35 meets R&M  requirements and update the R&M Improvement Program with these  steps. DOD concurred with the recommendations, noting that the F-35  program office would update the R&M Improvement Program with the  steps needed to ensure continued progress towards its goals. In April  2019, we found that F-35 R&M performance had shown some small  improvements but that the program could take more actions to meet the  R&M targets. We made additional recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense, with which DOD concurred and has taken some actions to  implement. Currently, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD (A&S)) is the acquisition decision  authority for the F-35 program, and would direct the F-35 program office  to take any further actions. In 2019, the program\u2019s R&M performance  generally remained unchanged. However, measurable improvements in  R&M can take time to manifest.

DOD refers to this approach as Continuous Capability  Development and Delivery (C2D2). This method is loosely based on the  Agile software development process. With this approach, the program  plans to deliver capabilities to the warfighter faster than it did during the  baseline development program. For example, rather than take years to  develop and deliver all the required capabilities to the warfighter, the  program intends to incrementally develop, test, and deliver small groups  of capabilities every 6 months. In January 2018, to transition from the  baseline development program to its Block 4 activities, the F-35 program  started using the C2D2 approach to develop and test software updates to  address deficiencies identified during testing.", "The planned $13.9 billion Block 4 effort exceeds the statutory and  regulatory thresholds for what constitutes a major defense acquisition  program, and Block 4 is more expensive than many of the other major  weapon acquisitions already in DOD\u2019s portfolio. To provide better  oversight into Block 4 activities, in 2016, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense hold a milestone B review\u2014a critical point in an  acquisition program leading to the engineering and manufacturing  development phase\u2014and manage it as a separate major defense  acquisition program.

Specifically, as of February 2020, according to test officials, the  program completed 156 flight tests. The program must still conduct four  open-air flight tests, the remaining cybersecurity tests of the air vehicle and mission systems, and 64 simulated flight tests. The 9-month delay  needed to complete testing, however, also provides additional time for the  program to address our June 2018 recommendation that it resolve critical  deficiencies before making its full-rate production decision, currently  planned to occur between September 2020 and March 2021.", "Figure 3 shows the test schedule as of 2019, the delay to the schedule  into 2020, and the remaining tests events planned.", "The completion of operational testing hinges on three main tasks: (1) the  final four open-air flight tests; (2) cybersecurity testing; and (3) the final  development, integration, verification and validation of its simulator and  64 simulated flight tests.", "First, the program expects to complete the four remaining open-air tests  between March and April 2020. To conduct these tests, the program must  finish moving the Radar Signal Emulators\u2014test assets that simulate long- range threat radars\u2014from the Nevada Test and Training Range to the  Point Mugu Sea Range in California. According to test officials, there is  some risk with this move, such as damage to the sensitive test equipment. The test facilities will have to integrate the equipment into the  testing infrastructure at Point Mugu.", "Second, while the program has conducted cybersecurity testing on  several aspects of the F-35 aircraft and support systems, three air vehicle  subsystems tests and two enterprise-level ALIS tests remain. The  program expects to complete these by August 2020.The tests completed  to date have identified multiple cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The F-35  program office has taken steps to address some identified vulnerabilities  and is working to address the remainder. Test officials stated that some of  the delays to cybersecurity testing of the aircraft are due to safety  concerns and the risk of losing the use of a test aircraft before testing is  complete.", "According to DOD policy, cybersecurity testing should be conducted as  early in the operational test cycle as possible. Leaving this critical  testing to the end of operational testing adds risk to the program because  the program will not know the extent to which the aircraft may have  cybersecurity vulnerabilities until near the expected decision to proceed to  full-rate production. If the program cannot finish these tests by  September 2020, officials stated that DOT&E could require that the  cybersecurity testing be completed in follow-on testing and not hold up  the full-rate production decision. Any additional cybersecurity  vulnerabilities may require more time to develop and implement plans to  address vulnerabilities in aircraft that have already been produced and  those slated for production.", "Lastly, the program has not been able to complete the F-35 Joint  Simulation Environment, which we refer to as the aircraft simulator, on  time. The simulator runs the F-35\u2019s mission systems software along with other software models (such as other weapons and modern threat  systems) to provide complex test scenarios that the program cannot  replicate in a real-world environment. We reported in April 2019 that the  simulator\u2019s development was behind schedule and was a risk to  operational testing. Since then, the program has struggled to develop  the complex software and functionality needed to complete the simulator.", "The difficulties stem, in part, from the program office\u2019s original plan to  have the contractor, Lockheed Martin, develop the simulator. However, in  August 2017, program office officials decided that the contractor\u2019s  proposal was considered to be too expensive. To mitigate concerns over  the cost of the proposal, the program decided to have the Navy complete  the work. The program originally expected the Navy\u2019s simulator to be  ready for testing in 2017, but it is now 3 years behind schedule. According  to program office officials, the simulator\u2019s development effort has taken  longer than expected to integrate F-35 aircraft and sensor data, in part  because the contractor claimed the data as its own intellectual property.  These issues were resolved by 2019 when the contractor provided the  necessary data. Because of these delays, the program now expects that  the simulator will be ready by August 2020, with the planned simulator  testing expected to take about 3 weeks. According to test officials, there  is increased risk that the completion of the simulator may face additional  delays to correct deficiencies and add needed capabilities, but also stated  that they can complete the tests by August 2020.", "Due to these delays to completing operational testing, the program has  delayed its full-rate production decision by at least an additional 9  months. Though the program is working toward September 2020, the  program has acknowledged this decision could be made as late as March  2021. Any additional delays due to challenges with moving the  emulators, completing the simulator, or cybersecurity testing could further  delay the end of operational testing and the program\u2019s decision to enter  into full-rate production. This delay, however, gives the program more  time to complete two key steps consistent with statute and DOD policy.", "Complete operational testing, which is intended to demonstrate that  the aircraft are operationally suitable.", "Resolve all deficiencies, which should be done prior to full-rate  production, and is discussed below.", "Even with these delays, the program plans to have produced and  delivered over 550 aircraft before operational testing is complete, adding  to the risk of finding more deficiencies that will require retrofits\u2014at  additional cost\u2014for the delivered aircraft. Statute and DOD policy states  that the preliminary low-rate production quantities will be set at the  development request for proposal decision point. If, at that time, low-rate  initial production quantities are determined to be above 10 percent of the  total quantity planned, the Secretary of Defense must explain the reasons  for the increase in a report to Congress. When a program reaches the  planned low-rate initial production quantity, and requires to exceed the  quantity, the program may seek approval to produce quantities above that  amount. The F-35 program will have delivered more than 10 percent of  the total planned production quantities\u2014due to the necessity to prevent a  break in production\u2014before operational testing and the full-rate  production decision are complete. As noted above, this approach has  contributed to the $1.4 billion in concurrency costs already incurred by the  program.", "The program reports that none of the category 1 deficiencies is a  safety of flight concern and all of them have operational workarounds.

The contractor also delivered  more aircraft on time in 2019. According to contractor officials, the  improved rates of on-time delivery are partially a result of the contractor\u2019s  efforts to obtain a performance incentive fee that was added to the lot 11  production contract. The program intended the incentive fee to focus the  contractor on improving its performance in the final assembly phase of  production, which was expected to improve its on-time deliveries. To earn  the incentive fee, contractor representatives told us they took several  steps to improve production rates. For example, because the F-35Cs  were taking longer to produce and all variants had to move through the  same final assembly area, the contractor made a separate final assembly  line for the F-35Cs so work could proceed without delaying the other  variants. This step, according to program office officials, allowed the  contractor to improve on-time deliveries for F-35As and F-35Bs.

For example, the average number of hours needed to build an  aircraft decreased slightly for the F-35A but increased for the B and C  variants. Defense Contract Management Agency officials told us the  increase was partly attributable to new personnel. In particular, since  January 2017, the contractor has hired and trained nearly 1,700 new  personnel to accommodate increased production rates\u2014nearly doubling  its workforce. New personnel take time to train and gain experience on  the production line. According to contractor representatives, as these new  employees become more experienced and produce more aircraft, they  expect the metric to improve.", "The contractor\u2019s amount of rework needed was also mixed. During the  course of production, the contractor may identify issues with a part or a  process, which, in turn, may lead to scrap, rework, and repair to replace  or fix the issue. Between 2016 and 2017, most F-35 variants realized  improvements in the amount of scrap, rework, and repair needed. In 2018  and 2019, however, only the F-35A continued to show improvements.  Figure 8 shows the average total hours for scrap, rework, and repair for  each variant since 2016.", "According to the program office, the increased production rate posed a  challenge, and because the contractor has not built as many F-35Cs, this  has added to the increase in scrap, rework and repair.

The contractor continues to change  some of its production processes, and in other cases, is not following its  own established processes well, which has led to several quality issues  over the years. For example, in 2018, we reported that the contractor had  halted deliveries of aircraft after the Air Force identified corrosion between  the aircraft\u2019s surface panels and the airframe because the contractor did  not apply a primer when it attached the panels. We reported in 2019  that the program office, the contractor, and the F-35 Program Executive  Officer reached a mutual agreement on the cost to resolve this issue, the  details of which they did not disclose publicly. In November 2019, a  mechanic identified titanium fasteners installed in an area of the aircraft  where the design calls for a fastener stronger than titanium. According to  the program office, the incorrect fasteners were installed on most already- fielded F-35 aircraft. That same month, the contractor started  implementing its corrective action plan. As of March 2020, the F-35  program office had reviewed and approved the contractors\u2019 analysis as  well as its durability and damage reports on the use of these fasteners.  We describe other key F-35 technical risks in appendix V.", "Over the years, the airframe contractor has continued to change and  refine production processes, aiming to improve efficiency amidst  concurrent development and production.

To  address this issue, the prime contractor developed a new tool that helps  the installer route the wires more consistently.", "While process changes like these can improve the quality of the product,  they also indicate that the overall production process are not in control  less than a year before the program\u2019s planned full-rate production  decision, or milestone C review. In 2019, according to our analysis, the  total number of key F-35 manufacturing processes identified in the final  assembly phase increased 70 percent, to a total of over 10,000 critical  processes. Furthermore, of these critical processes, only 30 percent are  currently able to produce a product within predefined design standards.  According to manufacturing leading practices, critical processes should  be repeatable, sustainable, and consistent in producing parts within  quality standards. Meeting these practices provides confidence that the  contractor can produce the product within cost, schedule, and quality  targets.

The R&M  goals lay out specific quantitative goals aimed at ensuring that an aircraft  will be available for operations as opposed to out of service for  maintenance. We reported in April 2019 that the F-35 aircraft in service  around the world were still not meeting all of their R&M goals and  recommended the program take actions to ensure that the aircraft would  meet those goals. Despite some improvement in 2019, the program is  not meeting half of its R&M goals. Until the program does so, the  warfighter will continue to accept aircraft for delivery that are less reliable  and more costly to maintain than originally planned. For details on the F- 35\u2019s R&M performance, see appendix IV.", "The program has not met these two leading manufacturing practices, in  part, due to the changes the airframe contractor made and continues to  make to the production line and the program\u2019s concurrent approach to  acquisition. We have repeatedly found that DOD programs that moved  into full-rate production carrying manufacturing risks experienced billions  of dollars in cost growth in production, and nearly two-thirds reported  increases in average procurement unit costs. With the risks the F-35  program still faces, it may realize additional cost and schedule growth if  these production risks are not evaluated. Despite these risks, the program  has continued to push forward with increased production rates and has  not taken actions to determine the potential impact of not meeting these  leading practices may have on future production and overall life-cycle  costs.", "Furthermore, according to a program official, the F-35 program has not  completed a comprehensive assessment of production risks and does not  plan to ahead of its full-rate production decision.

According to an official with that  office, Turkish suppliers will provide parts through the end of lot 14  deliveries (scheduled to take place through 2022), in part, to avoid  disruptions to aircraft deliveries and additional cost growth from standing  up new suppliers. The F-35 program office identified that Turkish  companies supplied 1,005 parts for the F-35 airframe and engine and  some of these parts have been provided by only one supplier.

According to program officials, some of these  new parts suppliers will not be producing at the rate required until next  year, as roughly 10 percent are new to the F-35 program. Airframe  contractor representatives stated it would take over a year to stand up  these new suppliers, with lead times dependent on several factors, such  as part complexity, quantity, and the supplier\u2019s production maturity. In addition, these new suppliers are required to go through qualification and  testing to ensure the design integrity for their parts.

While the  program office updates its cost estimate regularly, officials told us that  they do not intend to address some of these missing elements in future  updates.", "Work breakdown structure. According to cost estimating leading  practices, the program should base its cost estimate on a program- level, product-oriented WBS that allows a program to track cost and  schedule by defined deliverables, such as hardware or software  components. The WBS ensures that the program does not leave out  any portions of the work and makes it easier to compare it to similar  systems and programs. According to program officials, the Block 4  cost estimate does not rely on a single WBS; rather, multiple,  contractor-derived WBSs exist for the program.

However, overall  program risk management is different from quantitative cost risk and  uncertainty analyses in that program risk management is not specific  to costs and it is not used to assess the cost variance of the cost  estimate itself. When planning for funding decisions for a program of  this scale, analyzing program-level risks alone is inadequate. Without  a risk analysis, the cost estimate will not be fully accurate or credible  because it will not account for the effects of potential schedule slips or  other risks that the program could realize.", "Technology maturity. A program office official stated that in  developing the cost estimate they did not consider that technologies  would not be mature, but rather assumed that most technologies  needed to deliver each Block 4 capability would be mature before the  program begins development for that capability. The official stated  that the complexity of design, development, and testing based on the  baseline program experience was reflected in the estimate, but the  cost estimate did not identify if there were specific costs associated  with maturing these technologies. The official further noted that Block  4 costs would increase if a capability takes longer than planned to  design, integrate, and test due to its immaturity. In 2019, we  recommended that the Secretary of Defense ensure that the F-35  program office completes an independent technology readiness  assessment, as part of its business case for the initial Block 4  capabilities, before initiating additional development work.

Leading practices indicate that mature  production lines\u2014production lines ready for full-rate production\u2014should  meet metrics for consistency. Furthermore, to minimize production risk  and potential cost growth, suppliers should routinely meet quality and  delivery schedules, although this is not yet true of the F-35 program. Not  meeting these leading practices poses risks that DOD and the  international partners will not routinely receive the F-35\u2019s they specified  and need. The long-standing challenges with receiving parts on time and  efforts underway to replace Turkish suppliers of parts for the F-35  compound these production challenges and may raise additional risks.
