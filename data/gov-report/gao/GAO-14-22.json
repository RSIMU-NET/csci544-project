WBSCM had significant deficiencies when it was implemented in April 2011, which led USAID to discontinue using it to procure ocean freight for bulk commodities, manage prepositioned or stockpiled commodity inventory, and track food aid shipments. For example, WBSCM was slow and time consuming to use and its process to procure ocean freight for bulk commodities was not compatible with USAID's process to negotiate contracts with ocean freight vendors. USDA currently uses WBSCM to procure food aid commodities, while USAID procures ocean freight using other systems not connected to WBSCM. Since March 2012, USDA has made changes to WBSCM, and USDA officials assert that these changes address some of the problems that led to USAID's decision to discontinue use of the system.", "Since USAID uses systems outside of WBSCM, USAID and USDA lack information on individual food aid shipments, which, in turn, hinders USDA's ability to use WBSCM to prepare reports and efficiently file claims against ocean carriers to recover U.S. government funds. GAO's Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that information should be accurately recorded and communicated to those who need it and in a form that enables them to carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. USAID relies on freight forwarders to track and periodically provide information on shipments. In GAO's work for a recent report, we found that freight forwarders did not collect complete or consistent information on emergency food aid shipments. Without accurate information from its freight forwarders, USAID is limited in its ability to generate accurate information on food aid shipments. In addition, GAO found that USAID and its warehouse contractors did not always accurately record all prepositioned commodity inventory transactions. USAID provides this potentially inaccurate information to USDA officials who enter this information into WBSCM to generate quarterly financial statements. Moreover, USAID's data collection outside WBSCM makes it more difficult for USDA to file claims efficiently against ocean freight vendors and recover U.S. funds because USDA officials must manually enter USAID information. According to USDA officials, USDA filed 131 such claims in fiscal year 2012 valued at $1.2 million.", "USDA and USAID are not collaborating effectively to resolve their disagreement on the usefulness of WBSCM. In prior work, GAO identified key elements of effective collaboration that can enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies. Although USDA and USAID's collaborative efforts have incorporated some of these elements to develop WBSCM, they have not incorporated others. Specifically, USDA and USAID do not agree on the roles and responsibilities of key participants in the process, do not share a defined outcome for their collaboration, and do not have a written agreement stating how the agencies will collaborate. An upcoming functional upgrade of WBSCM offers an opportunity to make substantial changes that are mutually agreeable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended the agencies work together to ensure USDA receives accurate prepositioned inventory data, improve WBSCM's functionality by testing modified functions, and develop a written agreement that clearly outlines outcomes and roles and responsibilities for using WBSCM.

However, USAID may also  preposition commodities in domestic and overseas warehouses located  near regions of the world with historically high emergency food aid  needs. Using this approach, USAID requests commodities from USDA  and ships them to a warehouse before a need for the commodities is  identified. For the commodities shipped to warehouses, ocean freight  vendors submit invoices directly to USAID for payment, and USDA retains  ownership of the commodities until cooperating sponsors pick up the  commodities from the warehouses, according to USDA. As a result,  commodities in these warehouses remain on USDA\u2019s accounting ledger  as inventory assets until cooperating sponsors make requests and take  possession of the commodities for their programs.

According to USDA officials, WBSCM did not have the capability to  process ocean freight claims when the system was first implemented, so  USDA requested USAID, cooperating sponsors, freight forwarders, and  others to submit claims documentation outside of WBSCM. Although  USDA officials say claims could be processed through WBSCM since  November 2012, USAID and freight forwarders continue to provide  documents via email, and regular mail instead of uploading documents  into WBSCM.", "USDA\u2019s guidance also required freight forwarders to provide freight contracts and  discharge/delivery surveys, among other documents. In addition, the guidance required  cooperating sponsors to sign off their rights to have USDA to pursue a claim on their  behalf. accurate information on the amount USAID actually paid. During the  course of GAO\u2019s work, USAID contacted USDA and made arrangements  to provide the necessary documents to assist USDA in its claims process.

Although USDA\u2019s and USAID\u2019s efforts have incorporated  some practices to enhance and sustain collaboration they have not  incorporated others. As we mentioned above, the agencies held weekly  meetings to identify needs and priorities, created an action list, and  assigned relevant individual USDA and USAID officials to specific tasks  on the list between November and December 2011. However, by March  2012, the agencies could not agree on how to move forward with using  WBSCM to procure bulk ocean freight and USAID has not tested changes  that USDA has made to the system since March 2012. Specifically, USDA  and USAID do not agree on the roles and responsibilities of key  participants in the international food aid procurement process, do not  share a defined outcome for their collaboration, and do not have a written  agreement stating how the agencies will collaborate.", "Clarify roles and responsibilities. While USDA and USAID have  designated some roles and responsibilities between themselves, they  do not agree on the role and responsibilities that the freight forwarders  should have in entering and updating information in WBSCM. Our  prior work found that a key factor of effective collaboration is that  agencies clarify the roles and responsibilities of those participating in  the collaborative effort. During the design phase of WBSCM, the  agencies assigned the freight forwarders responsibility for entering  information about individual shipments and updating the information  whenever there were changes. However, freight forwarders we  interviewed have said they were not consulted by either agency and,  after WBSCM was rolled out, they expressed concerns about the  amount of information they needed to update, according to agency  documents and officials. They noted that entering such information  into WBSCM was redundant with their own systems, cumbersome,  and time consuming given the system problems WBSCM was  experiencing. As we previously noted, USAID informed USDA in June  2012 that they would no longer require the freight forwarders to  update shipment information in WBSCM for USAID\u2019s international  food aid shipments. The lack of updated information has created  challenges for USDA in processing claims and ensuring that they  have accurate inventory information.", "Agree on common goals. USDA and USAID established some joint  action items for WBSCM, but they do not agree on a common goal for  its further development and use of WBSCM. Our prior work has found  that most experts we interviewed in collaborative resource  management emphasize the importance of collaborative groups  having clear goals. Experts noted that participants may not have the  same interests, but establishing common goals provides them a  reason to participate in the process. After the rollout, as problems  arose, USDA and USAID agreed that USAID would suspend using the  system for bulk freight procurement, and then for tracking  prepositioned food aid inventory. They also agreed that freight  forwarders would not be required to update freight information as  changes in the shipments occurred. While the agencies collaborated  to resolve some problems, such as creating a role for the stevedores  in WBSCM, they have not resolved whether USAID would resume  trying to use WBSCM fully for bulk freight procurement, tracking and  updating information on shipments, and recording prepositioned food  aid inventory. As we noted above, as of February 2014, USAID had  not agreed to test the changes that USDA made to the system since  March 2012 to improve its performance and functionality to procure  emergency food aid. In its response to this report, USAID stated that it  would test the international procurement functions of WBSCM.", "Written collaborative agreements. USDA and USAID have not  documented how they would further develop and use WBSCM, or  how they would resolve their outstanding issues. Our prior work found  that agencies that articulate their agreements in formal documents  can strengthen their commitment to working collaboratively. As we  have previously reported, having a clear and compelling rationale to  work together is a key factor in successful collaborations. Agencies  can overcome significant differences when such a rationale and  commitment exist. USDA and USAID have a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) concerning the emergency food aid program  that FSA and USAID signed in 1991. FSA and USAID have drafted,  but not yet signed, an updated MOU that USDA\u2019s General Counsel is  currently reviewing. According to USDA officials, both MOUs generally  cover USAID\u2019s and USDA\u2019s roles and responsibilities in carrying out  emergency food aid operations.

In September 2013, USDA  began a technical upgrade of WBSCM to replace some system  components and software that are obsolete and are increasingly difficult  to maintain. According to USDA officials, the technical upgrade should  also result in some benefits for users, such as improved performance,  and allow users to better segregate and identify the cost of split  shipments. In addition, the technical upgrade will enable users to access  the system using the most current versions of Internet Explorer, which is  a widely used Internet browser. A USDA official cautioned, however, that  because USDA has just begun making this upgrade, it cannot be sure of  the full scope of the improvements that will occur.", "The technical upgrade will be the foundation for a more extensive,  functional upgrade that USDA plans to conduct in fiscal years 2015  through 2017, according to USDA officials. To make WBSCM a more  effective system, USDA intends to change the functionality of WBSCM to  align with current commercial business practices. Therefore, as part of  the functional upgrade effort, USDA plans to examine domestic and  international commercial food business trends and best practices and the  extent to which its food aid procurement processes reflect them.  According to USDA officials, the planned functional upgrade would  provide an opportunity to fully address USAID\u2019s concerns. For example,  the functional upgrade could allow USDA to re-configure WBSCM so that  it fits USAID\u2019s bulk ocean freight procurement needs.

We also interviewed and obtained documentation  from six of the seven freight forwarders that manage the transportation of  food aid from the U.S. load port to the foreign destination or overseas  prepositioned warehouse port. We did not test the system ourselves  because it was beyond the scope of this review to simulate multiple food  aid procurements, including the variances that occur during the shipping  process, and simulate the interface for multiple users.

To  examine how USAID\u2019s use of systems outside of WBSCM affects USDA\u2019s  ability to report and account for U.S. government funds, we obtained and  analyzed USDA and USAID documentation and spreadsheets used to  track foreign prepositioned commodity inventory levels and how these are  used to provide information for financial statements. The documentation  that we obtained and analyzed included warehouse inventory reports  prepared by each of the contractors that manage USAID\u2019s foreign  prepositioned warehouses, as well as a consolidated warehouse  inventory spreadsheet that USAID has provided to USDA to comply with  USDA\u2019s request for inventory data to use in complying with applicable  financial reporting requirements.", "We also drew on work conducted for a recent report to describe the  systems that USAID relies upon to track emergency food aid shipments.", "For that report, we collected data on emergency food aid shipments from  fiscal years 2007 through 2012 from the World Food Program and six  freight forwarders.
