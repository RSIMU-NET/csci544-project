Therefore, a person must have been uninsured at least 10 months to qualify for TennCare as an uninsured person on January 1, 1994. To stay within budget ceilings, the state limited total enrollment to 1.3 million for the first year and 1.5 million in succeeding years.

In addition, the waiver permits federal cost sharing for expenditures for services to enrollees in state mental hospitals that are not normally covered by Medicaid. The TennCare waiver provides other, indirect benefits to the state by expanding coverage for those not previously eligible under Medicaid but who received services through other state-funded programs, which allows the state to reduce its funding of such programs.

However, the state is not required to forward any of the resulting federal payments to the hospitals.

As revenue collections surpass $75 million, the percentage of premium revenue allowable as state share gradually decreases. The state initially estimated that it would collect $21 million for state fiscal year 1994 and an additional $101 million for state fiscal year 1995 but subsequently revised its state fiscal year 1995 estimate to $30 million.

Most significantly, Medicaid does not cover persons between the ages of 21 and 65 in state mental hospitals. TennCare allows short-term coverage of this population and reimburses mental hospitals directly for the actual costs of such services. Federal TennCare cost sharing for this population reduces the amount of state subsidy needed for state mental hospitals. As a result, Tennessee officials identified $69 million in annual state funding of state mental hospitals that could be used to fund TennCare.", "Indirect benefits to the state result from covering persons not previously included in Medicaid and making capitated payments to MCOs instead of fee-for-service reimbursements to individual providers. Covering the uninsured and uninsurable allows the state to reduce its funding for other state programs that had served these populations. Therefore, in addition to the state funding of mental hospitals, state officials identified $91 million in annual funding of other state programs that could be used to fund TennCare, which now provides such services to the uninsured. Most of this funding\u2014$65 million\u2014comes from reduced state funding of community mental health services. Also included is $5 million in reduced state funding for the Tennessee Comprehensive Health Insurance Program and $21 million for public health services, such as communicable diseases and hemophilia services.", "Making capitated payments to MCOs indirectly benefits the state because these payments are then subject to certain taxes; fee-for-service payments to providers generally were not. The state has a tax of 2 percent on payments made to HMOs and 1.75 percent on payments to PPOs. The tax on HMOs existed before TennCare, and a tax on accident and health insurers that existed before TennCare was extended to include PPOs.

Peat Marwick found that the data underlying the state\u2019s cost projections were sound, except for an understatement of incurred claims. However, it made several recommendations on factors to include in setting rates. Among the recommendations was that claims data should be used to set monthly rates on the basis of eligible months rather than the number of eligibles participating in Medicaid for some period during the year. Peat Marwick also recommended that regional capitation rates be established. The state did recompute the capitation rates, but it used total number of eligibles to establish an annual cost regardless of eligible months, and it did not establish regional rates.", "When TennCare\u2019s capitation rates were announced about 3 months after the Peat Marwick review, concerns were raised. To address these concerns, the Legislative Oversight Committee on TennCare contracted Milliman and Robertson, Inc. (in conjunction with Schubert & Associates) to review the TennCare Bureau\u2019s capitation rate-setting methodology.", "In its November 1993 report, Milliman and Robertson stated that in the aggregate, the capitation rates were about 25 percent below projected 1994 fee-for-service Medicaid costs. Further, since MCOs would incur administrative costs not reflected in the capitation payment, Milliman and Robertson estimated that MCOs would have to significantly reduce medical costs to succeed financially. In addition, Milliman and Robertson agreed with Peat Marwick\u2019s recommendation that rates should address regional variation and said that the variations were too significant to be ignored. According to Milliman and Robertson, the state\u2019s analysis showed that costs by region were as low as 83 percent and as high as 122 percent of statewide average costs.", "The report made several conclusions: (1) the gross capitation rates were not based on commonly accepted actuarial methods, (2) inconsistencies existed between the Bureau\u2019s reported methodology and the actual calculations, (3) no explicit assumptions existed on cost reductions in the gross capitation rate development, and (4) capitation rate reductions were not well documented.", "Milliman and Robertson found that the gross capitation rates were not based on commonly accepted actuarial methods because the state used the total number of people who received Medicaid during the year regardless of length of time on the program to determine capitation rates and ignored Medicaid cost variations by area. The state\u2019s computation of capitation rates, in effect, assumed that every Medicaid recipient in 1992 was covered for the entire 12 months. Milliman and Robertson calculated that on average, Medicaid recipients were only enrolled for 8.72 months during 1992, which understated the aggregate capitation by 26.2 percent. Also, the state projected 1994 rates from 1992 data, on the basis of a 5.5 percent annual inflation rate. However, the state may have understated actual inflation increases since it had provided information in its TennCare application that showed an average annual increase of 8.7 percent from fiscal years 1988-1989 to 1991-1992.", "In addition, Milliman and Robertson said that the average gross capitation rate that TennCare used for budget purposes overstated the actual rates paid by eligibility category. This was due to an error in how Tennessee weighted the eligibility categories. In calculating each of the eight capitation rates, the state counted people equally regardless of how many months they had been in the program and whether they were in more than one capitation category. For example, a 9-month-old child qualifying for Medicaid halfway through the calendar year would be counted in determining the capitation rate for each of two categories\u2014\u201cless than one year of age\u201d and \u201caged 1 to 13\u201d\u2014even though the child would have been in each category for only a few months. This understates the per capita costs because the child is treated, in effect, as having received services for an entire year in each capitation category. Milliman and Robertson calculated that the gross capitation rates by eligibility category were about 6.2 percent too low to achieve the TennCare Bureau\u2019s reported average gross capitation rate because of this error.", "Milliman and Robertson also reported that no explicit assumptions existed about cost savings under TennCare. They said that the state\u2019s utilization data indicated the potential for significant utilization reductions. Given this and other states\u2019 experiences, Milliman and Robertson said that a 10-percent reduction assumption for 1994 would have been appropriate to apply to otherwise actuarially sound rates. Even when allowing for the utilization cost reduction, Milliman and Robertson said that an overall increase of 20 percent was still needed to address problems in the rate-setting methodology.", "Further, Milliman and Robertson noted that the Bureau did not provide them with the necessary information to evaluate the capitation reductions for charity care, local government funding, and enrollee cost-sharing adjustments.

The state Medicaid program had primarily operated a fee-for-service reimbursement system. As a result, state staff were inexperienced with the characteristics and complexities of MCOs, and the state\u2019s relationship with physicians and hospitals changed dramatically under TennCare. Despite this lack of experience and the magnitude of these changes, Tennessee began operating its statewide program within 9 months of announcing it.", "According to TennCare Bureau officials, they met with parties interested in contracting as TennCare MCOs beginning in the summer of 1993. However, interested parties did not enter into TennCare contracts until late November, little more than a month before actual enrollment was to begin. Of the 12 contracted MCOs, only 1 had experience serving the Medicaid population before TennCare, and most of the MCOs developed their TennCare products in response to TennCare. This inexperience caused confusion for the contracted MCOs as well as TennCare beneficiaries and participating providers. TennCare reported that after program start-up, the state\u2019s hotline averaged 50,000 calls a day, from beneficiaries, MCOs, and providers\u2014compared with 9,000 calls a day in the following quarter.

One MCO\u2019s enrollment grew overnight from 35,000 to over 260,000, and officials from the MCO reported receiving 2,000 calls each hour in the first days of implementation. In addition, HCFA Region IV\u2019s 1994 Monitoring Report found that during the first months of TennCare, multiple changes to enrollment and eligibility\u2014some retroactive\u2014further burdened the MCOs.

TMA also opposed BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s \u201ccram down\u201d provision, which required physicians who participated in a network that operated for state employees and others to participate in TennCare. The provision prompted about a third of the 6,500 providers in the network to drop out in the early months of TennCare and providers in some parts of the state, particularly rural Western Tennessee, to boycott the program.

As a result, beneficiaries were confused about the number and type of plans and the available providers, and some families signed up with more than one MCO, exacerbating difficulties in managing enrollment. Some beneficiaries were further frustrated when they found that their primary care physicians were not participating in TennCare. A TMA satisfaction survey of physicians in October 1994 reported lack of patient understanding of TennCare as a major problem and recommended better efforts by MCOs to educate and manage patients.

Although enrollment of uninsured people began in January 1994, the initial billings were not mailed until June 1994. In addition, enrollees were given two alternatives to reduce the burden of paying the full accumulated premiums for the prior months: (1) pay reduced premiums by retroactively changing from a low cost-sharing plan to a cost-sharing plan with a higher deductible and higher total out-of-pocket liability or (2) pay no premiums by changing their effective enrollment dates to June 1, 1994. Enrollees were to receive premium booklets and begin scheduled monthly payments in July 1994. However, the state contractor failed to mail some of the booklets, and this error was not discovered until November 1994. In February 1995, the TennCare Bureau sent letters to nearly 60,000 TennCare households notifying them of past due premiums totaling $31 million.
