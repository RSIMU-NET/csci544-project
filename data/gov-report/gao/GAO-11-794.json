In February 2006 and July 2008, GAO reported on significant internal control weaknesses related to FBI's contract administration, processing of contractor invoices, and accountability for equipment acquired for these projects. GAO made 27 recommendations to the FBI to address these deficiencies. The FBI concurred with all 27 recommendations. This report provides an assessment of (1) the FBI's corrective actions to address GAO's 27 recommendations and (2) whether there were any indications of implementation issues related to the policies and procedures the FBI developed to address 17 of the 27 recommendations. GAO reviewed FBI policies and procedures, performed walk-throughs, and conducted detailed tests on statistically and nonstatistically selected samples of transactions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The corrective actions developed by FBI were sufficient to address 21 of the 22 Trilogy recommendations and all 5 Sentinel recommendations. The FBI substantially addressed: 17 Trilogy recommendations related to contract administration, invoice processing, and property accountability by establishing or revising policies and procedures; 4 by contracting for follow-up audits of the Trilogy costs; and the 5 Sentinel recommendations by revising Sentinel policies and procedures. The one Trilogy recommendation that FBI did not address completely was related to 1,205 missing, lost, or stolen Trilogy assets. As of February 2011, the FBI had researched and determined the status of all but 134 of these assets. FBI officials stated that almost all of these assets had a useful life of 7 years, and if they were not already returned or destroyed, they are now obsolete. There are diminishing returns to continue to pursue these assets, which included several information technology items that could potentially contain sensitive information. However, if the FBI is able to determine the status of any of these assets in the future, officials stated that they will make the entries to properly record them in FBI's property management application (PMA). In assessing implementation of the policies and procedures developed in response to GAO's 17 Trilogy recommendations related to contract administration, invoice processing, and property accountability, GAO found that policies and procedures related to the 4 recommendations dealing with contract administration, including interagency agreements, were effectively implemented but also identified a new issue. Specifically, GAO found that forms--required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation to support the use of interagency agreements to conveniently or economically obtain supplies and services--were not timely completed for 15 of 54 statistically selected interagency agreements tested, and found that FBI's monitoring did not identify this deficiency. GAO estimates that as much as 39.5 percent of FBI's fiscal year 2009 interagency agreements did not meet this requirement, increasing the risk that funds may have been disbursed for goods or services that were not in the best interest of the government. In addition, GAO's testing of FBI's implementation of polices and procedures for the remaining 13 recommendations that were related to invoice processing and property accountability found indications of implementation issues in 3 areas. (1) Regarding the review of contractors' invoices, 5 invoices (of the 37 tested) that had been reviewed and approved by FBI officials included labor rates that were not fully supported by the contract documentation. Without verifying labor charges against the contractor's proposal as required by FBI policy, there is an increased risk of disbursing funds for unallowable charges. (2) For property accountability, GAO found instances in which FBI (1) did not record accountable property items in its system in a timely manner and (2) did not accurately record key accountability information, such as location and serial numbers, as required by FBI's policies. These shortcomings increase the risk that assets could be lost or stolen and not be detected and investigated in a timely manner."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes three new recommendations to improve interagency agreement controls and determine if additional actions are necessary to improve controls for invoice processing and property accountability.

Our February 2006 report on  the FBI\u2019s Trilogy project and July 2008 report on its subsequent Sentinel  project focused on whether the FBI\u2019s internal controls provided  reasonable assurance that payments to the Trilogy and Sentinel  contractors were for allowable costs and properly supported, and that  accountability was maintained over equipment purchased for the  projects.  We identified internal control weaknesses, some significant,  related to the FBI\u2019s contract administration, processing of contractor  invoices, and accountability for equipment acquired during these projects.  We made 27 recommendations to the FBI to address the identified  deficiencies. Many of these recommendations focused on developing or  revising policies and procedures, which had broad applicability to the  FBI\u2019s procurement processes, while others focused on specific Trilogy or  Sentinel project weaknesses.", "Because the FBI continues to enter into contracts to acquire goods and  services and disburses millions annually related to these contracts, it is  critical that the FBI fully address the internal control deficiencies identified  in our Trilogy and Sentinel reports. In accordance with your request and  as agreed to with your staff, our objectives are to assess whether:  (1)  the FBI\u2019s new or revised policies and procedures and other specific  corrective actions were sufficient to address the recommendations we  made in our Trilogy and Sentinel reports and  (2)  there were any indications of implementation issues related to the  policies and procedures FBI developed to address 17 of the 27  recommendations.", "To assess if the FBI\u2019s new or revised policies and procedures and other  corrective actions were sufficient to address the recommendations in our  prior reports, we (1) reviewed the FBI\u2019s documented corrective actions for  each recommendation and supporting documentation; (2) held interviews  with FBI personnel responsible for the development of the corrective  actions; (3) reviewed documentation related to new or revised policies  and procedures as well as related training materials; and (4) requested  and reviewed additional relevant documentation identified during our  interviews.", "To assess whether there were any indications of FBI-wide implementation  issues related to the policies and procedures that FBI developed in  response to 17 of our 27 recommendations, we performed several types  of procedures. Depending on the nature of the policy and procedure  being implemented, or other corrective action being taken, our follow-up  work consisted of detailed testing of certain statistically and  nonstatistically selected transactions, walk-throughs, document reviews,  and interviews. For example, we performed detailed testing of  interagency agreements and contracts statistically selected from the  universe of interagency agreements and contracts executed by the FBI  during fiscal year 2009. We then nonstatistically selected purchase  orders, invoices, and accountable property associated with the selected  contracts and performed detailed testing to determine whether there were  any indications that the FBI did not fully or consistently perform the  activities prescribed in its new or revised policies and procedures. We  evaluated these selected transactions against the FBI\u2019s documented  policies and procedures and considered the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidance  for interagency agreements, our Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory  Board\u2019s (FASAB) accounting standards for accountable property.    Further details on our scope and methodology are included in appendix I.", "We provided the FBI with a draft of this report for review and comment.  The FBI provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III.  The FBI also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated  as appropriate.

Trilogy consisted of three parts: (1) the Information Presentation  Component (IPC) to upgrade FBI\u2019s computer hardware and software, (2)  the Transportation Network Component (TNC) to upgrade the FBI\u2019s  communication network, and (3) the User Application Component (UAC)  to upgrade and consolidate the FBI\u2019s five most important investigative  applications.", "The IPC component provided for new desktop computers, servers, and  commercial-off-the-shelf automation software, including Web-browser and  e-mail software to enhance usability by the agents. The TNC component  called for upgrading the complete communication infrastructure. These  upgrades were expected to provide the physical infrastructure that would  run the applications that were to be developed under the UAC component  of the Trilogy project to replace the FBI\u2019s paper case files with electronic  files and improve efficiency and replace the obsolete Automated Case  Support system, the FBI\u2019s primary investigative application that uploads  and stores case files electronically.", "Our 2006 audit of the project\u2019s costs identified significant internal control  deficiencies over administration of contracts and interagency agreements,  the processing (review, approval, and payment) of invoices, and the  accountability over assets purchased under the project. More  specifically, we reported that the FBI\u2019s review and approval process for  contractor invoices did not provide an adequate basis for verifying that  goods and services billed were actually received by the FBI or that  payments were for allowable costs. This occurred in part because  responsibility for the review and approval of invoices was not clearly  defined in the interagency agreements related to the Trilogy project and  because contractors\u2019 invoices frequently lacked the detailed supporting  documentation necessary for an adequate review of invoice charges.  During our audit, we identified more than $10 million in questionable  contractor costs paid by the FBI for the Trilogy project. With respect to  property, we reported that the FBI: (1) did not adequately maintain  accountability for purchased computer equipment; (2) relied extensively  on contractors to account for Trilogy assets while they were being  purchased, warehoused, and installed; (3) did not establish controls to  verify the accuracy and completeness of contractors\u2019 records on which  the FBI was relying; (4) did not ensure that only the items approved for  purchase were acquired by the contractors, and that the bureau received  all those items; and (5) did not establish adequate physical control over  the assets. As a result of these deficiencies, we identified more than  1,200 pieces of missing equipment that we estimated to be worth more  than $7.5 million.", "We made 22 recommendations to the FBI in our 2006 report on Trilogy.  Of the 22 recommendations, 17 were focused on developing agencywide  policies and procedures to address internal control weaknesses in the  FBI\u2019s procurement and contract administration processes. The remaining  five recommendations were specific to the Trilogy project and were  related to contractor overpayments and accountable property.", "The FBI discontinued the virtual case file component of its Trilogy project  in March 2005, after it was determined to be infeasible and cost  prohibitive to implement as originally envisioned. FBI\u2019s Sentinel project  was approved in July 2005 and was to succeed and expand on elements  of the Trilogy project, namely to provide the FBI with a modern,  automated investigative case-management system. The Sentinel project  management office (PMO) had designed and implemented policies and  procedures that assigned specific invoice-review responsibilities and  required Sentinel contractors to provide detailed support for all invoiced  amounts and to obtain advance approval from the Sentinel PMO for  travel, overtime, and other direct costs.", "With respect to Sentinel equipment, we reported that the Sentinel PMO  had established policies and procedures specific to the Sentinel project to  ensure Sentinel\u2019s equipment purchases were properly authorized and that  received property was timely inspected and entered into the FBI\u2019s  Property Management Application (PMA). However, we did identify some  additional opportunities for the Sentinel PMO to improve controls over  purchased equipment for the Sentinel project.

Of the 27 prior recommendations, 17 focused on  establishing, revising, or reinforcing policies and procedures with FBI- wide applicability. We found that the FBI had sufficiently developed,  revised, or updated these policies and procedures as we recommended.  For example, in response to our recommendation that the FBI revise its  policies and procedures to require that accountable assets be entered  into PMA immediately upon receipt rather than within the prior 30-day  time frame, the FBI issued a new policy that required that accountable  property be recorded in PMA within 48 hours of being received. Appendix  II provides information on each of the 27 Trilogy and Sentinel  recommendations and the specific corrective actions developed by the  FBI.", "We also made four recommendations in our Trilogy report related to the  recovery of overpayments and reimbursement of questionable costs from  Trilogy contractors. In response to these recommendations, the Defense  Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), an independent third party, was engaged  to perform post audit reviews of contractor billings for the Trilogy project.  DCAA conducted separate audits of the billings submitted by the two  prime contractors, Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and Science  Applications International Corporation (SAIC), as well as the billings  submitted by the numerous subcontractors, and identified over $18 million  in questioned costs.  DCAA defines questioned costs as those costs that  are not acceptable for negotiating a fair and reasonable contract price.  DCAA\u2019s audits included reviewing the areas with potential overpayments  we had identified as well as assessing if other identified questionable  costs should be reimbursed. The most significant questioned costs were  costs incurred outside the effective dates of temporary labor agreements,  missing supporting documentation, application of incorrect billing rates,  unapproved timesheets, unapproved overtime, and subcontractor  overbillings.", "The one recommendation that the FBI had not fully addressed from our  Trilogy report recommended that the FBI investigate the 1,205 assets that  we identified as missing, lost, or stolen and determine whether any  confidential or sensitive information may be exposed to unauthorized  users, and identify any patterns related to the equipment that could  necessitate a change in FBI policies and procedures. These assets  consisted of a variety of information technology items, including desktop  computers, servers, and laptops that could potentially contain confidential  or sensitive information that could be exposed to unauthorized users.", "In February 2011, FBI officials provided documentation accounting for the  status of all but 134 assets, including desktop computers, laptops, and  servers that could contain sensitive information. With regard to the 134  assets, the FBI stated that all of these assets had a useful life of 7 years  or less and that if they were not already returned or destroyed, they are  now obsolete and that spending more time or resources to search for the  obsolete equipment would be wasteful. Instead the FBI is focused on  implementing a new property management system, and incorporating  property management lessons learned from the Trilogy project.

Specifically, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires that any  interagency agreement entered into under the authority of the Economy  Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1535, be supported by a Determination and Findings  document. The Determination and Findings form identifies the  responsible agencies to the agreement (requesting agency and servicing  agency), is prepared by the requesting agency, and identifies the goods  or services that are to be provided by the servicing agency. In addition, it  documents the requesting agency\u2019s determination that, among other  things, the use of an interagency acquisition is in the best interest of the  government, and the supplies or services cannot be obtained as  conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source.  The FAR also requires that the requesting agency complete the  Determination and Findings form before placing an order for supplies or  services with another government agency.", "In reviewing our statistical sample of 55 interagency agreements with  regard to implementation of our prior recommendations, we identified 54  interagency agreements that were required to comply with FAR  requirements related to Determination and Findings and found that 15 of  them did not comply with these FAR requirements. For these 15 cases,  the required Determination and Findings forms supporting the execution  of interagency agreements between the FBI and other federal entities  were prepared and signed after the interagency agreements were  executed\u2014in some cases more than a year later.  \uf0b7  Three Determination and Findings forms were signed less than 3  months after the date of the related purchase orders were issued.  \uf0b7  One Determination and Findings form was signed between 3  months and 6 months after the date of the related purchase order  was issued.  \uf0b7  Seven Determination and Findings forms were signed between 6  months and 1 year later.  \uf0b7  Four Determination and Findings forms were signed more than a  year after the date of the related purchase orders.", "Based on the results of our review, we are 95 percent confident that the  total percentage of interagency agreements executed by the FBI in fiscal  year 2009 that lacked a required Determination and Findings form prior to  the FBI placing the order could be as much as 39.5 percent.", "FBI officials acknowledged that the Determination and Findings forms  were not completed prior to placing orders for goods and services and  provided two explanations. The interagency agreements and related  documentation for some of them were executed by a new employee who  was instructed to prepare and include the Determination and Findings  forms after the files had been reviewed by the Unit Chief, and a  contracting officer did not prepare and submit the interagency agreement  documentation to the Unit Chief in a timely manner for the others. The  FBI\u2019s monitoring of the interagency agreement process did not identify  that the Determination and Findings forms were not properly prepared as  required. Internal controls should be designed to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. By not completing a  required Determination and Findings form prior to issuing a purchase  order, obligating the agency for the purchase order amount, the  requesting agency risks obligating funds for supplies and services or both  that are not in the best interest of the government, and executing a  contract that is not in compliance with federal laws or regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Tests Identified Issues with Implementation of Certain FBI-wide Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Of the remaining 13 corrective actions that involved the implementation of  FBI-wide policies and procedures, our testing found indications that 3 of  them may not have been fully or consistently implemented.

Internal control  standards require agencies to establish controls that reasonably ensure,  among other things, that funds, property, and other assets are  safeguarded against waste, loss, or unauthorized use. The FBI requires  contractors bidding on contracts to submit proposals that include direct  labor categories and rates, subcontractor labor categories and rates, and  other direct costs used to calculate the total cost of their proposal.  Contractor invoices must include key information such as employee  name, labor classification, rate of pay, hours worked for billed labor  charges and support for other charges. FBI guidance states that staff  performing invoice reviews should compare the key data to the contractor  proposal to verify the accuracy of amounts charged.", "During our review of a non-statistical sample of 37 contractor invoices, we  found unsupported charges of $292,684 on five invoices submitted by  three contractors for three separate contracts that totaled $6,293,046 for  prime contractor and subcontractor direct labor, materials, and other  direct costs. Specifically, these totals include:  \uf0b7  We reviewed an invoice, dated October 5, 2009, submitted by one  contractor that included direct labor charges of $16,963 for one  labor group that was not included in the contractor\u2019s cost  proposal. The FBI acknowledged that the labor group was not  listed in the original proposal by the contractor but stated that  during the course of the contractual effort, the contractor  determined there was a need for labor to be performed on the  contract that required the skill set of a labor group that had not  been included in the contractor\u2019s cost proposal. In addition, the  FBI stated that the rate charged resulted in a savings to the FBI  under this contract without affecting the contract schedule or  deliverables. However, the FBI did not provide us with  documentation supporting the FBI\u2019s approval of the new labor rate  for the contract prior to the period billed on the invoice. In addition,  the invoice included $50,000 for the work of a subcontractor. In  our review of the contractor\u2019s proposal related to subcontractor  labor, we noted that it included, for this specific subcontractor, a  proposed labor rate of $184.84 for 610 hours for a total of  $112,752. However, the invoice documentation did not include  any information such as the name of the subcontractor  employee(s), the labor category, the hours worked, or the rate of  pay under other direct costs that would allow the FBI to verify the  accuracy and validity of the charges.", "In our review of two invoices submitted by another contractor, we  found that the contractor had billed the FBI $97,851 for direct  labor and subcontractor labor at rates, six for the contractor and  three for a subcontractor, which were not included in the  contractor\u2019s proposal.  \uf0b7  Similarly, in our review of two invoices submitted by a contractor  for a third contract we found that they included labor charges of  $127,870 at hourly labor rates, for four contractors and two  subcontractors, which were not supported by the contractor\u2019s  proposal.", "We also discussed our findings related to the second and third  contractor\u2019s invoices with FBI officials, and they explained that in  reviewing the invoices they focus on the status of the project and its  various components or tasks. They also stated that both contractors  submitted monthly reports to the FBI that included the actual costs of the  project for each current month as well as the costs of the project to date  and compared the costs to project\u2019s budget. However, the FBI also stated  that it did not require the contractors to provide analyses for cost  variances except when variances exceed thresholds set for the two  contracts. Without verifying labor groups and labor rates billed on  contractor invoices against the contractor\u2019s proposal as required by FBI  policy, the FBI is at increased risk that it will not identify erroneous or  improper billings and will disburse government funds for unallowable  contractor charges.", "As shown in table 2, we also found instances in which the FBI did not  record accountable property items in its system in a timely manner and  did not accurately record key accountability information such as location  and serial numbers as required by the FBI\u2019s policies and procedures.  \uf0b7  The FBI\u2019s revised policy, which is in response to our prior  recommendation, requires that accountable property be recorded into  the Property Management Application (PMA) within 48 hours of  receipt instead of within 30 days of receipt, which was the FBI\u2019s policy  at the time our 2006 report. Internal control standards require  agencies to establish controls that reasonably ensure, among other  things, that funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against  waste, loss, or unauthorized use. In our review, we found 406 pieces  of accountable property out of the 674 we tested had not been  recorded in PMA within 48 hours of being received as now required  and that some had not been recorded until more than a month after  being received. However, we also noted that the FBI, while not  adhering to its more stringent current policy, had recorded 90.7  percent of the accountable property we tested within 30 days of  receipt. This represents an improvement from the situation that  existed at the time of our Trilogy work. During its agencywide upgrade  of hardware and software under the Trilogy project, the FBI only  recorded 28.4 percent of accountable property that we reviewed,  within 30 days of receipt, as reported in our 2006 report.", "FBI management acknowledged that property was not being recorded  in compliance with its policy. FBI management officials explained that  this condition was due to property being ordered and received by  numerous FBI divisions and field offices and that some of these  divisions and field offices, did not have dedicated staff for recording  purchased assets in PMA immediately upon receipt of the property.  This situation serves to delay the recording of the assets in PMA. In  addition, they explained that some accountable property ordered by  the various FBI offices is delivered to FBI storage facilities and held  for security reasons before being delivered to the end user and that  these properties are not recorded in PMA until received by the end  user. Recording of property in PMA is critical in establishing  accountability. The longer it takes to record property in PMA, the  greater the risk that property may be stolen or lost without detection  by the FBI.", "In 2006, the FBI issued a policy to all FBI divisions that made  recording the location field when accountable property is added to  PMA or when corrections to records are made, mandatory. In  addition, the policy stated that the information recorded in the location  data field is the location of the property within the division or \u201clegat.\u201d  In reviewing the data entry screens for recording assets in the FBI\u2019s  property management application we noted that there are fields that  can be utilized by the property custodian to provide a location within  the division or legat. In our review of the PMA screens for the selected  property items we found that the information recorded in PMA for 80  of the 674 records did not provide sufficient information on the  location of the property within the division as required.", "In addition, we found that the serial number field was either blank,  incomplete, or had the entry \u201c719TOBEADDED\u201d in the PMA records  for 14 of the 674 tested assets. In addition, the five records that had  \u201c719TOBEADDED\u201d recorded, had not been updated for more than a  year. We also found 45 PMA records in which the model description  was entered as \u201cTO BE ADDED.\u201d The model description was missing  for all 45 assets for more than a year, with 6 of these assets lacking  this information for almost 2 years since they were first entered in  PMA.", "We brought these findings above to the attention of FBI officials. With  regard to the location information, the FBI stated that while the location  field is mandatory, there is no requirement on the amount of detail to be  listed. However, as mentioned previously, the 2006 policy issued by the  Asset Management Unit clearly states that the information recorded in the  location data field is the location of the property within the division or  legat. The lack of key information such as model, manufacturer,  description, serial number, and specific location information in PMA as  required by FBI policy would limit its ability to investigate assets reported  as missing during physical inventories. In addition, inadequate location  information results in the lack of a systematic means of identifying where  an asset is located or when it is moved, transferred, or disposed of."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The FBI has taken action to address 26 of the 27 recommendations we  made in our prior Trilogy and Sentinel reports. Many of these actions  involved developing policies and procedures. Developing and  communicating policies and procedures, while critical, is only the first step  that the FBI must take to address the identified internal control  weaknesses. Management must also ensure that the policies and  procedures are effectively implemented throughout the agency. Although  we found that the FBI had effectively implemented policies and  procedures related to interagency agreements and contracts, our tests on  the statistical selected transactions showed that additional action is  needed to ensure that Determination and Findings forms are properly  completed before the FBI enters into interagency agreements. With an  estimated 40 percent of its interagency agreements lacking a properly  completed Determination and Findings form, the FBI increases the risk  that it is obligating funds for supplies and/or services that are not in the  best interest of the government or executing a contract that is inconsistent  with federal laws or regulations. Further, we identified several other areas  where the implementation of policies and procedures, primarily related to  review of contractor invoices and accountability for purchased assets,  may need to be strengthened. Our testing of selected invoice transactions  identified unsupported labor categories and rates billed by contractors.  This situation points to a lack of thorough review of contractor invoices.  This weakness puts the FBI at risk of making payments to contractors for  questionable or improper charges. Additionally, our testing of selected  accountable property items identified property items that were not timely  or accurately recorded.

Specifically, in its required 60-day letter to Congress, the  FBI explained the corrective actions it had taken or planned to take to  address the issues we identified in our report. In addition, in mid-2006,  the FBI submitted additional documentation to GAO which included  revised or updated corrective action plans for each recommendation.  Also, in the third quarter of 2009, the FBI submitted additional  documentation to GAO for selected recommendations to support  additional corrective action steps taken since 2006. We also identified key  operations and management officials at the FBI responsible for the  development of the corrective actions and conducted interviews and walk- throughs to ensure that we fully understood the corrective actions. We  reviewed additional information and documentation identified during our  interviews, as well as new and revised policies and procedures and  training materials received from the FBI, and utilized this information to  make a determination of whether the corrective actions were adequately  designed to address our recommendations.", "To address our second objective to determine whether there were any  indications of implementation issues related to the policies and  procedures that the FBI developed to address 17 of the 27  recommendations, we selected statistical samples of interagency  agreements and contracts. We then non-statistically selected purchase  orders, invoices, and accountable property from the contracts selected in  the statistical samples and performed a variety of detailed tests. In our  review of the FBI\u2019s corrective action plans, we determined that the agency  had continued to take corrective actions to address our recommendations  through fiscal year 2008. Therefore, in order to obtain a more  representative population of transactions that had occurred after the last  corrective actions had been put in place, we decided to select statistical  samples from a population of transactions that occurred in fiscal year  2009.", "Because we selected statistical samples for testing implementation of  certain new or revised policies and procedures, we assessed the  reliability of the FBI\u2019s contracting, interagency-agreement, and property- data files by first identifying and documenting the controls in place at the  FBI for ensuring accurate and complete data is recorded into information  systems during the FBI\u2019s contracting, interagency-agreement, and  property-acquisition processes and then assessing whether these  controls appeared adequate. We inquired about the processes by which  interagency agreements, contracts, and purchase orders are completed  and recorded and developed an understanding of the controls designed  to ensure data entered into FMS for interagency agreements and  contracts is accurate and complete. In addition, we reviewed DOJ\u2019s  annual financial statement internal control reports for fiscal years 2007,  2008, and 2009 to identify any material weaknesses or reportable  conditions related to the information systems identified in the step above.  We also analyzed data listings to identify any anomalies in the data fields  such as blank cells or inconsistent naming conventions for contracts and  interagency agreements and obtained explanations for any anomalies  noted. Based on these steps, we determined the FBI\u2019s contract,  interagency-agreement, and property-data files were sufficiently reliable  to address the objectives of this report.", "We selected a statistical sample of 55 interagency agreements from a  total population of 494 interagency agreements executed by the FBI  during fiscal year 2009. In our testing of interagency agreements, we  verified that all agreements clearly defined the roles and responsibilities  relative to contract administration including invoice submission for both  parties. During our testing, we also considered new guidance on  interagency agreements issued by the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy that the FBI  disseminated to all of its procurement chiefs.", "We selected a statistical sample of 32 contracts from a population of 51  contracts executed in fiscal year 2009. In addition, for each of the 32  contracts in the sample, we selected all related purchase orders for  testing. The total number of purchase orders selected for testing was 34.  Our contract and purchase-order testing consisted of determining whether  the contracts and/or purchase orders (1) clearly specified key cost  determination provisions; (2) clearly reflected the appropriate Federal  Acquisition Regulation travel cost requirements; and (3) contained  provisions regarding the contractor\u2019s review of subcontractor charges. In  addition, for purchase orders only, we determined whether the purchase  orders were sufficiently detailed to verify the receipt of property and other  goods and services.", "We obtained a listing of all invoices that had been submitted to the FBI for  the purchase orders we selected noting that invoices had not yet been  submitted to FBI for 7 of the 34 purchase orders. A total of 110 invoices  had been submitted for the other 27 purchase orders we selected\u2014one  invoice each had been submitted for 16 of the purchase orders, two  invoices each for 3 of the purchase orders, and three or more invoices  had been submitted for the remaining 8 purchase orders. In selecting  invoices for testing, we selected all invoices for those purchase orders  that only had either one or two invoices. For each of the 8 purchase  orders with three or more invoices, we selected the invoice with the  highest dollar value for testing and one other invoice on a non-judgmental  basis. The total number of invoices selected for testing was 37. Our  invoice testing consisted of determining whether the contractor\u2019s invoice  and supporting documentation (1) provided evidence of the FBI review  and approval of the charges by the parties designated in the contract; (2)  included evidence that goods and services billed on the invoice were  received; (3) provided sufficient information to support the charges; (4)  included amounts that were appropriate and in accordance with contract  terms; and (5) provided evidence that the FBI properly documented the  resolution of invoice discrepancies.", "We also asked the FBI to provide a listing of all accountable property  included in its Property Management Application (PMA) for each of the 34  purchase orders we reviewed. According to the FBI\u2019s listing, 20 of the 34  purchase orders included accountable property that had been recorded in  the FBI\u2019s PMA. There were a total of 674 individual items of accountable  property for the 20 purchase orders. We included all 674 items of  accountable property for our property testing. Our property testing  consisted of determining whether the FBI (1) entered in PMA the  appropriate purchase order number, asset description, and physical  location of the accountable property purchased; (2) entered all  accountable property in PMA within the time frame specified in the FBI\u2019s  policy; (3) assigned bar codes to the accountable property when received  and annotated the assigned bar codes in the receiving reports and in  PMA; (4) properly documented any accountable property rejected  immediately upon delivery; and (5) properly updated the PMA records of  all accountable property returned after being accepted.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the FBI.
