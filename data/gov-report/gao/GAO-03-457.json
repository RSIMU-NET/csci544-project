Although the methodology used to calculate two of the cited measures resulted in overstating the rates of improvement, our recalculation after correcting for the methodology errors still showed positive--although less dramatic--improvement trends. While we were able to verify the reductions in travel card delinquencies because the underlying data were available from an independent source, we could not verify the accuracy of the specific improvement percentages reported for payment recording errors and commercial payment delinquencies. DOD's archaic and nonintegrated systems either do not contain the transaction-level detail to support the completeness and accuracy of the metrics or they make it extremely onerous and time consuming for the staff to gather and reconcile the needed detail. However, we were able to verify that DOD has made numerous policy, procedure, and systems changes that support an overall trend toward improved performance in these areas. If they could be verified, some of the cited metrics could be effective indicators of short-term financial management progress. However, if considered alone, delinquency rates are not necessarily good indicators for centrally billed travel cards or commercial payments. Placing too much emphasis on paying bills promptly may tempt DOD staff to bypass important internal controls meant to ensure that the goods and services being paid for were properly authorized and actually received. Despite shortcomings, the cited metrics have focused DOD's attention on highly visible financial management problems. As shown below, recent metrics issued by the DOD Comptroller indicate continuing improvements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) inability to accurately account for and  record its disbursements has been a serious, long-standing, and much  reported financial management problem.  The department\u2019s ability to  improve its accounting has historically been hindered by its reliance on  fundamentally flawed financial management systems and processes and a  weak overall internal control environment.  In fact, DOD\u2019s complex and  inefficient payment processes have generally inhibited the proper  recording of transactions when they occur, including the prompt and  proper matching of disbursements with obligations\u2014a critical funds- control measure.  Such payment recording errors mean that DOD does not  know the true amount of funds that it has available to obligate and spend in  each appropriation account.  As a result, the department risks  overspending or not effectively using all available funding for needed  items.", "Auditors have also reported on DOD\u2019s history of delinquent payments to its  commercial suppliers and for its government-issued individually billed  travel cards.  These weaknesses increased the risk of fraud and/or  disbursement errors, including duplicate payments, payments in the wrong  amount, or charges to the wrong accounts.  In addition, travel card  delinquencies and charge-offs have resulted in millions of dollars in lost  rebates and increased fees.  These payment problems contributed greatly  to our decision to put DOD financial management on our high-risk list of  areas that are vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in  1995, a designation that continues today.", "To increase attention to these problems, the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) accelerated and expanded the use of its  existing financial management performance metrics several years ago, to  include specific measures for payment recording errors and payment  delinquencies.  In his March 6, 2002, testimony before your Subcommittee,  the DOD Comptroller reported significant improvements in these measures  based on calculations using DFAS data.  In particular, the Comptroller  stated that  payment recording errors decreased by 57 percent between October  2000 and October 2001,   DOD\u2019s backlog of commercial payments (i.e., delinquent unpaid  invoices) had been reduced by 41 percent between April 2001 and  October 2001, and   payment delinquencies decreased by 34 percent for personal  (individually billed) travel cards and 86 percent for organizational  (centrally billed) travel cards between January 2001 and December  2001.", "This report responds to your request that we review DOD\u2019s reported  improvements.  As agreed with your office, our objectives were to  determine whether (1) the cited performance measures were defined and  calculated in a manner consistent with previous reporting on payment  recording errors and delinquencies, (2) the cited improvement data were  properly supported and represent real improvements in performance, and  (3) the metrics are effective indicators of short-term financial management  progress that can be sustained.", "In conducting this work, we visited various DFAS centers and gathered,  analyzed, and compared information on how payment recording errors,  commercial payment backlogs, and travel card delinquencies were defined,  calculated, and reported both in the past and for the cited metrics.  We  spoke with center personnel about process and systems improvements and  we gathered and analyzed relevant output that demonstrated the results of  those changes.  We also reviewed the various financial management  metrics programs in place or being developed throughout DOD.  However,  as discussed later in this report, we were unable to independently verify the  completeness and accuracy of the data that supported the cited metrics,  with the exception of travel card information.  We performed our work in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards  from June 2002 through February 2003.  Details of our scope and  methodology are in appendix I.

Although  DFAS is responsible for providing accounting services for DOD, military  service and other defense agency personnel play a key role in DOD\u2019s  disbursement process.  In general, military service and defense agency  personnel obligate funds for the procurement of goods and services,  receive those goods and services, and forward obligation information and  receiving reports to DFAS.  Separate DFAS disbursing offices and  accounting offices then pay the bills and match the payments to obligation  information.  Several military services and DOD agencies can be involved  in a single disbursement and each has differing financial policies,  processes, and stand-alone, nonstandard systems.  As a result, millions of  disbursement transactions must be keyed and rekeyed into the vast  number of systems involved in any given DOD business process.  Also,  transactions must be recorded using an account coding structure that can  exceed 75 digits and this coding structure often differs\u2014in terms of the  type, quantity, and format of data required\u2014by military service.  DFAS\u2019s  ability to match disbursements to obligation records is complicated by the  fact that DOD\u2019s numerous financial systems may contain inconsistent or  missing information about the same transaction.  Input errors by DFAS or  service personnel and erroneous or missing obligation documents are two  of the major causes of inconsistent information.", "For calculating and reporting performance metrics related to payment  recording errors, officials from the Comptroller\u2019s office included the  following categories.", "Unmatched disbursements\u2014Payments that were made by a DFAS  disbursing office and received by a DFAS accounting office but have not  yet been matched to the proper obligation.", "Negative unliquidated obligations\u2014Payments that have been matched  to and recorded against the cited obligations but which exceed the  amount of those obligations.", "Intransits\u2014Payments that have not yet been received by the DFAS  accounting office for recording and matching against the corresponding  obligation.", "Suspense account transactions\u2014Payments that cannot be properly  recorded because of errors or missing information (e.g., transactions  that fail system edit controls because they lack proper account coding)  and are therefore temporarily put in a holding account until corrections  can be made.", "For DOD to know how much it has spent and/or how much is still available  for needed items, all transactions must be promptly and properly recorded.   However, we reported as early as 1990 that DOD was unable to fully  identify and resolve substantial amounts of payment recording errors.  We  also stated that DOD\u2019s early reporting of these errors significantly  understated the problems.  For example, DFAS excluded $14.8 billion of  intransits from its 1993 benchmark against which it measured and reported  its progress in reducing recording problems in later years.  In addition,  DOD excluded suspense account transactions from its reporting of  payment recording errors until as late as 1999.  Finally, when negative  unliquidated obligations, intransits, and suspense account transactions  were reported, they were reported using net rather than absolute values."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Payments", "paragraphs": ["DFAS has overall responsibility for the payment of invoices related to  goods and services supplied by commercial vendors.  As part of a  reorganization effort in April 2001, DFAS separated its commercial  payment services into two efforts\u2014contract pay and vendor pay.", "Contract pay handles invoices for formal, long-term contract instruments  that are typically administered by the Defense Contract Management  Agency (DCMA).  These contracts tend to cover complex, multiyear  purchases with high dollar values, such as major weapon systems.   Payments for contracts are made from a single DFAS system\u2014 Mechanization of Contract Administration Service (MOCAS).  For fiscal  year 2001, DFAS disbursed about $78 billion for over 300,000 contracts  managed in MOCAS.", "The vendor pay product line handles invoices for contracts not  administered by DCMA, plus miscellaneous noncontractual payments such  as utilities, uniforms/clothing, fuels, and food.  Vendor pay is handled by 15  different systems throughout DFAS and, annually, DFAS personnel pay  nearly 10 million vendor invoices in excess of $70 billion.  In general, DOD  makes vendor payments only after matching (1) a signed contractual  document, such as a purchase order, (2) an obligation, (3) an invoice, and  (4) a receiving report.  If any one of these components is missing, such as  an obligation not being entered into the payment system, payment of the  invoice will be delayed.  According to DOD officials, approximately 80  percent of payment delinquencies are due to the delayed receipt of  receiving reports by DFAS from the military service activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Travel Cards", "paragraphs": ["DOD implemented the current travel card program in November 1998,  through a DOD task order with Bank of America.  This was in response to  the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-264), which  modified the existing DOD Travel Card Program by mandating that all  government personnel must use the government travel card to pay official  travel costs (for example, hotels, rental cars, and airfare) unless  specifically exempted.  The travel card can also be used for meals and  incidental expenses or to obtain cash from an automatic teller machine.   The intent of the travel card program was to provide increased  convenience to the traveler and lower the government\u2019s cost of travel by  reducing the need for cash advances to the traveler and the administrative  workload associated with processing/reconciling travel advances.", "DOD\u2019s travel card program, which is serviced through Bank of America,  includes both individually billed accounts and centrally billed accounts.   When the travel card is submitted to a merchant, the merchant will process  the charge through its banking institution, which in turn charges Bank of  America.  At the end of each banking cycle (once each month), Bank of  America prepares a billing statement that is mailed to the cardholder (or  account holder) for the amounts charged to the card.  The statement also  reflects all payments and credits made to the account.  For both individual  and centrally billed accounts, Bank of America requires that the cardholder  make payment on the account in full within 30 days of the statement  closing date.  If the cardholder\u2014individual or agency\u2014does not pay the  monthly billing statement in full and does not dispute the charges within 60  days of the statement closing date, the account is considered delinquent.", "For individually billed accounts, within 5 business days of return from  travel, the cardholder is required to submit a travel voucher claiming  legitimate and allowable expenses, which must be reviewed and approved  by a supervisor.  DOD then has 30 days in which to make reimbursement.   Although DOD, like other agencies, relies on its employees to promptly pay  their individually billed accounts, DOD does have some tools to monitor  travel card activity and related delinquencies, including Bank of America\u2019s  Web-based Electronic Account Government Ledger System (EAGLS).   Using EAGLS, supervisors can obtain reports on their cardholders\u2019  transaction activity and related payment histories.  For the centrally billed  accounts, the travel office at each military installation or defense agency  must first reconcile the charges shown on the centrally billed travel charge  card account with the office\u2019s internal records of transportation requests.   After reconciliation has been completed, the voucher is sent to DFAS for  payment.", "Because the travel card program is fairly new, DOD does not have a long  history of reporting statistics for delinquencies.  However, in our previous  reports and testimonies, we have reported that DOD\u2019s individually billed  delinquency rate is higher than that of other federal agencies.  As of  September 2002, DOD\u2019s delinquency rate was approximately 7.3 percent,  about 3 percent higher than other federal agencies.  Among the military  services, however, the Air Force had the lowest delinquency rate.  As of  September 2002, the Air Force delinquency rate was 4.8 percent,  significantly lower than the rest of DOD.  Even though the Air Force had  lower numbers of delinquent accounts, we found that control environment  weaknesses and breakdowns in key controls were departmentwide and  that these deficiencies led to instances of potential fraud and abuse with  the use of travel cards in all the military services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Metrics Programs", "paragraphs": ["In 1998, DFAS developed its Performance Contract to focus on continued  achievement of its mission to provide responsive, professional finance and  accounting services to DOD.

DFAS managers\u2014and sometimes staff\u2014are  rated and rewarded based on their ability to reach annual reduction goals  for each indicator.  Performance metrics are now calculated monthly and  the DFAS Director and the DOD Comptroller regularly review the results.", "Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998  (P.L. 105-85) directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a biennial  strategic plan for the improvement of financial management to the  Congress.  In conjunction with the plan, the DOD Comptroller decided to  develop a performance measurement system\u2014a set of departmentwide  metrics that will provide clear-cut goals for financial managers to monitor  their progress in achieving reform.  To begin this effort, the Comptroller  adopted many of the DFAS performance measurement indicators because  the DFAS metrics program had been underway for some time and was  reporting successes.  For payment recording errors and commercial  payment backlogs in particular, the Comptroller\u2019s metrics used information  gathered and tracked by DFAS for its performance management contract.", "The metrics cited in the Comptroller\u2019s testimony represent only a few of the  financial management performance metrics developed to date.

We did find that the reported metrics overstated  the rate of improvement in some areas because Comptroller officials  included transactions that DFAS would not consider to be payment errors  or because they chose an inappropriate comparison to measure travel card  delinquencies.  However, recalculation of the metrics after correcting for  these factors still showed positive\u2014although less dramatic\u2014improvement  trends."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Payment Recording Errors", "paragraphs": ["DOD has gradually improved its reporting of payment recording errors over  the years.  DOD is now including all known categories of payment errors\u2014 unmatched disbursements, negative unliquidated obligations, intransits,  and suspense account transactions\u2014in its definition and, except in the  case of intransits, is using absolute rather than net amounts in its  calculations.  However, the reporting of payment recording errors may not  be complete.  For example, work that we have performed on closed DOD  accounts and on unliquidated obligations indicates that recording errors  are not always identified or resolved appropriately.  DFAS agrees that to  properly manage and improve its payment processes, it must have a  complete universe of payment recording errors.  Therefore, DFAS  personnel are currently working to determine whether the error categories  identified to date contain all of the relevant transactions and whether other  error categories exist.", "While the same basic methodologies were used for calculating the cited  metrics at the beginning and ending measurement dates, Comptroller  officials overstated DOD\u2019s improvement percentages because the October  2000 calculation included transactions that did not meet the DFAS criteria  for being considered payment errors while the October 2001 calculation did  not include them.  First, the October 2000 calculation for payment  recording errors included all transactions that were being held in DFAS  suspense accounts; however, DFAS uses certain suspense accounts to  record collection transactions, such as accrued payroll taxes and receipts  for the sale of military property, that are held temporarily before being  distributed to the proper government agency or DOD entity.  The  transactions in these accounts, which DFAS labels as \u201cexempt suspense  accounts,\u201d do not represent payment recording errors.  In fiscal year 2001,  DFAS Cleveland changed its practice of charging payroll taxes to suspense  accounts and began appropriately accruing taxes in an accrued payroll tax  account.  As a result, payment recording errors as calculated by  Comptroller officials at October 2001 were reduced by an estimated $7.5  billion\u2014the amount of DFAS Cleveland\u2019s accrued payroll taxes\u2014even  though payment processes were not improved at all.", "Second, in fiscal year 2001, DFAS Indianapolis corrected a reporting error  by a defense agency that had been double-counting transactions in its  suspense accounts.  This resulted in an estimated $1.1 billion reduction  from amounts reported in October 2000, even though no payment  recording errors were corrected or resolved.", "In addition, Comptroller officials measured intransits using net rather than  absolute values and did not adopt DFAS criteria for aging intransit and  suspense account transactions.  These practices affected the balances used  to calculate the metrics at both the beginning and ending measurement  dates.  First, net rather than absolute values were used to calculate  intransits at October 2000 and October 2001, which understated both  balances by approximately $4 billion. When net amounts are reported,  collections, reimbursements, and adjustments are offset against  disbursements, thus reducing the balance of intransit transactions.   Second, the reported metrics included all intransit and suspense account  transactions at October 2000 and October 2001 regardless of their age.   However, DOD allows 60 days to 180 days for the normal processing of  various payment transactions because of systems limitations and the  complexity of the department\u2019s processes and, in line with these criteria,  DFAS\u2019s metrics related to payment errors only consider aged intransit and  suspense account transactions.  By not using DFAS\u2019s criteria for aged  intransit and suspense account transactions, the Comptroller officials  overstated the balances of payment recording errors by approximately $6  billion at the beginning and $5 billion at the ending measurement dates.", "Figure 1 illustrates the effect on improvement rates of (1) eliminating  exempt suspense accounts and double counting, (2) using DFAS\u2019s criteria  for aged intransits and suspense amounts, and (3) using absolute rather  than net amounts for intransits.  Our recalculation shows an overall 46  percent reduction in payment recording errors between October 2000 and  October 2001 rather than the 57 percent reduction reported by the  Comptroller; however, the reductions are still significant and the trend is  still overwhelmingly positive.  Between October 2001 and September 2002,  DOD continued to report that it had reduced payment recording errors.

If the military services or DOD components  have not provided DFAS with accurate obligation information within  specified time frames, the revision gave DFAS the authority to record  obligations in order to resolve individual unmatched disbursements,  negative unliquidated obligations, and certain suspense account  transactions.  DFAS also expanded its prevalidation policy, which it claims  has been key to reducing payment errors associated with commercial  contracts.  Prevalidation requires that DFAS personnel ascertain that there  is a valid obligation recorded in the accounting records before making a  payment.

We obtained travel card  delinquency information from an independent source, the General Services  Administration (GSA), that supported the Comptroller\u2019s metrics.  GSA  receives information from individual travel card vendors, such as Bank of  America, and prepares a monthly summary report for DOD that documents  individual and centrally billed travel card delinquencies by military service  or defense agency.  We compared the GSA data to the cited metrics and  verified that the reported reductions in travel card delinquencies were  accurate.  As with the other problem areas, DOD credits the decrease in  travel card delinquency rates in both individual and centrally billed  accounts primarily to increased management attention.", "For the centrally billed accounts, DOD has attributed the initial high  delinquency rates to problems in transferring the travel card contract from  American Express to Bank of America.  When Bank of America was given  the contract, its on-line travel information system, EAGLS, was not fully  operational and therefore was unable to accurately process all of the travel  data being transferred by American Express.  Because EAGLS contained  incorrect account numbers, invoice information, and billing addresses,  DOD agency program coordinators did not have the information necessary  to determine which accounts were delinquent, in suspense, or canceled.  While DOD and Bank of America officials were working jointly to identify  and resolve the problems, centrally billed invoices became backlogged.   Once the problems were resolved, DOD was able to reduce the backlog.  As  of December 31, 2002, DOD\u2019s centrally billed delinquency rate was 1.5  percent, well below fiscal year 2002\u2019s proposed goal of 3.0 percent and  equal to the delinquency rate for other federal agencies.  Figure 4 below  shows the centrally billed delinquency rates from January 2001 through  December 2002.", "For individual travel cards, our recent work also supports the improved  delinquency rates being reported by DOD.  During the past year, we  reported on the travel card programs for all three military services.  In  general, we found that the military services, in particular the Air Force,  have given delinquencies greater attention and have used travel card audits  to identify problems and needed corrective actions.  We reported that all of  the services are now holding commanders responsible for managing the  delinquency rates of their subordinates.  For example, Air Force  management holds monthly command meetings where individual travel  card delinquencies are monitored and briefed.  The individual services have  also implemented new programs to help reduce delinquencies, including  the following.", "In January 2003, the Army established two goals of not more than 4.5  percent of dollars delinquent and not more than 3 percent of accounts  delinquent. The Navy has established a similar goal of no more than 4  percent delinquent accounts.", "The Air Force is providing financial training to all inductees that  includes developing a personal budget plan, balancing a checkbook,  preparing a tax return, and understanding financial responsibility.  The  training also covers the disciplinary actions and other consequences of  financial irresponsibility by service members.", "The Navy has developed a three-pronged approach to address travel  card issues:  (1) provide clear procedural guidance to agency program  coordinators (APCs) and travelers that is available on the Internet,   (2) provide regular training to APCs, and (3) enforce the proper use and  oversight of the travel card by using data mining to identify problem  areas and abuses.", "In January 2003, the Army issued two directives to its major  commanders, which address a range of policy requirements, to include:   (1) training for APCs and cardholders, (2) monthly review of cardholder  transactions, (3) exempting and/or discouraging the use of the card for  en route travel expenses associated with deployments, and   (4) prohibiting use of the card for travel expenses associated with  permanent change of station moves.", "In addition, DOD has implemented a number of departmentwide programs  to improve the individually billed travel card program.  Beginning in  November 2001, DOD began a salary and military retiree pay offset  program for delinquencies\u2014similar to wage garnishment.  In March 2002,  the Comptroller created a Credit Card Task Force to address management  issues related to the purchase and individually billed travel card programs.", "On July 19, 2002, the DOD Comptroller directed the cancellation of   (1) inactive travel charge card accounts, (2) active travel card accounts not  used in the previous 12 months, and (3) travel card accounts for which the  bank cannot identify the cardholders\u2019 organization.  DOD is also  encouraging individual cardholders to elect to have all or part of their  travel reimbursement sent directly by DFAS to Bank of America\u2014a  payment method that is standard practice for many private sector  employers.  The Congress has recently addressed this issue in section  1008(a) and (b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2003, which provides the Secretary of Defense the authority to require use  of this payment method.  According to DOD, about 32 percent of its  individually billed cardholders elected this payment option for fiscal year  2002.", "As a result of these and other actions, DOD has been able to sustain  reduced delinquency rates between October 2002 and December 2002, as  illustrated in figure 5 below.  However, DOD still needs to do more to  address the underlying causes of the problems with its travel card program.   In a recent testimony, we concluded that actions to implement additional  \u201cfront-end\u201d or preventative controls are critical if DOD is to effectively  address the high delinquency rates and charge-offs, as well as potentially  fraudulent and abusive activity.  As a result of our work on travel cards,  the Congress included a provision in the Department of Defense  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003 requiring the Secretary of Defense  to evaluate whether an individual is creditworthy before authorizing the  issuance of any government charge card.  If this requirement is effectively  implemented, DOD should continue to improve delinquency rates and  reduce potential fraud and abuse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cited Metrics Serve Important Purpose But Further Steps Are Needed to Sustain Improvements", "paragraphs": ["The metrics that the DOD Comptroller highlighted in the March 2002  hearing relate to areas that have received considerable congressional and  audit attention.

While some of the  cited metrics could be effective indicators of short-term financial  management progress, assuming they could be verified, others are not  necessarily good indicators, particularly if taken alone.  In addition,  continued financial management progress will require additional actions.   For example, the military services and other defense agencies are key  contributors to preventing and resolving payment recording errors and  commercial payment delinquencies but they do not have the same  incentives to improve their performance in these areas.

Monitoring the delinquency rates for individual  travel card payments would provide DOD with an early indication that  employees may be abusing their cards (i.e., using the cards for personal  purchases) or having credit problems.", "However, improved delinquency rates do not necessarily indicate improved  financial management of centrally billed travel cards or commercial  payments.  In fact, by placing too much emphasis on paying bills promptly,  DOD staff may be tempted to shortcut important internal control  mechanisms that are meant to ensure that the goods and services being  paid for were properly authorized and actually received.  We and DOD  auditors have issued several reports on the improper use of individually  billed travel cards at DOD and on over- and underpayments to DOD  contractors but are just beginning work to identify and evaluate the  adequacy of DOD policies, procedures, and controls related to purchases  from vendors and centrally billed travel cards.  As a result of these audits,  we will likely recommend additional metrics related to program  performance and internal controls for monitoring performance in these  areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sustainability of Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Measures such as the ones discussed in this report may be useful in the  short term but may not be appropriate once DFAS has reengineered its  business processes and modernized its systems.

Based on the recent work we performed for your  committee related to DOD\u2019s enterprise architecture, however, these new  systems are years away from implementation.", "Because DFAS lacks modern, integrated financial management systems,  preventing and resolving payment delinquencies and errors require  intensive effort day after day by DFAS and military service staff.  As a  result, DFAS has indicated that much of the reported progress to date is  sustainable only if its workload is not significantly increased or its staffing  significantly decreased.", "Until new systems and reengineered processes are in place, DOD can take  a number of steps to help maintain improvements in these areas.  First,  continued leadership and focus by top management will be a major factor  in the sustainability of progress made to date.  Second, because DFAS alone  cannot resolve DOD\u2019s payment recording problems or payment  delinquencies, integrated metrics programs across DOD will be important.   As noted earlier in this report, while the military services and other defense  agencies play key roles in obligating DOD funds, preparing obligation  documents, receiving and preparing billing documents, preparing receiving  reports, and recording transaction information into accounting systems,  these organizations do not currently have complementary metrics  programs.  Thus the military services and defense agencies are not  measured on the accuracy and timeliness of their payment processes even  though their assistance is necessary for DFAS to make improvements and  resolve problems.  For example, commercial payment backlogs were  largely due to failure by the military services in providing receiving reports  to DFAS, yet service delays were not being measured.", "DOD is currently developing a departmentwide, balanced program of  metrics that is intended to align with its strategic goals, focus on results,  and achieve auditable reports.  As contemplated, DFAS, the military  services, and other defense agencies will all be supporting players in this  program.  From the individual performance measurement programs of the  military services, defense agencies, and DFAS, certain metrics will be  selected and reported to the top levels of DOD management for evaluation  and comparison.  In this scenario, it is important that DOD properly and  consistently calculate and report the selected metrics and that the military  services, other agencies, and DFAS develop integrated metrics programs to  assist in identifying, measuring, and resolving crosscutting issues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As the cited metrics demonstrate, DOD can make meaningful, short-term  progress toward better financial management while waiting for long-term  solutions, such as integrated financial systems.
