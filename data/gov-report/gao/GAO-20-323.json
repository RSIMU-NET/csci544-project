For example, the Army's intermediate-level PME program did not meet its Sea Service (i.e., Navy, Marine Corps, and, in certain instances, Coast Guard) requirement (see table). GAO's analysis found that the Navy could have assigned officers to Air Force and Army programs while not harming participation in its own seminars.

Department of Defense (DOD) guidance states that performance measurement is a means of evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and results and that a balanced performance measurement scorecard includes nonfinancial and financial measures focusing on quality, cycle time, and costs. While OSD is in the process of developing some performance measures, it is not planning to require the military services to track program costs. Implementing its planned measures and establishing costs as a performance measure will better position OSD to assess the effectiveness of PME programs.", "The Under Secretary of Defense (USD) (Comptroller's) ability to monitor the military services' PME programs is limited by incomplete and inconsistent reporting of service budget request data.

Military service  and Joint Staff officials stated it was difficult for Air Force and Army  officers to gain a full appreciation of the Navy\u2019s contribution to joint  military operations when there were no Sea Service students in the  seminar. In the situations where a seminar did not have Sea Service  representation, Joint Staff officials told us that a decision was made to  award students JPME credit. Furthermore, officials told us that it was  decided to not \u201cpunish\u201d military service PME programs for not meeting the  OPMEP\u2019s JPME seminar student mix requirement as military services\u2019  programs cannot control the number of in-bound students assigned by  the other military services.", "Officials from the Air Force\u2019s and the Army\u2019s intermediate-level PME  programs told us that when they are unable to meet the OPMEP seminar  student mix requirement, they take steps to compensate for the lack of  Sea Service student representation, such as using faculty to provide Sea  Service perspectives. Similarly, a 2010 Congressional report noted the  value of in-residence officer PME programs because of the acculturation  opportunities that they offer.", "Other than Joint Staff officials requesting that the Navy meet the  OPMEP\u2019s JPME seminar student mix requirement, no other actions have  been taken by the Chairman, OSD, or the Navy to resolve the issue  concerning Navy participation in the Air Force\u2019s and Army\u2019s intermediate- level PME programs. Specifically, according to DASD(FE&T) officials, as  of November 2019, OSD has not been involved in addressing the Navy\u2019s  failure to meet the OPMEP\u2019s JPME seminar student mix requirement.", "Additionally, Joint Staff officials told us that the Chairman cannot direct a  Secretary of a military department to comply with provisions of a  Chairman\u2019s publication.", "However, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state  that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to  achieving defined objectives. Given that joint acculturation is a key  component of intermediate-level PME programs, the lack of action to  resolve or mitigate the issues at hand has the potential to negatively  affect students\u2019 opportunities to increase their knowledge and develop the  necessary skills to operate in joint environments. Without DOD taking  steps to determine whether the appropriate number of Navy officers can  be assigned to intermediate-level PME programs of the Air Force and  Army, the officers participating in these programs lack the perspectives of  Sea Service participants, which diminishes the quality of the educational  experience.", "Furthermore, neither the Chairman nor OUSD(P&R) has evaluated or  approved the mitigation steps, either before or after-the-fact, when a PME  program lacks representation to meet the joint acculturation requirement.  Although the OPMEP requires that each intermediate- and senior-level  JPME seminar contain at least one student from each of the two non-host  military departments, the OPMEP does not contain guidance on what  PME programs should do when they do not meet this requirement.  Developing guidance concerning actions, if any, the military services can  take to mitigate JPME seminar student mix shortfalls and still meet the  intent of the OPEMP\u2019s joint awareness common educational standard  could better position DOD and the military services to ensure that DOD\u2019s  JPME programs are meeting their objectives."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "OSD Is Taking Steps to Exercise Oversight of the Military Services\u2019 PME Programs, but Its Ability to Assess the Effectiveness of These Programs Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["OSD has had PME and JPME statutory oversight responsibilities for more  than 30 years; however, while it has taken some steps to strengthen its  oversight, it is not well-positioned to assess the effectiveness of the  military services\u2019 PME programs. The Goldwater-Nichols Act, as  amended, states that the Secretary of Defense shall, with the advice and  assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, periodically review  and revise the curriculum of JPME schools, and require that the PME  schools periodically review and revise their intermediate- and senior-level  PME curriculums to strengthen the focus on joint matters and preparing  officers for joint duty assignments. Moreover, DOD Directive 5124.02  requires the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  develop policies, plans, and programs for educating DOD personnel.", "According to several DOD officials with whom we spoke, prior to the  establishment of DASD (FE&T), OUSD(P&R) unofficially relinquished its  responsibilities for PME and JPME to the Chairman, whose office issued  the first version of the OPMEP in 1996. As mentioned earlier, the OPMEP  outlines the Chairman\u2019s process for meeting statutory responsibilities for  overseeing officer JPME, which is a subset of PME. For example, the  OPMEP states that JPME is a Chairman approved body of objectives,  outcomes, policies, procedures, and standards supporting the educational  requirements for joint officer management.", "As recently as 2017, OUSD(P&R) reported to Congress that it had no  formal process for exercising its authority to periodically review and revise  the curricula of officer JPME. In the same report, OUSD(P&R) stated  that DOD was reviewing JPME and the DOD Joint Officer Management  Program. OUSD(P&R) also reported that with the reorganization of its  office to include a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force  Education and Training (DASD(FE&T)) in 2015, OSD was now organized  to exercise its statutory authorities with respect to PME and JPME and  would do so in line with the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction in the  National Defense Strategy. According to the 2015 implementation plan  detailing the reorganization, the Deputy Assistant Secretary\u2019s  responsibilities include measuring, assessing, and overseeing all aspects  of education and training, which includes PME and JPME. In 2019,  DOD issued guidance stating that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Readiness is the principal advisor to the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness on all matters related to the readiness of the  Total Force, including by developing policies and plans, providing advice,  and making recommendations for PME to include alignment to the  National Defense and National Military Strategies and talent management  and utilization.", "OUSD(P&R) is drafting its first DOD instruction (the draft instruction) that  covers PME and JPME, which DASD(FE&T) officials told us it plans to  issue in February 2020. According to DASD(FE&T) officials, once issued,  the DOD instruction will be the prevailing policy document for PME and  JPME at the OSD-level. While we believe these steps will improve OSD\u2019s  oversight of the military services\u2019 PME and JPME programs, we identified  areas that could continue to impede DOD\u2019s ability to assess the  effectiveness of these programs. Specifically:", "DOD lacks a mission statement and performance measures for  its PME and JPME programs. DASD(FE&T) officials stated that prior  to the draft policy OUSD(P&R) had not developed a mission  statement and performance measures for PME, but told us that the  draft instruction would include a mission statement and examples of  performance measures. However, we did not identify a mission  statement for PME that clearly defines the respective key purposes for  this program when we reviewed the draft instruction. According to  leading training and development practices, a mission statement is  important to an organization\u2019s success because it explains the  organization\u2019s purpose and goals and is the basis for goal-directed  performance measures. The draft instruction proposes the  performance measures the military services should track and assess  as part of their required annual program reviews, such as graduate  assignments and retention rates. Performance measures are  important because they assess an organization\u2019s progress toward  achieving results that are aligned with its mission. However, without  a department-wide mission statement for PME and JPME,  OUSD(P&R) is not well-positioned to propose performance measures  for the military services to track and enable OUSD(P&R) to assess the  effectiveness of these programs.", "Further, our review of the draft instruction found no examples of cost- related performance measures. DASD(FE&T) officials confirmed that  cost-related performance measures were not included in the draft  instruction, but told us that they planned to coordinate with officials  from the Joint Staff Directorate for Joint Force Development to refine  the performance measures sometime in the future. DOD\u2019s Financial  Management Regulation states that performance measurement is a  means of evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and results, and that a  balanced performance measurement scorecard includes nonfinancial  and financial measures focusing on quality, cycle time, and cost.  Moreover, leading training and development practices state that  performance measures should include both qualitative and  quantitative measures to assess training results, and include the  identification and tracking of costs. These same leading practices  state that organizations should compare associated costs and  monetized benefits of training programs to determine return on  investment. DASD(FE&T) officials told us that having cost information  on the military services\u2019 PME and JPME programs to determine return  on investment would enable their office to compare and make well- informed decisions about these programs.", "DOD lacks a requirement for the military services to report  periodically on PME and JPME programs. OUSD(P&R) has not  established a requirement for the military services\u2019 to periodically  report information to its office on the military services\u2019 respective PME  and JPME programs. For example, the Chairman\u2019s PAJE reports that  document accreditation findings and include a full, conditional, or no  accreditation determination are not provided to OUSD(P&R).  According to the OPMEP, PAJE reports will be forwarded to the Chief  of the applicable military service, the Director of the Defense  Intelligence Agency, or the President of the National Defense  University for appropriate action. A Joint Staff official confirmed that  PAJE reports are not provided to OUSD(P&R).", "Our review of the draft instruction found no requirement for the  Chairman to provide PAJE reports to OUSD(P&R), nor is there a  requirement for the military services to report information on their  PME and JPME programs\u2014such as their annual program reviews\u2014to  OUSD(P&R). According to DASD(FE&T) officials, reporting  requirements were omitted from the draft instruction because their  office lacks the personnel to review and assess the information the  military services would be required to collect and report. However,  without a requirement for the military services\u2019 to periodically report  information on their PME and JPME programs, OUSD(P&R)\u2019s ability  to assess the effectiveness of these programs and perform  meaningful oversight will continue to be limited.", "Leading training and development practices state that organizations  should collect appropriate performance data during implementation  and establish accountability for the results of these efforts.

While the Financial Management Regulation requires the military services  to submit separate annual budget request data exhibits for most of their  intermediate- and senior-level PME programs, it does not require the  Marine Corps to submit an exhibit for its senior-level PME program, the  Marine Corps War College. Based on our review of the Marine Corps\u2019  fiscal years 2014 through 2020 budget request data exhibits and  according to the USD(Comptroller) and Marine Corps officials, the Marine  Corps did not submit a budget request data exhibit for the Marine Corps  War College during this 7-year period.

Additionally, section 2162 of title 10, U.S. Code, requires the  Secretary of Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to promulgate a uniform cost accounting system  for use by the Secretaries of the military departments in preparing budget  requests for the operation of PME schools. However, the DOD Financial  Management Regulation does not specify how the military services  should account for the data required for the military services\u2019 budget  request data submissions. Consequently, the budget request data  reported by the military services varies. For example, in their fiscal year  2020 budget request data submissions the Army and the Air Force  combined distance education and in-residence education programs, the  Navy reported this data in separate exhibits, and the Marine Corps  omitted distance education costs for its intermediate-level PME program.

The Skelton Panel  undertook a comprehensive congressional review of PME, and published  its findings and recommendations in a 1989 report (the Skelton Report).  Although the Skelton Panel did not take a comprehensive look at how  well PME institutions were funded to accomplish their mission, the panel  inquired into cost per student at each school and reported receiving from  OSD raw data submitted by each PME institution, which included  considerable differences in scope and cost methodology used by the  PME institutions. The Skelton Report recommended that DOD establish a  uniform cost accounting system for the PME schools, and that the annual  report of the Secretary of Defense provide data on PME costs beginning  in 1990. A 2010 congressional report focused on PME developments  since the Skelton Panel\u2019s review, investigated whether a uniform cost  accounting system existed, among other things. The congressional  report found that DOD did not have a uniform cost accounting method for  PME schools, and that it had not provided cost data to support useful  comparisons among PME schools. The report included a  recommendation for DOD to report its PME funding to Congress using a  standardized accounting method for cost per student at each of the PME  institutions, as recommended by the Skelton Panel in 1989. According to  DASD(FE&T) and Joint Staff officials, the department has not collected or  reported PME program cost information to Congress as the 1989 Skelton  Report and the 2010 congressional report both recommended.", "Without complete and uniform budget request data, USD(Comptroller)\u2019s  ability to monitor the military services\u2019 PME programs, identify program  trends within the Marine Corps and among the other military services\u2019  PME programs, and formulate meaningful inter-service comparisons is  limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on PME to prepare its military personnel for the intellectual  demands of complex contingences and major conflicts that typically  involve more than a single military service.
