However, program officials anticipate a gap in satellite data between the time that the S-NPP satellite reaches the end of its life and the JPSS-1 satellite becomes operational. Given the criticality of satellite data to weather forecasts, the likelihood of a significant satellite data gap, and the potential impact of a gap on the health and safety of the U.S. population and economy, GAO added this issue to its High Risk List in 2013.", "GAO was asked to review the JPSS program because of the importance of polar satellite data. GAO's objectives were to (1) evaluate NOAA's progress in sustaining the continuity of NOAA's polar-orbiting satellite system through S-NPP and JPSS satellites; (2) evaluate the quality of NOAA's program schedule; and (3) assess NOAA's plans to address potential gaps in polar satellite data. To do so, GAO analyzed program management status reports, milestone reviews, and schedule data; examined polar gap contingency plans; and interviewed agency and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has made noteworthy progress on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program by delivering data from its first satellite--the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP)--to weather forecasters, completing significant instrument development for the next satellite (called JPSS-1), and reducing the program's life cycle cost estimate from $12.9 billion to $11.3 billion by refocusing on weather products. However, key challenges remain. Specifically, S-NPP has not yet achieved full operational capability because the program is behind schedule in validating the readiness of satellite products. Also, the program does not track whether key users are using its products or if the products meet the users' needs. In addition, issues with the JPSS ground system schedules have delayed the delivery of key system capabilities. Until the program addresses these challenges, it may continue to experience delays in delivering actionable S-NPP data to system users and in meeting JPSS-1 development schedules.", "A program's success depends in part on having an integrated master schedule that defines when and how long work will occur and how activities are related to each other; however, the JPSS program office does not yet have a complete integrated master schedule and weaknesses exist in component schedules. Specifically, the program established an integrated master schedule in June 2013 and is reporting a 70 percent confidence level in the JPSS-1 launch date. However, about one-third of the program schedule is missing information needed to establish the sequence in which activities occur. In addition, selected component schedules supporting the JPSS-1 satellite have weaknesses including schedule constraints that have not been justified. Until the program completes its integrated schedule and addresses weaknesses in component schedules, it will lack the information needed to effectively monitor development progress and have less assurance of meeting the planned JPSS-1 launch date.", "While NOAA developed a mitigation plan to address a potential 14 to 18 month gap in afternoon polar satellite data in October 2012 and subsequently identified additional alternatives for addressing potential gaps, it has not yet established a comprehensive contingency plan. Specifically, NOAA has not yet revised its mitigation plan to include the new alternatives, and the plan lacks several key elements, such as triggers for when to take key actions and detailed procedures for implementing them. Until NOAA establishes a comprehensive plan, it may not be sufficiently prepared to mitigate anticipated gaps in polar satellite coverage."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending NOAA develop a mechanism to track the usage of its satellite products, establish a complete integrated master schedule, address weaknesses in component schedules, and address shortfalls in polar satellite gap contingency plans.

Managed jointly by the Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  the Department of Defense (DOD)/U.S. Air Force, and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the program was  considered critical to the nation\u2019s ability to maintain the continuity of data  required for weather forecasting and global climate monitoring through  the year 2026.", "However, in the 8 years after the development contract was awarded in  2002, the NPOESS cost estimate had more than doubled\u2014to about $15  billion, launch dates had been delayed by over 5 years, significant  functionality had been removed from the program, and the program\u2019s tri- agency management structure had proven to be ineffective. Importantly,  delays in launching the satellites put the program\u2019s mission at risk. To  address these challenges, a task force led by the White House\u2019s Office of  Science and Technology Policy reviewed the management and  governance of the NPOESS program. In February 2010, the Director of  the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a decision to  disband the NPOESS acquisition and, instead, have NOAA and DOD  undertake separate acquisitions, with NOAA responsible for satellites in  the afternoon orbit and DOD responsible for satellites in the early morning  orbit. After that decision, NOAA began developing plans for the Joint  Polar Satellite System (JPSS). In October 2011, the JPSS program  successfully launched the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership  (S-NPP) demonstration satellite, the first in a series of satellites to be  launched as part of NOAA\u2019s JPSS program.", "Given your interest in the progress NOAA has made on the JPSS  program, our objectives were to (1) evaluate NOAA's progress in meeting  program objectives of sustaining the continuity of the polar-orbiting  satellite system through the S-NPP and JPSS satellites, (2) evaluate the  quality of the JPSS program schedule, and (3) assess NOAA\u2019s plans to  address potential gaps in polar satellite data.", "To evaluate NOAA's progress in meeting its program objectives, we  analyzed plans and reports on the satellites\u2019 system development efforts  and on the maturity of S-NPP products. We compared current  requirements to prior iterations to assess how recent changes in  capabilities have impacted program goals and objectives. We also  interviewed JPSS program officials to discuss S-NPP product  development, JPSS system development, and changes in requirements  for JPSS satellites. To evaluate the quality of NOAA's program schedule,  we used an exposure draft of GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment Guide to  assess component contractor schedules as well as the program\u2019s  schedule risk analysis and interviewed cognizant JPSS program office  and contractor officials. To assess NOAA\u2019s plans to address potential  gaps in polar satellite data, we compared NOAA\u2019s gap mitigation plan and  contracted alternatives study against risk mitigation and contingency best  practices from GAO and advocated by leading organizations, determined  planning shortfalls and key remaining activities for NOAA to accomplish,  and interviewed NOAA headquarters and JPSS program officials about  their plans.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 through  September 2013 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  Additional details on our objectives, scope, and methodology are provided  in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1960s, the United States has operated two separate  operational polar-orbiting meteorological satellite systems: the Polar- orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series, which is  managed by NOAA, and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program  (DMSP), which is managed by the Air Force. These satellites obtain  environmental data that are processed to provide graphical weather  images and specialized weather products. These satellite data are also  the predominant input to numerical weather prediction models, which are  a primary tool for forecasting weather days in advance\u2014including  forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes. The weather products  and models are used to predict the potential impact of severe weather so  that communities and emergency managers can help prevent and  mitigate its effects. Polar satellites also provide data used to monitor  environmental phenomena, such as ozone depletion and drought  conditions, as well as data sets that are used by researchers for a variety  of studies such as climate monitoring.", "Unlike geostationary satellites, which maintain a fixed position relative to  the earth, polar-orbiting satellites constantly circle the earth in an almost  north-south orbit, providing global coverage of conditions that affect the  weather and climate. Each satellite makes about 14 orbits a day. As the  earth rotates beneath it, each satellite views the entire earth\u2019s surface  twice a day. Currently, there is one operational POES satellite and two  operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they cross the  equator in the early morning, midmorning, and early afternoon. In  addition, the government relies on a European satellite, called the  Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite, for satellite observations in  the midmorning orbit. In addition to the operational satellites, NOAA, the  Air Force, and a European weather satellite organization maintain older  satellites that still collect some data and are available to provide limited  backup to the operational satellites should they degrade or fail. The last  POES satellite was launched in February 2009. The Air Force plans to  launch its two remaining DMSP satellites as needed. Figure 1 illustrates  the current operational polar satellite constellation.", "Polar satellites gather a broad range of data that are transformed into a  variety of products. Satellite sensors observe different bands of radiation  wavelengths, called channels, which are used for remotely determining  information about the earth\u2019s atmosphere, land surface, oceans, and the  space environment. When first received, satellite data are considered raw  data. To make them usable, processing centers format the data so that  they are time-sequenced and include earth-location and calibration  information. After formatting, these data are called raw data records. The  centers further process these raw data records into channel-specific data  sets, called sensor data records and temperature data records. These  data records are then used to derive weather and climate products called  environmental data records. These environmental data records include a  wide range of atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage,  temperature, humidity, and ozone distribution; land surface products  showing snow cover, vegetation, and land use; ocean products depicting  sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and wave height; and  characterizations of the space environment. Combinations of these data  records (raw, sensor, temperature, and environmental data records) are  also used to derive more sophisticated products, including outputs from  numerical weather models and assessments of climate trends. Figure 2 is  a simplified depiction of the various stages of satellite data processing,  and figure 3 depicts examples of two different weather products.", "With the expectation that combining the POES and DMSP programs  would reduce duplication and result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994  Presidential Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the  two satellite programs into a single satellite program\u2014NPOESS\u2014capable  of satisfying both civilian and military requirements. The converged  program, NPOESS, was considered critical to the nation\u2019s ability to  maintain the continuity of data required for weather forecasting and global  climate monitoring. NPOESS satellites were expected to replace the  POES and DMSP satellites in the morning, midmorning, and afternoon  orbits when they neared the end of their expected life spans.", "To manage this program, DOD, NOAA, and NASA formed a tri-agency  Integrated Program Office, with NOAA responsible for overall program  management for the converged system and for satellite operations, the  Air Force responsible for acquisition, and NASA responsible for facilitating  the development and incorporation of new technologies into the  converged system.", "When the primary NPOESS contract was awarded in August 2002, the  program was estimated to cost about $7 billion through 2018. The  program was to include the procurement and launch of 6 satellites over  the life of the program, with each satellite hosting a subset of 13  instruments. The planned instruments included 11 environmental  sensors, and two systems supporting specific user services (see table 1).  To reduce the risk involved in developing new technologies and to  maintain climate data continuity, the program planned to launch the  demonstration satellite in May 2006. This satellite was intended to  demonstrate the functionality of selected instruments that would later be  included on the NPOESS satellites. The first NPOESS satellite was to be  available for launch in March 2008.", "In the years after the program was initiated, NPOESS encountered  significant technical challenges in sensor development, program cost  growth, and schedule delays. By November 2005, we estimated that the  program\u2019s cost had grown to $10 billion, and the schedule for the first  launch was delayed by almost 2 years. These issues led to a 2006  decision to restructure the program, which reduced the program\u2019s  functionality by decreasing the number of planned satellites from 6 to 4,  and the number of instruments from 13 to 9. As part of the decision,  officials decided to reduce the number of orbits from three (early morning,  midmorning, and afternoon) to two (early morning and afternoon) and to  rely solely on the European satellites for midmorning orbit data.", "Even after the restructuring, however, the program continued to  encounter technical issues in developing two sensors, significant tri- agency management challenges, schedule delays, and further cost  increases. Because the schedule delays could lead to satellite data gaps,  in March 2009 agency executives decided to use S-NPP as an  operational satellite. Later, in August 2009, faced with costs that were  expected to reach about $15 billion and launch schedules that were  delayed by over 5 years, the Executive Office of the President formed a  task force, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to  investigate the management and acquisition options that would improve  the NPOESS program. As a result of this review, in February 2010, the  Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that  NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly procure the NPOESS satellite  system; instead each agency would plan and acquire its own satellite  system. Specifically, NOAA would be responsible for the afternoon orbit  and the observations planned for the first and third satellites. DOD would  be responsible for the early morning orbit and the observations planned  for the second and fourth satellites. The partnership with the European  satellite agencies for the midmorning orbit was to continue as planned.  When this decision was announced, NOAA and NASA immediately began  planning for a new satellite program in the afternoon orbit called JPSS.  DOD began planning for a new satellite program in the morning orbit,  called the Defense Weather Satellite System, but later decided to  terminate the program and reassess its requirements, as directed by  Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Initial NOAA Plans for the JPSS Program", "paragraphs": ["After the decision was made to disband the NPOESS program in 2010,  NOAA began the JPSS satellite program. Key plans included: acquiring and launching two satellites for the afternoon orbit, called  relying on NASA for system acquisition, engineering, and integration;  completing, launching, and supporting S-NPP; developing and integrating five sensors on the two satellites; finding alternative host satellites for selected instruments that would  not be accommodated on the JPSS satellites; and providing ground system support for S-NPP, JPSS, and the Defense  Weather Satellite System; data communications for MetOp and  DMSP; and data processing for NOAA\u2019s use of microwave data from  an international satellite.", "In 2010, NOAA estimated that the life cycle costs of the JPSS program  would be approximately $11.9 billion for a program lasting through fiscal  year 2024, which included $2.9 billion in NOAA funds spent on NPOESS  through fiscal year 2010. Subsequently, the agency undertook a cost  estimating exercise where it validated that the cost of the full set of JPSS  functions from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2028 would be $11.3  billion. After adding the agency\u2019s sunk costs, which had increased to $3.3  billion through fiscal year 2011, the program\u2019s life cycle cost estimate  totaled $14.6 billion. This amount was $2.7 billion higher than the $11.9  billion estimate for JPSS when NPOESS was disbanded in 2010.", "In working with the Office of Management and Budget to establish the  president\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget request, NOAA officials stated that  they agreed to cap the JPSS life cycle cost at $12.9 billion through 2028,  to fund JPSS at roughly $900 million per year through 2017, and to merge  funding for two climate sensors into the JPSS budget. Because this cap  was $1.7 billion below the expected $14.6 billion life cycle cost of the full  program, NOAA decided to remove selected elements from the satellite  program. Table 2 compares the planned cost, schedule, and scope of  NOAA\u2019s satellite programs at different points in time.", "We have issued a series of reports on the NPOESS and JPSS programs  highlighting technical issues, cost growth, and key management  challenges affecting the tri-agency program structure. In June 2012, we  reported that while NOAA officials communicated publicly and often about  the risk of a polar satellite data gap, the agency had not established plans  to mitigate the gap. At the time, NOAA officials stated that the agency  would continue to use existing satellites as long as they provide data and  that there were no viable alternatives to the JPSS program. However, our  report noted that a more comprehensive mitigation plan was essential  since it is possible that other governmental, commercial, or foreign  satellites could supplement the polar satellite data. Because it could take  time to adapt ground systems to receive, process, and disseminate an  alternative satellite\u2019s data, we noted that any delays in establishing  mitigation plans could leave the agency little time to leverage its  alternatives. We recommended that NOAA establish mitigation plans for  risks associated with pending satellite gaps in the afternoon orbit as well  as potential gaps in the early morning and midmorning orbits. NOAA  agreed with the report\u2019s recommendation and noted that the National  Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service\u2014a NOAA  component agency\u2014had performed analyses on how to mitigate potential  gaps in satellite data and planned to provide a report by August 2012.", "More recently, in February 2013, we added the potential gap in weather  satellite data to our biennial High-Risk list. In that report, we noted that  satellite data gaps in the morning or afternoon polar orbits would lead to  less accurate and timely weather forecasting; as a result, advanced  warning of extreme events would be affected. Such extreme events could  include hurricanes, storm surges, and floods. For example, the National  Weather Service performed case studies to demonstrate how its  forecasts would have been affected if there were no polar satellite data in  the afternoon orbit, and noted that its forecasts for the \u201cSnowmaggedon\u201d  winter storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic coast in February 2010 would have  predicted a less intense storm further east, with about half of the  precipitation at 3, 4, and 5 days before the event. Specifically, the models  would have under-forecasted the amount of snow by at least 10 inches.  Similarly, a European weather organization recently reported that  NOAA\u2019s forecasts of Hurricane Sandy\u2019s track could have been hundreds  of miles off without polar-orbiting satellites\u2014rather than identifying the  New Jersey landfall within 30 miles 4 days before landfall, the models  would have shown the storm remaining at sea. Such degradation in  forecasts and warnings would place lives, property, and our nation\u2019s  critical infrastructure in danger.", "We reported that the length of an afternoon polar satellite data gap could  span from 17 months to 3 years or more. In one scenario, S-NPP would  last its full expected 5-year life (to October 2016), and JPSS-1 would  launch as soon as possible (in March 2017) and undergo on-orbit  checkout for a year (until March 2018). In that case, the data gap would  extend 17 months. In another scenario, S-NPP would last only 3 years as  noted by NASA managers concerned with the workmanship of selected  S-NPP sensors. Assuming that the JPSS-1 launch occurred in March  2017 and the satellite data were certified for official use by March 2018,  this gap would extend for 41 months. Of course, any problems with JPSS- 1 development could delay the launch date and extend the gap period.  Figure 4 depicts four possible gap scenarios.", "We also noted that NOAA had recently established a mitigation plan for a  potential 14- to 18-month gap in the afternoon orbit, which identified and  prioritized options for obtaining critical observations, including alternative  satellite data sources and improvements to data assimilation in models  and listed technical, programmatic, and management steps needed to  implement these options. However, these plans were only a beginning.  We suggested that NOAA must make difficult decisions on which steps it  would implement to ensure that its mitigation plans are viable when  needed, including how these plans would be integrated with the agency\u2019s  broader end-to-end plans for sustaining weather forecasting capabilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NOAA Has Made Progress on JPSS Development, but Continues to Face Challenges in Completing S-NPP Products, Revising the Program\u2019s Scope, and Meeting Schedules", "paragraphs": ["NOAA has made progress towards JPSS program objectives of  sustaining the continuity of NOAA\u2019s polar-orbiting satellite capabilities  through the S-NPP, JPSS-1, and JPSS-2 satellites by (1) delivering  S-NPP data to weather forecasters and (2) by completing significant  instrument and spacecraft development for the JPSS-1 satellite.  However, the program is behind schedule in validating the readiness of  S-NPP products and has experienced delays on the ground system  schedules for the JPSS-1 satellite. Moreover, the program is moving to  revise its scope and objectives to reduce costs and prioritize NOAA\u2019s  weather mission.

To develop the precise data products, NOAA  established a process for calibrating and validating its products. Under  this process, most products (which are primarily sensor data records and  environmental data records) proceed through three different levels of  algorithm maturity\u2014the beta, provisional, and validated levels. NOAA  had originally planned to complete efforts to validate S-NPP products by  October 2013, which was 2 years after the S-NPP satellite was launched.  It is not enough, however, to simply deliver validated products. Both the  Software Engineering Institute and GAO recommend tracking whether  customers are receiving the expected value from products once they are  deployed, and whether corrective actions are needed. Moreover, in April  2013 the Executive Office of the President\u2019s National Science and  Technology Council released a national strategy for civil earth  observations that called for agencies to, among other things, track the  extent to which earth observation data are actually being used, track  whether the data had an impact, and provide data users a mechanism to  provide feedback regarding ease of use, suspected quality issues, and  other aspects of the data.", "The JPSS program has made progress on S-NPP since launching the  satellite in October 2011. Specifically, the program completed satellite  activation and commissioning in March 2012, and transitioned from  interim operations under NASA to routine operations under NOAA in  February 2013. The program also made key upgrades to the ground  system supporting S-NPP. For example, in November 2012 the office  completed an interim backup command and control facility that could  protect the health and safety of the satellite if unexpected issues occurred  at the primary mission operations facility. In addition, the JPSS program  office has been working to calibrate and validate S-NPP products in order  to make them precise enough for use in weather-related operations.", "While the program office plans to have 18 products validated for  operational use by September 2013, it is behind schedule for the other  products. Specifically, the program expects to complete validating 35  S-NPP products by the end of September 2014 and 1 other product by  the end of September 2015, almost 1 and 2 years later than originally  planned. In addition, the program office reported that 15 products do not  need to be validated, one product\u2019s validation date has not been  established, and 6 products do not have estimated validation dates  because the program plans to remove them from its requirements. The  program categorized its products by their priority, ranging from priority-1  for the highest priority products, to priority-4 for the lowest priority  products. According to NOAA and NASA officials, the S-NPP products\u2019  validation has been delayed in part because of issues initially identified on  VIIRS that had to be corrected and additional time needed to validate  environmental data record products that require observations of seasonal  weather phenomena. Further, program officials stated that they  rebaselined the planned product validation timelines in November 2011  and have been generally meeting the target dates of this revised plan.  Table 3 illustrates program-reported data on the number of products in  each priority level, examples of products, and the estimated validation  date for the last product at each level.", "Even though S-NPP products are not at the validated stage in which  products are ready for operational use, the National Weather Service  (NWS) has accepted certain products for use in its operational systems.  For example, the JPSS program office reported that NWS is using ATMS  temperature data records in its operational forecasts, and that the Alaska  Weather Forecast Offices are using VIIRS imagery in its forecasts. In  addition, NWS\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Prediction is  evaluating CrIS sensor data records for use in numerical weather  prediction, but has not yet used the data operationally because it is in the  midst of a computer upgrade. Officials also stated that the program  obtains information on the operational use of S-NPP data from other  NOAA offices, including the National Ocean Service and the National  Marine and Fisheries Service.", "While NOAA is aware of these uses, it does not track the extent to which  key satellite data users\u2014including users from the Air Force, Navy, Forest  Service, European weather offices, and academic institutions\u2014have  incorporated S-NPP data into their operations or if corrective actions are  needed to make the products more accurate or more effective for the  specific users. Program officials noted that they are not required to tailor  products to meet non-NOAA user requirements, and that they do not  have a tracking mechanism that would allow them to identify which  entities are using the data. They noted, however, that the program  obtains informal reports from customer representatives through various  working groups and forums, such as the Low-earth Orbiting  Requirements Working Group and the JPSS Customer Forum. While  these efforts obtain information from known customer groups, they do not  meet best practices for actively tracking whether customers are using the  products, receiving the expected value, or in need of product corrections.  Until the program office tracks the use of S-NPP and future JPSS  products, it will not have full knowledge of the extent to which products  are being used to assess the value they provide to end users and  whether corrective actions are needed.

A comprehensive schedule  includes all government and contractor activities, reflects resources  (labor, materials, and overhead) needed to do the work, and realistically  reflects how long each activity will take. A well-constructed schedule  includes activities that are sequenced with the most straightforward logic  possible, a critical path that represents a true model of the activities that  drive the project\u2019s earliest completion date, and total float that accurately  depicts schedule flexibility. A credible schedule reflects the order of  events necessary to achieve aggregated products or outcomes  (horizontal traceability) and maps varying levels of the schedule to one  another (vertical traceability). Also, a credible schedule includes data  about risks and opportunities that are used to predict a level of confidence  in meeting the project\u2019s completion date. A controlled schedule is updated  periodically by trained schedulers using actual progress and logic to  realistically forecast dates for program activities and is compared against  a designated baseline schedule to measure, monitor, and report the  project\u2019s progress. The JPSS program office is applying NASA\u2019s schedule  management handbook guidance to manage its schedules, which is  largely consistent with our guidance on scheduling best practices. Table 7  provides more detail on the best practices and key characteristics of a  reliable schedule.", "The quality of three selected component schedules supporting the JPSS- 1 mission\u2014VIIRS, the spacecraft, and the ground system\u2014was  inconsistent with respect to implementing the characteristics of a high- quality, reliable schedule. Each schedule had strengths and  weaknesses with respect to sound scheduling practices, but VIIRS was a  stronger schedule with fewer weaknesses compared to the ground  system and spacecraft schedules. Since the reliability of an integrated  schedule depends in part on the reliability of its subordinate schedules,  schedule quality weaknesses in these schedules could transfer to an IMS  derived from them. Table 8 identifies the quality of each of the selected  JPSS-1 component schedules based on the extent to which they met ten  best practices of high-quality and reliable schedules; the discussion that  follows highlights observed strengths and weaknesses from each  schedule. In addition, appendix III includes a more detailed assessment of  each schedule against the ten best practices.", "Of the ten best practices, the ground system schedule minimally met two  best practices, partially met two best practices, and substantially met six  best practices. There were strengths in the ground schedule in that the  contractor established a clear process for integrated information between  the schedule and its resource management software and the contractor  has performed resource leveling on the schedule. In addition, the  contractor stated that people responsible for the activities estimated  activity durations. Also, the contractor stated that it performs wellness  checks on the quality of the schedule after each update to identify issues  associated with missing logic or date constraints and provides a monthly  status briefing to the JPSS program office that addresses the status of  external schedule handoffs.", "However, there were also weaknesses in the ground schedule. For  example, activities on the critical path with date constraints are preventing  accurate calculations of the schedule\u2019s total float, or flexibility. In order for  the critical path to be valid, the activities on the critical path must also  have reasonable total float. Without a critical path that accurately  calculates schedule flexibility, the program office will not be able to  provide reliable timeline estimates or identify when problems or changes  may occur and their effect on downstream work. Moreover, while the  contractor conducted a schedule risk analysis on the schedule, that  analysis was for select near-term milestones rather than the readiness of  the ground system for the launch of JPSS-1 and it did not include the  risks most likely to delay the project. A schedule risk analysis should be  conducted through the finish milestone and should include risk data to  determine activities that most often end up on the critical path.", "Of the ten best practices, the spacecraft schedule partially met eight best  practices, and substantially met two best practices. There were strengths  in the spacecraft schedule in that it was horizontally and vertically  traceable; the contractor provided evidence of monthly progress updates  to management, including status reporting of key milestones, handoffs,  explanations of date changes, and an analysis of the critical and near- critical paths; the contractor conducted a schedule risk analysis; and the  schedule included baseline dates of activities for comparisons of actual  performance to date.", "However, there were also weaknesses in the spacecraft schedule. For  example, the schedule had a low level of detail and included one-third of  remaining activities with durations greater than 44 days, even after  accounting for undefined and procurement-related activities. When  establishing the durations of activities, they should be reasonably short  and meaningful and allow for discrete progress measurement. Durations  longer than 2 months do not facilitate objective measurement of  accomplished effort and the milestone to detail activity ratio does not  allow for effective progress measurement and reporting. As another  example of a quality shortfall, the schedule was overly flexible with high  float values that were not justified in schedule documentation.  Specifically, 70 percent of remaining activities had about 5 business  weeks of float, including 67 activities that had over 1,000 days of float,  meaning that these activities could slip approximately 3.5 years without  affecting the project\u2019s completion date. In order to establish reasonable  total float, there should be documented justification for high float values in  the schedule. Without this, it is unclear whether float values are high due  to factors accepted by management and which are due to incomplete  logic or other issues.", "The VIIRS schedule partially met one best practice, substantially met  seven best practices, and fully met two best practices. There were  strengths in the VIIRS schedule in that the contractor established a clear  process for integrating information between the schedule and resource  management software, stated that durations were estimated by the  people responsible for the activities based on work to be done, and  justified in its schedule documentation activities with durations longer than  44 days. In addition, the contractor justified in schedule documentation  the use of all date constraints, identified a valid driving path of activities  for managing the program, and identified reasonable float values or  justified them to the JPSS program office. Further, the contractor provided  a schedule narrative accompanying each status update, which describes  the status of key milestone dates (including the program finish date);  explanations for changes in key dates; and a description of critical paths.", "However, there were also weaknesses in the VIIRS schedule. For  example, the schedule had milestones that represented handoffs  between contractor integrated product teams, but it did not include  handoffs to the JPSS program office. In order to verify a schedule\u2019s  horizontal traceability, handoffs should link products and outcomes  associated with other sequenced activities. Without this, there could be  different expectations between management and activity owners. As  another example, the contractor conducted a schedule risk analysis with  a good schedule network and obtained three different duration estimates  from subject matter experts. However, the duration estimates did not  reflect risks from the project\u2019s risk register and the analysis was focused  only on activities on the critical path. This approach is flawed because  activities that are not currently on the critical path could become critical as  risks occur.", "The inconsistency in quality among the three schedules has multiple  causes. Program and contractor officials explained that certain  weaknesses have been corrected with updated schedules. In other  cases, the weaknesses lacked documented explanation in part because  the JPSS program office did not require contractors to provide such  documentation. Based on program schedule documentation, the schedule  management and reporting requirements varied across contractors  without documented justification for tailored approaches, which may  partially explain the inconsistency in practices among the schedules.  Since the reliability of an integrated schedule depends in part on the  reliability of its subordinate schedules, schedule quality weaknesses in  these schedules will transfer to an integrated master schedule derived  from them. Consequently, the extent to which there are quality  weaknesses in JPSS-1 support schedules further constrains the  program\u2019s ability to monitor progress, manage key dependencies, and  forecast completion dates.

The analysis does not focus  solely on the critical path because, with risk considered, any activity may  potentially affect the program\u2019s completion date.

First, the model that the  program office used was based on flight project activities rather than an  integrated schedule consisting of flight, ground, program office, and other  activities relevant to the development and launch of JPSS-1. As a result,  the JPSS program office\u2019s confidence level projections do not factor in the  ongoing scheduling issues that are impacting the ground project. Had  those issues been considered, the JPSS-1 confidence level would have  been lower. Second, there are concerns regarding the spacecraft  schedule\u2019s quality as discussed in the previous section. Factoring in these  concerns, the confidence of the JPSS-1 satellite\u2019s schedule and projected  launch date would be lower. We have previously reported that when using  the JCL, NASA projects did not always include relevant cost and risk  inputs.", "While program officials noted that they included key ground system risks  in their calculations, they did not include ground system scope in the JCL  because it was too difficult to allocate ground system components to  individual missions.

We found other areas of questionable sequencing logic. For instance, there are about 10  percent of remaining activities in the schedule that have lags and leads, including some  instances of leads with start-to-finish logic\u2014a particularly abnormal logical relationship.  We also found date constraints pervasive throughout the schedule: 140 activities have  soft constraints and 17 have hard constraints. Hard constraints are useful for calculating  the amount of float available in the schedule and, therefore, the realism of the required  project finish date and available resources during schedule development. However, they  may be abused if they force activities to occur on specific dates that are determined off- line without much regard for the realism of the assumptions necessary to achieve them.", "The schedule defines activities with zero total float as critical. However, partly because  of logic issues, the critical path as calculated by the scheduling software was convoluted  and most likely unreliable. The path includes lags, leads, long-duration activities, and  activities with hard constraints, which by definition will appear as critical. Officials stated  they agreed that software-calculated critical paths cannot be relied upon in a complex  schedule, and said they report the longest (or driving path) to management. Ideally, the  critical path and the longest path should be the same, but our analysis found the longest  path to be somewhat different than the default critical path; it does not include several  activities that appeared on the critical path because of their date constraints.

The schedule is generally horizontally traceable. The  schedule clearly identifies givers and receivers and negative total float calculations  respond appropriately when significant delays are introduced into the network. However,  negative float is calculated because key milestones are constrained. While the negative  float may be an accurate assessment of potential delay, management may not be aware  of potential delays when constrained dates are reported in summary-level schedules.", "Officials stated that they follow an internal process to perform schedule risk analyses on  the schedule. Officials also stated that three-point durations are applied to activities,  correlation is accounted for, and a Monte Carlo analysis is run on the schedule to derive  probabilities for forecasted dates. Although the contractor has no contractual  requirement to share schedule risk analysis results with the JPSS program office, it  provided a summary of its risk assessment report and instructions.
