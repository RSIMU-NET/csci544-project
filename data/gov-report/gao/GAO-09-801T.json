In response to an administration reform initiative and related executive order, agencies have, among other things, established asset management plans, standardized data, and adopted performance measures. According to OMB, the federal government disposed of excess real property valued at $1 billion in fiscal year 2008, bringing the total to over $8 billion since fiscal year 2004. OMB also reported success in developing a comprehensive database of federal real property assets and implemented a GAO recommendation to improve the reliability of the data in this database by developing a framework to validate these data. GAO also found that the Veterans Administration has made significant progress in reducing underutilized space. In another report, GAO found that six agencies reviewed have processes in place to prioritize maintenance and repair items. While these actions represent positive steps, some of the long-standing problems that led GAO to designate this area as high risk persist. Although GAO's work over the years has shown that building ownership often costs less than operating leases, especially for long term space needs, in 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA), which acts as the government's leasing agent, leased more property than it owned for the first time. Given GSA's ongoing reliance on leasing, it is critical that GSA manage its leasing activities effectively. However, in January 2007, GAO identified numerous areas that warranted improvement in GSA's implementation of four contracts for national broker services for its leasing program. GSA has implemented 7 of GAO's 11 recommendations to improve these contracting efforts. Although GAO is encouraged by GSA's actions on these recommendations, GAO has not evaluated their impact. Moreover, in more recent work, GAO has continued to find that the government's real property data are not always reliable and agencies continue to retain excess property and face challenges from repair and maintenance backlogs. Regarding security, GAO testified on July 8, 2009, that preliminary results show that the ability of the Federal Protective Service (FPS), which provides security services for about 9,000 GSA facilities, to protect federal facilities is hampered by weaknesses in its contract security guard program. Among other things, GAO investigators carrying the components for an improvised explosive device successfully passed undetected through security checkpoints monitored by FPS's guards at each of the 10 federal facilities where GAO conducted covert testing. As GAO has reported in the past, real property management problems have been exacerbated by deep-rooted obstacles that include competing stakeholder interests, various budgetary and legal limitations, and weaknesses in agencies' capital planning. While reforms to date are positive, the new administration and Congress will be challenged to sustain reform momentum and reach consensus on how such obstacles should be addressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We welcome the opportunity to provide this update on our recent work on  issues that led us to designate federal real property as a high-risk area. As  you know, in January 2003, we designated federal real property a high-risk  area because of long-standing problems with excess and underutilized  property, deteriorating facilities, unreliable real property data, over- reliance on costly leasing, and building security challenges. As we have  reported as part of the high-risk series, the federal real property portfolio  largely reflects a business model and the technological and transportation  environment of the 1950s. Many federal real property assets are no longer  needed; others are not effectively aligned with, or responsive to, agencies\u2019  changing missions. We issued our latest update on this area in January  2009, finding that agencies have taken some positive steps to address real  property issues but that some of the core problems that led to our  designation of this area as high risk persist. My testimony today is based  on our extensive body of work related to these issues. We also spoke with  officials at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the General  Services Administration (GSA) to update our information on agencies\u2019  efforts to address our prior recommendations, and we reviewed recently- introduced initiatives related to agencies\u2019 real property disposal  authorities. My testimony focuses on (1) progress made by major real  property-holding agencies to strategically manage real property, (2)  ongoing problems we have identified in recent work regarding agencies\u2019  efforts to address real property issues, and (3) underlying obstacles we  have identified through prior work as hampering agencies\u2019 real property  reform efforts governmentwide. We conducted our work in Washington,  D.C., in June and July 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

The administration had also established a Federal Real  Property Council (FRPC) that guides reform efforts.", "Under the real property initiative, OMB has been evaluating the status and  progress of agencies\u2019 real property management improvement efforts since  the third quarter of fiscal year 2004 using a quarterly scorecard that color  codes agencies\u2019 progress\u2014green for success, yellow for mixed results, and  red for unsatisfactory. As Figure 1 shows, according to OMB\u2019s analysis,  many of these agencies have made progress in accurately accounting for,  maintaining, and managing their real property assets so as to efficiently  meet their goals and objectives. As of the first quarter of 2009, 10 of the 15  agencies evaluated had achieved green status. According to OMB, the  agencies achieving green status have established 3-year timelines for  meeting the goals identified in their asset management plans; provided  evidence that they are implementing their asset management plans; used  real property inventory information and performance measures in decision  making; and managed their real property in accordance with their strategic  plan, asset management plan, and performance measures.

According to OMB, the federal government  disposed of excess real property valued at $1 billion in fiscal year 2008,  bringing the total to over $8 billion since fiscal year 2004. OMB also  reported success in developing a comprehensive database of federal real  property assets, the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP). OMB recently  took further action to improve the reliability of FRPP data by  implementing a recommendation we made in April 2007 to develop framework that agencies can use to better ensure the validity and  usefulness of key real property data in the FRPP. According to OMB  officials, OMB now requires agency-specific validation and verification  plans and has developed a FRPP validation protocol to certify agency data.  These actions are positive steps towards eventually developing a database  that can be used to improve real property management governmentwide.  However, it may take some time for these actions to result in consistently  reliable data, and, as described later in this testimony, in recent work we  have continued to find problems with the reliability and usefulness of  FRPP data.", "Furthermore, our work over the past year has found some other posi steps that some agencies have taken to address ongoing challenges.  Specifically:  In September 2008, we found that from fiscal year 2005 through 2007, VA  made significant progress in reducing underutilized space (space not used  to full capacity) in its buildings from 15.4 million square feet to 5.6 million  square feet. We also found that VA\u2019s use of various legal authorities, suc h  as its enhanced use lease authority (EUL), which allows it to enter into  long-term agreements with public and private entities for the use of VA  property in exchange for cash or in-kind consideration, likely contrib to its overall reduction of underutilized space since fiscal year 2005.

However, our  work over the years has shown that building ownership often costs less  than operating leases, especially for long-term space needs.", "In January 2008, we reported that federal agencies\u2019 extensive reliance on  leasing has continued, and that federal agencies occupied about 398  million square feet of leased building space domestically in fiscal year  2006, according to FRPP data. GSA, USPS, and USDA leased about 71  percent of this space, mostly for offices, and the military services leased  another 17 percent. For fiscal year 2008, GSA reported that for the first  time, it leased more space than it owned.", "In 10 GSA and USPS leases that we examined in the January 2008 report,  decisions to lease space that would be more cost-effective to own were  driven by the limited availability of capital for building ownership and  other considerations, such as operational efficiency and security. For  example, for four of seven GSA leases we analyzed, leasing was more  costly over time than construction\u2014by an estimated $83.3 million over 30  years. Although ownership through construction is often the least  expensive option, federal budget scorekeeping rules require the full cost of  this option to be recorded up front in the budget, whereas only the annual  lease payment and cancellation costs need to be recorded for operating  leases, reducing the up-front commitment even though the leases are  generally more costly over time. USPS is not subject to the scorekeeping  rules and cited operational efficiency and limited capital as its main  reasons for leasing.", "While OMB made progress in addressing long-standing real property  problems, efforts to address the leasing challenge have been limited. We  have raised this issue for almost 20 years. Several alternative approaches  have been discussed by various stakeholders, including scoring operating  leases the same as ownership, but none have been implemented. In our  2008 report, we recommended that OMB, in consultation with the Federal  Real Property Council and key stakeholders, develop a strategy to reduce  agencies\u2019 reliance on leased space for long-term needs when ownership  would be less costly. OMB agreed with our recommendation. According to  OMB officials, in response to this recommendation, an OMB working  group conducted an analysis of lease performance. OMB is currently using  this analysis as it works with officials of the new administration to assess  overall real property priorities in order to establish a roadmap for further  action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA\u2019s Initial Implementation of the National Brokers Services Contracts Demonstrated Need for Numerous Improvements", "paragraphs": ["With GSA\u2019s ongoing reliance on leasing, it is critical that GSA manage its  in-house and contracted leasing activities effectively. However, in January  2007, we identified numerous areas in GSA\u2019s implementation of four  contracts for national broker services that warranted improvement. Our  findings were particularly significant since, over time, GSA expects to  outsource the vast majority of its expiring lease workload.", "At one time, GSA performed lease acquisition, management, and  administration functions entirely in-house. In 1997, however, GSA started  entering into contracts for real estate services to carry out a portion of its  leasing program, and in October 2004, GSA awarded four contracts to  perform broker services nationwide (national broker services), with  contract performance beginning on April 1, 2005. GSA awarded two of the  four contracts to dual-agency brokerage firms\u2014firms that represent both  building owners and tenants (in this case, GSA acting on behalf of a tenant  agency). The other two awardees were tenant-only brokerage firms\u2014firms  that represent only the tenant in real estate transactions. Because using a  dual-agency brokerage firm creates an increased potential for conflicts of  interest, federal contracting requirements ordinarily would prohibit  federal agencies from using dual-agency brokers, but GSA waived the  requirements, as allowed, to increase competition for the leasing  contracts. When the contracts were awarded, GSA planned to shift at  least 50 percent of its expiring lease workload to the four awardees in the  first year of the contracts and to increase their share of GSA\u2019s expiring  leases to approximately 90 percent by 2010\u2014the fifth and final year of the  contracts. As of May 30, 2009, GSA estimated that the total value of the  four contracts was $485.6 million.", "We reviewed GSA\u2019s administration of the four national broker services  contracts (i.e., the national broker services program) for the first year of  the contracts which ended March 31, 2006. In our January 2007 report, we  identified a wide variety of issues related to GSA\u2019s early implementation of  these contracts. Problems included inadequate controls to (1) prevent  conflicts of interest and (2) ensure compliance with federal requirements  for safeguarding federal information and information systems used on  behalf of GSA by the four national brokers. We also reported, among other  matters, that GSA had not developed a method for quantifying what, if any,  savings had resulted from the contracts or for distributing work to the  brokers on the basis of their performance, as it had planned. We made 11  recommendations designed to improve GSA\u2019s overall management of the  national broker services program. As figure 2 shows, GSA has  implemented 7 of these 11 recommendations; has taken action to  implement another recommendation; and, after consideration, has decided  not to implement the remaining 3.

In April 2007, we reported that although some agencies  have made progress in collecting and reporting standardized real property  data for FRPP, data reliability is still a challenge at some of the agencies,  and agencies lacked a standard framework for data validation. We are  pleased that OMB has implemented our recommendation to develop a  framework that agencies can use to better ensure the validity and  usefulness of key real property data in the FRPP, as noted earlier.  However, in the past 2 years, we have found the following problems with  FRPP data:  In our January 2008 report on agencies\u2019 leasing, we found that, while FRPP  data were generally reliable for describing the leased inventory, data  quality concerns, such as missing data, would limit the usefulness of FRPP  for other purposes, such as strategic decision making.", "In our October 2008 report on federal agencies\u2019 repair and maintenance  backlogs, we found that the way six agencies define and estimate their  repair needs or backlogs varies. We also found that, according to OMB  officials, FRPP\u2019s definition of repair needs was purposefully vague so  agencies could use their existing data collection and reporting process.  Moreover, we found that condition indexes, which agencies report to  FRPP, cannot be compared across agencies because their repair estimates  are not comparable. As a result, these condition indexes cannot be used to  understand the relative condition or management of agencies\u2019 assets.  Thus, they should not be used to inform or prioritize funding decisions  between agencies. In this report, we recommended that OMB, in  consultation with the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board,  explore the potential for adding a uniform reporting requirement to FRPP  to capture the government\u2019s fiscal exposure related to real property repair  and maintenance. OMB agreed with our recommendation.", "In our February 2009 report on agencies\u2019 authorities to retain proceeds  from the sale of real property, we found that, because of inconsistent and  unreliable reporting, governmentwide data reported to FRPP were not  sufficiently reliable to analyze the extent to which the six agencies with  authority to sell real property and retain the proceeds from such sales  actually sold real property. Such data weaknesses reduce the  effectiveness of the FRPP as a tool to enable governmentwide  comparisons of real property efforts, such as the effort to reduce the  government\u2019s portfolio of unneeded property.", "Furthermore, although USPS is not required to submit data to FRPP, in  December 2007, we found reliability issues with USPS data that also  compromised the usefulness of the data for examining USPS\u2019s real  property performance.

We reported some federal agencies maintain a significant  amount of excess and underutilized property. For example, we found that  Energy, DHS, and NASA reported that over 10 percent of their facilities  were excess or underutilized. Agencies may also underestimate their  underutilized property if their data are not reliable. For example, in 2007,  we found during limited site visits to USPS facilities that six of the  facilities we visited had vacant space that local employees said could be  leased, but these facilities were not listed as having vacant, leasable space  in USPS\u2019s Facilities Database (see fig. 3). At that time, USPS officials  acknowledged the vacancies we cited and noted that local officials have  few incentives to report facilities\u2019 vacant, leasable space in the database.", "Underutilized properties present significant potential risks to federal  agencies because they are costly to maintain and could be put to more  cost-beneficial uses or sold to generate revenue for the government. In  2007, we also reported that addressing the needs of aging and  deteriorating federal facilities remains a problem for major real property- holding agencies, and that according to recent estimates, tens of billions of  dollars will be needed to repair or restore these assets so that they are  fully functional. In October 2008, we reported that agency repair backlog  estimates are not comparable and do not accurately capture the  government\u2019s fiscal exposure. We found that the six agencies we  reviewed had different processes in place to periodically assess the  condition of their assets and that they also generally used these processes  to identify repair and maintenance backlogs for their assets. Five agencies  identified repair needs of between $2.3 billion (NASA) and $12 billion  (DOI). GSA reported $7 billion in repair needs. The sixth agency, DOD, did  not report on its repair needs.

We found that FPS does not fully ensure that its contract  security guards have the training and certifications required to be  deployed to a federal facility and has limited assurance that its guards are  complying with post orders. For example, FPS does not have specific  national guidance on when and how guard inspections should be  performed; and FPS\u2019s inspections of guard posts at federal facilities are  inconsistent, and the quality varied in the six regions we visited. Moreover,  we identified substantial security vulnerabilities related to FPS\u2019s guard  program. GAO investigators carrying the components for an improvised  explosive device successfully passed undetected through security  checkpoints monitored by FPS\u2019s guards at each of the 10 level IV federal  facilities where we conducted covert testing. Once GAO investigators  passed the control access points, they assembled the explosive device and  walked freely around several floors of these level IV facilities with the  device in a briefcase. In response to our briefing on these findings, FPS  has recently taken some actions including increasing the frequency of  intrusion testing and guard inspections. However, implementing these  changes may be challenging, according to FPS. We previously testified  before this subcommittee in 2008 that FPS faces operational challenges,  funding challenges, and limitations with performance measures to assess  the effectiveness of its efforts to protect federal facilities. We  recommended, among other things, that the Secretary of DHS direct the  Director of FPS to develop and implement a strategic approach to better  manage its staffing resources, evaluate current and alternative funding  mechanisms, and develop appropriate performance measures.

For  example, we found that USPS was no longer pursuing a 2002 goal of  reducing the number of \u201credundant, low-value\u201d retail facilities, in part,  because of legal restrictions on and political pressures against closing  them. To close a post office, USPS is required to, among other things,  formally announce its intention to close the facility, analyze the impact of  the closure on the community, and solicit comments from the community.  Similarly, VA officials reported that disposal is often not an option for  most properties because of political stakeholders and constituencies,  including historic building advocates or local communities that want to  maintain their relationship with VA. In addition, Interior officials reported  that the department faces significant challenges in balancing the needs and  concerns of local and state governments, historical preservation offices,  political interests, and others, particularly when coupled with budget  constraints.

Federal  agencies are required by law to assess and pay for any environmental  cleanup that may be needed before disposing of a property\u2014a process  that may require years of study and result in significant costs. As valuable  as these legal requirements are, their administrative complexity and the  associated costs of complying with them create disincentives to the  disposal of excess property. For example, we reported that VA, like all  federal agencies, must comply with federal laws and regulations governing  property disposal that are intended to protect subsequent users of the  property from environmental hazards and to preserve historically  significant sites, among other purposes. We have reported that some VA  managers have retained excess property because the administrative  complexity and costs of complying with these requirements were  disincentives to disposal.

As we have testified previously, it seems reasonable to allow agencies to  retain enough of the proceeds to recoup the costs of disposal, and it may  make sense to permit agencies to retain additional proceeds for  reinvestment in real property where a need exists. However, in  considering whether to allow federal agencies to retain proceeds from real  property transactions, it is important for Congress to ensure that it  maintains appropriate control and oversight over these funds, including  the ability to redistribute the funds to accommodate changing needs.", "Two current initiatives relate to these issues.

In 2007, we recommended that OMB,  in conjunction with the FRPC, develop an action plan for how the FRPC  will address these key problems. According to OMB officials, these key  problems are among those being considered as OMB works with  administration officials to assess overall real property priorities in order to  establish a roadmap for further action. While reforms to date are positive,  the new administration and Congress will be challenged to sustain reform  momentum and reach consensus on how the ongoing obstacles should be  addressed.", "Madam Chair, this concludes my prepared statement.

To achieve these goals and gauge  an agency\u2019s success in accurately accounting for, maintaining, and  managing its real property assets so as to efficiently meet its goals and  objectives, the administration established the real property scorecard in  the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.

These 13 standards include 8 standards needed to  achieve yellow status, plus 5 additional standards.
