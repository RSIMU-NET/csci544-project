For instance, the composition of DHS's largest investigative component--U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)--includes the legacy Customs Service, which has extensive experience with money laundering and other financial crimes. Another DHS component, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has primary responsibility for interdictions between ports of entry.

ICE was adjusting the draft strategy to focus on the southwest border and encompass all aspects of smuggling, aliens as well as drugs and other contraband. In adjusting the strategy, ICE officials stressed the importance of incorporating lessons learned from ongoing follow-the-money approaches such as Operation ICE Storm, a multi-agency task force launched in October 2003 to crack down on migrant smuggling and related violence in Arizona. Also, the strategy's effectiveness depends partly on having clearly defined roles and responsibilities for ICE and CBP, two DHS components that have complementary antismuggling missions. In this regard, ICE and CBP signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2004 to address their respective roles and responsibilities, including provisions for sharing information and intelligence. Currently, however, there is no mechanism in place for tracking the number and the results of referrals made by CBP to ICE for investigation. CBP and ICE officials acknowledged that establishing a tracking mechanism could have benefits for both DHS components. Such a mechanism would help ICE ensure that appropriate action is taken on the referrals. Also, CBP could continue to pursue certain leads if ICE--for lack of available resources or other reasons--cannot take action on the referrals. In fiscal year 2004, about 2,400 criminal defendants were convicted in federal district courts under the primary alien-smuggling statute, and ICE reported seizures totaling $7.3 million from its alien-smuggling investigations. For the first 6 months of fiscal year 2005, ICE reported $7.8 million in seizures from alien-smuggling investigations. A concern raised by ICE and the Department of Justice is the lack of adequate statutory civil forfeiture authority for seizing real property, such as \"stash\" houses where smugglers hide aliens while awaiting payment and travel arrangements to final destinations throughout the nation. However, Justice does not have a legislative proposal on this subject pending before Congress because the department's legislative policy resources have been focused on other priorities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Globally, alien smuggling generates illicit revenues estimated to total  billions of dollars annually and is recognized as a significant and growing  problem that can pose a serious threat to the security of the United States,  a primary destination country. Our May 2000 report noted that although it  is likely that most aliens smuggled into the United States seek economic  opportunities, some are brought into the United States as part of criminal  or terrorist enterprises. This concern has heightened since September 11,  2001. Creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in March  2003 has provided new opportunities to more effectively combat alien  smuggling, particularly in reference to using financial investigative  techniques to target and seize the monetary assets of smuggling  organizations. For instance, the department\u2019s largest investigative  component\u2014U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\u2014 integrates the legal authorities and investigative tools of the legacy  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the Customs Service,  which has extensive experience in combating money laundering and other  financial crimes.", "Accordingly, at congressional hearings in June and July 2003, ICE officials  testified that ICE was developing a national strategy to dismantle criminal  and terrorist organizations that smuggle or traffic in people by tracing and  stripping away their monetary assets.

Regarding ICE\u2019s strategy for combating alien smuggling,  we interviewed ICE officials to determine its implementation status and  the extent to which it includes a focus on following the money trail.  Regarding prosecutions and convictions in alien-smuggling cases, we  obtained relevant statistics from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.  Regarding seizures of monetary assets, we obtained data from the federal  government\u2019s applicable asset forfeiture funds. We discussed the sources  of these data with federal agency officials and worked with them to  resolve any inconsistencies. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this review. Also, to more fully understand and  illustrate the results of alien-smuggling investigations, we identified and  summarized recent alien-smuggling cases prosecuted in federal district  courts in three districts\u2014the District of Arizona, the Southern District of  California, and the Southern District of Texas\u2014each of which is  coterminous with the U.S.-Mexico, or southwest, border (see app. V). To  identify recent alien-smuggling cases federally prosecuted in these  districts, we reviewed press releases issued by the respective U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Office during January through June 2004. We discussed each of  these cases with U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and ICE officials.

This activity generally produces short- term profits for the smugglers. That is, after the aliens reach their final  destinations, they have no continuing relationship with the smugglers. In  legal and diplomatic references, alien smuggling is distinct from human  trafficking, although both smuggling and trafficking may have similarities  or common elements. In human trafficking, the criminality and human  rights abuses\u2014such as coercion for prostitution, labor sweat shops, or  other exploitative purposes and servitude arrangements\u2014may continue  after the migrants reach the United States in order to produce both short- term and long-term profits. Whereas a trafficked person is a victim, an  alien who consents to be smuggled is subject to criminal processing and  deportation.", "Given the underground nature of alien smuggling, exact figures quantifying  the size or scope of this transnational crime are not available. Nonetheless,  estimates by the United Nations and the federal law enforcement and  intelligence communities indicate that people smuggling is a huge and  highly profitable business worldwide, involving billions of dollars  annually, and the United States is a major destination country. People  smuggling is a continuously growing phenomenon, according to the  International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). The types of  smugglers can range from opportunistic business owners who seek cheap  labor to well-organized criminal groups that engage in alien smuggling,  drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. Partly because of increased  border monitoring by governments, Interpol has noted that criminal  networks increasingly control the transnational flow of migrants. That is,  willing illegal migrants increasingly rely on the services of criminal  syndicates that specialize in people smuggling, even though traveling  conditions may be inhumane and unsafe.", "Alien smuggling generally is prosecuted under section 274 of the  Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits knowingly or recklessly  bringing in, transporting, or harboring certain aliens. Depending on the  conduct charged, a conviction under section 274 could result in a  maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment per alien smuggled.  Moreover, significant enhanced penalties are provided for some section  274 violations that involve serious bodily injury or placing life in jeopardy.  If certain violations result in the death of any person, the convicted  defendant may be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or be  subjected to a death sentence. Other federal criminal statutes may also be  applicable. Specifically, alien-smuggling-related offenses are among the list  of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations predicate offenses (18  U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)) and also are included within the definition of specified  unlawful activity for purposes of the money-laundering statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7  1956). Further, criminal and civil forfeiture statutes may apply to alien- smuggling cases.", "Although ICE is a primary DHS component for investigating alien  smuggling, combating the smuggling of aliens into the United States can  involve numerous federal agencies, as well as the cooperation and  assistance of foreign governments. In addition to ICE, other relevant DHS  components are the Border Patrol (a \u201cfront-line defender\u201d), which is now  part of CBP, and the U.S. Coast Guard, which is tasked with enforcing  immigration law at sea. Additionally, significant roles in combating alien  smuggling are carried out by Department of Justice components, including  the Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and U.S.  Attorney\u2019s Offices, and Department of the Treasury components, such as  Internal Revenue Service (Criminal Investigation) and the Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Further, Department of State  components have significant roles. For instance, the Bureau of Diplomatic  Security\u2014the law enforcement arm of the State Department\u2014is  statutorily responsible for protecting the integrity of U.S. travel  documents. Perhaps the most coveted and sought after travel documents  in the world are U.S. passports and visas. Alien smuggling and travel  document fraud often are inextricably linked.", "The March 2003 creation of DHS, including its largest investigative  component (ICE), ushered in an opportunity for developing a strategy to  combat alien smuggling by, among other means, using financial  investigative techniques. Two months later, in May 2003, ICE used such  techniques to follow the money and prosecute the perpetrators of a  smuggling operation that had resulted in the deaths of 19 aliens in Victoria,  Texas. The Victoria 19 case has been cited by ICE as representing a new  model for fighting alien smuggling\u2014a model that ICE (1) subsequently  used to launch a multi-agency task force (Operation ICE Storm) in the  Phoenix (Arizona) metropolitan area and (2) reportedly was using to  develop ICE\u2019s national \u201cAntismuggling/Human-Trafficking Strategy.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE\u2019s Strategy for Combating Alien Smuggling Not Yet Issued", "paragraphs": ["Although its development was announced as early as June 2003, a national  strategy for combating alien smuggling had not been finalized and  implemented by ICE as of April 2005.

ICE  officials indicated that the draft strategy was being adjusted to broadly  cover all aspects of smuggling\u2014encompassing aliens, as well as drugs and  other illegal contraband\u2014and to focus initially on the southwest border.  The strategy\u2019s continuing development period is attributable partly to  organizational and training needs associated with integrating the separate  and distinct investigative functions of the legacy INS and the U.S. Customs  Service, following creation of DHS in March 2003. Also, ICE and CBP\u2014 two DHS components with complementary antismuggling missions\u2014 signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2004 to address  their respective roles and responsibilities, including provisions to ensure  proper and timely sharing of information and intelligence.

In October  2004, the officials told us that ICE was narrowing the initial focus of the  strategy to the southwest border, between the United States and Mexico\u2014 the most active area in terms of smuggling activity and open  investigations. The officials explained that ICE was developing a  comprehensive southwest border strategy, given the anticipated  displacement of smuggling activity to other areas along the border  resulting from Operation ICE Storm and the Arizona Border Control  Initiative (see app. II). In further elaboration, ICE headquarters officials  said that the southwest border strategy would broadly cover all aspects of  smuggling to encompass aliens as well as drugs and other illegal  contraband. The officials explained that lessons learned\u2014based, for  example, on the results of Operation ICE Storm and the Arizona Border  Control Initiative\u2014indicated that criminal enterprises tend to smuggle not  only people but also drugs, weapons, counterfeit trade goods, and other  illegal contraband. The ICE officials emphasized that it was important to  incorporate these lessons learned into the southwest border strategy  before issuing it. Also, the officials noted that irrespective of whether  smuggling involves aliens or contraband, ICE can use similar investigative  techniques for following the money trail.", "In April 2005, ICE officials told us that the draft southwest border strategy  was in the final stages of review; had been vetted with CBP, which is ICE\u2019s  closest partner in the antismuggling arena; and was expected to be  implemented within the next 30 to 60 days. Moreover, the officials said  that, following a certain period of implementation, the southwest border  strategy would be evaluated and expanded into a nationwide strategy. The  officials noted, for instance, that although there is no one law enforcement  strategy totally effective in all areas of the nation, the methodologies  applied in Arizona with both Operation ICE Storm and the Arizona Border  Control Initiative would be evaluated and tailored for use in other parts of  the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continuing Development Period for ICE\u2019s Strategy Attributable Partly to Organizational and Training Needs", "paragraphs": ["\u201cThe integration of INS and Customs investigators into a single investigative program has  involved blending two vastly different workforces, each with its own culture, policies,  procedures, and mission priorities.

Also, the  officials explained that certain investigative techniques, such as controlled  delivery operations used to develop drug-trafficking cases, are either very  difficult or unavailable in alien-smuggling cases because humans are  involved. Further, the officials said that unlike drug-trafficking cases  where the contraband itself is proof of the illegal activity, the successful  prosecution of alien-smuggling cases relies on the availability of material  witnesses (illegal migrants) who often get terrified before or during trial  and change their mind about testifying against smugglers.

According to ICE  headquarters, significant investigations would include, for example, alien- smuggling networks identified by the targeting subgroup of the National  Security Council\u2019s Migrant Smuggling and Trafficking Interagency Working  Group.", "During our visits in September 2004 to ICE field offices responsible for  southwest border areas, we asked to review the files of any closed alien- smuggling cases that reflected the use of financial investigative techniques.  In response to our inquiries, the field office managers informed us that  their respective offices had not yet completely closed relevant cases. For  instance, ICE officials in the southern district of Texas said that they were  still tracing illegal proceeds in the Salman case involving the smuggling of  Chinese nationals, which is summarized in appendix V based on press  release information. ICE headquarters officials explained that criminal  investigations in which persons are targeted for prosecution and assets are  identified for seizure can remain open for 1, 2, or more years before being  completely closed. The officials noted that it is not uncommon for targeted  individuals to be arrested, convicted, and sentenced while seized assets  are still pending final disposition through civil or criminal forfeiture  proceedings.", "Also, during our field visits in September 2004, we asked U.S. Attorney\u2019s  Office officials for their observations regarding whether there has been an  increasing emphasis on the financial aspects of alien-smuggling  investigations since the creation of DHS and ICE. In Arizona, federal  prosecutors emphasized that Operation ICE Storm is a clear indication of  ICE\u2019s efforts to become more proactive in alien-smuggling investigations.  Also, federal prosecutors in Texas (Houston) said the money trail is being  pursued when appropriate, such as proactive cases involving smuggling  organizations that are based in the Far East (e.g., Thailand and certain  provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of China) and have networks in Latin  America and Mexico. The federal officials noted that investigations of  these cases may include FBI participation and the use of undercover  agents and electronic surveillance and may result in assets being seized  and suspects being charged with money laundering and violations of the  Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.", "In December 2004, ICE headquarters officials told us that ongoing alien- smuggling cases in other areas of the nation\u2014Florida, Georgia, New York,  and Washington\u2014were also using financial investigative techniques and  are expected to result in substantial seizures. Because these cases were  ongoing, the officials declined to provide specific details, other than  information already made available to the public. For example, according  to ICE or U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office news releases:    Southern District of Florida: Sixteen people were arrested in  December 2004, following an investigation conducted by ICE in Miami,  New York, and Ecuador. Using immigration documents provided by  undercover agents, the defendants participated in smuggling  Ecuadorian and Chinese nationals into the United States by  commercial airline. The criminal organizations behind the scheme  charged as much as $20,000 per alien.", "Northern District of Georgia: In November 2004, federal indictments  were unsealed regarding 19 defendants allegedly connected with an  illegal-alien-smuggling conspiracy. According to the indictments, the  defendants employed hundreds of undocumented aliens in various gas  station/convenience stores in the Atlanta metropolitan area as a means  of attaining higher profits through nonpayment of overtime  compensation, nonpayment of employer-share taxes, and nonpayment  of mandatory employee benefits. Forfeitures amounting to \u201cmillions of  dollars\u201d are being sought.\u201d", "Northern District of New York: From January 1999 through November  17, 2004, the defendants, all operators of various Chinese buffet  restaurants in Albany, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia, and Dutchess  Counties, used illegal aliens of Chinese and Mexican nationality as  workers in their restaurants and laundered proceeds from the  operation of those restaurants. Forfeitures are being sought relating to  more than 40 bank accounts, as well as vehicles (allegedly used during  the commission of the offenses) and parcels of real property (allegedly  purchased with the illegal proceeds).", "Western District of Washington: In November 2004, the defendant\u2014 who had admitted to organizing a scheme whereby Cambodian  children were taken from their families and represented on  immigration forms as orphans for adoption by American families\u2014was  sentenced to 18 months in prison, 3 years of supervised release, 300  hours of community service, and more than $60,000 in restitution. Also,  the defendant was ordered to forfeit the proceeds of the crime to the  government\u2014a home in Hawaii worth $1.4 million and a Jaguar car  (approximately $25,000).", "More recently, in April 2005, ICE officials emphasized to us that ICE has  many ongoing investigations in which criminal organizations are targeted  for alien smuggling violations and their assets are being targeted for  seizure.

Further, at the time of our visit to Phoenix in September 2004, ICE officials  told us that the most significant alien-smuggling cases under Operation  ICE Storm were still being developed. The officials anticipated that several  major smuggling organizations would be the subjects of arrests and  indictments in the coming months. In October 2004, for example, ICE and  the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office announced that a multi-agency  investigation had resulted in state grand jury indictments of 21 individuals  involved in providing criminal groups with used cars for smuggling illegal  immigrants, drugs, or cash. According to ICE, 11 used car lots located in  the Phoenix metropolitan area were shut down, and 349 cars worth almost  $1.4 million were seized by ICE and the Arizona Attorney General\u2019s Office.", "To obtain additional perspectives on the results of alien-smuggling  investigations in terms of recovered funds or seized assets, we contacted  Treasury\u2019s Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, which provides  management oversight of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund\u2014the receipt  account for the deposit of nontax forfeitures made pursuant to laws  enforced or administered by the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal  Investigation and DHS components (including ICE, CBP, the U.S. Secret  Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard). Regarding fund deposits since October  2003 that resulted from alien smuggling cases, Executive Office for Asset  Forfeiture officials commented (in July 2004) substantially as follows:    Fund deposits are not tracked by type of case. All member agencies are  mandated to deposit forfeited funds regardless of the type of  investigation.", "Anecdotally, however, as of July 2004, the Executive Office for Asset  Forfeiture has had no real experience with alien-smuggling  investigations that resulted in substantial enforcement actions  (seizures with a value of more than $100,000). But substantial  investigations of any kind (except bulk cash smuggling) go through the  judicial process, which in many cases takes 1 to 3 years from the date  of seizure to perfect the forfeiture. \u201cFY 2004 was a robust and unprecedented revenue year for the law enforcement bureaus  participating in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, with over $335 million from all sources. \u2026 It  is our view that the greatest damage to criminal enterprise can be effected through large  forfeitures, hence we have set a target level of 75 percent of our currency forfeitures to be  high impact forfeitures. Fund Management works through budgetary and policy means to  emphasize high-impact cases, i.e., those cash forfeiture cases equal to or greater than  $100,000 in value. For FY 2004 we exceeded our target significantly with 84 percent of our  cash forfeiture revenue stemming from high-impact cases. This is a credit to our law  enforcement bureaus and their dedication to the fight against crime.\u201d", "To illustrate the types of investigative cases worked by the fund\u2019s law  enforcement agencies, the report gave summary highlights of 33 cases\u2014 IRS (17 cases), CBP (8 cases), ICE (5 cases), U.S. Secret Service (2 cases),  and U.S. Coast Guard (1 case). None of the 33 case summaries referenced  alien smuggling. The 5 ICE cases involved, respectively, a bank scam, an  adult video store and other businesses seized for racketeering, counterfeit  cigarette traffickers, a counterfeit motion picture network, and a church  fraud scheme. Of the 17 IRS cases, 5 were narcotics-related investigations,  and another 3 involved bulk-cash seizures in south Texas of approximately  $370,000; $993,000; and $5.3 million, respectively. Also, of the 8 CBP  cases, 4 involved bulk-cash seizures\u2014Nogales, Arizona (about $464,000);  Eagle Pass, Texas (about $518,000); and 2 separate seizures at Rouses  Point, New York (about $991,000 and $995,000)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alien-Smuggling Cases: Asset Seizures Expected to Increase, although There Are Caveats", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture officials told us they  anticipate that ICE\u2019s alien-smuggling investigations will begin having an  impact on the fund in fiscal year 2005 or later.

For instance, according to  the Treasury officials, it is not uncommon for export or trade cases to  render plea agreements for cash forfeitures of tens of millions of dollars.", "ICE headquarters officials also told us they anticipate that alien-smuggling  investigations will begin having an impact on the Treasury Forfeiture Fund  in fiscal year 2005 and future years. For the first 6 months of fiscal year  2005, ICE reported seizures totaling $7.8 million from alien-smuggling  investigations, as table 3 shows.", "Generally, regarding asset seizures and forfeitures from alien-smuggling  investigations, ICE officials noted that there can be competing demands  for investigative resources. The mission of ICE\u2019s Office of Investigations\u2014 which has more than 5,000 agents in 26 field offices nationwide\u2014 encompasses a broad array of national security, financial, and smuggling  violations, including narcotics smuggling, financial crimes, illegal arms  exports, commercial fraud, child pornography/exploitation, immigration  fraud, and human trafficking. Regarding immigration enforcement, the  Office of Investigations is responsible not only for deterring, dismantling,  and diminishing the smuggling and trafficking of aliens but also for  minimizing immigrant benefit fraud, removing employers\u2019 access to  undocumented workers, and responding to community complaints about  illegal immigration. Nationally, about 7 percent of ICE\u2019s total investigative  hours were devoted to alien-smuggling cases in fiscal year 2004. As noted  in table 4, these investigative hours included cases involving alien- smuggling organizations (5 percent), as well as individuals and groups (2  percent).", "In its technical comments on a draft of this report, DHS noted that other  investigative programs conducted by ICE involve criminal organizations  that profit, wholly or in part, from alien smuggling. Specifically, DHS said  that the percentage of ICE\u2019s total investigative hours devoted to alien- smuggling cases in fiscal year 2004 could be up to 29 percent when, in  addition to the 7 percent statistic, other relevant investigative programs  are considered (see table 4)\u2014criminal alien (12 percent), identity and  benefit fraud (5 percent), Joint Terrorism Task Force (3 percent), and  human trafficking (2 percent). In providing an overall perspective  regarding ICE investigative resources devoted to alien-smuggling cases,  we agree that the 7 percent statistic is properly supplemented by other  investigative programs. However, reporting a 29 percent statistic may be  overreaching, given that these other programs may only partly involve  alien smuggling.", "In further reference to the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, ICE headquarters  officials cautioned that alien-smuggling cases, in comparison with drug  cases, are much less likely to result in seizures of money. The officials  explained that almost all drug deals are conducted in cash; therefore, it is  not unusual for law enforcement to arrest criminals handling hundreds of  thousands or even millions of dollars in drug money. In contrast, the  officials noted that alien-smuggling fees per person generally involve  smaller amounts that are paid by wire transfers, which present law  enforcement the challenge of identifying consolidation points. ICE  officials said that wire transfers reflect a developing trend by alien  smugglers to exploit money services\u2014a trend that ICE is addressing. For  instance, the officials noted that the use of wire transfers by criminal  organizations has been aggressively investigated during Operation ICE  Storm and the Arizona Border Control Initiative.", "From another perspective, Canadian immigration and law enforcement  officials, including Royal Canadian Mounted Police representatives, told  us that alien-smuggling cases that result in seizures of money can be  considered a bonus\u2014that is, such results are more the exception than the  norm. However, even absent seizures of money or other assets from alien  smugglers, ICE headquarters and field office officials stressed to us the  importance and utility of applying financial investigative expertise in  appropriate cases. The officials noted that such investigative expertise is  very useful for determining the scope and operational patterns of alien- smuggling organizations, identifying the principals, and obtaining evidence  to build prosecutable cases. As a case in point, the officials cited the  Victoria 19 case (see app. II), which they described as being very  successful in dismantling a smuggling organization, even though the case  did not produce substantial asset seizures or forfeitures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "According to Justice and ICE, Civil Forfeiture Authority Is Not Adequate to Seize Stash Houses Used by Alien Smugglers", "paragraphs": ["Regarding potential forfeitures in alien-smuggling cases, Justice and ICE  headquarters officials said a concern for investigators is the lack of  adequate statutory civil forfeiture authority for seizing real property\u2014 particularly stash houses used by smugglers.

For instance, as a  result of the government\u2019s seizure of vehicles, vessels, and aircraft used to  traffic drugs or smuggle aliens, criminals are prevented from using the  property to commit new crimes. Under current federal law, the  government has both criminal and civil forfeiture authority, but its  availability depends on several factors, including whether there has been a  conviction for the underlying offense and the nature of that offense."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Criminal Forfeiture Authority: Not Available for Fugitive Defendants or Property Owners Not Indicted", "paragraphs": ["\u201cshall order that the person forfeit to the United States, regardless of any provision of State  law\u2014(i) any conveyance, including any vessel, vehicle, or aircraft used in the commission  of the offense of which the person is convicted; and (ii) and property real or personal\u2014(I)  that constitutes, or is derived from or is traceable to the proceeds obtained directly or  indirectly from the commission of the offense of which the person is convicted; or (II) that  is used to facilitate, or is intended to be used to facilitate, the commission of the offense of  which the person is convicted.\u201d", "Before the resolution of a criminal forfeiture action, there must be a  conviction of the defendant based on a high evidentiary standard\u2014the  beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard.

In many alien-smuggling cases,  according to Justice and ICE, the real properties at issue are not owned by  the smugglers; rather, the properties are rental units, often in distressed  areas. Justice and ICE noted that evidence that the owner of a rented stash  house knew about the illegal activity and intentionally ignored it is not  sufficient to indict the owner for smuggling, and there is rarely evidence of  greater involvement in the offense by the owner; as a result, the criminal  forfeiture option is not available in such cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civil Forfeiture Authority: Innocent Owners Have Statutory Protections", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to criminal forfeiture procedure, civil forfeiture, in which the  government seizes real property and initiates a civil action to forfeit the  property, does not require that the owner of the property be charged with  a federal offense. Rather, the action is against the property, and the  government would have to demonstrate that the property is subject to  forfeiture under the applicable civil forfeiture statute for the underlying  offense. If the government is able to do so, the burden would shift to the  property owner to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he or  she was an innocent owner. The innocent-owner defense is not available  to someone who intentionally turned a blind eye to the illegal use of his or  her property, although such an individual most likely could not be  convicted of the offense involved.", "The innocent-owner defense and other substantive and procedural  protections were enacted as part of the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act  of 2000 (CAFRA), which was intended to prevent abuses of civil asset  forfeiture law. Before CAFRA\u2019s enactment, news articles and  congressional hearings recounted stories of innocent owners of motels or  air transport services who had lost their businesses trying to meet the legal  requirements for recovering their seized property. CAFRA eliminated or  modified some of these requirements. For example, the burden of proof  shifted to the government to show that the property was subject to  forfeiture, rather than the claimant having to prove that it was not. Also,  individuals seeking to recover their property no longer have to post a bond  in order to make a claim.", "After CAFRA, in order to forfeit facilitating property that was purchased  with legitimately earned funds, the government must demonstrate a  substantial connection between the use of the property and the offense.  Before CAFRA, some courts had allowed such forfeitures based on a  weaker connection to the crime. CAFRA was written to create uniform  procedures for civil asset forfeiture, regardless of the nature of the  underlying offense. Moreover, CAFRA increased uniformity among the  substantive forfeiture statutes by creating a single definition of proceeds  of the offense, expanding statutes to allow forfeiture of proceeds if not  already allowed, and creating a single innocent-owner defense with clearer  criteria for invoking it. Although its focus was civil forfeiture, CAFRA also  amended the criminal asset forfeiture provision for alien-smuggling cases,  which had been inadvertently written in a manner that rendered it  inoperable when it was enacted as part of a larger package of legislation  addressing immigration law in 1996.

In its response, Justice noted that statistics are not collected  on civil forfeiture cases that could not be brought, such as cases involving  real property held by fugitives or third parties that was used to facilitate  alien smuggling. However, Justice\u2019s analysis of civil and criminal forfeiture  statutes generally has led the department to conclude that a statute that  provides only for criminal and not civil forfeiture of facilitating property  will be inadequate in such cases. In addition, Justice officials told us that  investigative experience with alien smuggling has convinced them that  such cases are numerous. Further, in March 2005, Justice provided us  summary examples of recent or pending alien-smuggling cases in which  real property used to facilitate the offense could not be forfeited because  of the absence of statutory civil forfeiture authority (see app. VI).

These concerns include the  potential for abuse of this type of forfeiture and the adequacy of  protection for the rights of innocent property owners. CAFRA was  compromise legislation that was developed over several years by  Congress, the Executive Branch, and interest groups. Some observers felt  that the legislation did not provide enough reforms and protections, while  others felt that it went too far and would curtail a legitimate law  enforcement tool. The procedural protections in CAFRA included specific  requirements for real property forfeitures, such as notice and an  opportunity to be heard prior to seizure and judicial, as opposed to  administrative, forfeiture for all real property. CAFRA\u2019s requirement that  the government prove a substantial connection between facilitating  property and the underlying offense also would apply to any expansion of  civil forfeiture authority in the alien-smuggling statute, absent a specific  exemption.

ICE officials  noted, however, that none of ICE\u2019s reported seizures from alien-smuggling  cases in fiscal year 2004 ($7.3 million) and the first 6 months of fiscal year  2005 ($7.8 million) were made abroad.", "We made a similar inquiry for information from the State Department\u2019s  Bureau of Diplomatic Security. In response, the bureau noted that it has  been a full member of the Department of Justice\u2019s Asset Forfeiture  Program since October 1, 2004, and\u2014after admission to the program\u2014has  taken steps to prepare and encourage agents to consider forfeiture  whenever possible, including seeking the seizure and forfeiture of assets  abroad. Additional comments were substantially as follows:    Because participation in Justice\u2019s Asset Forfeiture Program is relatively  new, the bureau has submitted only one MLAT request seeking the  seizure and forfeiture of illegal assets overseas, and this request was  still pending as of March 2005. However, the bureau currently is  conducting numerous criminal investigations that most likely will  result in the submission of several more MLAT requests to various  foreign countries to seek the seizure and forfeiture of illegal funds and  assets.", "The MLAT process sometimes may be very time consuming and on  occasion has discouraged Assistant U.S. Attorneys from pursuing  forfeiture of illegal assets via an MLAT request. In the absence of an  MLAT, the letter rogatory process may be even more burdensome and  time consuming and the results less certain.", "The bureau noted that in addition to utilizing the MLAT process, there are  other procedures for gathering evidence or seizing the proceeds of a  crime. For example, as part of a plea agreement, a defendant may consent  to repatriate overseas assets to the United States without the involvement  of the host country. Finally, the bureau emphasized that the ability to  equitably share with foreign law enforcement agencies a percentage of the  proceeds seized based on their assistance and participation in  investigations is a very useful tool in securing the seizure and forfeiture of  illegal assets overseas."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Examples of Alien-Smuggling Cases Prosecuted in Federal District Courts", "paragraphs": ["This appendix summarizes selected alien-smuggling cases prosecuted in  federal district courts in three districts\u2014the District of Arizona, the  Southern District of California, and the Southern District of Texas.
