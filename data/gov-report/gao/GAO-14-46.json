This report explores (1) how SSA obtains death reports and steps it takes to ensure death reports are accurate; and (2) factors affecting federal agency access to SSA's death data. In addressing these objectives, GAO interviewed SSA officials and representatives of entities reporting or using the death data. GAO reviewed applicable federal laws, SSA procedures, and reports. GAO also performed independent testing of SSA's death data for certain errors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Administration (SSA) receives death reports from multiple sources, including state vital records agencies (states), family members, and other federal agencies to create its set of death records. In accordance with the Social Security Act (Act), SSA shares its full set of death data with certain agencies that pay federally-funded benefits, for the purpose of ensuring the accuracy of those payments. For other users of SSA's death data, SSA extracts a subset of records into a file called the Death Master File (DMF), which, to comply with the Act, excludes state-reported death data. SSA makes the DMF available via the Department of Commerce's National Technical Information Service, from which any member of the public can purchase DMF data. Certain procedures that SSA uses for collecting, verifying, and maintaining death reports could result in erroneous or untimely death information. For example, SSA does not independently verify all reports before including them in its death records. In accordance with its policy, the agency only verifies death reports for Social Security beneficiaries in order to stop benefit payments, and then, verifies only those reports from sources it considers less accurate, such as other federal agencies. GAO identified instances where this approach led to inaccurate data. For example, GAO's analysis of a sample of death records SSA erroneously included in its death data found that these errors may not have occurred if SSA had verified them. In other cases, when data provided do not match SSA's records, SSA typically does not record these deaths. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should conduct risk assessments of factors impeding their ability to achieve program objectives, such as data errors that could result in improper benefit payments. Agency officials told us SSA has not performed such risk assessments, but has initiated work on a full redesign of its death processing system.", "SSA lacks written guidelines other than the language in the Act for determining whether agencies are eligible under the Act to access the full death file, and it does not share with agencies how it determines the reasonable cost of sharing the data, which recipients of the full file are required to reimburse SSA. Because SSA has not developed or shared guidance on how it determines agency eligibility, this could create confusion among potential recipients regarding eligibility. Ensuring appropriate access is important because the DMF contains about 10 percent fewer records than the full death file, and officials expect that difference to increase over time. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency of cost information about the amounts recipients expect to pay. As a result of not knowing the factors that lead to the reimbursement amounts, agencies may not have sufficient information to make informed decisions. We found that SSA provided differing estimates for agencies' reimbursement amounts. Some variation is due to legal requirements and a quid pro quo arrangement. For example, one agency does not reimburse SSA for the cost of providing the death data because it provides SSA with its own data, and the agencies have agreed that the expenses involved in the exchanges are reciprocal. However, for some agencies this variation could not fully be explained by the frequency with which they expected to receive the data. For example, two agencies expected to pay similar reimbursement amounts in 2013 despite expecting to receive the file at different frequencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA assess risks associated with inaccuracies; develop and publicize guidance it will use to determine agency access under the Act; and share detailed reimbursement estimates.

Federal  benefit-paying agencies generally can access this information and match  it against data in their files to alert them to deceased benefit recipients,  and therefore help identify and prevent improper payments. As the  steward of taxpayer dollars, the federal government must guard against  improper payments. Yet for fiscal year 2012, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) reported federal agency improper payment estimates  totaling almost $108 billion. For example, the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) improperly paid over $500,000 in retirement benefits  to a deceased beneficiary\u2019s son over the course of 37 years, believing the  beneficiary was still alive and receiving the payments himself. Despite  the potential usefulness of SSA\u2019s death information, the SSA Office of  Inspector General (OIG) and others have identified inaccuracies in the  data. For example, in 2012 SSA\u2019s OIG reported that 1.2 million deceased  Social Security beneficiaries were not included in SSA\u2019s death data.  Such inaccuracies could adversely affect the usefulness of SSA\u2019s death  information in helping agencies combat improper payments.", "You asked us to review issues related to SSA\u2019s death information,  including its accuracy and usefulness to federal agencies.

To address these objectives, we reviewed applicable federal laws and  SSA procedures, as well as relevant reports and evaluations. We  interviewed SSA officials about how SSA obtains and processes death  reports and maintains its death information.

A subset of the full death file, which SSA calls  \u201cthe Death Master File (DMF),\u201d is available to the public. The Social  Security Act requires that SSA share its full death file, to the extent  feasible, with agencies that provide federally funded benefits (for the  purposes of this report, we refer to these as \u201cbenefit-paying agencies\u201d),  provided the arrangement meets statutory requirements. However, SSA  may not include death data received from states in the DMF, which can  be accessed publicly. Agencies may use the data to determine if  individuals receiving benefits under their respective programs are  deceased, and thus no longer entitled to those benefits. GAO has noted  the value of using this information for guarding against improper  payments. For example, in a June 2013 report, we recommended that the  U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) match its payment records  against SSA\u2019s full death file to prevent improper payments to deceased  farmers.", "Given the focus on guarding against improper payments, there has been  new emphasis on how agencies access critical data, such as death  records, while maintaining the security of sensitive information such as  SSNs. The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement  Act of 2012 established the Do Not Pay Initiative and requires federal  agencies to review a number of databases, as appropriate, including the  DMF, to verify eligibility prior to making payments with federal funds. A  component within the U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury)  administers the Do Not Pay Business Center, which operates the  centralized portal through which agencies can verify individuals\u2019 eligibility  to receive payments. Recent legislative proposals have also sought to  encourage federal agencies to use SSA\u2019s death information. For  example, a Senate bill introduced in July 2013 would provide for federal  agency access to the full death file for specified purposes, such as  ensuring authorized payments and facilitating other agency functions,  including public health or safety, law enforcement, tax administration,  health administration oversight, and debt collection, as determined  appropriate by the SSA Commissioner. At the same time, other  proposals have sought to limit public access to SSA\u2019s death data. For  example, proposed legislation introduced in the House in July 2013 seeks  to deter identity theft and tax fraud by limiting public access to the DMF,  according to the bill\u2019s sponsor.

Thirty-four states, the District of Columbia, and New  York City submit their death reports through an Electronic Death  Registration System (EDRS), which automates the electronic registering  and processing of death reports in order to improve timeliness and  accuracy. SSA considers reports submitted by states through EDRS to be  the most accurate because these systems are used by most states to  verify the name and SSN of the decedent with SSA databases before the  report is submitted to SSA. To get death reports from the states, SSA has  established contracts that set forth a payment structure to compensate  states for the reasonable costs of providing these records, in accordance  with the Social Security Act. Payments are higher for reports submitted  via EDRS and pre-verified with SSA databases, and those that are  submitted relatively soon after decedents\u2019 deaths. For example, for  calendar year 2013, SSA paid $2.93 for each EDRS report that was pre- verified and submitted to SSA within 6 days of the date of death,  compared to $0.82 for non-EDRS reports submitted within 120 days of  the date of death. Because of the time saved through automated  transmission of data and the use of pre-verification to ensure accuracy,  SSA has encouraged the expanded use of EDRS. The contracts with the  states provide that SSA will not share this information, except as  authorized by federal law and section 205(r) of the Act.", "Some states and other sources provide death information voluntarily to  SSA through methods other than EDRS. For example, funeral directors  routinely submit a form that includes the decedent\u2019s full name and SSN,  as provided by the decedent\u2019s family. In addition, family members often  contact SSA field offices directly to report a death. SSA considers reports  from families and funeral directors generally to be accurate because  those sources have first-hand knowledge of the death and the decedent\u2019s  identity.

It then matches the information to SSA\u2019s database of all  SSN-holders, known as the Numerical Index File (Numident).  Information in death reports from certain sources (see fig. 2) is also  verified by field office staff.

Analysis we performed on records in the full death file that  were erroneously included showed that most of these errors would not  have occurred if SSA had verified the death reports when it received  them. We identified nearly 8,200 deaths SSA deleted from its death data  between February 2012 and January 2013. These data reflect cases  where a death report matched a record in the Numident and SSA marked,  then later removed, a death indicator for that record.

In one example of an eligibility determination, officials told us  they provide the full death file to IRS for purposes that include allowing  IRS to confirm or deny taxpayers\u2019 requests for exemptions and standard  deductions. In addition, officials told us SSA would generally have the  authority to share the full death file with the OIG at benefit-paying  agencies for the purpose of ensuring proper payment of federally-funded  benefits.

According to federal internal control standards, agencies should have  written documentation, such as this type of guidance, and it should be  readily available for examination. The absence of written guidance may  also pose a risk to the consistency of SSA\u2019s future determinations in the  event of staff turnover, changes in administration, or any other disruption  that could lead to a loss of institutional knowledge. In a September 2008  report, we found that there was a risk to the management and operational  continuity of ongoing projects at SSA due to a lack of written policies and  procedures. We found that during organizational change, project  objectives, designs, and evaluation may be affected absent  comprehensive written policies and procedures. Also, until recently, SSA  did not have an officially designated organizational component for  monitoring use of death data or making decisions on access to its full  death data, which could have introduced additional uncertainty to those  decisions. However, officials told us the agency created the Office of Data  Exchange in January 2013 to clarify, simplify, and strengthen existing  data exchange programs. As part of this effort, it is looking at how SSA  makes decisions regarding access to its death data, as well as how it  shares the data with other agencies, and is monitoring the data exchange  agreements.", "Any agency that does not access SSA\u2019s full death file can instead access  the publicly-available DMF. Agencies can purchase a DMF subscription  through the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Technical Information  Service (NTIS), which reimburses SSA for the cost of providing the file.In accordance with the Act, SSA excludes state-reported death records  from the DMF. Federal entities that purchase the DMF from NTIS include,  among others:", "Department of Justice", "Department of Homeland Security", "Drug Enforcement Administration", "National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health", "Veterans Affairs medical facilities  The death information included in the DMF is less complete and likely  less accurate than that contained in SSA\u2019s full death file, which may result  in federal agencies that use the DMF receiving less useful information  than agencies that use the full death file. According to SSA officials,  agencies that purchase the DMF have access to 10 percent fewer  records overall than agencies with access to the full death file due to the  removal of state-reported deaths. Moreover, SSA officials said they  expect the percentage of state-reported deaths as a proportion of all of  SSA\u2019s death records to increase over time, which could lead to a greater  portion of death data being removed each year to create the DMF. For  example, for deaths reported in 2012 alone, the DMF included about 40  percent fewer death records than what was included in SSA\u2019s full death  file. As a result, agencies that purchase the DMF will continue to access  fewer records over time than those that obtain SSA\u2019s full death file. In  addition, because the deaths reported through EDRS by states are  generally more accurate, it is likely that federal agencies using the DMF  would encounter more errors than agencies using SSA\u2019s full death file. In  fact, the SSA OIG found that approximately 98 percent of deaths that  SSA erroneously included in its death file were reported by non-state  sources.", "It is not SSA\u2019s practice to proactively notify agencies that may be eligible  for access to the complete set of death information. Officials explained  that distributing death information to other federal agencies is not a part of  SSA\u2019s mission, nor is it an activity for which SSA receives an  appropriation. As a result, some agencies may not know to request the  full death file directly from SSA and may be relying on the less complete,  less accurate DMF to assist them in administering their programs. In at  least one case, an agency administering federal benefit-paying programs  was using the less comprehensive DMF to match against its payment  systems until it received access to the full file in January 2013. In a June  2013 report, we found that two agencies within the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA) were not matching beneficiary lists against SSA\u2019s full  death file. We spoke with program officials at another benefit-paying  agency that uses the DMF\u2014the Department of Labor\u2019s Division of Energy  Employees Occupational Illness Compensation, within the Office of  Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs\u2014who told us they did not know until  very recently that obtaining the full set of death data was an option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reimbursement Amounts Vary and SSA Does Not Share How They are Calculated", "paragraphs": ["Under the Act, one condition of receiving SSA\u2019s full death data is that the  recipient agency reimburses SSA for the reasonable cost of sharing death  data. However, factors including legal requirements and a quid pro quo  arrangement have resulted in varying projected reimbursement amounts  for different agencies (see table 1).", "Some agencies do not reimburse SSA at all. For example, VA is not  required to provide reimbursement by statute, while OPM provides federal  retirement data to SSA that is critical to its mission, and the agencies  have agreed that the expenses involved in the exchanges are  reciprocal. However, SSA officials were unable to point to any  reciprocity study supporting this decision.", "For other agencies, some of these differences in projected  reimbursement amounts cannot fully be explained by the frequency with  which the agencies expect to receive the data. For example, as noted in  Table 1, CMS expected to receive updates to the full death file weekly  from SSA and CMS officials told us the agency expected to reimburse  SSA $9,900 in fiscal year 2013. RRB similarly expected to pay $9,000,  despite expecting to receive the file less frequently\u2014monthly, rather than  weekly. At the same time, IRS expected to receive weekly updates to the  full file plus the full file annually in fiscal year 2013, and PBGC expected  to receive the file with the same frequency for fiscal year 2014. However,  IRS expected to pay more than $87,000, while PBGC\u2019s expected  reimbursement amount was $70,000.", "While the reimbursement amounts for agencies are sometimes included  in the inter-agency agreements governing how SSA provides its full death  file, the agreements lack information on how these amounts were  determined. According to SSA officials, these agreements specify the  permissible purpose for using the death data and limitations on sharing  the data within the agency. However, according to officials we spoke with  at several agencies that receive the full death file, SSA staff did not  provide an explanation for reimbursement amounts. SSA officials told us  they calculate a detailed breakdown of expenses in an internal document,  but provide only a summary of these expenses in the estimates and  billing statements they send to agencies. As a result, recipient agencies  do not know the factors that lead to the reimbursement amounts they are  charged, which could prevent them from making informed decisions  based on the amount they are spending. According to federal internal  control standards, financial information is something agencies should  communicate for external uses, because it is necessary to determine  whether agencies are meeting goals for accountability for effective and  efficient use of resources. In addition, SSA officials told us that because  the Act provides for SSA to be reimbursed for its costs, the agency will  not negotiate the reimbursement amounts if a prospective recipient  agency indicates unwillingness to pay the quoted amount. In one case,  SSA officials told us that while it approved a request for access to the file  from the OIG for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the  two entities never finalized an agreement because the OIG determined it  wanted to look for a lower-cost option for obtaining death information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal benefit programs\u2019 need for accurate administrative data, such as  death information, is increasingly evident in an environment of continuing  budget shortages, where improper payments due to inaccurate  information cost taxpayers billions of dollars in fiscal year 2012. Because  of its mission, SSA is uniquely positioned to collect and manage death  data at the federal level. SSA already has a responsibility to ensure that  this information is as accurate and complete as possible for its own  beneficiaries. Further, proposed legislation, if enacted, would require SSA  to disseminate full death data to a number of additional eligible federal  agencies. Only with more accurate and complete data can these  agencies reduce the risk of paying deceased beneficiaries. However,  because SSA has never analyzed the risk posed by errors or processes  that could result in errors, it is not fully aware of steps that would be  needed to address them. As a result, SSA and other federal agencies that  use the full death data and the DMF are potentially vulnerable to making  improper payments. Similarly, the absence of written guidelines for  determining which agencies can access the full death data may impede  federal agencies\u2019 ability to obtain that information in a timely and efficient  manner. Finally, SSA\u2019s approach to calculating and charging agencies for  death data lacks transparency about the fact that federal agencies pay  varying amounts for the same information. In such a setting, there is a  risk that federal agencies that could otherwise benefit from death  information will decline to participate, whether due to confusion over  SSA\u2019s access protocols or uncertainty concerning its financial  reimbursement policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to enhance the accuracy of and ensure appropriate agency  access to SSA\u2019s death data, we recommend that the Social Security  Administration\u2019s Acting Commissioner direct the Deputy Commissioner of  Operations to take the following three actions:  1. To be more informed about ways to improve the accuracy and  completeness of its death information, conduct a risk assessment of  SSA\u2019s death information processing systems and policies as a  component of redesigning SSA\u2019s death processing system. Such an  assessment should identify the scope and extent of errors, and help SSA  identify ways to address them. In addition, assess the feasibility and cost  effectiveness of addressing various types of errors, given the risk they  pose.  2. To clarify how SSA applies the eligibility requirements of the Social  Security Act and enhance agencies\u2019 awareness of how to obtain access,  develop and publicize guidance it will use to determine whether agencies  are eligible to receive SSA\u2019s full death file.  3.

SSA officials provided  written comments, which are reproduced in appendix II and described  below. IRS officials provided technical comments that further supported  the impact of late-reported deaths on federal users of SSA\u2019s death data,  and we incorporated an example they provided into that discussion. The  Department of Labor, the Office of Personnel Management, the Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and OMB also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate. CMS, the  Department of Defense, Treasury, and the National Technical Information  Service had no comments.", "In its comments, SSA partially agreed with our first and third  recommendations and disagreed with our second. In response to our first  recommendation, SSA agreed to perform a risk assessment as part of its  death information processing system redesign project, but raised  concerns about performing risk assessments for other users of the death  data. In making this recommendation, we did not intend for SSA to  perform risk assessments for other agencies\u2019 programs. However, we  believe that by assessing the risks of inaccuracies in its death data,  SSA\u2019s efforts could shed light on risks posed to other agencies\u2019 programs  in addition to its own. To clarify this, we deleted the specific reference to  other agencies. SSA also partially agreed with our third recommendation,  stating that it has implemented improvements in its estimating procedures  for future reimbursable agreements to ensure consistent estimates for all  customers. However, the agency stated that it is not a typical government  business practice to share these detailed costs for reimbursable  agreements. We are encouraged that SSA has made efforts to  standardize the estimates it shares with its federal partners, though we  have not had the chance to evaluate their effectiveness, since these  efforts were made recently. Also, we recognize that there may be  limitations on the type of cost details SSA can provide to recipient  agencies. However, we continue to believe that more transparency in  conveying the factors that lead to the estimated and final reimbursement  amounts recipient agencies are charged could help them make more  informed decisions. SSA disagreed with our second recommendation,  stating that each request to obtain the full death file is unique, and that  officials must review them on a case-by-case basis to ensure compliance  with various legal requirements. It also expressed concern that  developing this guidance as we recommended would require agency  expenditures unrelated to its mission in an already fiscally constrained  environment. We appreciate that agencies may base their request for the  full death file on different intended uses, and support SSA\u2019s efforts to  ensure compliance with all applicable legal requirements. However, we  continue to believe that developing this guidance could help to ensure  consistency in SSA\u2019s future decision making by the new Office of Data  Exchange, as well as enhance agencies\u2019 ability to obtain the data in a  timely and efficient manner. We do not expect such guidance, which  could include information such as the factors SSA considers in deciding  whether an agency provides federal benefits, would restrict SSA\u2019s  flexibility.", "SSA also outlined two general concerns with the body of the report. First,  it expressed concern that we inaccurately described SSA officials\u2019  reasons for determining that the agency could not provide Treasury with  full death data for the Do Not Pay Initiative. We made revisions to the  report to more accurately describe SSA\u2019s reasoning. Second, SSA was  concerned about the use of estimated reimbursement costs in Table 1  because these costs fluctuate throughout the year. SSA suggested  instead using figures it provided reflecting the actual costs from fiscal year  2012. The agency also noted that Table 1 contains incorrect information  related to the frequency at which the agencies receive the file. While we  agree that actual costs are inherently more accurate than estimated  costs, we chose to use estimated costs because this is the information  federal agencies receive when they are deciding whether and how to  obtain death data. In response to SSA\u2019s assertion that our table contains  incorrect information, we have added information to the table regarding  whether agencies expected to receive the annual file. We followed up  with an official, who clarified that our previous table was incomplete  because, for some of the agencies, it lacked information about receipt of  the annual full file. SSA also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We interviewed SSA officials regarding how SSA  obtains and processes death reports and maintains and shares its death  information. We also interviewed representatives of some entities that  provide death reports to SSA. We obtained and reviewed available  corroborating documentation such as the data sharing agreements SSA  made with other federal agencies.

Our reliability tests  included identifying cases in which the date of birth was listed as  occurring after the date of death. We also looked for cases involving  deaths at very old ages\u2014115 and higher\u2014and cases of death that  occurred before 1936 (when account numbers were first issued for  administering Social Security programs) after observing such cases in a  publicly-available version of the Death Master File (DMF). We then  systematically tested for incidences of these occurrences in the full death  information file.", "As part of our tests to identify deaths that occurred at age 115 or older  and those that occurred before 1936, we examined the monthly update  file of cases SSA added in March 2013, which represent new death  reports received by SSA. In conducting our analysis, we found a total of  539 deaths were added to the death data during this month that  reportedly occurred in years prior to 2012 (and another 9,462 that  occurred in 2012). At SSA\u2019s request, we provided a sample of these  cases to SSA staff to investigate. We selected and provided SSA lists of  those cases in which the deaths were reported to have occurred in 1976  and 2004\u2014a total of 22 cases. We chose these two years because each  of these years included a sufficiently large number of cases to allow us to  potentially identify patterns with respect to whether SSA had been paying  benefits to deceased beneficiaries. We also chose two years that were  nearly three decades apart to determine if there were any differences due  to time period variation. SSA was unable to research these cases  individually because of time constraints, but provided explanations of  possible reasons why the agency receives reports this many years after a  death.", "SSA also produces weekly and monthly update files listing deaths to be  deleted from and death reports to be added to its death information files.  To identify possible reasons for deleting deaths, we drew a random  sample of 97 cases from the monthly update files produced from   If all cases in this sample were  February 2012 through January 2013. reviewed, we would have been able to make generalized observations  about all of the deleted cases in this time period.

To identify possible  relationships with other characteristics, we also asked officials to provide,  if available, the source of the death report, and whether or not the listed  decedent was a Social Security beneficiary. We were satisfied we had a  sufficient number of cases after SSA had completed work on 46 of the 97  cases. While still randomly-selected, this smaller sample was non- generalizable. In recognition of the time and resources SSA was  committing to this work, we determined that the 46 cases would be  sufficient to describe characteristics of these cases, even though we  would not be able to make generalized statements about all deleted  cases in our population. Of these 46 cases, SSA officials were able to  determine reasons for deletion in 28 cases, source of the death report in  13, and determine the beneficiary/non-beneficiary status in all 46. They  were able to identify all three of these characteristics in 11 of the cases.", "For all of the tests and sampling just described, we used the full death  data file.

We  obtained the former through prior discussions with SSA officials and  congressional testimonies. For those federal entities that purchase the  public DMF, we requested a list of federal customers from officials at  NTIS. According to NTIS officials, they had to compile the list manually  because, prior to our request, they had no business reason to separate  federal customers from other customers. They described their manual  compilation process as looking through the NTIS list of approximately 800  DMF subscription customers one-by-one and determining, for each one,  whether it represented a federal customer by looking at the name and  email address. Officials then sent us a list of 27 federal customers.", "Our primary criterion for selecting six of the seven agencies to interview  was whether they administered programs that pay benefits.

We sought to understand this  agency\u2019s general experience using the DMF, as well as whether it had  ever tried to obtain the full file from SSA. Additionally, we selected the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) for interviews because it  transitioned from purchasing the DMF to obtaining SSA\u2019s full death file  during the course of our review, so officials had the unique perspective of  receiving both files. For the seventh agency, we interviewed officials from  the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Do Not Pay Business  Center, even though it does not pay benefits, because of its program goal  to prevent improper payments. Also, we had learned that Do Not Pay  officials had previously requested\u2014and were denied\u2014access to SSA\u2019s  full death file, and we wanted to better understand the circumstances of  that interaction.", "One limitation of the approach we used to identify all federal users of  SSA\u2019s death data is the subjectivity with which NTIS officials judged its  customers to be associated with federal agencies.
