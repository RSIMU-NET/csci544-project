However, GM faces continued challenges to its competitiveness. For instance, its market share of vehicles sold in North America remains smaller today than in 2008. Furthermore, GM continues to carry large pension liabilities.", "With Treasury's investments in Ally Financial, the company's condition has stabilized. For example, Ally Financial's capital and liquidity positions have stabilized or improved over the last 4 years. Such improvements have been noted by the three largest credit rating agencies, each of which has upgraded Ally Financial's credit rating. However, Ally Financial's credit rating remains below investment grade and its mortgage unit--Residential Capital LLC--impacted the company's financial performance. The mortgage unit filed for bankruptcy in May 2012, and these proceedings are ongoing. Analysts with whom GAO spoke indicated that the resolution of its mortgage unit's bankruptcy will be a positive development for Ally Financial's future financial performance.", "As of September 18, 2013, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has recovered about $35.21 billion of its $51 billion investment in GM and reduced its ownership stake from 60.8 percent to 7.32 percent. By early 2014, Treasury plans to fully divest its GM common shares through installments and estimates that it will lose at least 19 percent of its original investment. Treasury is working to exit from Ally Financial with a recent agreement to sell all of its preferred stock to the company for approximately $6 billion, but Treasury faces challenges. As a regulated bank holding company, Ally Financial must be well capitalized to receive its regulator's approval to repurchase shares from Treasury. Earlier this spring, Ally Financial's tier 1 common ratio fell below the required 5 percent in the Federal Reserve's \"stress test,\" and the Federal Reserve objected to the company's capital plan.

According to Treasury officials, Treasury provided  assistance not simply because of the industry\u2019s importance, but because  of the severity of the crisis and the desire to prevent significant disruption  to the economy that would have resulted from uncontrolled liquidations of  Chrysler and GM. To help stabilize the industry and avoid economic  disruptions, Treasury disbursed $79.7 billion through AIFP from  December 2008 through June 2009. The majority of the assistance was  used to support two automakers, Chrysler and GM, during restructuring,  along with their automotive finance companies, Chrysler Financial and  GMAC. In July 2009, Treasury outlined guiding principles for the  investments made to the auto industry, including: exiting its investments as soon as practicable in a timely and orderly  manner that minimizes financial market and economic impact; protecting taxpayer investment and maximizing overall investment  returns within competing constraints;  improving the strength and viability of GM and Chrysler so that they  can contribute to economic growth and jobs without government  involvement; and managing its ownership stake in a hands-off, commercial manner,  including voting its shares only on core governance issues, such as  the selection of a company\u2019s board of directors and major corporation  events or transactions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Assistance to GM", "paragraphs": ["GM is one of the world\u2019s largest automotive companies and does  business in more than 120 countries worldwide.

The plan  established targets for addressing some of the company\u2019s key challenges  to achieving viability, including reducing debt, numbers of brands and  models, dealership networks, and production costs and capacity. In 2009,  Old GM filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of  the U.S. bankruptcy code. Subsequently, in June 2009, Treasury  provided Old GM with $30.1 billion under a debtor-in-possession  financing agreement to assist during the restructuring.

In  determining how to finance their purchases, consumers have many  financial institutions from which to choose, including banks, credit unions,  and auto finance companies, all of which may offer loans or other credit  accommodations for the purchase of new and used automobiles.

Without orders for automobiles from dealerships,  GM would have been forced to slow or shut down its factories indefinitely  to match the drop in demand. Given its significant overhead, a slow-down  or stoppage of this magnitude would have caused GM to topple,  according to Treasury.", "However, GMAC was not initially eligible for assistance under the TARP  Capital Purchase Program (CPP). To become eligible for federal  financial assistance, GMAC sought to convert GMAC Bank\u2019s charter from  an industrial loan company into a commercial bank in 2008 and applied to  the Federal Reserve for bank holding company status. GMAC also  submitted an application to participate in the Capital Purchase Program,  conditional upon becoming a bank holding company. The Federal  Reserve approved GMAC\u2019s bank holding company application in  December 2008. Although GMAC originally applied for participation in  CPP, in late December 2008, as a part of AIFP, Treasury agreed to  purchase $5 billion in senior preferred equity from GMAC and received an  additional $250 million in preferred shares through warrants that Treasury  exercised immediately.", "Treasury subsequently provided GMAC with additional assistance  through TARP.", "In May 2009, Treasury purchased $7.5 billion of mandatory  convertible preferred shares from GMAC.

As we found in our prior work, a key result of  the restructuring was that GM lowered its fixed costs by reducing the  number of employees, plants, and dealerships, among other things.  Reduced fixed costs allow GM to be profitable with fewer sales,  thereby lowering its \u201cbreak-even\u201d level.", "Operating income (loss): Operating income (loss) describes a  company\u2019s profit and loss from its core operations. It is the difference  between the revenues of a business and the related costs and  expenses, excluding income from sources other than its core  business (e.g., income derived from investments). GM reported  operating income of $5.1 billion and $5.7 billion in 2010 and 2011,  respectively (see table 1). In 2012, GM took an approximate $27  billion goodwill impairment charge that significantly reduced its  operating income, contributing to a $30.4 billion operating loss.", "Operating cash flow: Operating cash flow refers to the amount of cash  generated by a company\u2019s core business operations. Operating cash  flow is important because it indicates whether a company is able to  generate sufficient positive cash flow to maintain and grow its  operations, or requires external financing. In its 2010, 2011, and 2012  annual reports, GM reported operating cash flow of $6.6 billion, $7.4  billion, and $9.6 billion, respectively. Further, in 2010 GM reported  total available liquidity from automotive operations of $32.5 billion,  including $5.9 billion from credit facilities. This amount had increased  slightly by 2012, when GM reported total available liquidity of $37.2  billion, including $11.1 billion from credit facilities. Finally, GM  reported current assets greater than current liabilities from 2010  through 2012, indicating that it could meet all current liabilities without  additional financing.", "These improvements in GM\u2019s financial performance have been reflected  in its credit ratings. A credit rating is an assessment of the credit  worthiness of an obligor as an entity or with respect to specific securities  or money market instruments. Credit ratings are important because  investors and financial institutions may consider them when making  investment and lending decisions. The three largest credit rating agencies  have each increased GM\u2019s long-term credit rating two steps in the past 3  years. Fitch Ratings and Standard and Poor\u2019s raised their long-term  rating on GM from BB- to BB+. Moody\u2019s raised its long-term corporate  family rating on GM from Ba2 to Baa3, an investment grade rating (i.e.,  the issuer or bond has a relatively low risk of default). Comparatively,  Standard and Poor\u2019s also rates Ford Motor Company as one step below  investment grade, with a positive outlook.

GM purchased the shares at $27.50 per share, about 7.8 percent over the  market price of about $25.50.  This generated about $5.5 billion in  revenue for Treasury and further reduced its ownership interest to just  over 22 percent. GM officials said that they determined the premium price  based on an arms-length negotiation between GM and Treasury.

Similar to the process Treasury used to divest its ownership in  Citigroup, Treasury began placing its GM shares on the market in  tranches, or \u201cdribbles,\u201d for a specific time period, beginning in January  2013. Treasury reports these sales after the end of each period for  selling a particular tranche. According to Treasury officials, in the case of  GM, the dribble approach is a better divestment method than discrete  large offerings given the remaining size of its equity holdings and time  frame in which it is planning to exit. Furthermore, the dribble approach  helps (1) secure the highest possible prevailing market price for  taxpayers, (2) limit the impact of additional supply in the market, and (3)  ensures that Treasury has flexibility to average the proceeds over time  and make adjustments if necessary. As of September 2013, Treasury has  sold over 811 million shares for more than $25 billion, leaving it with  101,336,666 shares which represent a 7.32 percent ownership stake in  GM. On September 26, 2013, Treasury announced it was launching a  third pre-defined written trading plan for its GM common stock.", "Although Treasury has implemented a plan to divest itself of its ownership  stake in GM, it does not anticipate fully recouping its investments. In  September 2013, Treasury projected approximately at least a 19 percent  loss on its GM investment. The extent of the loss, however, will depend  on GM\u2019s stock price.

At the same time as Ally Financial\u2019s announcement last year,  Treasury stated that the company\u2019s two strategic initiatives would put  taxpayers in a stronger position to continue recovering their investment in  Ally Financial.

However, Ally Financial\u2019s initial plan to  repurchase the mandatory convertible preferred shares stalled after the  Federal Reserve objected to its proposed capital plan in the spring 2013  Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). The Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal  Reserve to conduct an annual supervisory stress test of bank holding  companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to  evaluate whether the companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses  resulting from adverse economic conditions. As part of the stress test  for each company, the Federal Reserve projects revenue, expenses,  losses, and resulting post-stress test capital levels, regulatory capital  ratios, and the tier 1 common ratio under three scenarios (baseline,  adverse, and severely adverse). In March 2013, the Federal Reserve  reported the results of its most recent supervisory stress test and of the  CCAR exercise. The Federal Reserve found that Ally Financial\u2019s tier 1  common capital ratio fell below the required 5 percent under the severely  adverse scenario. Ally Financial was the only one of the 18 bank holding  companies tested that fell below this required level.", "Further, as previously indicated, the Federal Reserve objected to Ally  Financial\u2019s capital plans during the 2013 CCAR. CCAR is an annual  exercise the Federal Reserve conducts to help ensure that financial  institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that  take into account their unique risks and sufficient capital to continue  operating during periods of economic and financial stress. As part of the  CCAR process, the Federal Reserve evaluates institutions\u2019 capital  adequacy; internal processes for assessing capital adequacy; plans to  make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock  repurchases; and other actions that affect capital. The Federal Reserve  may object to a capital plan because of significant deficiencies in the  capital planning process or because one or more relevant capital ratios  would fall below required levels under the assumption of stress and  planned capital distributions.  If the Federal Reserve objects to the  proposed capital plan, the bank holding company is only permitted to  make capital distributions if the Federal Reserve indicates in writing that it  does not object and must resubmit the capital plan to the Federal  Reserve following remediation of these deficiencies. Of the 18 bank  holding companies reviewed in 2013, the Federal Reserve objected to  Ally Financial\u2019s and one other company\u2019s capital plans.", "According to the Federal Reserve, Ally Financial\u2019s capital ratios did not  meet the required minimums under the proposed capital plan.  Specifically, the Federal Reserve reported that under stress conditions  Ally Financial\u2019s plan resulted in a tier 1 ratio of common capital of 1.52  percent, which is below the required level of 5 percent under the capital  plan rule. According to the Federal Reserve report, these results  assumed that Ally Financial remained subject to contingent liabilities  associated with ResCap. The Federal Reserve required Ally Financial to  resubmit a capital plan. Ally Financial resubmitted its new capital plan to  the Federal Reserve in September 2013, and in accordance with federal  regulation, the Federal Reserve will have 75 days to review the plan.", "On August 19, 2013, Ally Financial announced that it had entered into  agreements with certain accredited investors to issue and to sell to them  an aggregate of 166,667 shares of its common stock (private placement  securities) for an aggregate purchase price of $1 billion. Ally Financial did  not identify the investors. According to Ally Financial, the agreement  would strengthen the company\u2019s common equity base and support its  capital plan resubmission to the Federal Reserve. The agreement  requires that the private placement close no later than November 30,  2013. Also on August 19, Ally Financial and Treasury entered into an  agreement under which Ally Financial is to repurchase all of the  mandatory convertible preferred shares. The agreement is conditioned on  Ally Financial receiving a non-objection by the Federal Reserve on its  resubmitted CCAR capital plan and the closing of the private placement  securities transaction.", "Ally Financial faces growing competition in both consumer lending and  dealer financing from Chrysler Capital, GM Financial, and other large  bank holding companies. This competition may affect the future  profitability of Ally Financial, which could influence the share price of Ally  Financial once the company becomes publicly traded and thus the timing  of Treasury\u2019s exit. Similar to its GM investment, the eventual amount of  Treasury\u2019s recoupment on its Ally Financial investment will be determined  by the share price of Ally Financial stock.", "Chrysler Capital: In February 2013, Chrysler announced that it had  entered into an agreement with Santander Consumer USA Inc., a  subsidiary of Banco Santander, S.A., that specializes in subprime  auto lending, to provide a full spectrum of auto financing services to  Chrysler Group customers and dealers under the name of Chrysler  Capital. Under the 10-year, private-label agreement, Santander  Consumer USA was to establish a separate lending operation  dedicated to providing financial services under the Chrysler Capital  name, including financing for retail loans and leases, new and used  vehicle inventory, dealership construction, real estate, working capital,  and revolving lines of credit. The agreement grants Santander  Consumer USA the right to a minimum percentage of Chrysler\u2019s  subvention volume and the right to use the Chrysler Capital name for  its auto loan and lease offerings. Santander Consumer USA will also  provide loans to Chrysler dealers to finance inventory, working capital,  and capital improvements. On May 1, 2013, Chrysler Capital started  its lending operations.", "GM Financial: In 2009, GM acquired AmeriCredit Corporation  (AmeriCredit), a subprime automobile finance company, to serve its  subprime customers. AmeriCredit was renamed GM Financial and  made a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. Its target lending market is  lending to consumers who have difficulty securing auto financing from  banks and credit unions. According to GM officials, the purpose of GM  Financial is to drive incremental GM automobile sales by providing  solid and stable funding for GM dealers and consumers. GM Financial  would serve as a captive lender for GM, much as GMAC did. This  year, GM Financial increased its overall assets by purchasing Ally  Financial\u2019s international assets in Europe and Latin America, including  the dealer financing arrangements in these countries.", "Other bank holding companies: We compared the amount of Ally  Financial consumer auto lending with four large bank holding  companies (Bank of America Corporation, Capital One Financial  Corporation, JPMorgan Chase & Company, and Wells Fargo &  Company) that reported consumer automobile loans. These data do  not include all types of automobile financing, such as automobile  leasing and dealer financing, only retail consumer automobile loans  for the time period. As shown in figure 7, the dollar amount of  consumer auto loans Wells Fargo & Company and Capital One  Financial Corporation made increased from March 2011 through June  2013. However, Ally Financial remained the leader among the four  institutions for the same time period.", "Treasury officials noted that such competition could also be a benefit  because Ally Financial\u2019s assets could be viewed as valuable to the other  competitors. Treasury officials noted that the value of Ally Financial can  be demonstrated by the recent private placement agreement. Specifically,  if Treasury sells its Ally Financial common stock at the share price agreed  to in the private placement agreement\u2014$6,000 per share\u2014Treasury  would receive a significant profit on its Ally Financial investment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third Party Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FDIC, the Federal Reserve and  Treasury for their review and comment.

Treasury agreed with the report\u2019s overall findings.  In its written  comments, Treasury describes the auto industry\u2019s recovery and the  progress Treasury has made in unwinding its investments in Ally  Financial and GM.

In its  technical comments, GM highlighted what third parties have suggested  could have happened had Treasury not provided assistance to the auto  industry, including the potential adverse effects on unemployment levels  and tax receipts of all levels of government.

Under TARP, Treasury established the  Automotive Industry Financing Program, through which Treasury  committed $51 billion to help General Motors Company (GM) and $16.3  billion to GMAC LLC, a financial services company that provides  automotive financing and that later became Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally  Financial).", "This report examines (1) the financial condition of GM and Ally Financial  and (2) the status of Treasury\u2019s investments in the companies as well as  its plans to wind down those investments.", "To assess the financial conditions of GM, we analyzed net income,  operating income, operating cash flow, operating income, sales of  automobiles, GM\u2019s share of the North American market, credit ratings,  and pension obligations and pension plan funding for GM\u2019s U.S.  employees from 2008 through the second quarter (June 30) of 2013. For  Ally Financial, we reviewed the institution\u2019s capital ratios, net income,  operating income, net interest spread, return on assets, nonperforming  assets ratio, liquidity ratio, bank deposits, operating cash flow, and credit  ratings, generally from 2008 through the second quarter (June 30) of  2013. To obtain information on the financial ratios and indicators used in  their analyses of GM\u2019s or Ally Financial\u2019s financial condition, we  interviewed staff from Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), GM, Ally Financial, and analysts from the three  largest credit rating agencies as well as investment firms. To select  analysts from investment firms to interview, we identified analysts who  covered GM. We identified them using GM\u2019s investor relations webpage  (http://www.gm.com/company/investors/analyst-coverage.html) and  selected four to contact based on an electronic search for automotive  equity analysts cited in reputable trade and business publications. We  reached out to four analysts and interviewed two. We also interviewed  analysts responsible for covering GM from one of the credit rating  agencies and analysts responsible for covering Ally from all three of the  credit rating agencies. The views of these analysts cannot be generalized  to all analysts from investment firms and credit rating agencies.", "We reviewed past GAO reports, information from GM\u2019s and Ally  Financial\u2019s annual 10-K filings with the Securities and Exchange  Commission, reports and documentation from Treasury and the  companies, and data from SNL Financial from 2008 through the second  quarter (June 30) of 2013. For both GM and Ally Financial, we collected  information, generally from 2008 through the second quarter (June 30) of  2013, the most recent information that was publicly available. We have  relied on SNL Financial data for past reports, and we reviewed past GAO  data reliability assessments to ensure that we, in all material respects,  used the data in a similar manner and for similar purposes. For each data  source we reviewed the data for completeness and obvious errors, such  as outliers, and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. We also reviewed the credit ratings from three rating  agencies for each of these companies. Although we have reported on  actions needed to improve the oversight of rating agencies, we included  these ratings because they are widely used by GM, Ally Financial,  Treasury, and market participants.", "To examine the status of Treasury\u2019s investments and its plans to wind  down those investments, we reviewed Treasury\u2019s TARP reports, which  included monthly 105(a) and daily TARP updates on AIFP program data  for the time period from 2008 through September 2013. We have used  Treasury\u2019s data on AIFP in previous GAO reports. We determined that  the AIFP program data from Treasury were sufficiently reliable to assess  the status of the program. For example, we tested the Office of Financial  Stability\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting as they related to our  annual audit of the office\u2019s financial statements and found the information  to be sufficiently reliable based on the results of our audit of the TARP  financial statements for fiscal years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. AIFP  was included in these financial audits. Using the AIFP program data, we  analyzed Treasury\u2019s equity ownership and recovery of funds in GM and  Ally Financial for the time period from January 2009 to September 2013.  We reviewed the data for completeness and obvious errors, such as  outliers, and determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.
