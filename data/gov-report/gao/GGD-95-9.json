GSP allows developing countries to enjoy import tariff \u201cpreferences\u201d (tariff elimination or reduction) when shipping certain goods to industrialized nations. Because these preferences are applied only to developing countries, however, GSP is inconsistent with article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Article I is commonly referred to as the most-favored-nation (MFN) clause. Therefore, in 1971, the GATT organization granted a 10-year waiver of article I and made it permanent in 1979.", "The United States implemented its GSP Program in 1976. The program grants duty-free preferences to certain designated items from eligible countries, although there are restrictions on GSP benefits. Legislative provisions prevent certain products and countries from ever receiving eligibility. Benefits for eligible items may be restricted based upon (1) a product\u2019s \u201cimport sensitivity,\u201d that is, the degree to which a foreign product will compete with and negatively affect a U.S. product; or (2) the competitiveness of certain beneficiary developing countries (BDCs) in exporting specific items to the United States. Countries may be completely removed from the program if they no longer meet various eligibility requirements, such as by exceeding a specific gross national product (GNP) per capita level or failing to provide internationally recognized worker rights.", "In 1992, $35.7 billion in GSP-eligible imports entered the United States from beneficiary developing countries. About $16.7 billion, or 47 percent, of these imports actually received GSP duty-free entry. The U.S. GSP Program provided benefits to 145 developing countries and territories as of March 1994 and included 4,578 items on the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS).", "Over the years, GSP programs have been introduced by numerous nations; 16 programs are currently in effect. The two other major GSP programs, those of the European Union (EU) and Japan, are structured quite differently from the U.S. system and were considered more complex by UNCTAD and foreign officials we interviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Creation of the GSP Program", "paragraphs": ["The GSP concept was first proposed by UNCTAD in the mid-1960s. According to an UNCTAD official, UNCTAD\u2019s GSP developers were strong advocates of the idea that \u201ctrade, not aid\u201d was an effective way for industrialized nations to assist developing countries. GSP was viewed as a way to promote economic growth and industrialization in developing countries through, for example, increased foreign investment and exports of manufactured goods. This would allow beneficiary countries to earn foreign exchange and interact on a global scale. Another UNCTAD official added that GSP was viewed as a particularly effective \u201cassistance program\u201d because it rewarded competitiveness and encouraged increased participation in international trade based on market demands. UNCTAD fully endorsed the GSP concept in 1968 and completed it by passing a resolution in UNCTAD\u2019s Special Committee on Preferences in 1970.", "As originally envisioned by UNCTAD, GSP was to follow three primary principles: (1) GSP was to be \u201cgeneralized,\u201d meaning that all \u201cdonor\u201d countries that granted GSP benefits were to implement basically the same GSP program; (2) GSP was to be \u201cnonreciprocal,\u201d with donor countries exacting no concessions from benefiting nations in return for the tariff preferences; and (3) GSP was to be \u201cnondiscriminatory\u201d so that every eligible developing country would enjoy the same benefits as every other eligible developing country. According to an UNCTAD official, none of these goals has been met: each of the 16 donor countries (including the EU) has adopted its own separate version of a GSP scheme; demands for reciprocity have clearly been made through imposition of eligibility obligations such as U.S. \u201ccountry practice\u201d requirements related to worker rights and intellectual property rights (IPR) (discussed in ch. 5); and discrimination among developing countries exists within schemes.", "Granting GSP tariff preferences to developing countries is inconsistent with the GATT\u2019s article I MFN provision because it excludes developed countries. Therefore, during the creation of GSP, the contracting parties to GATT determined that the authority for the GSP Program would have to be in the form of a GATT waiver to the MFN clause. The waiver, which was granted in 1971 for 10 years, authorized each industrial country to establish its own GSP program, provided that these programs benefited all \u201cdeveloping countries.\u201d However, it was left to each industrial country to define what it considered to be a \u201cdeveloping country.\u201d Thus, although the GATT waiver established the GSP framework, a great deal of individual discretion was left to each nation implementing a GSP program.", "The 10-year GATT waiver would have expired in 1981. However, as part of the Tokyo Round negotiations, the contracting parties to GATT entered into a new derogation, or exception, from the MFN principle of article I in 1979, this time on a permanent basis, in a declaration entitled \u201cDifferential and More Favorable Treatment, Reciprocity, and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries.\u201d This declaration, commonly referred to as the \u201cenabling clause,\u201d stated that \u201contracting parties may accord differential and more favorable treatment to developing countries, without according such treatment to other contracting parties. . .,\u201d notwithstanding the provisions of the GATT MFN clause.", "According to a GATT official, this permanent waiver makes GSP autonomous and outside the GATT legal system. He stated that GSP beneficiaries have no formal legal recourse under GATT to seek changes in GSP programs over historically contentious GSP issues. These issues include, for example, the U.S. practice of maintaining \u201cdifferential treatment,\u201d or unequal product coverage, among GSP countries. A developing country may, however, apply to GATT for consultations as provided for in the enabling clause. The GATT official said that GSP programs have been employed in a more restrictive manner in the last few years, with a trend toward discretionary removal of GSP benefits for certain products from specific countries. However, for political reasons, no developing country has yet requested a consultation.", "The GATT official added that the country practice provisions currently in U.S. GSP law may be contrary to the spirit of the enabling clause due to their nontrade nature. However, in granting the GSP waiver from GATT, no guidelines, principles, or other criteria were provided on how to structure a GSP program. Further, the areas addressed in country practice provisions have been outside the purview of issues currently addressed by GATT. The official said that, essentially, the waiver provided donor countries with a carte blanche that allows them to implement this unilateral \u201cgift\u201d as they see fit.", "The GSP Program Director said he did not concur with the categorical nature of some of the statements made by the GATT official. He said that by ratifying the GATT enabling clause, countries have agreed that their GSP programs would grant \u201cgeneralized, nonreciprocal, and nondiscriminatory preferences.\u201d Interpretation of these terms is unclear. However, one interpretation has been that the intention of this provision is to prevent GSP donors from using GSP to obtain explicit tariff concessions, especially \u201creverse preferences.\u201d Moreover, the provision could be interpreted as involving explicit obligations, subject to GATT dispute settlement procedures.", "Aside from the autonomy of GSP from GATT rules, an official within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) said that the GATT enabling clause itself establishes a foundation to justify a previously mentioned, historically controversial aspect of the U.S. GSP Program: maintaining \u201cdifferential treatment,\u201d or unequal product coverage, among BDCs. This provision of the U.S. program, which allows the President selectively to remove GSP eligibility for certain items from particular countries that ship these items competitively, has been criticized by some BDCs. They note that GSP was meant to be a nondiscriminatory program. Such removal is commonly referred to as \u201cproduct graduation.\u201d", "According to USTR\u2019s General Counsel (in October 1992), GSP is meant to temporarily assist developing countries to progressively become full GATT participants. USTR points out that one provision in the enabling clause speaks to the possible improved ability of developing countries to make \u201ccontributions or negotiated concessions or take other mutually agreed action\u201d under the provisions of GATT as their economies develop and their trade situations improve. When a particular industry in a developing country has become sufficiently advanced so as to be globally competitive, it no longer needs GSP benefits to compete with industries in developed countries. With respect to that competitive industry, the developing country is expected to participate \u201cfully\u201d in GATT. This process envisions differentiation or product graduation\u2014removing GSP benefits for items from particular BDCs that export the articles competitively, while maintaining benefits on these items for other BDCs. A GATT official agreed with this analysis, stating that because product graduation deals specifically with trade in goods, it is possible for USTR to interpret this section of the enabling clause in this manner. He added, however, that USTR could not \u201cinvoke\u201d this argument on a legal basis within GATT since no direct link exists between this provision of the enabling clause and the GSP Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Structure and Usage of the U.S. GSP Program", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. GSP Program is administered by the GSP Subcommittee, a staff-level working group of the interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC).

TPSC, in turn, reports to the Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG), the policy-making body composed of subcabinet level officials. All three groups are chaired by USTR.", "The GSP Subcommittee administers an annual review process for petitions to add products to or remove products from GSP coverage, as well as petitions related to country eligibility. The GSP annual review is a 13-month cycle, with petitions submitted by June 1 and triggering a two-stage decision cycle. In the first stage, a decision is made on which petitions to accept for review; in the second stage, the accepted petitions are fully reviewed and a decision is made on which petitions to grant or deny for GSP coverage. All GSP eligibility changes go into effect on the following July 1.", "The GSP Program has undergone several changes since its implementation that tend to limit benefits available under the program. Legislative restrictions on eligible products and countries have been added. As a result of the program\u2019s restrictions on benefits, not all imports that are technically eligible under the program actually receive duty-free entry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Original Structure of the U.S. GSP Program", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. GSP Program was originally authorized by title V of the 1974 Trade Act (P.L. 93-618, Jan. 3, 1975), codified in title 19 of the U.S. Code (U.S.C.). The program became operational on January 1, 1976, and provides duty-free entry for designated items from eligible developing countries and territories. According to the 1974 act, the GSP Program was meant to provide fair and reasonable access to products of less-developed countries in the U.S. market. Statutory restrictions placed on product eligibility indicate that the need to protect domestic producers and limit use of the program by competitive countries was also to be recognized in administering the program.", "The 1974 Trade Act allows the President to designate BDCs, as well as specific articles, as eligible under the program. He must consider several factors when making country designations, such as the effect of GSP preferences on the economic development of BDCs and the anticipated impact of granting GSP on U.S. domestic producers. The 1974 act enumerated several factors that automatically eliminate countries from consideration for GSP eligibility, such as whether a country is communist (unless certain criteria are met); is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC); or has expropriated U.S. property without compensation, negotiation, or arbitration. Some additional, discretionary factors to be considered in granting (or maintaining) GSP status for a country include the country\u2019s level of economic development and the country\u2019s provision of equitable and reasonable access to its markets.", "The 1974 Trade Act contains several provisions that limit potential product benefits available under the program. Items such as most textiles, footwear, and other import-sensitive articles are statutorily prohibited from GSP eligibility. Further, items that are granted eligibility can later be restricted from actually receiving duty-free entry in many ways. For example, GSP has a \u201crule of origin\u201d requirement. This requirement states that at least 35 percent of the content and processing of an item shipped under GSP must have come from the shipping BDC in order to receive duty-free entry. The item must also be shipped directly from the BDC to the United States.", "In addition, as previously mentioned (see pp. 21-22), the 1974 act provides for \u201cgraduation,\u201d or the permanent removal of GSP benefits, under the section that allows the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit preferences at any time for any article or beneficiary country. Finally, the program contains a \u201ccompetitive need limit\u201d (CNL) exclusion provision, which is the temporary removal of GSP preferences for a particular item from a particular BDC. This provision automatically suspends GSP preferences if, in any 1 calendar year for any individual item, a beneficiary country ships above a statutorily determined import level. Benefits can be reinstated subsequently if the BDC\u2019s exports fall below the legislated limits.

The 1984 act states that GSP is intended to promote the economic development of BDCs and notes that trade, rather than aid, is a more effective way of achieving this goal. The 1984 legislation also points out that the amended GSP law is meant to provide trade and development opportunities for BDCs without adversely affecting U.S. producers and workers and \u201cto integrate developing countries into the international trading system with its attendant responsibilities in a manner commensurate with their development.\u201d U.S officials whom we interviewed reinforced this last idea, pointing out that GSP has an increased focus as a leveraging tool that can be used to encourage desired behaviors in beneficiary countries in exchange for continued GSP benefits.", "As a result, the 1984 act\u2019s eligibility criteria for countries and products under GSP are stricter. For example, a country must now have taken or be taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights in order to be eligible for GSP. The provision of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property by beneficiaries is also assessed in determining whether to grant (or maintain) GSP eligibility. Further, a GNP per capita eligibility limit was enacted, excluding countries that exceed the ceiling.", "The 1984 law also required the administration to conduct a general review of the GSP Program, and, based upon that review, to identify products from individual countries that could be considered sufficiently competitive. Results of the review were published in 1987. Many sufficiently competitive items shipped from specific BDCs were identified and are now subject to reduced statutorily defined CNL import levels.

By 1992, the value of GSP-eligible imports was $35.7 billion, with 47 percent of this amount ($16.7 billion) actually entering duty free under GSP. An additional $2.9 billion (8 percent of eligible imports) received duty-free access through other programs.

The program is divided into four product areas for eligible countries: industrial, textile (including items subject to the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles for some countries), agricultural, and steel products. For agricultural items, tariffs are eliminated or reduced. Specified items in all other areas enjoy total duty-free entry. Some items are subject to fixed duty-free amounts, or tariff quotas beyond which MFN rates are automatically reinstated. For other items, MFN duties may be reintroduced once a duty-free import tariff ceiling amount is met, based on an exchange of information between the member states and EU authorities. GSP access is reinstated at the end of the calendar year for all items. The amount eligible for preferential entry often varies by product and beneficiary country for specific items (though not for agricultural products, which are subject to global reduced-duty amounts). An UNCTAD official told us that the EU has been waiting until the completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations before it renews its GSP Program.", "The Japanese GSP Program, which has been extended to the year 2001, is also structured very differently from the U.S. system. This system was cited as complex by eligible beneficiary country officials we interviewed. The Japanese program comprises a positive list of agricultural items that are eligible for GSP, and a negative list of industrial goods (including textiles) that are ineligible. Similar to the EU\u2019s GSP, the Japanese program provides for duty-free as well as reduced-duty access under GSP. Reduced duties apply to both agricultural and industrial items. Import ceilings apply to some industrial products (though not agricultural goods) and may lead to a reinstatement of MFN tariff rates; imported products posing no threat or injury to Japan\u2019s domestic industry can continue to receive GSP preferences even after a country exceeds ceiling levels. Japan has adopted a graduation policy, whereby a particular country can lose its GSP benefits for a specific product when the beneficiary is viewed as internationally competitive.", "From a beneficiary\u2019s perspective, Australia\u2019s GSP program has been mentioned by UNCTAD officials as straightforward and simple. They explained that Australia\u2019s GSP scheme includes almost every item on its tariff schedule, with all developing countries receiving a tariff reduction of 5 percentage points.

However, the removal of Mexico, which accounted for the majority of these exclusions, from the program is one factor that may alter this trend.", "Some import-sensitive items, such as textiles and footwear, are legislatively prohibited from receiving GSP eligibility. For those items that are granted GSP eligibility, the GSP law permits improvements in BDC competitiveness to limit duty-free imports for specific products from particular countries. Such exclusions include discretionary permanent \u201cproduct graduation\u201d or removal from the program of a product shipped by a particular BDC, as well as legislated annual import ceilings for individual items beyond which GSP preferences will automatically be suspended for a country.

As a result of the 1989 GSP annual review, a policy was adopted that makes it easier for products from more economically advanced BDCs that are excluded under CNL to regain GSP status. However, CNL exclusions for certain countries have grown quickly in recent years. In 1992, all CNL exclusions were responsible for 42 percent of total exclusions. Although the overall value of shipments excluded from GSP due to CNL declined between 1989 and 1992, foreign officials we interviewed cited CNL as the main obstacle to obtaining GSP duty-free entry for eligible articles. Further, BDC officials we interviewed said that CNL exclusions actually result in a reduced ability to export to the United States, although items are excluded because the United States believes a BDC is competitive in exporting them. In examining two cycles of CNL exclusions, we found an immediate loss of market share once a CNL was implemented in a majority of cases for the country involved (though no causal link was identified).", "If BDCs are unable to produce and export eligible items, then they cannot participate in the program.

The prominence of the different types of exclusions from GSP duty-free entry has changed between 1989 and 1992, with administrative exclusions now dominating limitations under the program. Administrative exclusions can occur for reasons such as a failure to meet program requirements on product domestic content (rule of origin) or on direct shipment of an item from a GSP country to the United States. Inadequate customs paperwork can also lead to this type of exclusion. In 1989, administrative exclusions amounted to $3.8 billion and accounted for 31 percent of all exclusions. By 1992, they had grown substantially to over $9 billion to become the primary reason (56 percent) for exclusions from GSP duty-free entry in that year.", "Some trade experts and U.S. officials we interviewed commented on one type of administrative exclusion as being in need of change\u2014domestic content or \u201crule of origin\u201d requirements. Title 19 U.S.C., subsection 2463(b), establishes specific criteria (rules of origin) that articles must meet in order to be eligible for GSP preferences. These criteria are in place to determine an imported good\u2019s \u201clegal nationality.\u201d Under these rules, GSP duty-free entry is allowed only if the cost or value of materials produced in the beneficiary country, plus the direct costs of processing in the country, equals at least 35 percent of the appraised value of an article upon its entry into the United States. Product components from a third country must be \u201csubstantially transformed\u201d into new and different constituent materials, of which the eligible article is composed, in the exporting BDC before they can be considered part of this 35-percent domestic content rule. For the GSP Program there is no measurable definition of the term substantially transformed, and the determination as to whether such a requirement has been met is made on a case-by-case basis that involves subjective judgment. In addition, goods must be imported directly from the beneficiary country into the customs territory of the United States to obtain the duty preference (although entrep\u00f4t trade may be allowed in some instances).", "There has been criticism of this type of rule of origin requirement, with U.S. officials we interviewed claiming that BDCs may have no predictable (i.e., clear) way of knowing before shipment whether foreign components will be considered to have been substantially transformed and can be included as part of the 35-percent domestic content. Therefore, some U.S. officials and one trade expert have suggested that the GSP Program should adopt a different rule of origin approach, similar to that of NAFTA, where substantial transformation is clearly defined by changing a product\u2019s tariff classification. Under NAFTA, goods containing imported materials from outside the free trade area are generally considered NAFTA originating if the foreign materials undergo processing or assembly in North America sufficient to result in a specified change in the HTS tariff classification. Under this tariff-shift rule, depending on the good involved, NAFTA requires non-NAFTA components to be in a predetermined different HTS chapter, heading, subheading, or tariff item than the final product if the final product is to receive the agreement\u2019s preferential duty treatment. Therefore, North American exporters know whether they have met NAFTA rule of origin requirements before shipments are sent. In January 1994, the U.S. Customs Service proposed adopting a change of tariff classification system that would affect GSP and other preferential programs (though the 35-percent rule would remain independent) and was collecting public comments on this possibility until early April.", "U.S. government officials and a trade expert we interviewed said that the NAFTA approach is clear and leaves little doubt as to whether a partially non-NAFTA item has been substantially transformed and will, therefore, qualify as having sufficient North American content. However, some contend that an attempt to create such a system for the GSP Program could lead to disagreements over what constitutes adequate transformation or could result in an overly protective scheme. An ITC official also pointed out that a tariff classification change system would require massive paperwork for BDC companies where documentation would be involved at every stage of transformation in order to substantiate the required change. Such a process could make compliance with rule of origin requirements difficult and discourage BDCs from using the GSP Program.", "Another issue was raised about the current rule of origin system related to U.S. source content of GSP items. Currently, the GSP Program does not allow for U.S. components of BDC items shipped to be considered in any way in meeting domestic content requirements (unless substantially transformed). Private sector officials expressed concern over this situation and suggested that U.S. component input be included as counting toward the 35-percent requirement.", "In 1992, Mexico accounted for 67 percent of all administrative exclusions. Foreign and U.S. government officials told us that they believed Mexico\u2019s large proportion of such exclusions could possibly be attributed to high levels of imports that were eligible for GSP but instead were shipped under HTS chapter 98, subchapter II (\u201c9802\u201d), which provides for partial tariff elimination. These items were not shipped under GSP presumably because they could not meet GSP\u2019s 35-percent domestic content rule of origin or simply because 9802 was the preferred option. The dutiable value of all GSP-eligible goods imported under 9802 is categorized as an administrative exclusion. In 1991, Mexico was the largest beneficiary of 9802.

This situation is further compounded by the lack of data on GSP exports by beneficiary countries themselves. For example, as of 1992, Brazil, the program\u2019s fourth largest user, maintained no official data on its exports to the United States under GSP (although a computerized trade data system is being developed that would capture GSP exports). An official from the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism told us that the Brazilian government relies on UNCTAD for data on its GSP exports to the United States.", "Foreign company representatives in affected industries we interviewed said that they experience immediate production and export planning problems once they learn that their article will lose GSP. Foreign government officials said that businesses also experience long-term planning problems. Further, one foreign businessman noted that not only is future planning disrupted by a loss of GSP, but past planning efforts that were aimed at initially entering the U.S. market are lost. Foreign industry officials we interviewed said that the effect on profitability due to a lost tariff differential of just a few percentage points can be very great. A Brazilian economist working for the United Nations (U.N.) noted that the impact could be particularly strong for undifferentiated items where price is the primary factor that distinguishes the beneficiary\u2019s product in the U.S. marketplace.", "Suggestions were offered to soften the perceived severe impact of CNL exclusions. Foreign and UNCTAD officials we spoke with suggested that a longer adjustment period should be granted to businesses to plan for the tariff change and to find potential alternate markets before CNL exclusions are implemented. One point made by BDC government and industry officials was that CNL exclusions should be based on sustainable GSP export performance, rather than on only 1 year\u2019s data. Unusual circumstances in 1 year that trigger a CNL exclusion may not be typical or indicative of an industry\u2019s capability to export at competitive levels over the long run from a specific country. For example, a representative of one Brazilian sector (rods/bars of copper-zinc base) explained that the industry found itself subject to a CNL export percentage exclusion in 1991 even though its exports to the United States had not changed significantly from previous years. However, exports to the United States from other countries had decreased, and so the Brazilian industry\u2019s proportion of U.S. imports of the item had exceeded the CNL percentage level.", "A former GSP Program director questioned these requests for increased leniency before exclusions are implemented, pointing out that BDCs should be taking a more active role in reducing the impact of CNL exclusions. He noted that BDCs should act to avoid CNL exclusions altogether. BDC governments should more closely monitor U.S. import statistics to determine which industries may be at future risk of exceeding competitive need limits. The BDC government could then alert industry representatives, who could file for a CNL waiver during the annual review process before any CNL level was even exceeded. The industry would then be unaffected by any future CNL exclusion if the waiver were granted. Another former GSP Program official suggested that once a product from a BDC exceeds CNL levels for a certain number of years, U.S. policy should be to completely graduate the item for the country involved. This action would add an element of predictability to the process of reducing GSP benefits for specific countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decreasing Size of CNL Exclusions", "paragraphs": ["Some foreign government officials and an industry official we interviewed referred to CNL exclusions as the major barrier to receiving benefits from the program; however, as discussed previously (see pp. 47-48), we found that the majority of exclusions from duty-free entry were due to administrative reasons in 1991 and 1992. In 1989, total CNL exclusions accounted for the largest share (66 percent) of all exclusions and were valued at $8.2 billion. Reduced CNL, which affected primarily Mexico and Brazil, accounted for 17 percent of total CNL exclusions. By 1992, total CNL exclusions had dropped to $6.7 billion (42 percent of total exclusions), with 13 percent of all CNL exclusions due to reduced CNL.", "One Brazilian trade association official suggested that the reason for the decreased level of CNL exclusions may be that companies simply stopped shipping the items subject to CNL or graduation limitations because of a lost crucial competitive edge. This situation would make CNL exclusions appear relatively less serious than they actually were, when compared to other types of exclusions. (This argument could also be made for permanent product graduations.) Our analysis, based on exclusions in force in 1992, concluded that the assertion that countries completely stopped shipping CNL-excluded items was mistaken, at least for that year. At the end of 1992, although 245 product/BDC pairs were officially excluded from GSP eligibility, 225 (92 percent) items had been shipped by the affected country despite a lack of GSP duty-free benefits.", "Instead, the recent proportional decrease in the importance of CNL relative to other exclusions over the years can be attributed to the fact that (1) administrative exclusions have increased substantially and (2) fewer items are now subject to continued CNL limitations for key countries, primarily Mexico and Brazil, because of an eased redesignation policy adopted as part of the 1989 annual review. Following implementation of this policy, the value of CNL exclusions for these countries has decreased.", "Mexico and Brazil accounted for the majority of CNL exclusions in 1989 and 1990 (with Mexico continuing to account for over half of all CNL exclusions in 1991 and 1992), and the size of their CNL exclusions has, to a large degree, dictated the importance of CNL in the program overall over time. The number and value of Mexican and Brazilian CNL exclusions were greatly reduced by 1992. As shown in figure 3.1, Mexico and Brazil had a smaller share of total CNL exclusions in that year when compared to 1989.", "At the end of 1989, Mexico was officially subject to exclusions for 285 items. Following implementation of the eased redesignation policy, Mexico had 209 items that were returned to GSP-eligible status in 1990. By the end of 1992, Mexico was officially subject to limitations for 91 products. Similarly, at the end of 1989, Brazil had 132 items that were officially excluded from receiving GSP preferences. As with Mexico, Brazil had many items (90) that regained GSP eligibility after the redesignation policy was altered. At the end of 1992, Brazil was officially excluded from GSP duty-free entry for 55 items, most of which were eligible for redesignation.", "Just as the eased redesignation policy has allowed items to return to GSP status, so, too, have CNL waivers lessened the impact of CNL exclusions in recent years. Items entering with CNL waivers have increased in value and proportion, from $533 million (2 percent of eligible imports) entering GSP duty free under waivers in 1989, to $2.5 billion (7 percent of eligible imports) in 1992. As seen in figure 3.2, the two countries that benefited most from CNL waivers in 1992 were Mexico and Malaysia. Mexico was the primary beneficiary, with $1.1 billion entering duty free under waivers (45 percent of all waiver benefits). While Malaysia had $593 million in imports to the United States dutied under CNL in 1992, $906 million entered duty free under CNL waivers. However, Thailand and Brazil, in addition to being two of the countries most affected by CNL exclusions, shipped no items that benefited from CNL waivers.", "The reduced size of CNL exclusions may not last. While smaller CNL restrictions for Mexico (in particular) and Brazil have resulted in a reduced importance for CNL exclusions in the program overall, other top shipping countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have had very different experiences. These two countries had growth rates in GSP duty-free shipments of about 31 and 27 percent, respectively, between 1991 and 1992. However, they had even higher increases in shipments to the United States dutied under CNL that year. Thailand had about $845 million in GSP imports enter the United States dutied because of CNL in 1992, an increase of 33 percent from 1991. Malaysia reached a level of $593 million in shipments to the United States dutied under CNL in 1992, a 245-percent increase from 1991. This growth was largely due to increased levels of exports of the same excluded items over time, rather than an increase in the number of items excluded. For example, Malaysia\u2019s CNL exclusions in 1992 were attributable to just six products. Malaysia and Thailand now rank ahead of Brazil for imports entering the United States subject to duties due to CNL exclusions. Continued rapid growth in these CNL exclusions, combined with the graduation of Mexico, could result in an increased relative impact of CNL on the GSP Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Impact of CNL Exclusions", "paragraphs": ["Due to the concern expressed about CNL exclusions by foreign business and government officials, we examined exports to the United States of (1) the affected BDC, (2) other BDCs, and (3) ineligible countries following a CNL exclusion.

However, some U.S. officials said that BDCs are competitive without GSP if they are exporting beyond the statutory limits and that CNL exclusions provide increased opportunities for other BDCs.", "We examined data on 57 CNL product exclusions that took effect in 1990 (40 items) and 1991 (17 items) to assess the import position for the affected BDC, other BDCs, and non-GSP countries. Many of these exclusions were applied to Mexico. Our analysis showed that the results were mixed. Following the CNL exclusion, the affected BDC experienced a reduced competitive position, measured as a loss in U.S. import market share, in about 65 percent of the cases for both sets of exclusions by July 1992. The range of this share loss varied widely, from a few percentage points to a 100-percent loss. There was no pattern of share loss or gain for certain types of products.", "However, the excluded country was actually able to maintain or increase its import market share in up to 35 percent of the cases after the exclusion. Further, subsequent redesignations or CNL waivers softened the impact of lost import market share for about half of the 25 items excluded in 1990 that regained GSP status in 1991. The amount of GSP duty-free shipments before the CNL exclusion did not appear to be predictive of the impact the exclusion would have on the particular BDC.", "In addition, our analysis showed that the import market share lost by excluded BDCs was somewhat more likely to accrue to non-GSP countries, although other BDCs also improved their share, and often for the same items as non-GSP countries. In cases where the excluded BDC lost share, non-GSP countries increased their import market share for over 70 percent, while remaining BDCs increased their share for over 60 percent, of the items."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Awareness of the Program and Ability of BDCs to Produce and Export GSP-Eligible Products", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the legislative prohibition of eligibility for certain items, there are other reasons for limited use of the GSP Program that are not captured in data. It is possible that GSP is not used as much as it might be because exporters simply are not familiar with GSP, particularly in countries that are not large users of the program. For example, a U.S. government official in Turkey, as well as a Turkish government official, said that the Turkish government does an inadequate job of informing Turkish exporters about the opportunities provided by the GSP Program. A business representative in Brazil said that smaller firms in that country do not even know that the program exists.", "In addition, some U.S. government officials and GSP experts we interviewed told us that they believe an important limitation on GSP participation is that many BDCs cannot produce and export items that are eligible under the program. This conclusion led to varying opinions by these officials on the appropriate country focus of the GSP Program.", "Some U.S. government officials said that there is little that the United States can do to increase use of the program for many countries. They explained that the United States should realize that domination of the program by the few countries that can produce and export is to be expected. A former GSP director pointed out that too many people mistakenly view the GSP Program as a traditional aid program, believing that if the U.S. government removes benefits from some countries, it can allocate more to other countries. He said that such an action simply is not possible with the GSP Program, where the benefits of tariff preferences are not transferable to countries that are not strong producers or exporters of the GSP-eligible goods shipped by a graduated country.", "For example, our analysis of CNL exclusions showed that, in the short run, other BDCs were often able to increase their U.S. import market shares when certain BDCs were excluded from receiving GSP preferences for particular items. However, these increases in market share occurred for remaining BDCs that were already shipping the affected articles. This conclusion suggests that the universe of remaining eligible BDCs that could benefit in the short run from an exclusion, whether it is a CNL, product graduation, or country graduation exclusion, is limited to those countries that are already shipping the relevant articles.

Formal criteria cited in making the decision to remove the NIEs, in addition to their GSP shipment levels, were GNP per capita, economic growth rates, and an ability to export manufactured items into the United States. While some hoped that the graduations would improve exporting opportunities under GSP for other BDCs, others argued that it would be just as likely that developed, non-GSP countries would increase their exports of these goods.", "The circumstances surrounding Singapore\u2019s graduation were often singled out as unacceptable by trade experts we interviewed. Throughout most of the 1980s, Singapore did not protect U.S. (or any foreign) copyrighted goods. According to an official representing U.S. intellectual property interests, the U.S. government, pointing out the magnitude of financial losses to U.S. interests due to pirating of copyrighted U.S. works, informed Singapore that if copyright protection for U.S. goods were not soon provided, then that country would lose GSP benefits. Singapore, the fourth largest beneficiary under GSP, had duty-free shipments under the program of $1.3 billion in 1987.", "This industry representative pointed out that in order to protect U.S. copyrighted goods, Singapore needed to (1) pass a new copyright law and (2) either sign a multilateral convention to protect copyrighted works of other signatories (such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works) or enter into a bilateral agreement with the United States to afford reciprocal protection. Singapore passed a new copyright law in February 1987, and the United States and Singapore subsequently extended reciprocal copyright protection, through a bilateral agreement, in April of that year.", "With this newly enacted protection of U.S. copyrighted works, Singapore believed its status under GSP to be secure. However, just 9 months later, in January 1988, the United States announced that Singapore would be graduated entirely from the program beginning in 1989. Many U.S. intellectual property representatives were alarmed by this move, stating that it signaled bad faith on the part of the United States. One industry official stated that Singapore still resents and raises this issue, which has made current intellectual property discussions with that country more difficult. A former USTR official we interviewed countered that the decision to graduate Singapore was made based on overriding trade and economic factors entirely apart from IPR, and, under the political climate of the time, the country would have been removed regardless of the status of its IPR regime.", "Although the graduation of the four Asian NIEs had a great impact on the overall GSP Program figures and saw the imports of GSP-eligible goods from the four NIEs decrease, the action appears to have had an unclear effect on the level of GSP-eligible exports of the remaining BDCs, as shown in table 3.2. In 1988, the last year of program eligibility for the four Asian NIEs, total GSP-eligible imports to the United States from all BDCs amounted to almost $50 billion. Over $18 billion received GSP duty-free entry. The NIEs shipped almost $29 billion, or 60 percent, of eligible imports, and $9.85 billion of this amount received duty-free entry. Once the NIEs were graduated, GSP-eligible imports from BDCs dropped by over 50 percent, to $24.4 billion in 1989, while duty-free imports fell by 45 percent, to $10 billion.", "The four NIEs accounted for almost 19 percent of total U.S. imports of GSP-covered articles in 1988.

With the NIEs now among their ranks, non-GSP countries increased their share of GSP-eligible U.S. imports in 1989 to over 86 percent, from about 68 percent in 1988.

All GSP-eligible countries increased their share of U.S. imports of eligible items every year following the graduations, rising from almost 14 percent in 1989 to 17 percent in 1992.", "However, it is difficult to conclude that the modest increase in U.S. import market share of imports from GSP-eligible countries was specifically due to the NIEs\u2019 1989 graduations, since these BDCs had increased their portion of eligible imports even before the graduations. Further, the NIEs had been losing U.S. import market share before the graduations occurred.", "An evaluation of country graduation done through the U.N.\u2019s Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific in 1992 suggested, as did our analysis, that the trade impact on the graduated countries was negative. The evaluation also claimed that remaining Asian GSP-eligible countries realized an influx of foreign direct investment after the NIEs\u2019 graduation at the expense of the four NIEs. The U.N. study stated that other Asian BDCs were able to increase imports to the United States somewhat because of the NIE graduations. However, these countries maintained internal production and regulatory barriers that have kept them from fully exploiting any increased opportunities provided by the removal of the NIEs from the program.

The BDCs we visited have legitimate concerns over CNL. The premise behind the automatic CNL exclusions\u2014that a BDC\u2019s industry is a competitive exporter once these levels are reached and so no longer needs GSP\u2014can be questioned. Only 1 year of data is used in order to trigger an exclusion, during which time external factors that may have little to do with a specific BDC industry\u2019s competitiveness can affect U.S. import levels. While CNL exclusions are intended to remove products that are considered competitive, our data indicated that a loss of GSP due to CNL was often followed by a decrease in import market share. Further, unlike product graduation, domestic interests have no input into this process, and no U.S. government judgment is made concerning particular items and their competitiveness.", "The implementation of a CNL exclusion can be disruptive and destabilizing for the BDC industry and U.S. importers affected. GSP duty-free preferences are lost for at least a year, unless the industry has the foresight to apply for a waiver a year before it is needed. Once a CNL exclusion is triggered, the industry has only a few months\u2019 notice to prepare for the loss of GSP duty elimination. This circumstance undermines the program\u2019s intent of fostering economic growth and stability for BDCs.", "It is possible that granting a longer period before CNL exclusions take effect could counteract these problems. For example, after a BDC\u2019s industry exceeds the CNL, the industry could be granted an additional 1-year period during which the BDC industry could apply for a waiver and a second year of data would be collected. At the end of this additional year, a decision would be made whether to grant the waiver or, if the data show an import situation consistent with the first year for the industry, to deny it and allow the CNL exclusion to take effect. Any domestic concerns over whether to extend duty-free preferences with a waiver could be assessed on a case-by-case basis during the additional year. For example, product graduation could be applied to BDC items that are found to be exported competitively as a result of examining domestic concerns.", "Product graduation, while currently accounting for a small percentage of exclusions, is an effective way of targeting competitive BDC products for exclusion from GSP. Concerned U.S. producers, at their request, can receive relief from imports that they consider competitive.

Such criteria are difficult to articulate or quantify, requiring case-by-case judgments. This difficulty was the source of much of the controversy in the product petitions we reviewed. While most petitions were not controversial and were routinely decided based on economic merit, we found that the more controversial the case and the higher in the trade policy structure it was elevated, the more other policy factors became determinative. Another issue raised related to the transparency of the reasoning behind decisions on whether to grant or deny a product petition. USTR makes no public statement, although by regulation it must respond in writing to a written request for information by the petitioner. During the 1991 Special Review for Central and Eastern Europe, the administrative waiver of the rule that 3 years must pass before a product addition petition is refiled caused much controversy. The waiver created the perception among affected domestic industries that the program had been politicized, and they questioned the credibility of the program.

The concept of injury or threat of injury does not arise in the GSP statute. Rather, the statute requires that the President base a decision regarding a product\u2019s eligibility on whether it is import sensitive. However, the GSP Director stressed that import sensitivity clearly has a lower threshold than injury: if an industry is injured, it is import sensitive, but it can be import sensitive long before the industry is injured.

Our review of 45 cases in the 1991 annual review and the 1991 Central and Eastern Europe special review indicated that the inability to reach consensus on what is import sensitive or sufficiently competitive is often at the heart of the interagency debate. And clearly, the more controversial the case and the higher it is elevated in the trade policy structure, the more other policy factors become determinative.

We found that in cases in which the GSP Subcommittee reached consensus that a product was not import sensitive and that the petition should be granted, but domestic producers were vehemently opposed, the petition was generally elevated to TPSC or TPRG for resolution. In cases in which the GSP Subcommittee was unable to reach consensus, it was usually because one or two agencies strongly dissented from the majority view. The stronger the dissent, the higher the case was elevated in the trade policy structure. Invariably, in these high-profile cases, there were deep divisions on what the economic impact would be, to what extent domestic producers were import sensitive, and what constituted a level of imports that would harm domestic industry.", "The recommendations of the GSP Subcommittee were at times reversed by TPSC or TPRG, and the President decided cases differently from the recommendations forwarded to him as well. In 14 of the 45 cases we studied, recommendations were reversed, with 5 by TPSC, 6 by TPRG, and 3 by the President. In most cases, the action was to reverse a petition approval to a denial. This reversal rate is not representative of the reversal rate for all cases because we specifically included all of the controversial cases in our case study analysis, and, according to the GSP Director, the 1991 special review had a higher number of controversial cases than normal. This selection of cases may account for a higher percentage of changed results than would be usual.", "Trade policy is generally acknowledged to be a part of foreign policy; it is also a function of domestic policy. The fact that the GSP Program sits at the juxtaposition of these two sometimes opposing forces is at the heart of the balancing act required of the GSP Subcommittee: to assist developing countries to increase exports to the U.S. market while not harming domestic producers. The easy decisions on petitions only happened when the product was not domestically produced or when the BDC only took market share away from developed country exports, resulting in a neutral impact for the domestic market. But where there were domestic producers who were likely to lose any notable degree of market share, then the debate over what level of imports causes harm was triggered. The debate became even more contentious when there were domestic importers who did want the benefit of duty-free entry of that product. Obviously, the domestic producer was not enthusiastic about any loss of market share, while domestic importers generally disputed estimates of harmful impact and stressed potential benefits to themselves, U.S. consumers, and the BDC producers.", "One of the problems related to perspective.

We believe there is merit in the General Counsel\u2019s argument that TPSC could waive the 3-year rule since it is merely a procedural rule designed to reduce the possibility that articles would be subjected to repeated and overburdening review.

Several domestic industry representatives and a trade attorney disagreed with such a policy. They said that revealing the bottom-line conclusion\u2014whether or not a product was import sensitive under GSP\u2014would not threaten business-proprietary information such as profit margins or productivity of industry members: these need not be disclosed. They said this policy undercuts the transparency of the program. Several GSP Subcommittee members said that public disclosure of this information would jeopardize the validity of ITC investigations. They said that companies provide ITC with sensitive business information critical to the ITC analysis only because the companies know that it will be kept strictly confidential. Without this assurance, the quality and accuracy of future information disclosures would be undermined.", "ITC and GSP officials subsequently told us that concern for business-proprietary information was not the reason USTR classified the ITC economic impact advice as confidential. GSP officials said that there were several reasons for this policy. They said that the ITC probable economic effect advice under GSP is given pursuant to the same statutory basis as for trade negotiations. Confidentiality is necessary for such negotiations and historically has also been extended to GSP advice. The officials said another reason is that releasing ITC\u2019s advice could unduly highlight this advice as being more significant than it is in the GSP review process. ITC advice has been valued for its impartiality but has been treated as only one factor in the GSP Subcommittee\u2019s review.

Worker rights advocates are particularly concerned, especially since IPR advocates can pursue more powerful provisions in U.S. trade law.

Further, the prospect during GSP renewal of additional country practice provisions being proposed, particularly for environmental protection purposes where there are no international standards, was generally held to be a mistake by those we interviewed who currently participate in the GSP Program. It was frequently pointed out that adding new provisions would reduce the leverage of existing provisions and put too high a price on GSP benefits for many BDCs.

For example, the high level of research and development cost and risk faced by the pharmaceutical industry was highlighted in a February 1993 Office of Technology Assessment report, Pharmaceutical R&D: Costs, Risks and Rewards.

The PRMA representative gave the example of India, which he stated officially sanctions pharmaceutical piracy.

On June 30, 1989, a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat overthrew the Sudanese government, and the new government immediately issued a decree to abolish labor unions and forbid strikes.

Four of these 11 BDCs were later reinstated; the 4 granted reinstatement petitions were filed by 3 BDCs that had been suspended for worker rights violations and 1 BDC for expropriation violations.", "IPR advocates, who filed relatively few cases under GSP, generally felt that the GSP Program had played a beneficial role in securing improved IPR protection in GSP beneficiary countries. A number of BDCs have improved their IPR laws as a result of GSP petitions. IPR advocates were less concerned about acceptance of petitions and more concerned about more \u201cvigorous\u201d use of the IPR provision, resulting in more BDCs being suspended for IPR violations.", "Worker rights advocates were far more concerned about acceptance of worker rights petitions and were generally very disappointed with the implementation of the provision under the GSP Program. Although they acknowledged that the provision had led to progress in a number of BDCs, it was apparent that the results had not met their expectations. Their main area of concern was with the standards for acceptance of petitions for review. They said that the GSP Subcommittee needed to articulate clear and specific standards for acceptance or rejection of petitions for full review. They said that all worker rights petitions should be accepted, as long as they were not legally frivolous.", "In 1990, 23 labor and human rights groups filed suit against the administration in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The parties to the lawsuit included almost every group that had filed a worker rights petition under the GSP Program. They charged that the administration had failed to enforce the worker rights provision. They lost their case in district court and their appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. However, the lawsuits were dismissed on the technical ground that the parties lacked standing to bring the lawsuits or that the particular court lacked jurisdiction to consider the lawsuit; the substance of the lawsuits was never addressed.", "One of the primary concerns labor groups have had about acceptance of petitions has been based on the GSP Program\u2019s policy of distinguishing between human rights and worker rights violations. For instance, the murder of a trade union leader is classified as a human rights violation and is not accepted as the basis of a worker rights petition. Labor groups disagreed with this policy, stating that in most cases it is very clear that the reason a labor leader has been murdered was due to worker rights advocacy.", "GSP officials pointed out that in developing countries that have serious human rights problems, it is usually not possible to clearly establish the motivating cause for the violation. The GSP Director said that the policy line between human rights and worker rights has been a difficult one in some cases. Generally, the GSP Subcommittee looked for firm evidence that abuses against individuals were in some way related to their work as labor or union activists. This proves difficult in cases of widespread civil unrest or civil war. Moreover, it is difficult in such instances, where the perpetrating party is unclear, and where the government of the country may lack effective legal control over events, to determine the extent to which the government could take or was taking effective steps to prevent such abuses. However, he cited the recent case with Malawi, where a labor leader was imprisoned by the government for sedition, in which the GSP Program did have the clear evidence it needed. The GSP Subcommittee pursued the issue with the Malawi government, and the labor leader was finally released.", "Another policy that is controversial is the \u201cnew information\u201d standard in the GSP regulations. This regulation states that in order to re-petition on a worker rights case that has been dismissed (whether not accepted for full review or reviewed and found insufficient to establish a GSP violation), substantial new information must be brought. The reasons for the regulation are similar to the reasons behind the 3-year rule for product addition petitions: to prevent repeated petitioning on the same issue that would harass the petitioned party and unduly burden the GSP review process. Country practice petitions can be refiled every year; there can be no 3-year rule because the IPR and worker rights practices of a BDC can change at any time. However, labor groups said that the new information standard undermines their effective use of the worker rights provision. If a BDC is found to be taking steps toward, but is not in compliance with, worker rights standards, this regulatory standard makes it difficult to revisit the situation when labor groups feel progress on those issues stopped as soon as the GSP pressure ended.", "Worker rights advocates said that the petition filed against Malaysia in 1988 is a good example of this problem with the new information standard. After the petition, which stated that Malaysia was suppressing unions in its electronics sector, was accepted for review, the Malaysian government announced an end to the ban on electronics unions. Later, a Malaysian government official clarified the announcement to indicate that only in-house unions would be permitted, even though unions in Malaysia are generally organized at the national level. The United States found Malaysia to be taking steps to improve its labor regime, and the case was concluded at the end of the review cycle in spring 1989. However, the U.S. Trade Representative noted in her April 1989 letter to the Malaysian Prime Minister informing him of this decision that much progress was needed. She also cited the fact that the government did not allow full freedom for workers to associate and form labor unions of their own choosing in certain export industries such as the electronics industry. Notwithstanding this admonition, subsequent petitions filed in 1990 and 1991 were rejected for review because of determinations that they failed to provide new information.", "During our visit to Kuala Lumpur in November 1992, the embassy official responsible for labor issues said that the embassy\u2019s analysis had shown that the 1990 and 1991 petitions did not contain new information. He also confirmed that the embassy did not conduct any follow-up work to determine whether the Malaysian government had taken any corrective actions in the areas identified by the GSP Subcommittee.", "The AFL-CIO filed another petition on this issue in June 1993. The decision on whether to accept the petition for review was deferred until January 1994. USTR stated that additional time was needed to determine if a second review was warranted, or if worker rights progress had continued over the past several years.", "The GSP Director said that there had been a change in recent months to interpret the new information regulation more broadly. He said that the GSP Subcommittee has been more willing to accept petitions a second time. For example, the worker rights petition filed against the Dominican Republic in June 1989 resulted in a finding in April 1991 that the Dominican government was taking steps to improve worker rights by drafting a new labor law. Another petition was filed in June 1991, but was rejected because the Dominican government was still in the process of enacting the new labor law. However, 2 years later, in June 1993, a further petition was filed stating that the new law was not being adequately enforced. The GSP Director said that the GSP Subcommittee considered the new information that the Dominican Republic was not enforcing its new labor law and accepted the case for review. He also noted that GSP summary reports at the conclusion of reviews are now more explicit on worker rights cases. If the BDC is taking steps, the GSP Subcommittee notes the action and then goes on to record what additional steps the subcommittee expects.

In contrast, IPR and worker rights advocates generally said they want to see more cases accepted for review and more BDCs sanctioned through suspension from the GSP Program. However, the fact that worker rights advocates have reacted more strongly, to the point of filing suit against the administration, also reflects the relative standing of IPR and worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law.

More recently, in December 1993, two new worker rights cases filed against Costa Rica and Paraguay were settled, and the AFL-CIO withdrew its petitions after new legislation was enacted. The GSP Director said that progress was also being made in El Salvador and Indonesia. Just as importantly, GSP officials said that these provisions have resulted in raising the consciousness of BDC governments on the importance of IPR and worker rights protections and are having a longer term impact as BDC development levels increase.", "Generally speaking, according to government officials, the approach they take in administering country practice provisions is that of using the GSP provisions to encourage improved IPR and worker rights practices by BDCs. While they are willing to use the leverage provided by GSP benefits to push hard for improvements, they do not want to have to actually exercise GSP sanctions to punish BDCs. Once sanctions are imposed, leverage is lost in encouraging future improvements in any of the country practice provisions. And, just as important for the administration, bilateral trade and foreign relations are damaged. It is for this reason, we found, that country practice cases are usually held over until a resolution can be worked out.", "Government officials stressed that they have to take a broad view of bilateral relations to balance competing interests. They said that they cannot afford to take a narrowly focused position, as many advocacy groups do, that country practice petitions should be pursued at all costs, no matter what the impact will be on the commercial and bilateral relationship with a BDC. A myriad of equally important objectives may be held in the balance at any given time. A notable example of such inherent constraints was with the 1988 worker rights petition against Syria, which was held over for 3 additional years while the Middle East hostage situation was going on.

The most egregious IPR cases have been pursued through these first two provisions, rather than through GSP. GSP\u2019s main value for IPR advocates is as a first level of response, leaving negotiating room to increase the pressures with the threat or use of Section 301 and/or Special 301. Several IPR representatives told us that they preferred to use GSP when possible because it caused the least damage to bilateral trade relations.", "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides a domestic procedure under which affected enterprises or individuals may petition the U.S. Trade Representative to initiate actions to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements, or to respond to unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory foreign government practices that burden or restrict U.S. commerce. One of Section 301\u2019s main uses has been to obtain more effective protection worldwide for U.S. intellectual property.

Here, Congress has expressed its clear intent that intellectual property issues warrant unique coverage. Special 301 requires USTR to identify countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights or that deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons relying on intellectual property protection.

The intellectual property rights covered by the agreement are copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, integrated circuits (semiconductor chips), and geographical indications.

Since most IPR areas would be covered by GATT, the unilateral use of the Section 301 and Special 301 process may be restricted.

According to the GSP Director, the critical policy question for USTR would be when petitioners not willing to go through dispute settlement would want to bring their cases instead to GSP, which is a unilateral program outside GATT commitments. USTR would have to make a difficult policy decision of determining which IPR cases to accept under GSP. It would have to establish whether or not cases involving areas covered by TRIPs should be encouraged to go to dispute settlement instead.", "Indeed, IPR industries are beginning to take the position that Section 301 and Special 301 still could be used for TRIPs-covered areas if the sanction employed is in an area not covered by GATT, such as GSP. An IIPA official agreed that the GSP IPR provision would be more important to IPR industries if TRIPs is enacted. He said that as more areas would be bound under GATT\u2019s new World Trade Organization and IPR coverage would be brought under GATT, the United States\u2019 unilateral use of Section 301 would be limited. Fewer areas outside of GATT would be available for the imposition of unilateral sanctions. Therefore, GSP is very useful because it is outside GATT. According to this official, GSP would be even more important because developing countries would have a 5-year transition period under the Uruguay Round GATT agreement before they would have to be in full compliance (except for pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals, where they would have 10 years). IIPA is very concerned that a number of BDCs were on the verge of taking action to protect intellectual property under bilateral commitments they had made.

Finally, the section 599 provisions restricting U.S. foreign assistance programs (primarily for the Agency for International Development) will likely have little impact on worker rights practices in Caribbean Basin countries. The result is that the worker rights provision of the GSP Program is the primary worker rights legislation available to advocacy groups, and action under GSP also triggers actions under most of the worker rights provisions in U.S. trade law.

Fundamental differences in GSP and Special 301 petitions are reflected in the disparities in the functions of their hearings. Acceptance of a GSP petition for full review is a serious indication that there is an IPR problem. The GSP Subcommittee\u2019s investigation establishes the extent of the problem, and negotiations are then undertaken to try to reach a resolution so that the BDC is not suspended, according to GSP officials. Public hearings are held immediately so that all sides to the issue can establish their positions and present evidence. Then at the conclusion of the annual review process, the President may (1) find that the BDC has met the standards of the law or has taken actions to meet the standard and concludes the review, (2) hold the case over to allow time to take actions, or (3) suspend the BDC from GSP benefits.", "In contrast, under Special 301, acceptance by USTR of a petition is tantamount to an indictment. The Special 301 process is designed to work in the following way: Countries are placed on the watch list or the priority watch list as a warning that matters are increasingly serious on IPR issues. When a country is designated a \u201cpriority foreign country\u201d under Special 301, triggering a Section 301 investigation, there is no question of the seriousness of the matter and of its potential impact on bilateral relations. No hearings are held upon initiation of a Special 301 investigation because USTR immediately enters into consultations with the foreign government on the IPR issue. All parties are fully informed. Under Special 301, a hearing is only held if requested at the end of the investigation if the dispute cannot be resolved and USTR determines that it will take retaliatory measures. The purpose of the hearing is to allow affected parties to express their views on the impact of the proposed sanctions and the potential level of their losses, especially where another product sector is affected.", "Should the IIPA proposal be implemented, the likely result would be that GSP IPR reviews would be directly linked to Special 301. Currently, there is an indirect linkage, since there has been a Special 301 case that sanctioned a country by reducing GSP benefits.

In addition, there is certainly adequate precedent provided by past acceptance by the GSP Subcommittee of emergency product petitions. For example, in 1991 a petition on Malaysian vulcanized rubber thread exports was accepted for expedited consideration as an emergency petition.

The GSP Subcommittee has developed its own internal guidelines, which are used on a case-by-case basis but have not been made public. A public explanation of these guidelines would help petitioners in preparing better petitions and, in turn, would promote more efficient administration of the program. The regulations do have a standard requiring that resubmitted petitions contain new information. However, as currently administered, this standard has prevented further review of worker rights cases in which a BDC\u2019s promised progress has stopped after the GSP review was concluded. Although the GSP Director said that the GSP Subcommittee is interpreting the new information standard more broadly in accepting petitions for a second review, this change did not extend to the types of cases raised here.

In response to our recommendation that it revise the \u201cnew information\u201d standard to allow acceptance of petitions demonstrating a lack of promised progress, USTR said that its standard already allows for such an action.

Its reasons were that (1) it is very difficult to show that a domestic interest is so seriously affected by a country practice that an emergency review is warranted and (2) country practice determinations are the result of careful review of a great volume of information and deliberation that are not consistent with the notion of \u201cemergency\u201d circumstances.", "We do not agree with USTR\u2019s strong reluctance to accept country practice petitions on an emergency basis. First, there is no requirement in either the IPR or worker rights provisions in the GSP statute that direct and serious harm to U.S. interests be demonstrated. The focus of these provisions is entirely on whether the BDC in question is adequately meeting, or taking steps to meet, certain international standards. Thus, using such a test for acceptance of emergency petitions is not required.", "Second, while it may be true that it can be difficult to show direct and serious harm to a domestic interest in worker rights cases, this may not be the case in IPR petitions. If, for instance, a major regional video or software pirating center is set up, the copyright holders may suffer serious losses in that market. Should the U.S. industry provide solid evidence of such piracy, then there would be reason to initiate a review of whether the BDC is providing \u201cadequate and effective\u201d IPR protection, as required by the GSP statute.

USTR also pointed out, as discussed in our report, that the GSP Subcommittee has said that it now more clearly explains its rationale and expectations in finding a BDC to be \u201ctaking steps,\u201d potentially making it easier for petitioners to justify the lack of expected progress as \u201cnew information.\u201d While acknowledging that there can be disagreement about what constitutes \u201csubstantial new information\u201d in any particular case, USTR said that the real issue is one of ascertaining the facts and determining their significance in relation to a previous finding of \u201ctaking steps.\u201d", "In response to USTR\u2019s comments, we have revised our recommendation to clarify that the \u201cnew information\u201d standard already allows acceptance of petitions demonstrating a lack of promised progress.

The concept of making progress to meet international standards is at the heart of GSP country practice provisions; it is especially critical for worker rights, given the \u201ctaking steps\u201d language in the statute.

Most GSP benefits go to the relatively small number of more advanced or larger developing countries that can better meet U.S. market demands.

At the same time, the exclusions built into the program provide U.S. industries with extensive protection against undue harm.

The tariff reductions negotiated in the Uruguay Round, if enacted, would reduce the value of GSP benefits by an estimated 40 percent. In addition, several major BDCs have been graduated, substantially reducing the level of imports under the program. However, the Uruguay Round agreement may provide potentially meaningful growth in GSP product coverage of textile and apparel articles. If the Uruguay Round results are enacted and the Multifiber Arrangement is phased out over 10 years, textile and apparel articles legislatively excluded from the program due to their MFA status may be considered for GSP eligibility.", "The United States has made GSP benefits conditional on compliance with certain trade-related or nontrade country practice conditions. The IPR and worker rights provisions are the most contentious of the existing eligibility conditions, but provisions targeting new issues such as environmental protection are also being proposed for consideration during program reauthorization. Many government officials and trade experts believed that the ability of the GSP Program to provide leverage to pursue additional objectives, however, is modest and would decrease as its benefits are reduced. Adding new provisions would further reduce the leverage to achieve the objectives of existing provisions. Furthermore, if too many conditions are imposed, beneficiary countries may feel the compliance burden is too great and give up all benefits, thereby eliminating the existing leverage in the program.", "A key consideration for Congress in deciding whether to reauthorize GSP is the leverage created by the program and the purposes for which that limited leverage should be used."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
