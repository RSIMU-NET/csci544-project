GAO's analysis found that the percentage of total real property assets with a reported utilization rate in OSD's Real Property Assets Database increased from 46 to 53 percent over the past 4 fiscal years. OSD made some improvements in addressing inaccuracies in the utilization rates in its real property records, such as correcting records for those facilities reported with a utilization rate greater than 100 percent. The military departments use databases to a certain degree to identify opportunities to consolidate facilities, but primarily only in response to specific events, such as requests for space. Officials at all 11 installations GAO visited stated that inaccurate and incomplete data in the departments' databases limited opportunities to identify these opportunities. In September 2011, GAO recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) develop and implement a methodology for calculating and recording utilization data, and modify processes to update and verify the accuracy of reported data. OSD partially concurred because it stated that it had some actions already underway to address the recommendation. However, at that time, OSD did not specify what actions it had undertaken. Moreover, the recommendation has not yet been fully implemented. Fully implementing GAO's recommendation would help provide reasonable assurance that the utilization data are complete and accurate and better position the department to use the databases to identify consolidation opportunities.", "OSD does not have a strategic plan, with goals and metrics, to manage DOD's real property efficiently and facilitate identifying opportunities for consolidating unutilized or underutilized facilities. According to a DOD directive, it is DOD policy that DOD real property shall be managed to promote the most efficient and economic use of DOD real property assets, and in the most economical manner consistent with defense requirements. However, OSD officials stated that there is currently no OSD strategic plan to manage DOD's real property nor established department-wide goals, strategies to achieve the goals, or metrics to gauge progress for how it intends to manage its real property in the most efficient manner. Such goals could focus on correcting inaccurate and incomplete facility utilization data to provide better visibility on the status of facilities and to identify opportunities for consolidating unutilized or underutilized facilities and reducing operations and maintenance costs. GAO's prior work has shown that organizations need sound strategic planning to identify and achieve long-range goals and objectives.

For example, we found that DOD had not defined the strategies and  measures it intended to employ to eliminate excess facilities on its  installations. We concluded that, to the extent that DOD has identified  unutilized and underutilized facilities, additional cost savings might be  realized through the consolidation or disposal of such real property  inventory.

In  September 2011, we recommended that DOD develop and implement a  methodology for calculating and recording utilization data for all types of  facilities, and modify processes to update and verify the accuracy of  reported utilization data to reflect a facility\u2019s true status. As previously  discussed, DOD partially concurred with the recommendation and stated  that it recognized the need for further improvements in the collection and  reporting of utilization data across the department. Further, DOD stated at  the time that it had already begun some efforts to improve utilization data,  but it did not specify what actions it had completed to date or the time  frames for completing efforts to improve collection and reporting of  utilization data. Fully implementing our September 2011 recommendation  would help provide reasonable assurance that the utilization data are  complete and accurate, which could also help better position the military  services to identify consolidation opportunities and realize the potential  attendant cost avoidance from no longer maintaining and operating more  facility space than needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OSD Does Not Have a Strategic Plan to Manage DOD\u2019s Real Property Efficiently and Facilitate the Identification of Opportunities for Consolidating Unutilized or Underutilized Facilities", "paragraphs": ["OSD does not have a strategic plan to manage DOD\u2019s real property  efficiently and facilitate the department in identifying opportunities for  consolidating unutilized or underutilized facilities. According to DOD  Directive 4165.06, it is DOD policy that DOD real property shall be  managed to promote the most efficient and economic use of DOD real  property assets and in the most economical manner, consistent with  defense requirements. In addition, our prior work has shown that  organizations need sound strategic management planning in order to  identify and achieve long-range goals and objectives. Our prior work also  identified critical elements that should be incorporated into strategic plans  to establish a comprehensive, results-oriented management framework. A  results-oriented management framework approach includes a strategic  plan with, among other things, long-term goals, and strategies to achieve  the goals, and metrics or performance measures to gauge progress of the  implementation to meet the goals.", "While OSD has established a directive and a number of instructions for  the management of real property, including for the maintenance of data  elements about their facilities, OSD has not developed a strategic plan  nor established department-wide goals, strategies to achieve the goals, or  metrics to gauge progress for how it intends to manage its real property in  the most economical and efficient manner. Two critical elements of a  strategic plan are the establishment of long-term goals and a description  of strategies to achieve those goals. Such goals could be focused on  correcting inaccurate and incomplete facility utilization-rate data in OSD\u2019s  Real Property Assets Database to provide better visibility on the status of  the utilized, unutilized, and underutilized facilities. Another goal could be  to identify opportunities for consolidating unutilized or underutilized  facilities in order to effectively and efficiently use facilities as well as to  reduce operation and maintenance costs in a time of declining defense  budgets. Further, OSD has not established department-wide metrics for  assessing progress related to real property management. Such metrics  could be used to gauge progress in the efficient utilization of DOD\u2019s  current real property inventory. For example, a metric could be  established for the military departments to complete a 100 percent  inventory of all their real property at their respective installations within a  specific time frame in order to baseline the number of utilized, unutilized,  and underutilized facilities, which could help them to identify consolidation  opportunities. OSD officials acknowledged that there is currently no OSD  strategic plan that clearly establishes long-term goals, strategies to  achieve the goals, and the use of metrics to gauge progress to manage  DOD\u2019s real property, because DOD has focused on other priorities.  However, real property management is a long-standing issue and DOD\u2019s  real property assets represent significant resources, as well as the  opportunity for cost savings through the consolidation or disposal of  unutilized or underutilized inventory. Without a strategic plan that includes  long-term goals, strategies to achieve the goals, and metrics to gauge  progress, it will be difficult for OSD to effectively manage its facilities, and  it may be missing opportunities to identify additional consolidation  opportunities, and therefore may not be utilizing its facilities to their  utmost extent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["OSD has made some progress in improving the completeness and  accuracy of its facility utilization data in its Real Property Assets  Database.

Further, OSD\u2019s lack of a strategic plan to facilitate the  department\u2019s management of its real property puts OSD and the military  departments at risk for missing consolidation opportunities.

We selected the same data fields we  had used as part of our methodology and analysis for our September  2011 report. Specifically, we analyzed the utilization-rate data fields for  fiscal years 2010 through 2013\u2014the most recent full year available at the  time of this review\u2014to determine whether more complete utilization-rate  data had been entered since our previous review of the fiscal year 2010  data. We assessed the reliability of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  real property inventory data by (1) performing electronic testing for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) reviewing existing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and (3)  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to assess the trends of  the utilization data reported in OSD\u2019s Real Property Assets Database for  fiscal years 2010 through 2013. We also reviewed our prior work on  excess and underutilized real property to understand issues previously  identified with real property management. We gathered and analyzed  documentation, such as a DOD directive and instructions as well as  military department regulations, reflecting OSD\u2019s and the military  departments\u2019 management of real property and how OSD used the data  contained in its Real Property Assets Database to identify unutilized or  underutilized facilities or potential consolidation opportunities. We  interviewed officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Installations & Environment; each of the three military departments, which  include the four military services; and the military service installations we  visited, and discussed their processes to manage real property. We  selected 11 active military installations to visit to include installations from  the four services and to reflect those with high numbers of buildings.While the results of our interviews and visits cannot be generalized to all  installations, they provided perspectives on how installations manage  their real property. Using OSD\u2019s Real Property Assets Database and the  following data fields\u2014the utilization rate, the status as \u201cactive,\u201d and the  property description as \u201cbuilding,\u201d we used a fourth data field, which  described the asset as \u201cutilized,\u201d to determine any inconsistencies that  might exist between these data fields. Using these four criteria, we  reviewed the real property records for the 11 installations we visited to  identify the extent to which other consolidation opportunities, if any, may  exist on the installations and potential inconsistencies and inaccuracies.  We contacted and received information from DOD representatives, as  delineated in table 6.", "To determine the extent to which OSD has a strategic plan to manage  DOD\u2019s real property efficiently and to facilitate the identification of  unutilized and underutilized facilities, we obtained and analyzed  documentation, such as the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Installations and Environment report, 2013 Accomplishments  and 2014 Goals and Objectives, a DOD directive and instructions, and  military department regulations for the management of real property.
