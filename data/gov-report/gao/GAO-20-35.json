Some rural areas report provider  shortages with ongoing, long-term vacancies.", "To respond to these provider shortages and hiring and retaining  challenges, VHA has implemented new initiatives and practices to  increase the supply of rural health professionals. A VHA official noted that  these efforts include rural health training and education initiatives to  provide rural health experience to health professions trainees, including  those who provide SUD services. The agency also plans to use expanded  recruitment tools, like greater access to an education debt reduction  program, improved flexibility for bonuses for recruitment, relocation, and  retention, as well as piloting a scholarship program authorized under the  VA MISSION Act of 2018 to hire mental health professionals.

The official added that the provision of  SUD services using telehealth can be supported by medical personnel  located at the closest VA facility to complete necessary tests, such as  urine screening, when the service is provided at a VHA location.", "VHA officials from one health care system we spoke with and literature  noted that providing medication-assisted treatment via telehealth  technologies requires a cultural change within the profession. Officials  from one VHA health care system we spoke with told us that delivering  medication-assisted treatment using technology is risky. For example,  buprenorphine is a controlled substance with a risk of misuse. This official  added that many providers may not be open to the idea of delivering this  level of treatment using telehealth. One study we reviewed confirmed that  acceptance within the profession appears to be the main barrier to the  successful implementation of telehealth services.

Veterans may lack access to transportation or are no longer able to drive  because of age, health status, or driving restrictions. Some rely on family,  friends or vans available through community service organizations;  however, they may have other difficulties like reaching pick-up locations  or the organization not having vans that are wheelchair-equipped.  Officials from all six VHA health care systems we selected noted the lack  of transportation as a barrier to accessing SUD services. Officials from  two rural locations of the six selected VHA health care systems  mentioned that volunteers, including a local veteran service organization,  assist with getting veterans from their homes to their appointments;  however, they added that these services operate on an abbreviated  schedule and veterans are sometimes subjected to riding in the vehicle  for long periods of time (2 hours each way).
