The SSI program provides cash benefits to aged, blind, and disabled individuals whose income and resources are below a certain level. In 1995, over 6 million SSI clients received nearly $25 billion in federal benefits and $3 billion in state benefits, while SSI administrative costs totaled over $1.7 billion.", "The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers the SSI program and is responsible for ensuring that only those who are eligible for SSI receive benefits and that payment amounts are correct. To fulfill these responsibilities, SSA needs the most accurate and timely information possible when making these decisions. SSA is currently testing the use of computer access to state-collected and state-maintained income information to determine whether this access can reduce administrative costs and payment errors. Such access consists of direct\u2014commonly referred to as on-line\u2014connections between SSA\u2019s computers and the databases maintained by state agencies.

We also analyzed SSI data on overpayments caused when SSA did not have adequate income information on applicants or recipients (hereafter referred to as clients).", "We did our work between July 1995 and July 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Claims representatives at SSA field offices are responsible for processing all applications and determining the amount of monthly SSI payments. SSI is a program based on need. The maximum monthly SSI benefit in 1996 was $470. Clients receive less than the maximum or become ineligible for the program altogether if their earned and unearned income and resources exceed certain thresholds. Monthly changes in the amount of non-SSI income that clients receive increase or decrease the amount of SSI benefits to which they are entitled. If clients do not report these income fluctuations promptly to SSA, an overpayment or underpayment will accrue.", "SSI clients are required to self-report any income that they receive to claims representatives when applying for SSI and are also required to self-report any changes in their monthly income by the 10th day of the following month. SSA policy requires that claims representatives verify this reported income, but does not require that claims representatives check for unreported income unless they suspect that clients are not reporting all their income during initial or subsequent eligibility determinations.", "SSA uses both financial eligibility reviews, known as redeterminations, and computer matching to identify and prevent overpayments. During redeterminations, clients report their income on mailed questionnaires or during face-to-face or telephone interviews. The method used to contact the client and the frequency of such contacts depend on the likelihood that a client\u2019s financial situation will change. Computer matches detect some types of income that clients have not reported. They consist of comparing the SSI payment records against client information contained in the payment files of other government agencies. In order to detect unreported income, the earnings and unemployment insurance (UI) benefits reported by SSI clients are compared or matched, for example, against earnings and UI information that employers report to state agencies. However, no computer matches are done that could identify unreported or underreported income from the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) and workers\u2019 compensation (WC) programs.", "In 1994, SSA began establishing on-line connections between its field offices and state agencies that had automated databases that could easily be linked to SSA\u2019s computer system. SSA did this so that information on earnings and AFDC and UI benefits contained in these databases could be automatically obtained as soon as claims representatives requested it. Claims representatives use such information for a variety of purposes, including verifying the amount of income that clients report when applying for SSI and during redeterminations of their continuing financial eligibility.", "On-line access began in a limited number of SSA field offices in Nashville, Tennessee, in July 1994. Currently, claims representatives at all 30 Tennessee field offices are able to access state data on earnings, UI, and AFDC for any client using the computers on their desks. In addition, at the time of this report, on-line access to WC information was also being negotiated in Tennessee. This access takes only a minute or two to retrieve the pertinent data. As of mid-1996, on-line access to state wage, UI, and AFDC data was also fully implemented in SSA field offices in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Kentucky, and partially implemented in SSA field offices in 2 other states. Initial contacts or negotiations for on-line access were also being conducted in 11 other states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On-Line Access Reduces Administrative Costs", "paragraphs": ["SSA estimates that in Tennessee, on-line access saves at least $6.50 in administrative costs every time a claims representative obtains data on-line, which occurs thousands of times each month. SSA further estimates that having such access results in clients receiving their first benefit check at least 1 week earlier. These improvements occur because in processing an initial claim and in conducting redeterminations, claims representatives no longer have to telephone, write, fax, or sometimes even visit state agencies to obtain necessary documentation\u2014they simply obtain the information on their computers.", "Claims representatives use on-line access for a variety of purposes, including verifying the amount of AFDC or other benefit income a client reports receiving. According to SSA, in one field office, SSA staff found that on-line access saves 30 to 45 minutes of a claim representative\u2019s time per claim. In another field office, a claims representative told us that she was able to obtain needed AFDC information on-line for a co-worker in a field office in another state who had been waiting for 6 weeks to get this information through conventional channels.", "Another way that claims representatives use on-line access is to follow up on computer-matching results indicating that clients may not have reported all their earnings or UI benefits. This entails contacting the recipient and often an employer or government agency to confirm the receipt of earnings or benefits. One claims representative told us, for example, that she uses on-line access to obtain more up-to-date addresses on the clients she is investigating and that without such information it has taken her up to 2 months to find correct addresses. Other claims representatives told us that they routinely check earnings on-line when investigating computer-matching results because the on-line access can provide more current earnings information and identify additional employers who are not listed on SSA\u2019s computer matches with their own earnings data or state data.", "A final way that claims representatives use on-line access is to obtain miscellaneous personal information, such as the Social Security numbers and birthdays of members of a client\u2019s household, as well as the types of public assistance household members receive. Because this type of information is frequently available on-line from the states, claims representatives no longer have to delay claims processing while clients search for this information.", "SSA believes that the benefits of on-line access have been sufficiently demonstrated in field offices in the six states where it has been fully or partially implemented to warrant expanding it to other states. These benefits, which we observed during our field office visits, include reducing the amount of time and paperwork required for income verification as well as the amount of time required for claims processing. At the time of our work, SSA was developing a long-range plan to expand on-line access nationwide, which included developing benchmarks to better measure the amount of time and money such access will save. SSA was also actively pursuing such expansion in field offices in at least 11 additional states.

Preventing overpayments saves program dollars for two reasons: overpayments would never be made and SSA would not have to spend additional money trying to recover them.

On-line access might have detected these overpayments sooner than they would otherwise have been detected, however, because such access allows SSA to verify the amount of these benefits as soon as the benefit amount is updated at the relevant state agency, which occurs once a month or more frequently.", "The primary ways SSA currently detects SSI overpayments are through client self-reporting; miscellaneous tips from third parties; or, in the case of the UI program only, computer matching. All three methods are limited: both self-reporting and third-party tips may not occur or may not be timely and computer matching, which is done only for UI, cannot detect overpayments until 6 months after they have begun.", "Many SSI overpayments were not discovered for periods ranging from several months to more than 1 year after they began. According to fiscal year 1993 and 1994 SSA nationwide data, it took on average 9 months to discover overpayments made to newly eligible clients that were caused by the receipt of AFDC, UI, WC, and other types of unearned income.

Because self-reporting can result in information on earnings that is even more up to date than what can be obtained on-line, some overpayments could be detected sooner through self-reporting than with on-line access. The problem, however, is that SSA cannot rely on clients to fully report all the income that they receive at or near the time that they receive it. In order to detect income that clients do not report, SSA conducts computer matches.", "The earliest that computer matching could detect an overpayment varies with the age of the data used in the match. For example, the earned-income computer matches rely on earnings data that are anywhere from 6 to 21 months old. Therefore, the earliest that detection could occur would be 6 to 21 months after the overpayment began.

Two SSA officials we spoke with mentioned that replacing the state computer matches with an automatic computerized interface that notified claims representatives when earnings information needed to be checked would result in more timely notification and would also free up SSA headquarters resources currently used to conduct the matches.", "SSA\u2019s state computer-matching program compares the earnings that SSI clients report with the earnings data that employers submit to the states. Employees at SSA headquarters prepare computer tapes of the SSI recipients in each state and mail them to the appropriate state employment departments. State employees compare these files against their own earnings databases, adding the names of any SSI recipients who received earnings over the previous 6 months, and mail the tapes back to SSA. At SSA headquarters, computers then compare the state earnings data against the earnings reported by SSI recipients and generate lists of recipients with unreported earnings. SSA headquarters then provides these lists to the appropriate field offices where claims representatives investigate the unreported earnings.", "With an automatic interface using the same telecommunication lines now connecting SSA field offices on-line with the states, this earnings comparison could be done without having SSA headquarters employees prepare computer tapes and issue lists to field offices.

They normally do not use on-line access to identify overpayments resulting either from state-administered benefits or from earnings. When asked why, they said it was because they did not believe that on-line access would prevent or more quickly detect a significant amount of overpayments. This is because claims representatives believe that they are normally able to tell from experience when a client is hiding income and, in such situations, they then try to uncover it. They further stated that SSA policy normally does not require that they check independent information sources to determine whether clients may be receiving various types of income that they have not reported, a process referred to as negative verification.

This same official further explained that the programming changes that must be made at SSA headquarters take about 15 to 30 minutes for each state whose data are being accessed.

The records we examined of Tennessee residents pertained to clients who were assessed for initial or continuing eligibility between September 1, 1994, and August 31, 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Christopher C.
