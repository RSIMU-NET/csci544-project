Consistent with TSARA, TSA amended its policies to notify Congress within 30 days of awarding contracts exceeding $30 million for the acquisition of security-related technology. According to agency officials, TSA has not made any such new acquisitions since the enactment of TSARA.", "Acquisition Baselines", "TSA policies require that it prepare an acquisition program baseline, risk management plan, and staffing requirements before acquiring security-related technology. Consistent with TSARA, TSA established policies to notify Congress within 30 days of making a finding of performance failures, schedule delays, or cost overruns constituting a breach against acquisition program baselines. TSA reported that it had not experienced breaches in any existing acquisitions (i.e., those in place prior to December 2014) since the enactment of TSARA.", "Managing Inventory", "TSA's policies and procedures address TSARA requirements for using existing units before procuring more equipment; tracking the location, use, and quantity of security-related equipment in inventory; and using just-in-time delivery to avoid warehousing equipment.", "Submitting Plans", "TSA submitted its Technology Investment Plan and Small Business Report to Congress as required by TSARA. The Technology Investment Plan addresses required elements such as identifying security gaps and security-related technology needs and processes. The Small Business Report includes an action plan for integrating the concerns of small businesses into acquisition processes and increasing outreach to targeted small businesses.", "DHS and TSA officials said that TSA has not yet identified any efficiencies, cost savings, or delays from its implementation of TSARA. They added that because many of the policies and procedures that meet the provisions of the act were in place prior to the enactment of TSARA, it was unlikely for TSARA to result in major efficiencies, cost savings, or delays. According to TSA officials, TSA has developed mechanisms to monitor various aspects of TSARA, such as tracking progress in implementing planned technology programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) is the federal agency with primary  responsibility for the prevention of and defense against terrorist and other  threats to the United States\u2019 transportation systems. To address such  threats, TSA spends billions of dollars to develop, acquire, use, and  maintain security-related technologies. According to TSA officials, from  fiscal years 2002 through August 2015, TSA has obligated approximately  $13.4 billion to support the planning, testing, procurement, deployment,  installation, and maintenance of security-related technologies. For  example, TSA officials stated that they obligated $10.9 billion and $2.5  billion respectively to the Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP)  and the Passenger Screening Program (PSP), including approximately  $164 million for the procurement and installation of Advanced Imaging  Technology (AIT) systems for the screening of passengers at airport  passenger security checkpoints. While TSA has obligated billions of  dollars on security-related technology, it has also faced several  acquisitions challenges. For example, in January 2012, we concluded  TSA did not fully follow DHS acquisition policies when acquiring AIT  systems, resulting in DHS approving deployment of the equipment  without full knowledge of TSA\u2019s revised technical specifications. Further,  in April 2012, we found that TSA\u2019s methods for developing life cycle cost  estimates for EBSP did not fully adhere to best practices for developing  these estimates. The DHS Office of Inspector General has also issued  several reports pertaining to TSA\u2019s challenges in managing security- related technology inventory.", "The Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act (TSARA), enacted in  December 2014, addresses acquisition of security-related technologies  by, among other things, specifying measures for TSA to implement that  align with identified best practices and improve transparency and  accountability. TSARA includes a number of requirements for TSA,  including developing and submitting a strategic 5-year technology  investment plan and other reports to Congress, adhering to various  acquisitions and inventory policies and procedures, meeting small  business contracting goals, and ensuring consistency with the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and departmental policies and directives.", "TSARA contains a provision for GAO to submit a report to Congress that  evaluates TSA\u2019s progress toward implementing TSARA and includes  efficiencies, cost savings, or delays that may have resulted from  implementation.

Pursuant to TSARA, however, GAO will report again on TSA\u2019s  implementation of TSARA in approximately three years. Thus, this report  examines TSA\u2019s actions taken toward addressing TSARA.", "To determine TSA\u2019s actions toward addressing the applicable  requirements of TSARA, we examined TSA documents and guidance and  conducted interviews regarding acquisition justifications, establishing  baseline requirements, and inventory utilization. Specifically, we  compared TSA policies and procedures, TSA\u2019s TSARA Implementation  Strategy Memorandum, and supporting documentation to applicable  requirements in TSARA. We interviewed DHS and TSA officials with  responsibilities in each area to gain insights on the extent to which TSA\u2019s  development of policies and procedures were consistent with the act. To  determine the extent to which the strategic 5-year technology investment  plan and report to Congress on small business contracting goals  addressed each element specified in TSARA, we conducted an analysis  using two analysts to independently review the plan and a third analyst to  adjudicate differences. We interviewed agency officials to clarify  information and provide insights into the policies and procedures they  used to develop these plans. We also interviewed DHS and TSA officials  to determine whether they reported any cost savings, efficiencies, or  delays in program areas based on TSARA\u2019s implementation. To  determine whether TSA is able to ensure it executes its responsibilities  under TSARA in a manner consistent with and not duplicative of the FAR  and departmental policies and directives, we reviewed TSA\u2019s TSARA  Implementation Strategy Memorandum and supporting documentation,  examined DHS and TSA acquisition policy and guidance, and interviewed  DHS and TSA acquisition officials to determine the policies and  procedures they used to determine whether TSA\u2019s acquisition policies  were consistent with the FAR and other acquisition policies.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to February 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

DHS\u2019s policies govern TSA\u2019s acquisition programs and are primarily set  forth in DHS Acquisition Management Directive 102-01 (AD 102). DHS  acquisition policy establishes that an acquisition decision authority shall  review the program through the acquisition life cycle phases. Under this  directive, an important aspect of an acquisition decision authority\u2019s review  and approval of acquisition programs is to ensure that key acquisition  documents are completed, including (1) a life cycle cost estimate, which  provides an exhaustive and structured accounting of all resources and  associated cost elements required to develop, produce, deploy, and  sustain a program, and (2) the acquisition program baseline, which  establishes a program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance parameters.  When an acquisition program exceeds cost, schedule, or performance  thresholds, it is considered to be in breach.", "TSA\u2019s acquisition policies, which supplement DHS policies, generally  designate roles and responsibilities and identify the procedures that TSA  is to use to implement the requirements in DHS policies. For example, a  TSA policy designates an official to ensure TSA\u2019s acquisition programs  comply with AD 102, including the review and approval of key acquisition  program management documents and determining required acquisition  documentation for TSA programs.

For acquisition justifications, TSARA provides that before TSA  implements any security-related technology acquisition the agency must,  in accordance with DHS policies and directives, conduct an analysis to  determine whether the acquisition is justified, or whether the benefits  exceed the cost of the acquisition. TSA\u2019s policies and procedures  address this requirement. One change resulting from TSARA is the  requirement that TSA notify Congress at least 30 days preceding contract  awards for new security-related technology acquisitions exceeding $30  million, which TSA addressed by developing new procedures.

Consistent with TSARA, TSA is  to provide 5-day notice for contract awards that exceed $30 million to  facilitate a rapid response if there is a known or suspected imminent  threat to transportation security. TSA officials stated they will continue to  provide 5-day notice for all individual task order awards or delivery order  awards exceeding $1 million or more based on policies in effect prior to  TSARA\u2019s enactment. According to TSA officials, TSA has not yet  awarded a contract for security-related technology in excess of $30  million since TSARA\u2019s enactment.

In addition, TSA officials have briefed acquisition program  staff about TSARA\u2019s breach notification requirement changes. Prior to  TSARA\u2019s enactment, TSA followed DHS\u2019s acquisition policies that defines  breaches against an acquisition program baseline as performance  failures, schedule delays, or cost overruns of up to 15 percent, and did  not mandate reporting breaches to congressional committees. As  required by TSARA, TSA established procedures to notify Congress  within 30 days of schedule delays, cost overruns, or performance failures  constituting a breach against acquisition program baselines.
