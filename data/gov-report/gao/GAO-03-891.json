Most maquiladoras are U.S. owned, and maquiladoras import most of their components from U.S. suppliers. Maquiladoras have also been an engine of growth for the U.S.-Mexico border. However, the recent decline of maquiladora operations has raised concerns about the impact on U.S. suppliers and on the economy of border communities.

By early 2002, employment in the maquiladora sector had contracted by 21 percent and production had contracted by about 30 percent. The decline was particularly severe for certain industries, such as electronics, and certain Mexican cities, such as Tijuana. The downturn was felt on the U.S. side of the border as well, as U.S. exports through U.S.-Mexico land border ports fell and U.S. employment in manufacturing and certain other trade related sectors declined. The cyclical downturn in the U.S. economy has been a principal factor in the decrease in maquiladora production and employment since 2000. Other factors include increased global competition, particularly from China, Central America, and the Caribbean; appreciation of the peso; changes in Mexico's tax regime for maquiladoras; and the loss of certain tariff benefits as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Maquiladoras face a challenging business environment, and recent difficulties have raised questions about their future viability. Maquiladoras involved in modern, complex manufacturing appear poised to meet the industry's challenges. Still, experts agree that additional fundamental reforms by Mexico are necessary to restore maquiladoras' competitiveness.

With  double-digit growth rates in output and employment until its peak in the  last quarter of 2000, maquiladora-based production has been one of the  engines of regional employment and income growth for the U.S.\u2013Mexico  border. However, over the past 2 years, the level of employment and  production in maquiladora operations has declined sharply. This decline  has led a number of observers to express concern about the future viability  of maquiladoras. Some observers in the United States are also concerned  that the decline of Mexico\u2019s maquiladoras could adversely affect U.S.  companies that supply these plants and could hurt the economy of border  communities.", "In response to your concern about the significance of these developments,  this report analyzes (1) the ways in which the communities along the U.S.- Mexico border are integrated and how maquiladoras have contributed to  U.S.-Mexico interdependence; (2) recent changes in maquiladora  production, employment, and cross-border trade; (3) factors that have  affected employment and production in the maquiladora sector; and (4)  factors that could affect the maquiladora industry\u2019s future viability.", "To address these objectives, we met with U.S. and Mexican government  officials in Washington, D.C., and Mexico City. We contacted business and  nonprofit sector representatives, academicians, and other experts on the  maquiladora industry in the United States and Mexico, and we reviewed  extensive documentation and academic research provided by these  sources. We obtained and analyzed official data on employment and trade  trends from both U.S. and Mexican government agencies. We also  conducted a series of semistructured interviews with 29 representatives of  business associations consisting of maquiladora-specific and principal  industry sector organizations at the local and national levels. We relied on  business associations because, as representatives of the maquiladoras, they  could comment on issues facing their members, such as increased  competition, and could explain the reasons for plant closures, changes in  employment levels, and other changes within the industry. We conducted  site visits in three major border \u201ctwin cities\u201d: San Diego, California\u2013Tijuana,  Baja California; El Paso, Texas\u2013Juarez, Chihuahua; and McAllen, Texas\u2013 Reynosa, Tamaulipas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Mexico\u2019s Maquiladora program has been a central feature of the U.S.- Mexico border. The U.S.-Mexico border stretches nearly 2,000 miles, from  the Pacific Ocean in California to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. Four U.S.  states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas) and six Mexican states  (Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Sonora, and  Tamaulipas) make up the border. Texas contains the longest section of the  U.S. border with Mexico, with several large and numerous small border  crossings across the Rio Grande. Compared with Texas, California\u2019s border  with Mexico is relatively short, but it includes San Diego\u2013Tijuana, the  single busiest U.S.-Mexico border crossing. Arizona\u2019s principal border  crossing with the Mexican state of Sonora at Nogales plays a significant  role in agricultural trade. The relatively small border crossings between  New Mexico and Mexico reflect the sparsely populated areas in that region  of the border. Figure 1 shows the U.S.-Mexico border, including all U.S. and  Mexican border states, some Mexican border cities with varying  concentrations of maquiladora plants, and some ports of entry on the U.S.  side of the border.", "During the 1990s, the population along the border experienced significant  growth. On the U.S. side, the population increased by 21 percent,  considerably more than the overall U.S. population, which grew by 13.2  percent. Some cities on the U.S. border experienced significant increases in  population, such as Yuma, Arizona, and McAllen, Texas\u2014respectively, the  third and fourth fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States.  Population on the Mexican side of the border increased even more rapidly,  growing by 32 percent between 1990 and 2000. The majority of the border\u2019s  residents live in communities along the border that are composed of twin  cities\u2014a city on each side of the border\u2014such as San Diego\u2013Tijuana and  El Paso\u2013Juarez. The San Diego\u2013Tijuana area alone has a combined  population of about 4 million, and the El Paso\u2013Juarez area has a population  of 1.9 million.", "The Maquiladora program was first established by the government of  Mexico in 1965 as part of the Border Industrialization Program (BIP) and  maquiladoras have been a driving force in the development of the U.S.- Mexico border region. Under the BIP, Mexico encouraged foreign  corporations to establish operations along the northern border to provide  employment opportunities for Mexican workers displaced after the  termination of a temporary cross-border work arrangement known as the  Bracero Program. Also known as \u201cin-bond\u201d plants, maquiladoras were  allowed to import temporarily, on a duty\u2013free basis, raw materials and  components for processing or assembly by Mexican labor and to re-export  the resulting products, primarily to the United States.", "The maquiladoras have undergone a dynamic evolution over the last four  decades. In the mid-1960s, maquiladoras consisted primarily of basic  assembly operations taking advantage of Mexico\u2019s low labor costs. By the  1980s, U.S. multinationals representing various industrial sectors  established maquiladora plants along the U.S.-Mexico border. Japanese and  European companies also established maquiladora plants in Mexico to  compete in the U.S. market. Since the 1980s, some firms moved from low- skilled assembly work to more advanced manufacturing operations.    Researchers from Mexico\u2019s Colegio de la Frontera and San Diego State  University note that the number of \u201ctechnical workers\u201d employed by  maquiladoras increased significantly from the early 1980s to the 1990s.  Some maquiladoras now employ workers in development and design as  well as manufacturing. For example, Delphi Automotive in Juarez, the  largest private employer among maquiladoras in Mexico, now has a  sophisticated research and development center that employs hundreds of  highly skilled workers and engineers.", "Over the years, as maquiladoras evolved and expanded, the term  maquiladora has come to be used loosely to refer to almost any subsidiary  plant of a foreign company involved in export from Mexico, particularly  those located along the U.S. border. However, the Maquiladora program  continues to be quite distinct from other efforts initiated by the Mexican  government to encourage exports. Firms must register with the  government of Mexico to be considered maquiladoras and, once registered,  are eligible for several key benefits, such as preferential tariffs on inputs  and machinery, and simplified Mexican customs procedures. In this report,  we define maquiladoras as those firms officially participating in Mexico\u2019s  Maquiladora program.", "In addition to the Maquiladora program, the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship  has also been influenced by other important developments such as NAFTA.  NAFTA was concluded between the United States, Mexico and Canada in  1992 and entered into force on January 1, 1994. This agreement provided,  among its other provisions, for the elimination of tariffs and other barriers  to U.S.-Mexico bilateral trade by 2008. It also required Mexico to change  certain provisions of the Maquiladora program, such as elimination of duty- free benefits for imports of components from non-NAFTA countries. U.S.- Mexico trade has expanded sharply since NAFTA\u2019s inception. Much of this  trade involves \u201cproduction sharing,\u201d whereby final goods are produced  with parts, labor, and manufacturing facilities from the United States and  Mexico. Because it enables firms to increase specialization, take advantage  of low labor costs in Mexico, and attain other efficiencies, production  sharing is a key benefit to U.S. companies under the Maquiladora program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maquiladoras Contribute to Integration along the Diverse U.S.-Mexico Border", "paragraphs": ["A variety of social and economic factors create strong linkages between  communities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, and maquiladoras  play a critical part in this interdependence. Residents in the twin cities  cross the border about one million times every day to work, shop, attend  classes, visit family, and participate in other activities. Maquiladoras have  increased trade between the United States and Mexico and have helped to  develop the economies of several border regions.

For example,  certain U.S. universities in border cities offer combined degrees or  exchange programs with their counterparts on the Mexican side. In some  schools, such as the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of  Texas\u2013Pan American, Mexican nationals cross the border regularly to  attend classes. Political interaction and cooperation between local  authorities of twin cities enhance integration. Cultural and family ties also  contribute significantly to integration at the border. The U.S. counties with  the highest concentration of Hispanics are located along the southwest  border, and by far most of the Hispanics in southern border states are of  Mexican descent.", "Trade and retail sales contribute to economic interdependence at the  border. Approximately $200 billion in trade went through the U.S.-Mexico  border in 2002. Much of U.S.-Mexico trade occurs between border states.  For example, 62 percent of U.S. exports to Mexico originated in Texas,  California, Arizona, and New Mexico; of this, 70 percent was destined for  Mexican border states. Research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  indicates that trade between the United States and Mexico has positive  effects on border communities, because U.S. border cities typically provide  a variety of services such as transportation and customs brokerage. Retail  sales to Mexican nationals also contribute significantly to the economies of  cities on the U.S. side of the border. According to one estimate, retailers in  Texas annually make an estimated $15 billion in sales to Mexican shoppers.  In McAllen, Texas, 35 percent, or about $700 million worth, of retail sales  are made to Mexican nationals. Residents from Tijuana make 1.5 million  trips per month into the San Diego area, mainly to shop. In El Paso, Juarez  residents account for more than 20 percent of retail sales. On the other  hand, because of the high cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States, a  growing number of U.S. residents regularly cross the border into Mexico to  purchase prescription drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maquiladoras Drive U.S.\u2013 Mexico Trade and Border Integration", "paragraphs": ["Maquiladoras import most inputs from the United States and export most  of what they produce back to the United States. Growth in U.S.\u2013Mexico  trade and economic interdependence at the border during the last decade  can be explained to a great degree by the participation of maquiladoras in  supplying a strong U.S. market during the 1990s. Mexican exports  increased by about 340 percent between 1993 and 2001, in large part  because maquiladora-related exports increased by over 400 percent during  this time, according to a report by the Mexican Commission on Northern  Border Affairs. By 2001, maquiladoras accounted for 41 percent of total  Mexican trade with all countries \u2013 34 percent of Mexico\u2019s imports and 48  percent of its exports (see fig. 2). Trade with the United States makes up a  significant share of maquiladora trade. In 2001, 79 percent of maquiladora  imports of components and parts for production were from the United  States and 98 percent of their exported products were destined for the U.S.  market. Maquiladora trade between the United States and Mexico totaled  about $121 billion in 2001, with maquiladora exports ($75 billion)  accounting for more than half of Mexico\u2019s total exports to the United  States. Border cities are typically seen as the primary beneficiaries of  growing U.S.-Mexico trade. However, states such as Florida, Tennessee,  and Ohio, which doubled their exports to Mexico during the second half of  1990s, have also benefited from growing U.S.-Mexico trade.", "Furthermore, maquiladoras are directly connected to U.S. companies  through ownership and production ties. The list of Mexico\u2019s top 100  maquiladora employers includes such U.S. firms as Delphi, RCA, Ford  Motor Company, Tyco, General Electric, General Instruments, Johnson &  Johnson, and ITT. All told, 79 percent of the top 100 maquiladora employers  are from the United States. Maquiladoras are important to the United States  because they are a strategic means by which U.S. companies stay  competitive in the global marketplace. By offering lower production costs,  maquiladoras enable U.S. companies to produce goods more cheaply in  Mexico than in the United States. In essence, maquiladoras and U.S.  companies are part of a greater production-sharing model, which is an  important part of overall North American production. Moreover, more than  26,000 U.S.-based companies, located mainly in the Midwest, supply  maquiladoras with raw materials and components.", "The Mexican border region has benefited in terms of job creation from the  dominant presence of maquiladoras on the Mexican side of the border.  Overall, 77 percent of all maquiladora establishments are located in the six  Mexican border states shown in figure 3. Also, about 83 percent of  maquiladora employment was located in border states. During most of the  1990s, maquiladoras represented more than half of the industrial activity in  the states of Chihuahua and Tamaulipas. During the same time period, the  maquiladoras represented nearly three quarters of industrial production in  the state of Baja California, which contained almost one third of Mexico\u2019s  maquiladora firms.", "Cities on the U.S. side of the border have benefited from the large flow of  trade created by maquiladoras. Between 1990 and 2002, more than half a  million jobs were added to the U.S. border region, including jobs in  services, retail trade, finance, and transportation, and after 1995,  employment growth in the U.S. border region exceeded the U.S. national  average (see app. I for details). The employment gains are particularly  notable, because the border region historically has had high rates of  unemployment.   Some studies have outlined the effect of overall border  economic trends on local border communities. For example, researchers  estimated that in one Texas border community, in 2001, services and  supplies purchased by maquiladoras amounted to $136 million and a total  of 32,577 jobs were sustained by maquiladoras and related manufacturing  activity.", "The same researchers estimated that 15 percent of maquiladora workers\u2019  salaries was spent in the region on goods and services. In one Arizona  border community, researchers surveyed maquiladora workers and found  that workers who crossed the border to shop made an average of 5.5 trips a  month and spent about $35 on each trip. Almost one third of retail sales in  the same Arizona community are attributed to Mexican nationals,  according to local sources.", "Despite their role in generating employment in Mexico, the maquiladoras\u2019  benefit to the country remains a subject of some debate. Some express  reservations about the maquiladoras\u2019 ability to generate economic  development for Mexico, since these plants have generally been unable to  establish a network of domestic inputs providers or create significant  linkages to the internal Mexican economy. In April 2002, for example, the  former Mexican Foreign Minister noted that without proactive Mexican  government policy to set up domestic suppliers, the benefits of the  maquiladora industry would never extend beyond the border. In addition,  critics in the environmental and labor movements on both sides of the  border also assail these plants. Some environmental groups claim that  maquiladoras are responsible for the growing pollution problem in the  border region. Similarly, some labor organizations criticize the  maquiladoras for the low wages paid to workers and for allegedly poor  working conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Has Distinct Regions with Varying Degrees of Integration", "paragraphs": ["Although communities along the U.S.-Mexico border share certain traits,  they are also quite distinct. The level of integration between cross-border  twin cities depends on location, population, economic profile, and cross- border political cooperation. We observed some of these differences during  fieldwork in three border areas: McAllen\u2013Reynosa, El Paso\u2013Ciudad Juarez,  and San Diego\u2013Tijuana.", "McAllen\u2013Reynosa. McAllen and Reynosa are economically interdependent.  Both are medium-size cities, McAllen with a population of about 569,000,  and Reynosa with about 420,000, and there are no other sizeable urban  areas nearby on either side of the border. Officials at the McAllen  Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) capitalized on the  interdependence between McAllen and Reynosa and incorporated it into  their economic strategy for the region starting in 1988. At that time,  McAllen had high unemployment and Reynosa\u2019s economy was based on  subsistence farming. Working with political leaders in McAllen and  Reynosa, MEDC developed a strategy based on promoting industrial  development in Reynosa, recognizing that if companies opened  maquiladoras there, McAllen would benefit by providing inputs and  offering management, engineering, warehousing, trucking, legal, and  accounting services. In the 14 years since its establishment, MEDC has  recruited 178 companies to the area, in diverse manufacturing sectors, such  as electronics, auto parts, and telecommunications.", "El Paso\u2013Ciudad Juarez. Although El Paso and Ciudad Juarez are also  closely integrated, such ties have developed differently than in McAllen\u2013 Reynosa. Ciudad Juarez is a larger metropolitan area, with a population of  1.2 million, and it is home to more maquiladora employees than any other  Mexican city. On the U.S. side, El Paso and the neighboring communities in  southern New Mexico are much smaller. El Paso\u2019s economy has been  shaped by economic activity in Ciudad Juarez, especially that of providing  services to maquiladoras. In addition, Juarez residents contribute to El  Paso\u2019s economy by purchasing items ranging from cars to clothing and  services such as financial and health services. In 2001, there were  approximately 46 million northbound crossings via the three international  bridges that connect the two cities. However, business leaders and other  observers whom we met in the El Paso\u2013Juarez area frequently noted that  integration and economic dependence between El Paso and Juarez  occurred spontaneously, rather than by design. The development of  maquiladoras on the Mexican side occurred much earlier than in Reynosa  and was largely attributed to individual efforts by entrepreneurs in Juarez  and El Paso that began in the 1960s, rather than to a collective vision.  However, in recent years, in Santa Teresa, a nearby border community in  southern New Mexico, developers created a strategic plan to build an  industrial park as a supplier base, with warehouse and distribution  facilities, to service maquiladoras. The Santa Teresa port of entry opened  11 years ago. Developers envisioned that this border crossing would serve  as an alternate point of entry to El Paso for cross border trade.", "San Diego\u2013Tijuana. The dynamics of integration between San Diego and  Tijuana are notably different from other cross-border twin cities. In this  area, economic dependence is more one-sided.   Unlike El Paso or McAllen,  San Diego is a large metropolitan area in its own right, with a population of  close to 3 million. Many of the major economic activities in San Diego,  including defense and space manufacturing, biosciences, and tourism, are  not directly connected to Tijuana. While Hispanics account for at least 50  percent of the population in most U.S. counties along the Southwest  border, they account for only about 27 percent of the population in San  Diego County, suggesting lower levels of family ties or connections to  Mexico. In contrast, Tijuana, with a population of about 1.2 million, is  heavily dependent on maquiladoras, and the city is closely tied to the U.S.  market. In addition to U.S. companies, Tijuana has also been the preferred  location for Japanese and Korean maquiladora investments, which have  made this area the world\u2019s leading producer of color televisions. More than  600 maquiladora plants, employing approximately 150,000 people are  located in Tijuana. Moreover people in Tijuana are more likely to cross the  border to shop or do business in San Diego than vice versa; in fact, it is  estimated that two out of three residents of San Diego have never been to  Tijuana. In contrast, Tijuana residents spend between 3 to 5 billion dollars  in purchases in the San Diego region, mostly in the communities adjacent  to the border. In addition, 7 percent of economically active people in  Tijuana work in San Diego, earning an estimated $650 million a year in  wages and salary income."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "After Rapid Growth, Maquiladoras and Border Region Experienced Declines Beginning in 2000", "paragraphs": ["Maquiladora production and employment grew rapidly throughout the  1990s but declined sharply after October 2000.

(App. I provides a detailed analysis of employment  trends in the U.S. border region.)", "Despite the contractions in manufacturing and certain other trade-related  sectors, other sectors in the U.S. border region grew. As a result, total  nonagriculture-related employment in the border area grew by 4 percent  even after the U.S. economic slowdown began in 2000 and national  employment contracted 1 percent through 2002. Some border metropolitan  areas maintained even stronger employment growth. For example, the  McAllen area grew by 9 percent between 2000 and 2002, while Laredo grew  by 6 percent, and San Diego and Las Cruces grew by 5 percent each over  the same period.

Although many government, academic, and industry sources  generally refer to the cyclical downturn in the U.S. economy as a principal  factor in the decrease in maquiladora employment and production since  the last quarter of 2000, there is no such agreement on the relative  importance of other factors associated with the decline of the  maquiladoras.

Of the 23 industry association representatives we interviewed  whose membership had experienced a decline in production or  employment, about three-quarters cited the recent downturn in the U.S.  economy as a major factor. As noted earlier in this report, maquiladora  production is often linked to U.S. manufacturing through production- sharing arrangements. In fact, about 98 percent of maquiladora production  is destined for the U.S. market. Thus, it is not surprising that the  maquiladoras are very sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. manufacturing and  demand. Our analysis of economic data supports the conclusion of experts  and interviewees, demonstrating that historically maquiladora employment  typically grows when the overall U.S. economy expands and is negatively  influenced when the U.S. economy slows down (see app. II for a discussion  of the effect of the economic downturn in the United States on employment  for various maquiladora industrial sectors). Moreover, maquiladora  employment has been even more sensitive to changes in U.S.  manufacturing production, particularly in sectors such as textiles and  autos, and a sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing has characterized the  present U.S. economic slowdown.", "As figure 10 illustrates, maquiladora employment shows a correlation with  U.S. economic performance over the past two decades. On average,  maquiladoras added almost 118,000 employees annually from 1995 to  2000. During this period, U.S. annual economic growth averaged 3.6  percent. However, in 2001, as U.S. economic growth slowed to 1.4 percent,  the maquiladoras lost nearly 229,000 jobs.", "Moreover, although the Mexican economy as a whole is very closely linked  to that of the United States, the maquiladoras appear to have been affected  by the U.S. economic slowdown more severely than the Mexican economy  overall. While Mexico\u2019s economy contracted .2 percent in 2001, it resumed  growth at .7 percent in 2002. However, the maquiladora sector declined  both years 9.2 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.

One maquiladora spokesman, for  example, suggested that China\u2019s entrance into the World Trade  Organization (WTO) has made that country a more attractive choice for  foreign direct investment, while foreign investment in Mexico\u2019s  maquiladoras has decreased.", "Among the major suppliers of imports to the United States, Mexico ranked  second and China third in 2002. As figure 11 illustrates, both Mexico and  China experienced significant growth in exports to the United States from  1995 to 2002.

As a result, the gap between  Mexico and China narrowed in China\u2019s favor.", "As appendix III details, Mexico recently lost market share in 47 out of 152  major U.S. import categories. At the same time, China gained U.S. market  share in 35 of those 47 import categories, including toys, furniture,  electrical household appliances, television and video equipment and parts,  and apparel and textiles. Some of these industries represent significant  sectors of maquiladora production.", "Recent International Trade Commission (ITC) staff research suggests that  while Mexico does face increased competition from China in the U.S.  market, some sectors are more threatened than others. According to the  ITC staff research, a growing share of some textiles and apparel products  sold in the United States are being produced in China rather than Mexico.  In contrast, this staff research notes that within the machinery sector, the  data did not indicate a shift in competitiveness away from Mexico towards  China. Mixed results are apparent in the electronic products sector. Mexico  lost U.S. market share to China in the telephone and telegraph equipment  segment in both 2001 and 2002, and Mexico\u2019s gain in the computer  hardware segment in 2001 was more than offset by a sharp loss to China in  2002.", "The ITC staff research noted above concludes that China has competitive  advantages over Mexico in terms of labor costs, electricity costs, and  diversity of component suppliers. In this context, it is worth noting that  wages along the U.S.-Mexico border, where the maquiladoras are  concentrated, tend to be higher than in other areas of Mexico. More  recent ITC staff research indicates that the cost of water for industrial uses  (important in the textiles industry) and corporate income tax rates are  lower in China. On the other hand, the ITC staff research suggests that  Mexico\u2019s comparative advantages include lower transportation costs,  shorter transit time, and lower international communication costs. Mexico  also provides greater protection for intellectual property, more  transparency in regulation and administration, and a network of free-trade  agreements with third countries.", "Several industry representatives noted that Mexico also faces increased  competition from countries in Central America or the Caribbean. One  industry spokesperson noted that the U.S. decision in May 2000 to grant  NAFTA-parity access to Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries had  eroded Mexico\u2019s ability to compete in the U.S. apparel market, particularly  because a number of Central American and Caribbean countries have  lower labor costs than Mexico. According to a Mexican economic research  group, manufacturing wages in Mexico are almost 67 percent higher than in  the Dominican Republic and about 92 percent higher than in Honduras.", "The heightened global competition from China and CBI countries is part of  a larger phenomenon in which the benefits enjoyed by maquiladoras and  other Mexican producers have eroded as U.S. trade preferences or  liberalization accorded to other countries have expanded. The recent  experience of the Mexican textiles and apparel industry, one of the major  maquiladora sectors, illustrates this point. In 1994, NAFTA gave Mexico  preferential access for its textiles and apparel. Other countries\u2019 exports to  the United States and Canada generally did not receive similar  advantages. U.S. imports of Mexican textile and apparel products grew  rapidly, with Mexico\u2019s share of total U.S. imports in this sector doubling  from 7 percent in 1994 to 14 percent in 2000 (see fig. 12). Mexico surpassed  both China and the Caribbean Basin countries to become the largest  supplier to the U.S. market. However, under the Trade and Development  Act of 2000, the United States allowed textile and apparel products from  Caribbean Basin countries that met certain requirements to receive  preferential access to the U.S. market. This legislation also stipulated that  to benefit from the special treatment, CBI-based apparel operations must  use U.S.-made inputs, and, according to a Mexican textile industry  association, operations have shifted from using Mexican textiles. In  addition, under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, all quotas on  textile and apparel products are being phased out by 2005. For some  products quotas have already been removed. Despite the recent U.S.  recession and a decline of total U.S. imports of textiles and apparel by 5  percent between 2000 and 2002, U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from  China rose 12 percent, making China again the largest foreign supplier to  the U.S. market.

Historically, growth periods in the  maquiladoras have been associated with devaluations of the peso. For  example, after the peso was devalued in 1984, there was a 3-year surge in  U.S. automotive industry investments in maquiladora plants. Similarly,  according to a study by the El Paso Branch of the Federal Bank of Dallas,  the peso devaluation in December 1994 played a key role in spurring the  expansion of Mexico\u2019s maquiladoras during the second half of the past  decade. However, beginning in the last quarter of 1998, the Mexican peso  consistently appreciated against the dollar in real terms, a trend that  continued while the maquiladoras experienced their greatest employment  decline, from the end of 2000 to the beginning of 2002 (see app. II for the  relative dependence of maquiladora employment on the real peso exchange  rate). As the peso appreciated in real terms, maquiladora operating  expenses increased.", "Moreover, this real appreciation of the Mexican peso took place as the  currencies of some of Mexico\u2019s East Asian competitors were depreciating  against the dollar. For example, figure 13 compares the performance of the  Chinese yuan to the Mexican peso, in real terms, between 1995 and 2002.

These groups noted that  such uncertainty had caused some firms to withdraw from, or downsize,  their operations in Mexico and had also discouraged new foreign direct  investment in Mexico. In particular, industry representatives said that  frequent changes to the fiscal regime had increased the tax burden and  administrative costs to maquiladoras. They were also concerned that the  frequent changes reduced the maquiladoras\u2019 ability to develop long-term  investment plans.", "In addition to the duty-free treatment on import of parts, components, and  other inputs, maquiladora plants enjoyed, at least until the mid-1990s, a  virtual freedom from taxation. Though legally subject to income taxes, in  practice, the companies paid only a small assets tax, a flat minimum of 2  percent of the value of the maquiladora\u2019s assets. Moreover, the  maquiladoras were permitted to use the cost of wages to offset their tax on  assets. This virtually eliminated taxes for some maquiladoras. According to  experts, the twin benefits of duty-free import and minimal taxation were  primary incentives for foreign firms to establish manufacturing operations  in Mexico.", "The tax regime applicable to maquiladoras remained constant for almost 30  years but began to evolve rapidly in the 1990s. The most significant of these  tax changes, the treatment of what are known as \u201cpermanent  establishments\u201d is frequently noted by industry groups and others as a  cause of investor uncertainty about the industry.", "A permanent establishment typically is a branch of a company from one  country that is doing business in another \u201chost\u201d country, and which may be  taxed in that host country. According to U.S. Treasury officials, permanent  establishment is a concept found in virtually all double taxation treaties.  Mexico adopted the permanent establishment concept as part of its income  tax law in 1981. According to U.S. Treasury officials and Mexican tax  experts GAO consulted, Mexico essentially exempted maquiladoras from  the tax that could be imposed on permanent establishments until 1998.  However, starting in 1998, Mexico began seeking to treat the foreign parent  companies of maquildoras as having permanent establishments in Mexico  for tax purposes. By treating the maquiladoras as permanent  establishments, the Mexican government could subject the foreign parent  companies to taxation, potentially allowing Mexico to increase the  revenues it collects from maquiladora operations.", "The right of the Mexican government to tax maquiladoras as permanent  establishments was affirmed in the U.S.-Mexico tax treaty of 1992.  However, U.S. companies with maquiladora operations in Mexico were  concerned that Mexico\u2019s application of permanent establishment to their  maquiladora operations would subject them to double taxation. This could  occur if Mexico imposed a broad definition of how permanent  establishments could be taxed that the U.S. Treasury would not accept,  because it would prevent the U.S. parent company from getting a full credit  in the United States from the taxes actually paid in Mexico. Resolution of  potential problems, such as double taxation, associated with the treatment  of maquiladoras as permanent establishments has necessitated a series of  additional bilateral agreements between the United States and Mexico. It  took several years and several different iterations to finally resolve such  practical problems, and this caused a prolonged period of uncertainty for  maquiladoras. Other changes in Mexico\u2019s tax regime have contributed to  the climate of investor uncertainty. In 2002, for example, Mexico limited the  ability of businesses, including maquiladoras, to take a tax credit on  salaries. According to industry representatives, this provision could have  significantly increased the tax burden on some maquiladoras.

When NAFTA was signed in 1993, it  envisioned fundamental changes to the maquiladora model. The most  significant of these changes was embodied in Article 303 of NAFTA, which  eliminated duty drawback (or refunds of duties) for inputs of non-NAFTA  origin as of January 1, 2001, if the final products incorporating these inputs  are to be subsequently exported to another NAFTA country. For various  reasons, notwithstanding the 7-year grace period provided, the  maquiladoras did not develop a network of domestic suppliers in Mexico.  As a result, implementation of Article 303 has adversely affected the  competitiveness of maquiladoras that rely on non-NAFTA suppliers for  inputs and resulted in closure of some maquiladora firms.", "According to officials with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,  some aspects of the Maquiladora program were not consistent with  NAFTA\u2019s trade objectives. For example, the duty drawback provisions of  the Maquiladora program were in conflict with NAFTA\u2019s rules of origin  requirements. Under NAFTA\u2019s rules of origin, goods traded among NAFTA  partners are allowed duty-free status only when the goods comprise a  minimum percentage of North American content. However, the  Maquiladora program provided duty drawbacks for inputs imported to  Mexico from any source, including non-NAFTA countries, undermining the  duty-free benefits that North American products were to receive in Mexico  as a result of NAFTA. Second, such drawback programs represented an  advantage for exporters versus firms involved in production for the  domestic market, since the latter would not receive an equivalent duty  drawback. In negotiating NAFTA, the United States hoped to reverse this  advantage, which led to the development in Mexico of an economic system  with separate production tracks for exports and for goods destined for  domestic consumption. In fact, U.S. officials explained that they envisioned  the gradual phasing-out of maquiladoras with the implementation of  NAFTA, as duty-free treatment would apply to all trade among NAFTA  member countries.", "The rationale behind Article 303 was to encourage firms to develop North  American suppliers for critical inputs by providing an incentive for  maquiladoras to shift sourcing of components or inputs to North America,  including Mexico. The development of a network of North American  suppliers would mean that more value would be added during the  production process in Mexico, the United States, and Canada.The  elimination of duty drawback would necessitate significant changes in the  sourcing of maquiladora inputs, particularly for maquiladora operations of  some Japanese and other Asian companies that were heavily dependent on  certain inputs from the Far East. The implementation of Article 303 was  therefore scheduled for January 1, 2001, 7 years after NAFTA\u2019s entry into  force, to allow the maquiladoras to relocate their supply chain to North  America. However, a network of Mexican domestic suppliers for the  maquiladoras largely failed to materialize during this period. Maquiladora  observers have suggested several explanations, principally the scarcity of  credit in Mexico to support entrepreneurial activity and the lack of an  entrepreneurial culture among Mexican businesses.", "Under NAFTA, Mexico could have chosen to counter the loss of duty  drawback following implementation of Article 303 by reducing or  eliminating its most favored nation duties on key inputs. U.S. officials note  that Canada eliminated hundreds of its most favored nation duties before  Article 303 took effect. Instead, in order to cushion the impact of NAFTA  Article 303, Mexico instituted a measure known as the sectoral promotion  program with targeted and reversible tariff reductions.", "Since Article 303 was implemented, maquiladoras that depend on inputs  from outside North America have seen their competitiveness erode. Some  maquiladoras have reported production cost increases of up to 20 percent  due to the implementation of Article 303.

Prior to the downturn, they said, maquiladoras in  some border cities reported very high employee turnover rates because the  rapid growth in maquiladora establishments allowed workers to  continuously find new jobs in other plants. One expert suggested that such  turnover in some border cities had reached 80 percent at the height of the  maquiladora boom. Consequently, employers had significant hiring and  training costs and were forced to keep some positions overstaffed to  compensate for the turnover. This could have more fundamental  implications for the ability of some maquiladoras to build a highly skilled  workforce, since it is not feasible to invest in significant training for  workers whose expected tenure with a firm is only a few months. Industry  sources told us that the turnover rates had dropped sharply since the  downturn, and some maquiladoras report that this has had a positive effect  on administrative costs as well as the cost of training new employees.", "Finally, industry sources stressed the importance of Mexican government  action for the development of a favorable business environment that can  respond quickly to changing market forces faced by maquiladoras. In  response to industry pressure, the Mexican government recently undertook  several measures in support of the maquiladoras, primarily aimed at easing  irritants.", "On May 12, 2003, the Mexican government issued a decree modifying  certain aspects of the Maquiladora program. The reforms are aimed  primarily at simplifying regulations that apply to companies that provide  support and logistic services to maquiladoras, and to enhance legal  certainty for Mexican exporters, including maquiladoras. An important  provision of the new decree will be streamlined customs requirements  for companies with several subsidiaries operating under the  Maquiladora program. This would allow such companies greater  flexibility in the transfer of finished or semi-finished products from one  subsidiary to another. The decree also contains provisions that would  reduce administrative costs and procedures. For example, a  maquiladoras will only have to submit a single report on an annual basis,  which can be submitted electronically. Based on initial industry  reaction, it is unclear whether the new decree will satisfy critics seeking  greater legal certainty and improved incentives for maquiladoras.", "In response to the recent crisis in the maquiladora industry, Mexico has  greatly expanded its sectoral promotion program (PROSEC).

National growth effect. The national growth effect is that part of a  regional change in total employment ascribed to the national growth  rate of total employment. It assumes that the region\u2019s employment  growth matches the overall national rate. The national growth  component is the change that would be expected given that the local  area is part of a changing national economy.", "Our analysis shows that from 1990 through 2002, the border counties  gained 339,100 jobs due to economic trends at the national level (see  table 2).

The border area\u2019s biggest employer, the service sector, had the  highest national growth component (97,300 jobs), followed by the  government (71,200 jobs), and retail trade sectors (65,900 jobs). Our  analysis incorporating possible differences among the border  subregions shows that from 1990 through 2002, nonfarm employment  growth in San Diego accounted for nearly 50 percent of the increase in  employment due to employment expansion at the national level.", "2.", "Industry-mix effect. An industry-mix effect is the amount of change  that a region would have experienced had each of its industries grown  at their industry national rates, less the national growth effect. This  component identifies the share of local job growth that can be  attributed to the region\u2019s mix of industries and seeks to address  whether employment growth in an area outpaced the nation owing to a  concentration of faster growing industries.", "For the period 1990 to 2002, the border area gained 21,200 jobs owing to  a concentration of faster growing sectors there than in the nation as a  whole. This gain in total employment was achieved primarily with  employment gains in the services (114,400 jobs) and construction and  mining (4,200 jobs), and it occurred despite employment losses totaling  95,200 jobs from other sectors, notably manufacturing (69,800 jobs),  government (10,500 jobs), and wholesale trade (8,500 jobs). Moreover,  47 percent of the employment growth due to the industry-mix effect  occurred between 2001 and 2002. In subregions, the industrial mix  component for all sectors decreased total nonfarm employment during  1990\u20132002 only in El Paso, Texas.  3. Local (competitive) effect. A local (competitive) effect seeks to isolate  the extent to which factors unique to the local area have caused growth  or decline in regional employment. The effect is defined as the  employment change that remains after the national and industrial mix  components have been accounted for, and it is therefore the purely  regional aspect of the region\u2019s employment growth. If a region\u2019s  competitive share is positive, the region is considered to have local  advantage in promoting employment growth. This advantage could  result from such factors as local businesses having superior technology,  management, location,  market access or the local labor force\u2019s having  higher productivity, lower wages, or both. A negative competitive share  component could be caused by local shortcomings in any or all of these  aspects.", "Local conditions appear to have been a significant factor in the increase  in U.S. border employment, particularly since 1995. Across all sectors,  the competitive share component\u2014employment growth attributable to  local conditions\u2014totals to a net addition of 230,000 jobs. This indicates  that the border area was competitive in securing additional  employment from 1990 through 2002.  As figure 15 shows, nearly all of  these employment gains were realized in the years since 1995.  Furthermore, 43 percent of border area employment gains owing to  local factors were achieved between 2001 and 2002. The top three  sectors in competitive share gains in employment from 1990 through  2002 were services (70,600 jobs), government (67,200 jobs), and  manufacturing (37,500 jobs). However, for the 2000\u20132002 period, the  transportation and public utilities sector showed a reduction in jobs  (approximately 300 jobs) owing to local factors. In addition, factors  unique to the local area caused employment declines in certain  subregions and sectors during 1990\u20132002, notably, in Laredo, Texas, in  construction and mining; El Paso, Texas, in wholesale trade and  services; Brownsville, Texas, in finance, insurance, and real estate;  Tucson, Arizona, in transportation and public utilities; and Las Cruces,  New Mexico, in government employment.  Furthermore, subregions in  Texas generally lost their local edge in securing manufacturing  employment from 1990 through 2002 and this loss was more  pronounced in 2001 and 2002. Similarly, owing to local factors from  2001 to 2002, Tucson, Las Cruces, and El Paso lost jobs in  transportation and public utilities; Tucson, El Paso, and Laredo lost  employment in wholesale trade; and El Paso lost service employment;  and Brownsville and Las Cruces lost employment in the finance, real  estate, and insurance sector."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Effect of U.S. Economic Conditions on Employment in Mexican Maquiladoras", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical analysis shows that the key factors cited in our  semistructured interviews as responsible for the maquiladora downturn\u2014 namely, the U.S. general economic slowdown, particularly in U.S.  manufacturing, and the real peso-dollar exchange rate\u2014are significant  determinants of maquiladora employment. We found a strong relationship  between maquiladora employment and U.S. economic conditions. This  relationship is stronger than that between maquiladora employment and  the real peso-dollar exchange rate, but considerably weaker than that  between maquiladora employment and changes in U.S. manufacturing  shipments. We also found that maquiladora sectors are more sensitive to  changes in U.S. manufacturing shipments than to broader U.S. economic  conditions.", "A major reason for the rapid growth of the maquiladora industry has been  its direct tie to the U.S. economy, particularly to U.S. manufacturing. As a  result, the maquiladoras are partly independent of Mexico\u2019s internal  economic trends. This independence from the Mexican economy has made  the industry a stabilizing force when the Mexican economy heads into  recession. However, the direct tie to U.S. manufacturing also makes the  industry predisposed to U.S. business cycles. As mentioned previously in  the main body of this report, the number of maquiladoras and the  employment they generate has declined from a peak reached in 2000. This  decline has been attributed to several factors. The most important of these  factors is the downturn in the U.S. economy. An additional factor that has  been alleged to contribute to the apparent decline has been cost increases  due to increases in the inflation adjusted value of the peso relative to the  dollar, i.e., the real exchange rate of the peso. This appendix investigates  the relationship  between maquiladora employment in Mexico and U.S. economic  performance and the real peso exchange rate.", "To determine the link between maquiladora employment and U.S.  economic conditions, we assembled data on maquiladora employment in  total and by main sectors as well as data on U.S. GDP on a quarterly basis  from January 1980 to December 2002. We then converted all of these data  to their natural logarithms and performed a regression of maquiladora  employment on the real peso-dollar exchange rate and the real U.S. GDP.  The results of the regression are presented in table 3. = \u03b1+\u03b2 lnY + \u03b3ln\u2126 + \u03b5  Where X is Maquiladora employment, Y is U.S. Gross Domestic Product, \u2126 is the exchange  rate of the dollar relative to the peso, and \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 are positive constants to be estimated. J  represents the maquiladora sectors and ln indicates natural logarithms.", "As table 3 shows, maquiladora employment is very sensitive to U.S.  economic growth and the exchange rate. Our results show that a 1 percent  rise (or fall) in U.S. GDP increases (decreases) total maquiladora  employment by 3.68 percent, while a 1 percent rise in the real peso  exchange rate decreases maquiladora employment by 0.17 percent.  Maquiladora employment is consequently more responsive to changes in  the U.S. economy than to changes in the real exchange rate of the peso. In  addition, maquiladora employment in the automotive sector is most  responsive to change in U.S. GDP, while maquiladora employment in  electrical apparatus and machinery is least responsive. The automotive  sector is also the most responsive to real exchange rate variations, while  the electrical materials sector is least responsive.", "To investigate the stability of our estimates, we divided our sample into  three separate time periods: 1980 to1985, 1986 to1993, and 1994 to 2002.  Respectively, these three periods correspond roughly to the periods before  and after the implementation of Mexican economic policy reform and after  the implementation of NAFTA. Our analysis of the effect of U.S. GDP and  the real peso-dollar exchange rate on total maquiladora employment during  these three periods is shown in table 4. As the table shows, the  responsiveness of maquiladora employment to U.S. economic conditions  and the real peso exchange rate is fairly consistent with our results in table  3. However, the strongest maquiladora employment responsiveness to U.S.  GDP growth occurred in the pre-NAFTA reform period (1986 to 1993). The  post-NAFTA period (1994 to 2002) has a lower response coefficient for GDP  and a higher response coefficient for exchange rates. It should be noted  that the peso depreciated considerably in December 1994, after the onset of  the \u201cpeso crisis.\u201d", "We also looked into whether the U.S. manufacturing sector has a unique  effect that cannot be captured by overall U.S. GDP.

The results of our analysis  appear in table 5.", "As can be seen from table 5, a 1 percent change in U.S. manufacturing  shipments induces an employment growth in maquiladoras of  approximately 6.7 percent. Overall, the table shows, the maquiladora  employment\u2019s response to changes in U.S. manufacturing shipments is  larger than its response to changes in U.S. GDP.

We  then converted all of these data to their natural logarithms and performed a  regression of maquiladora employment on U.S. real GDP, U.S.  manufacturing shipments and the real peso-dollar exchange rate. The  semistructured interviews were conducted in person and by telephone with  29 representatives of business associations, consisting of organizations  representing principal industrial sectors involved in maquiladora  operations, and maquiladora associations at the local and national level.", "Of these 29 organizations, 23 reported their members experienced a decline  in employment and/or production. We asked these 23 organizations to  discuss the major reasons for the maquiladoras\u2019 recent decline. We relied  on business associations to identify the factors affecting employment and  production in the maquiladora industry, because of the direct experiences  of their membership with plant closures, changes in employment levels,  and other company changes. We also relied on associations to comment  generally on issues facing the industry, such as increased competition, and  for information on overall industry trends. In selecting potential interview  participants from maquiladora and other business associations, to ensure  representation throughout the industry, we considered three criteria:  geographic location, industry sector, and country of origin or region of  representation.", "Of the 29 associations interviewed, 17 were maquiladora associations and  12 were industry-specific associations. The maquiladora associations were  primarily identified through the membership list for Mexico's National  Council of the Maquiladora Export Industry (Consejo Nacional de la  Industria Maquiladora de Exportaci\u00f3n -- CNIME) that has a membership  including 22 maquiladora associations located across Mexico. We  contacted all 22 members and the national association, and we completed  interviews with the national association and 14 local member associations.  We completed additional interviews with two maquiladora associations  that were not members of CNIME, but were included to broaden  representation of country of origin/region of representation (i.e., Japan and  the United States). Of the 12 industry-specific associations, we sought  interviews with associations representing major industrial sectors,  specifically targeting the electronics, automotive, and apparel sectors. Of  the 29 associations, Mexico, the United States, and Japan were the country  of origins/regions of representation included.", "We developed 14 questions for the semistructured interview guide, based  on previous research. Six questions were closed ended, and eight were  open ended. Participants\u2019 responses to the open-ended items were content- analyzed by two trained coders, and intercoder reliability values were  computed. Reliability values ranged from 58 percent to 100 percent. The  coding category scheme was modified until 100 percent agreement was  reached between the two coders. The results will not be generalizable  outside our sample; however, we believe we have included associations in a  way that is as balanced and inclusive as possible within the number of  interviews we were able to conduct.", "To identify the implications of recent developments in the maquiladora  industry for the border region and U.S.-Mexico trade (objective 4), we  analyzed documents and interviews citing factors that might influence the  recovery of maquiladora production. We also analyzed the debate about the  viability of the industry and some initiatives to identify and address its  recovery. The information on foreign laws in this report does not reflect  our independent legal analysis, but is based on interviews and secondary  sources.", "We performed our work from July 2002 through July 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those listed above, Joel Aldape, Bronwyn Bruton, Gezahegne  Bekele, Francisco Enriquez, Reid Lowe, Alison Martin, and Timothy  Wedding made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
