After media reports of problems with the care delivered to veterans in CLCs, VA contracted with the Long Term Care Institute, Inc. (LTCI), a nonprofit organization that surveys nursing homes, to conduct in-depth reviews of CLCs in 2007-2008 and again in 2010-2011. GAO was asked to evaluate VA's approach to managing veterans' quality of care and quality of life in CLCs. This report examines (1) VA's response to and resolution of LTCI-identified deficiencies and (2) information VA collects about the quality of care and quality of life in CLCs and how VA uses it to identify and manage risks. To do this work, GAO interviewed officials from VA headquarters, examined all 116 2007-2008 and 67 2010-2011 LTCI reviews, and analyzed 50 CLCs' corrective action plans for 2007-2008 and 23 such plans for 2010-2011."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["VA headquarters established a process for responding to deficiencies identified at CLCs during the 2007 and 2008 LTCI reviews. VA is using the process, which requires CLCs to submit corrective action plans addressing LTCI-identified deficiencies--such as how CLCs will address a lack of competent nursing staff and a failure to provide a sanitary and safe living environment--during the 2010 and 2011 LTCI reviews. On the basis of its analysis of the deficiencies identified in 2007 and 2008, VA headquarters also developed a national training and education initiative. VA headquarters officials told GAO that they plan to analyze the deficiencies identified during the 2010 and 2011 reviews and identify national areas for improvement. However, GAO found weaknesses in VA's process for responding to and resolving LTCI-identified deficiencies. First, VA headquarters does not maintain clear and complete documentation of the feedback it provides to CLCs regarding their corrective action plans. Second, VA headquarters does not require VA's networks, which oversee the operations of VA medical facilities, including CLCs, to report on the status of CLCs' implementation of corrective action plans or to verify CLCs' self-reported compliance with the requirements of the national training and education initiative. Because of these weaknesses, VA headquarters cannot provide reasonable assurance that LTCI-identified deficiencies are resolved. For example, without requiring networks to report on the status of CLCs' implementation of their corrective action plans, VA headquarters cannot determine whether CLCs' corrective action plans are fully implemented. Unaddressed, weaknesses in VA headquarters' process for responding to LTCI-identified deficiencies may compromise the quality of care and quality of life of veterans in CLCs. VA headquarters' current approach to identifying risks associated with the quality of care and quality of life of CLC residents does not comprehensively analyze information from all available sources, and for the sources VA does analyze, it does not compare findings across sources. VA's approach relies significantly on the analysis of findings from LTCI reviews of CLCs. However, in addition to LTCI reviews, VA headquarters obtains information about CLCs from a variety of other sources, such as VA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), but does not analyze the information from all these other sources. Further, for the sources it does analyze, VA headquarters evaluates each source in isolation and does not compare the findings from one source with findings from the other sources. Therefore, VA headquarters' current approach to identifying risks in CLCs may result in missed opportunities to detect patterns and trends in information about the quality of care and quality of life within a CLC or across many CLCs. For example, in comparing findings from VA's Office of the Medical Inspector, OIG, LTCI, and VA's quality indicator and quality measure data for one CLC, GAO found a pattern of deficiencies related to pain management. Without considering information from all available sources and comparing it across sources, VA headquarters cannot fully identify risks in CLCs, estimate the significance of the risks, or take actions to mitigate them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA document feedback to CLCs and require periodic status reports about corrective action plan implementation, and implement a process to comprehensively identify and manage risks to residents in CLCs by analyzing and comparing information about residents' quality of care and quality of life.

CLCs offer a range of services that include short-term postacute  rehabilitation for conditions such as a stroke; long-term care for veterans  who cannot be cared for at home because of severe and chronic physical  or mental limitations; and end-of-life care for terminal illnesses. More than  46,000 elderly and disabled veterans annually receive care in CLCs. This  vulnerable population relies on VA to ensure they receive quality care and  maintain their quality of life while residing in a CLC.", "In 2004, problems related to the care and conditions in one CLC surfaced  in the media, raising concerns about the effectiveness of VA\u2019s efforts to  manage the quality of care and quality of life in its CLCs. In response, VA  headquarters had in-depth unannounced reviews conducted at selected  CLCs between August 2004 and November 2006, and contracted with the  Long Term Care Institute, Inc. (LTCI), in March 2007 to conduct in-depth  reviews of 116 CLCs. LTCI conducted its reviews between June 2007  and September 2008. In late 2009, a series of newspaper articles  reported the details of deficiencies that LTCI had identified at another  CLC in September 2008. Specifically, the articles reported a lack of  competent skilled nursing in the CLC as well as failure to provide a  sanitary and safe living environment, promote and protect veterans\u2019 rights  to autonomy, and treat veterans with respect and dignity.", "Recognizing the value of the information obtained from the in-depth  reviews of CLCs, VA headquarters awarded a second contract in July  2010 to LTCI to begin reviewing all 132 CLCs in September 2010. In light  of this contract and the 2009 newspaper articles, you raised questions  about VA\u2019s process for responding to the deficiencies identified during the  LTCI reviews, as well as the agency\u2019s overall approach to managing the  quality of care and quality of life in its CLCs. These questions included  how VA headquarters uses available information regarding the quality of  care and quality of life in its CLCs, such as the deficiencies cited by LTCI,  to identify patterns and associated risks and take appropriate actions to  address those risks. This report examines (1) actions VA headquarters  has taken to respond to and resolve LTCI-identified deficiencies and   (2) what information VA headquarters collects regarding the quality of  care and quality of life in CLCs and the extent to which VA headquarters  uses the information to identify and manage risks.", "To examine actions VA headquarters has taken to respond to and resolve  deficiencies LTCI identified during its 2007 and 2008, and 2010 and 2011,  reviews of CLCs, we obtained and analyzed copies of the 116 LTCI  reviews performed during 2007 and 2008; VA headquarters\u2019 subsequent  analyses of those reviews; copies of 50 CLCs\u2019 corrective action plans and  related documentation from the 2007 and 2008 reviews; copies of the   67 LTCI reviews performed between September 1, 2010, and March 31,  2011; and copies of 23 CLCs\u2019 corrective action plans from the 2010 and  2011 reviews. We also reviewed relevant VA policy documents, including  Veterans Health Administration Directive 2009-43, Quality Management  System. We interviewed officials from VA headquarters offices involved in  responding to LTCI-identified deficiencies, including the Office of  Geriatrics and Extended Care and the Office of the Deputy Under  Secretary for Health for Operations and Management. In addition, we  reviewed Executive Career Field Plans of VA network directors and  interviewed officials from 2 of VA\u2019s 21 networks, which oversee the  operations of the various medical facilities within their assigned  geographic area. These two networks were the VA Mid-Atlantic Health  Care Network (Durham, North Carolina) and the VA Northwest Health  Network (Vancouver, Washington). To select the networks, we  considered the average number of deficiencies per CLC reviewed by  LTCI in 2007 and 2008. We assessed VA headquarters\u2019 response to the  identified deficiencies in the context of federal standards for internal  control for monitoring, control activities, and information and  communications. The internal control for monitoring refers to an agency\u2019s  ability to provide reasonable assurance that actions are taken in response  to the findings from reviews and the deficiencies identified are promptly  resolved, while the internal control for control activities refers to an  agency\u2019s ability to provide reasonable assurance that management\u2019s  directives are carried out, which includes appropriately documenting  transactions and internal controls.

The workgroup included representatives from  Geriatrics and Extended Care, the Office of Nursing Services, Nutrition   and Food Services, and the Infectious Diseases Program Office. A VA  headquarters official told us that the workgroup included the last three  offices because the majority of LTCI-identified deficiencies were related to  nursing, nutrition, and infection control issues. VA headquarters provided  the VA networks and CLCs with the national guidelines and checklists  and required CLCs to incorporate them into their training and education  policies. VA headquarters required CLCs to report whether they had met  the following four requirements for each of the eight clinical high-risk  categories: (1) establish CLC policies, (2) adopt procedures for  implementing the policies, (3) design an assessment to observe staff  proficiency in providing care matching the established procedure, and   (4) establish a plan for ongoing training and assessment of staff, including  new staff. In addition, CLCs were required to directly observe staff  providing care to CLC residents and report the percentage of staff that  had been observed as being proficient in the procedures necessary to  comply with CLCs\u2019 policies for each of the eight clinical high-risk  categories. If CLCs did not meet all four requirements for each category  or had observed less than 90 percent of their staff as proficient in  providing care in any one of the clinical high-risk categories, they were to  develop and submit corrective action plans to VA headquarters.  According to the documentation we reviewed, in most categories, the  majority of CLCs indicated that they had met the requirements of the  national training and education initiative. However, in every category  there were CLCs that did not meet these requirements and had to submit  a corrective action plan.

We found that VA  headquarters relied on self-reported information from CLCs regarding   (1) compliance with all four requirements for each of the eight clinical  high-risk categories and (2) the percentage of staff that were observed to  be proficient in treatments and procedures associated with the categories.  VA headquarters did not specify to its networks that they should verify the  accuracy of CLCs\u2019 self-reported information.

Without analyzing  information from all available sources and comparing the results, VA  headquarters\u2019 assessments of risks in CLCs are incomplete. According to  federal internal control standards, management should assess the risks  the agency may face from both external and internal sources. The  standards state that a risk management process includes   (1) comprehensively identifying risks associated with achieving an  agency\u2019s goals (for example, providing quality of care and quality of life in  CLCs); (2) estimating the significance of the risks; and (3) determining  actions to mitigate the risks, such as developing or clarifying policies or  targeting reviews of noncompliant CLCs.", "VA headquarters\u2019 current approach relies significantly on the analysis of  findings from LTCI reviews of CLCs. VA headquarters also relies on  analysis of the findings from The Joint Commission accreditation surveys  and the Artifacts of Culture Change tool. (See app. I for a detailed  description of these analyses.) While these three separate analyses  enable VA headquarters to identify trends in each source of information,  such as the most frequently cited deficiencies across all CLCs or the  average number of deficiencies per CLC, they do not provide a complete  assessment of the risks that would be identified by evaluating all nine  sources. Information VA headquarters receives about the quality of care  and the quality of life in CLCs from the remaining six sources\u2014OIG, OMI,  SOARS, quality measures and quality indicators, issue briefs, and  complaints\u2014could also be valuable in identifying patterns in CLC-related  findings. VA headquarters officials we interviewed said they do not  typically analyze information they receive about CLCs from these six  sources because they do not always believe that doing so would be  valuable for identifying trends and patterns regarding the quality of care  and quality of life in CLCs. For example, VA headquarters officials said  that they do not extract CLC-related findings from OIG Combined  Assessment Program reviews because the reviews typically do not  include enough CLC-related findings to warrant analysis. However, when  we analyzed findings from the 77 OIG Combined Assessment Program  reviews that were completed at VAMCs that have CLCs between   October 1, 2009, and June 20, 2011, we found that 49 of the reviews\u2014or  about 64 percent\u2014included at least one finding related to the quality of  care or quality of life in a CLC. Without analyzing information from all  available sources about the quality of care and quality of life in CLCs, VA  headquarters\u2019 assessments of risks in CLCs are incomplete.", "VA headquarters does not compare information across all sources to  identify patterns of findings for an individual CLC, CLCs within a network,  or all CLCs nationwide. Rather, VA headquarters analyzes the findings  from three sources separately to identify trends in the findings. However,  it does not compare the findings from one source to the findings from the  other sources. One source\u2019s findings, in isolation, may not present the  significance of certain risks, especially those that may suggest immediate  risks for residents within a given CLC or across all CLCs. However, if  related information that VA headquarters receives was compared across  different sources concurrently, VA headquarters officials would be better  positioned to recognize the risks to CLC residents.", "One example we identified of the benefit from considering the usefulness  of multiple information sources is in the area of pain management. In this  regard, we found that in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, VA headquarters\u2019  quality indicator and quality measure data showed that about 25 percent  of all long-stay CLC residents and 40 percent of all short-stay CLC  residents experienced moderate to severe pain. In June 2007, OMI  investigated allegations about the quality of care for a resident at one  CLC and found, among other things, that the CLC had failed to  adequately manage the resident\u2019s pain. Three months later, in September  2007, LTCI conducted a review of the same CLC and found that staff  were not performing assessments after administering pain medications to  determine whether the medication had been effective. In November 2009,  the OIG visited the same CLC as part of a Combined Assessment  Program review and found that staff had not documented pain medication  effectiveness within the required time frames nearly two-thirds of the time  that pain medications were administered. If VA had comprehensively  analyzed OMI information\u2014which it does not analyze\u2014along with LTCI  information that was available in 2007 and compared this information with  the information from the 2009 OIG review and quality indicator and quality  measure data, VA headquarters would have been better informed about  the significance of the risks and what actions might have helped to  mitigate the risks of pain medication management problems at this CLC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The 46,000 elderly and disabled veterans annually who are residents in  VA\u2019s CLCs depend on VA to provide them with quality care and maintain  their quality of life.

VA headquarters  officials told us that they intend to use the findings of the 2010 and 2011  LTCI reviews to determine whether deficiencies that were first identified  by LTCI 2 to 3 years earlier have been resolved. However, VA  headquarters cannot provide reasonable assurance of resolution of  deficiencies because it does not (1) clearly document the feedback that it  provides to CLCs about corrective action plans for LTCI-identified  deficiencies, (2) require VA networks to report on the status of CLCs\u2019  implementation of action plans, and (3) verify CLCs\u2019 self-reported  information about their implementation of the requirements of the national  training and education initiative.
