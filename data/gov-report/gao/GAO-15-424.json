The  types of unforeseen disaster costs states encountered depended, in large  part, on the kind of disaster, but were typically related to emergency  response activities. For instance, the costs of clearing debris and  repairing roads along with emergency policing were typical expenses that  states incurred after a major storm. Many of those expenses qualified for  federal reimbursement under a presidential disaster declaration.", "Statewide disaster accounts. Statewide disaster accounts provided  funding for disaster expenditures across state agencies or for localities.  As shown in figure 2, all 10 states in our review established one or more  types of statewide disaster accounts that received funds from general  fund appropriations or from other revenue sources. All 10 states funded  these statewide accounts through general fund revenues and 6 states\u2014 Alaska, California, Florida, Indiana, North Dakota, and Vermont\u2014used  other revenue sources in addition to general fund revenues to cover  unforeseen costs that arose during the fiscal year. For example, Florida  imposed an annual surcharge on homeowners\u2019 residential insurance  policies and on commercial and business owners\u2019 property insurance  policies, which the state then deposited into a trust fund to be used for  emergency management purposes. In addition, one of Indiana\u2019s  statewide disaster funds relied on public safety fees generated through  the sale of retail fireworks, while North Dakota funded its statewide  disaster account through a biennial appropriation from the revenues of  the state\u2019s share of oil and gas taxes.", "The states in our review based initial funding levels for statewide disaster  accounts on a range of considerations, such as estimates of disaster  costs based on past events and emergency response costs for  unforeseen disasters. Although some statewide disaster accounts allow  unexpended balances to be carried over into future fiscal years, states  typically budgeted these costs for a single budget cycle. For example,  based on its past disaster costs, Alaska typically budgeted disaster relief  funds to cover the costs of two state-declared disasters (totaling $2  million) and two federally-declared disasters (totaling $5 million to $6  million). Some states, such as North Dakota and California, may also  establish funding amounts in statute. Specifically, North Dakota\u2019s Disaster  Relief Fund receives an appropriation of $22 million every 2 fiscal years  or each biennial budget cycle, while California\u2019s Disaster Response- Emergency Operations Account receives an annual appropriation of $1  million at the beginning of each fiscal year, consistent with the state\u2019s  budget cycle.", "In establishing statewide disaster accounts, states typically defined the  criteria under which the account funds could be used. For example, in  Oklahoma, the governor is authorized to distribute funds from the state\u2019s  disaster account to agencies that requested funds for emergency  situations including: (1) destruction of public property; (2) operation of the  National Guard; (3) matching funds for federal disaster relief programs;  (4) asbestos removal from public buildings; and (5) emergency response  necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare of livestock or  wild animals.

For example, Florida\u2019s  Department of Environmental Protection established a disaster  contingency account funded through user fees on Florida\u2019s state parks. In  addition, the contingency fund for California\u2019s Department of Forestry and  Fire Protection typically received an appropriation based on the average  emergency cost from the previous five years.", "Supplemental appropriations. Eight of the 10 states in our review made  use of supplemental appropriations when the funds appropriated to  statewide accounts or agency budgets at the beginning of the fiscal year  were insufficient. When states\u2019 general funds served as the source of  supplemental appropriations, these funds were unavailable to spend on  other budget areas. Statewide multipurpose reserve accounts, such as  budget stabilization funds (also referred to as rainy day funds), could also  be tapped in the event that funds were not available through other means.  A few states expanded the conditions for which budget stabilization funds  could be tapped to include similar unanticipated expenses not directly  related to revenue shortfalls or budget deficits. For example, although  initially intended to offset revenue shortfalls, West Virginia\u2019s budget  stabilization fund was subsequently modified to allow the state legislature  to make appropriations from the fund for emergency revenue needs  caused by natural disasters, among other things. However, budget  officials from several states in our review told us that it was uncommon to  access budget stabilization funds to cover disaster expenses because  their state could generally provide disaster funding from a combination of  general fund revenues and spending reductions in other areas. For  example, despite having expanded its acceptable uses to include natural  disasters, West Virginia only accessed its budget stabilization fund once  since 2005 to cover disaster-related expenses. Similarly, in Florida, the  state\u2019s budget stabilization fund was last used for disaster costs during  the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons.", "Funding transfers.

While these moves  did not provide funding for future disasters beyond the current fiscal year,  they did improve the availability of funds for disaster response within the  current fiscal year. For example, Alaska established a statewide disaster  fund in the late 1960s to ensure the availability of disaster funding. Prior  to 2010, Alaska primarily funded the disaster fund through supplemental  appropriations after a disaster had occurred and after the state\u2019s  administration and emergency management agency had requested  funding. However, according to a state official, this approach did not  provide funding timely enough for state agencies and localities to respond  quickly to a disaster. Rather, the approach involved waiting for the state  legislature to appropriate funds to the state\u2019s disaster account, which  could have taken weeks, particularly if the legislature was not in session.  At that time, Alaska experienced multiple concurrent disasters. In  addition, the nature of Alaska\u2019s climate and the remote location of many  of its communities resulted in a need for the state to take swift action to  respond to disasters so that residents were able to repair or rebuild their  damaged homes before the onset of winter. Consequently, the state  began to forward fund the disaster fund to have more money available  immediately after a disaster. According to this state official, the change in  approach relied on cost estimates of multiple disasters to develop an  annual budget figure.", "In 2006, Indiana began appropriating funds to its State Disaster Relief  Fund from the revenues it generated from firework sales to ensure the  availability of a dedicated source of disaster funding. Although the state  established the disaster relief fund in 1999, it did not appropriate funds to  the account due to fiscal constraints. In 2006, the state began dedicating  funds from the sale of fireworks. Then in 2007, the state established in  statute that the fund would receive an annual appropriation of $500,000  from revenues generated from the firework sales. Prior to 2006, the  state relied on general revenue funds to pay for disasters on an as- needed basis.", "North Dakota established its Disaster Relief Fund during its biennial  legislative session (2009 to 2011) to ensure the availability of funding in  the event of a disaster.

In order to respond to  disasters prior to the establishment of this fund, state agencies with  emergency response missions, such as the Department of  Transportation, had to request funding directly from the state legislature  during the time it was in session.session, state agencies were required to obtain a loan from the Bank of  North Dakota to cover their immediate disaster costs. Then, to repay the  loan, the agencies needed to request a supplemental appropriation when  the state legislature reconvened.

After North Dakota established a dedicated revenue source to ensure the  availability of disaster funding, the state legislature took subsequent steps  to increase the oversight of disaster relief funds. In particular, the  legislature required state agencies to submit a request to the state\u2019s  Emergency Commission in order to receive disaster funding. Established  in 2011, the Emergency Commission, comprised of the Governor,  Secretary of State, and the House and Senate majority leaders, has the  authority to approve the appropriation of supplemental funding when  there is an imminent threat to the safety of individuals due to a natural  disaster or war crisis or an imminent financial loss to the state. Prior to  2011, the state\u2019s emergency management agency had been authorized to  access disaster relief funds directly without approval from the  Commission. According to a state emergency management official, the  legislature took this action in response to a number of instances in which  federal PA funds initially awarded to the state were deobligated, leaving  the state with unanticipated disaster response costs. In one instance, for  example, federal PA funds were deobligated because the state did not  properly document the pre-existing conditions of a parking lot damaged  by the National Guard in responding to a disaster. In this particular case,  the state had to appropriate funds from their disaster relief fund to cover  the cost of repair, rather than rely on federal PA funding to cover these  costs.", "To provide more oversight for disaster expenditures, the Missouri  legislature changed its requirements for accessing funds from the State  Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) budget.

In light of this federal approach to funding disaster  response and recovery, the states in our review designed their budgeting  approaches for disasters to cover the required state match for federal  disaster assistance as well as the costs they incur in the absence of a  federal declaration. For unforeseen disaster costs and for ongoing costs  associated with past disasters, these states relied on a number of budget  mechanisms including statewide disaster accounts, state agency budgets  and supplemental appropriations, to ensure the availability of funding for  disasters. However, none of the states in our review maintained reserves  dedicated solely for future disasters outside of the current fiscal year.  More frequent and costly disasters could prompt reconsideration of  approaches to dividing state and federal responsibilities for providing  disaster assistance. Given the fiscal challenges facing all levels of  government, policymakers could face increased pressure to consider  whether the current state and federal approach for providing disaster  assistance balances responsibilities appropriately. Absent federal policy  changes, the experience of the 10 states we reviewed suggests that  states will likely continue to rely on federal disaster assistance for most of  the costs associated with the response to large-scale disasters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security for review and comment.

To select the  states for our sample, we obtained data from the Federal Emergency  Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) Integrated Financial Management  Information System on major disaster declarations by state during fiscal  years 2004 through 2013. We focused on this time frame because it  contained the most current data for major disaster declarations. We  assessed the reliability of the FEMA data by discussing with another GAO  team their recent access and use of the data in a prior year\u2019s report and  their determination that the data provided reliable evidence to support  findings, conclusions, and recommendations. We also discussed data  quality control procedures with FEMA officials who were knowledgeable  about the specific types of data recorded in the database. Based on how  we intended to use the information, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of selecting states for our study.", "We sorted the data obtained based on the total number of major disaster  declarations approved by state. We calculated the median number of  major declarations approved by FEMA and identified states directly above  the median. For those states, we also identified the number of major  disaster declarations that had been denied by FEMA during the same  time period, which ranged from zero denials to seven denials. We then  calculated the statewide Public Assistance per capita amount of funding,  based on FEMA\u2019s statewide per capita indicator of $1.39 and the U.S.  Census Bureau\u2019s 2013 population estimate for each state. That is, we  multiplied the 2013 population estimate for each state by the PA per  capita indicator of $1.39. We then grouped the states according to low,  medium, and high per capita threshold levels. To ensure geographic  dispersion and a range of per capita amounts, we selected 10 states\u2014 four low per capita states (Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont, and West  Virginia), two medium per capita states (Missouri and Oklahoma), and  four high per capita states (California, Florida, Indiana, and New York)  (see table 1 for additional information). The results of our study are not  generalizable to state budgeting approaches for all states and the District  of Columbia.", "We then developed and administered a semistructured interview to state  budget officers and emergency management officials in the10 selected  states regarding the approaches they used to budget for and fund state- level disaster costs and how, if at all, approaches changed over time.", "To address the first objective, we analyzed information from the  semistructured interviews about selected states\u2019 approaches to budgeting  for disasters. We also obtained and analyzed state budget and other  relevant documents to determine how states estimate, authorize, and  appropriate state disaster funds, the extent to which states share costs  with affected localities, and how cost share arrangements with affected  localities are determined.", "To address the second objective, we analyzed information from the  semistructured interviews about how states\u2019 budgeting approaches have  changed during the past decade, factors influencing any changes, and  any challenges states face in funding disaster assistance. We focused  our questions on the period covering fiscal years 2004 through 2013. We  also analyzed FEMA data regarding major state disasters to identify  possible trends in the frequency, severity, type, and cost of state disaster  events during the period from fiscal years 2004 through 2013.", "For both objectives, we analyzed relevant state statutes and regulations  that govern the use of state disaster funds. In addition, we interviewed  FEMA officials who participate in making recommendations to the  President as to whether state requests for federal disaster funding should  be approved or denied.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 to March 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
