The  Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 aimed to improve the  organization and procedures of DOD for the acquisition of major weapon  systems, for example by revising the certifications that programs were  expected to complete before approval for system development start. The  new certifications included the need to conduct trade-offs among cost,  schedule, and performance objectives and for independent verification of  technology maturity. In 2010, DOD started its own acquisition reform  initiatives through \u201cBetter Buying Power.\u201d These reforms required DOD  programs to conduct analyses of program affordability and set cost  targets, among other things, which placed cost constraints on programs  and encouraged programs to find cost improvements during program  execution. These and other reforms championed sound management  practices, such as realistic cost estimating, increased use of prototyping,  and systems engineering. In 2016, we found that DOD was beginning to  decrease the amount of cost growth in its major defense acquisition  program portfolio.", "Despite DOD\u2019s improvements in cost control, however, members of  Congress remained concerned that the DOD acquisition process was  overly bureaucratic and too slow to deliver capability to the warfighter.  Congress enacted numerous additional acquisition-related provisions in  the National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2016 and  subsequent years that addressed the processes with which DOD and the  military departments acquire goods and services and encourage  innovation. These provisions addressed a wide range of acquisition  issues, such as the:  creation of new processes for oversight of major defense acquisition  programs; development of streamlined alternative acquisition paths; and  changes to DOD\u2019s other transaction authority, which allows DOD to  enter into agreements that generally do not follow a standard format  or include terms and conditions required in traditional mechanisms,  such as contracts or grants.", "Congress also required that DOD establish a panel in the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, referred to as the  \u201cSection 809 Panel,\u201d to identify ways to streamline and improve the  defense acquisition system.

While  DOD has made progress in implementing these reforms, continued  attention from top leadership would help ensure that the progress the  department has made is not unnecessarily slowed or halted. Middle-tier  acquisition will require careful consideration as the department proceeds  with the development of final guidance. Middle-tier programs are  generally exempt from traditional acquisition and requirements processes,  but they may still be large, expensive programs critical to the  department\u2019s ability to meet its mission. Identifying the types of business  case elements decision makers should consider when initiating programs  would improve the department\u2019s ability to ensure that the programs the  military departments select are sound investments and likely to succeed  using a middle-tier acquisition pathway. Identifying metrics to track  performance consistently across the portfolio of middle-tier programs will  provide necessary information to senior leaders once programs have  been started to assess the performance of middle-tier acquisition  programs, including whether they are well positioned to meet statutory  objectives.", "The department also faces challenges that affect the implementation of  the reforms we reviewed. These sweeping changes have resulted in  some disagreements about oversight roles and responsibilities between  the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments that  have not been fully resolved. Clear communication from top leadership of  a framework for oversight roles and responsibilities that is detailed  enough to address areas of continued disagreement would help the  department to move forward with effective implementation of the reforms.  Developing an approach to assess the effects of recent acquisition  reforms is also critical so that DOD can monitor whether reforms are  collectively having the effect of speeding up the acquisition process  without unintended negative consequences on cost and performance of  acquisition programs.", "We also continue to believe that DOD should address our past  recommendations to clarify and strengthen roles and responsibilities at  the enterprise level for making portfolio management decisions to make  sure that its investments are strategy-driven, affordable, and balance  near- and long-term needs.

We incorporated  DOD\u2019s technical comments as appropriate.", "In its written comments, DOD described planned actions to address our  recommendations. Specifically, in response to our first recommendation,  to identify the types of business case elements that should be considered  by decision-makers for middle-tier programs at program initiation, DOD  stated that it expects to identify these business case elements in its final  guidance on middle-tier programs, which it expects to complete in  September 2019. In response to our second recommendation, to identify  metrics that will be used to assess the performance of middle-tier  programs, DOD stated that it plans to determine performance metrics in  coordination with its release of its final guidance on middle-tier programs.  DOD expects to release this guidance in late 2019. In response to our  third recommendation, for senior leadership to clarify acquisition oversight  roles and responsibilities, DOD stated that these roles and responsibilities  will be finalized through the issuance of chartering directives and updated  acquisition policy; issuance is expected by the end of 2019. Finally, in  response to our fourth recommendation, to plan for assessing the effects  of acquisition reforms, DOD stated that it has included a division in the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition to analyze  and assess this and other high-level oversight and policy issues.", "DOD\u2019s planned actions to address our first, second, and fourth  recommendation, if implemented effectively, should address the intent of  our recommendations. With regard to our third recommendation,  however, we do not believe that the steps outlined in DOD\u2019s written  comments are likely to fully address the disagreements about acquisition  oversight roles and responsibilities that we identified in the report. We  acknowledge in the report that DOD plans to issue chartering directives  and re-issue DOD Instruction 5000.02 as part of its efforts to outline the  roles and responsibilities of various parties for acquisition oversight, as  DOD reiterated in its written comments. However, without a  comprehensive framework to inform the revisions of acquisition policies,  such as DOD Instruction 5000.02, DOD\u2019s ability to finalize these policies  may be hindered by the disagreements between the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and the military departments that we identified in  our report. These disagreements are persistent and focused on  fundamental acquisition oversight issues. Simply issuing chartering  directives and finalizing policy as planned may not be enough to ensure  that areas of disagreement are resolved and that officials within the Office  of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments have a shared  understanding of an acquisition oversight framework for the entire  Department that will serve as the basis for any policy. Furthermore,  without senior leadership within DOD communicating this framework to  the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military departments in  sufficient detail to address areas of disagreement among key  stakeholders, disagreement will likely persist and the intended impacts of  reforms could be stymied.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and the Acting Secretary of Defense.

Take a hypothetical example in which DOD starts  with 10 programs and $50 billion to invest. Without portfolio management,  program managers may seek to get the most that they can out of each of  the 10 programs, without assessing their aggregate contributions to  defense. Using portfolio management, DOD executives would look at  different combinations of and approaches to the 10 programs to  determine what, collectively, would provide the best capabilities for $50  billion. This would enable executives to decide, for example, whether it is  better to concentrate more investment in seven programs rather than fund  all 10 as best as possible. In another example, if a program began to  have cost or performance problems, portfolio management would  consider whether the other programs in the portfolio could address the  requirements of the problematic program rather than just putting more  money into it.", "Portfolio management activities at DOD are carried out at both the  enterprise level and the military department level and responsibilities are  divided among the requirements community, the acquisition community,  and the budget community. At the enterprise level, the primary offices  responsible for portfolio management are the Joint Staff (representing the  requirements community), the Under Secretary of Defense for Research  and Engineering and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and  Sustainment (representing the acquisition community), and the Director of  Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (representing the budget  community)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Portfolio Management Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["In 2007, we identified several best practices for portfolio management,  which we revalidated in 2015.

Therefore Joint  Staff officials may have less information about program requirements  than for a major defense acquisition program. Office of the Secretary  of Defense officials told us they are working with the military  departments and other stakeholders to determine what information is  needed for oversight and portfolio management for middle-tier  acquisition programs. Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint  Staff officials told us that guidance issued by the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment in October 2018 that gives  the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff formal roles in a  governance process may help to ensure sufficient insight.", "DOD\u2019s ability to develop a common set of portfolios to facilitate  integrated portfolio analysis may be more difficult. We previously  reported that the requirements, acquisition, and budget communities  at DOD were using different portfolio constructs, meaning that they  defined their portfolios differently and did not use a standard approach  to group investments into portfolios. We identified the use of different  approaches as a barrier to taking an integrated approach to prioritize  needs and allocate resources in accordance with strategic goals, as  called for by portfolio management best practices. For example, the  requirements community uses eight joint capability areas for  examining warfighter needs, acquisition portfolios vary by military  department, and budget data are organized into 11 major force  programs. In our prior work, many officials at DOD said that using a  wide variety of portfolio constructs is necessary and sometimes  beneficial given the different roles and perspectives of the  organizations involved.

Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Research and Engineering told us that they were still in the process of  determining what portfolio construct they would use to group investments  for portfolio management purposes. If that office decides to use a different  portfolio construct than other entities, that decision will increase the  already complex process of mapping together portfolios in order to  perform an integrated portfolio analysis.
