Both cited the need for future BRAC authority. Subsequently, the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review and the 1997 report of the congressionally mandated National Defense Panel addressed the problem of remaining excess infrastructure within DOD and recommended that additional BRAC rounds be conducted. In DOD\u2019s May 19, 1997, report to the Congress on the results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Secretary announced that DOD would ask the Congress to authorize two additional BRAC rounds.", "In considering the Secretary\u2019s request for additional BRAC round authority in 1997, various Members of Congress questioned the need for any future rounds. As a result, the Congress enacted section 2824 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, which required that the Secretary of Defense provide the Congress with a comprehensive report on a range of BRAC issues and described the manner in which the data were to be presented in the report. That legislation also required the Secretary to submit the report not later than the date on which the President submitted to the Congress the budget for fiscal year 2000 and prohibited DOD from spending funds to plan for subsequent BRAC actions until the report was delivered. DOD submitted its report, The Report of the Department of Defense on Base Realignment and Closure, on April 2, 1998.", "In submitting DOD\u2019s report to the Congress, the Secretary reemphasized that DOD has substantial excess capacity in its base infrastructure. The Secretary stressed that DOD needs the money that could be saved from closing unneeded infrastructure to sustain high force readiness and a robust weapon systems modernization program. Accordingly, the Secretary requested two additional BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005.

Further, the legislation prescribed how DOD\u2019s analysis should be presented, requiring several levels of detail and comparative analyses.", "DOD\u2019s report provides most, but not all, of the information required in section 2824. Data limitations and other factors prevented DOD from providing some required information. In some instances, there were limitations in the degree of coverage DOD provided in responding to individual reporting requirements. In a few instances, coverage could have been more comprehensive had DOD involved the services, for example, in updating savings estimates from prior BRAC rounds. DOD\u2019s assessment provided only a rough indication of excess capacity.

The data also show that BRAC actions will net $14 billion in savings during implementation and are expected to produce recurring savings of about $5.7 billion or more each year thereafter.", "DOD assessed its costs and savings data from several vantage points to affirm its position that prior BRAC rounds are saving billions of dollars in operating costs. These included (1) analyzing data drawn from DOD\u2019s annual budget submissions to the Congress; (2) completing a new analysis that relied heavily on an analysis of personnel reductions as a basis for estimating savings; (3) summarizing reviews by external groups, such as the DOD Inspector General (IG) and Army Audit Agency audits of selected BRAC rounds and BRAC actions; and (4) citing reports by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and GAO.", "We and CBO have reported that BRAC reductions provide the basis for recurring savings once implementation costs have been offset. Our assessment that substantial savings are expected is based on our reviews of BRAC issues, which have included examining DOD data that showed reductions in spending on base support programs and personnel. Many bases are aging, and base closures offer an opportunity to avoid capital improvement costs in the future. However, our analysis of DOD\u2019s report and its supporting documentation and our previous work on this issue also indicate that DOD\u2019s cost and savings data are not precise. The data exclude some costs and savings, which if included would cause some increase in the time required for savings to exceed implementation costs and for net savings to begin. Reviews by the DOD IG and the Army Audit Agency have also pointed out the imprecision in DOD\u2019s estimates of costs and savings, though they reinforced the view that BRAC actions result in net savings.", "While DOD has required the military services to update costs and savings, the services seldom updated BRAC savings estimates. In addition, DOD\u2019s estimates may not capture all costs and savings\u2014including the avoidance of some costs associated with base closures, such as the costs of long-term capitalization improvements that will not have to be undertaken. Additionally, in making its estimates, DOD assumed that all BRAC recommendations would be implemented and initial savings projections realized. In selected cases, bases recommended for closure or realignment have been scheduled for privatization in place, or operation of the installations will be turned over to private contractors. As we have reported, privatization does not always produce savings or reduce excess capacity.", "DOD supplemented its estimates of savings with a separate analysis that focused primarily on calculating savings from personnel reductions; it estimated an annual recurring savings of about $7 billion. This analysis is not precise because (1) the personnel costs used in the calculation were estimates and were not tied to the actual salaries of positions eliminated and (2) while BRAC actions have clearly produced significant personnel reductions and savings, we cannot be sure of the extent to which all personnel reductions DOD cited are fully attributable to BRAC actions, as opposed to other force structure reductions during this period of downsizing. See appendix II for a more detailed analysis of DOD\u2019s reporting on cost and savings from prior BRAC rounds.", "DOD\u2019s report projects that additional BRAC rounds would also save resources that it could use for higher priorities, such as weapon systems modernization. DOD estimated the net recurring savings after implementing two future BRAC rounds to be $3.4 billion annually. DOD arrived at this estimate by averaging estimated costs and savings for the most recent two rounds, in 1993 and 1995, and applying this average to proposed BRAC rounds in 2001 and 2005. DOD did not present estimates of future costs and savings by service in its report, as required.", "Also, the method of estimating cost and savings for future BRAC rounds is limited, principally because it assumes that savings from future base closures will be the same as savings from the 1993 and 1995 BRAC rounds, adjusted for inflation. While DOD\u2019s estimate may be appropriate for planning purposes, its precision is limited because the costs of future BRAC rounds might not parallel the costs from prior rounds. For example, among facilities rated low in military value, bases closed in prior rounds frequently were among those least costly to implement and requiring the shortest time for savings to offset implementation costs. Generally, those costing more to implement and requiring a longer time to recover savings were not selected for closure. Therefore, DOD\u2019s estimate represents only a rough gauge of future savings. More information on DOD\u2019s methodology for estimating future costs is provided in appendix II.", "If future BRAC rounds were held as requested, DOD would begin to incur implementation costs in 2002. However, some questions have been raised regarding whether DOD already is incorporating costs and savings from future BRAC rounds into its Future Years Defense Program. DOD has incorporated net estimated costs in the last 2 years (2002 and 2003) of its 1999-2003 Future Years Defense Program. The costs represent a net amount, since DOD anticipates savings from the avoidance of military construction and the cessation of some operations and maintenance activities. These planned costs are presented in the aggregate at the DOD level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior BRAC Rounds Do Not Appear to Have Limited Military Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The 1998 act required DOD to assess the impact of previous base closures on military capabilities. DOD\u2019s report concludes that previous BRAC rounds had a positive effect on military capabilities. The commanders in chief of the combatant commands, the service chiefs, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff concurred with the conclusion that previous BRAC rounds have not harmed military capabilities and have had a net positive impact on operations. While readiness can be temporarily affected as individual BRAC decisions are being implemented, available data does not provide us with any basis to disagree with DOD\u2019s conclusions concerning any long-term impact.", "DOD looked to a number of indicators and studies to determine whether any operational and readiness problems could be linked to BRAC actions. DOD officials reviewed operational and readiness records dating from 1991 to the time they completed their report, including the joint monthly readiness reports, the joint uniform lessons learned reports, commanders in chief integrated priority lists, and the combat support agency review.DOD concluded from its review that BRAC actions had not adversely affected military capabilities.", "This view was supported by the results of monthly senior-level Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff forums, during which issues affecting military capabilities are considered under varying operational scenarios. These assessments incorporate input from affected combatant commanders in chief, and any BRAC-related problems might surface in these assessments. According to a military official associated with these forums, some temporary problems associated with transitions during domestic BRAC closings have been identified, but no long-term problems or deficiencies that related to domestic BRAC activities have surfaced. This conclusion is consistent with statements from other senior military officials after previous BRAC rounds. For example, in a 1997 letter to the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously supported additional domestic base closures. Our reviews of readiness issues over the years have not identified any long-term readiness problems that were related to domestic base realignments and closures.", "DOD took several actions to minimize potential negative impacts to military capability in previous BRAC rounds, including stressing military value in deciding on bases to recommend for closure and realignment. In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders in chief reviewed the Secretary of Defense\u2019s closure and realignment recommendations to prevent degradation of military capability and endorsed the recommendations. Using such an approach in the future, should the Congress decide to authorize any future BRAC rounds, may help to avoid long-term adverse effects on military capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Analysis Provides a Rough Measure of Excess Base Capacity", "paragraphs": ["DOD identified those installations (bases) with 300 or more authorized civilians. It also assessed excess capacity as required, which involved many of the same bases. DOD reported increased capacity in 2003 relative to 1989 for DOD, for each service, and for types of installations within each service and reported an overall increase in excess capacity of 23 percent. In using 1989 as a baseline for its excess capacity analysis, DOD did not assess excess capacity that might have existed in 1989. Additionally, the analysis did not take into account the possibilities of joint cross-servicing and the potential impacts of management initiatives discussed in the Secretary\u2019s report on defense reform initiatives or by the BRAC 1995 joint cross-service group\u2019s report. Such initiatives could result in consolidation, reorganization, or regionalization of activities and potentially reduce the amount of infrastructure capacity required in the future.", "The services generally agreed with the magnitude of excess capacity shown by the analysis. Because of differences in the types of installations among the services and in the way capacity was measured, DOD did not report capacity as a percentage of the total capacity by types of installations, such as the total capacity in all depots. Such an analysis of excess capacity would allow a comparison among types of installations, which is what the legislation appears to envision. Further, DOD did not present a description of the types of installations that would be recommended for closure or realignment, by service, in one or more future BRAC rounds as required. Rather, DOD indicated that all bases would be considered for closure or realignment in any future BRAC round.  Appendix III provides additional details on DOD\u2019s methodology for identifying bases that are authorized 300 or more civilian employees and for computing excess capacity.", "DOD officials said that its analysis was not designed to identify bases that would be closed in additional BRAC rounds. According to DOD officials, individual base-level data, such as that collected for a BRAC round, would be required to specify the types of installations that would be recommended for closure. They also said that section 2824(f) of the 1998 act prohibited DOD from expending resources to conduct such data-gathering efforts. DOD\u2019s view has some merit; however, it appears that DOD could have taken additional steps to illustrate more clearly how much excess capacity existed within categories of bases. For example, while DOD\u2019s analysis shows no increase in the excess capacity between 1989 and 2003 in the category of Army depots, our previous work has shown\u2014and DOD officials have agreed\u2014that depots have excess capacity. Further, while a definitive picture regarding actual numbers of bases to be closed in any future BRAC round would not be known until the analysis associated with a specific round occurred, we believe DOD could have provided a clearer picture of the types and potential amount of excess capacity it has within its basing infrastructure. This could be part of a broader strategic plan for the future, one which better delineates future requirements, excess capacity, and plans for revitalizing remaining infrastructures. We have previously suggested the need for such a plan and suggested that it be presented to the Congress in much the same way DOD presented its plan for force structure reduction in the Bottom-Up Review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Communities Are Rebounding Economically From Base Closures", "paragraphs": ["The 1998 act required DOD to report on the cost of economic assistance provided to communities adversely affected by BRAC actions\u2014funding that has been provided outside of DOD\u2019s BRAC implementation budgets or by other federal agencies. DOD estimated these costs to be $955.9 million between 1988 and 1997; these costs are discussed in appendix II. Additionally, while not specifically required to do so, DOD\u2019s report expands on the subject of economic assistance and credits public and private reinvestment in the affected communities with facilitating base reuse and economic recovery. The report states that for bases closed more than  2 years, nearly 75 percent of the lost civilian jobs have been replaced. It also cites a number of examples in making the point that most communities are rebounding.", "Our prior and ongoing work also found indications of economic recovery in many communities, although some are faring better than others. We found that federal assistance provided to communities affected by base closures has helped to cushion the negative economic impact and supports DOD\u2019s contention that the redevelopment of base property has successfully created thousands of jobs. However, the reuse of bases appears to be only one aspect of economic recovery for most communities. The strength of the national economy and the level of economic diversity in the affected communities played a strong role in determining how well they survived a base closure. Without a growing economy, some communities might not have been as successful at attracting industries and jobs to redevelop base properties. The same would be true for communities affected by future BRAC rounds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Any Future BRAC Rounds Could Build on Processes Developed for Prior BRAC Rounds", "paragraphs": ["The 1998 act required that DOD report on the criteria and methodologies the Secretary would use to evaluate military installations for future closures or realignments. DOD\u2019s report indicates that future BRAC procedures and methodologies would be similar to those used in prior rounds. DOD proposed legislation for new BRAC authorities to the Congress in February 1998; that proposal was also included in DOD\u2019s required report to the Congress.", "Congressional authority for two additional BRAC rounds modeled on processes used in recent BRAC rounds is DOD\u2019s preferred alternative for reducing its excess infrastructure. DOD states that legislation modeled on authorities provided to execute recent BRAC rounds is superior to provisions contained in 10 U.S.C. 2687, which placed many study and reporting requirements upon DOD in connection with efforts to close military bases. We previously reported that section 2687, enacted in the 1970s, greatly impeded efforts to close military bases until special legislation authorizing recent BRAC rounds was enacted. We also reported that legislation enacted in 1990, which expired in 1995, was seen by many officials as a starting point for considering new legislation should the Congress decide that it wants to authorize future BRAC rounds. Some individuals expressed concern over the role of politics in the process. We recognize that no public policy process such as that used for base realignment and closure can be completely removed from the U.S. political system. However, the processes used between 1988 and 1995 had several checks and balances to keep political influences to a minimum. Ultimately, however, the success of these processes requires the cooperation of all participants.", "As DOD and previous BRAC commission officials have noted, key elements of the 1990 BRAC legislation, as amended, contributed to the success of prior rounds. These elements included (1) the establishment of an independent commission and nomination of commissioners by the President, in consultation with the congressional leadership; (2) the development of clearly articulated, published criteria for decision making; (3) the use of data certified as to its accuracy; (4) the requirement that the President and the Congress accept or reject in their entirety the lists of closures adopted by a BRAC commission; and (5) the creation of tight time frames to force timely decisions. The legislation also required that we analyze DOD\u2019s BRAC decision-making process and recommendations.", "Additional audit coverage by the DOD IG and service audit agencies associated with the process helped ensure the accuracy of data and analyses associated with the decision-making process.", "DOD\u2019s legislative proposal contains, with minor exceptions, essentially the same provisions as those contained in the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-510, as amended) for making decisions on which bases to close and realign. One exception is that it gave 2 months more than was available in BRAC 1995 for the Secretary of Defense to publish the proposed list of bases to be closed. The publication date would be May 1 rather than March 1 of the year in which the BRAC round is conducted. Other decision points outlined in the legislation also shifted  2 months. Another difference is that the proposed legislation would reduce the amount of time available for us to review and report to the Congress and the BRAC commission on the Secretary\u2019s proposals from 45 days as in BRAC 1995 to 30 days."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Alternatives to New BRAC Authority", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s report notes that actions may be required to reduce base capacity, such as demolishing buildings that are no longer needed and conducting reorganizations and consolidations that do not require BRAC actions or invoke provisions of section 2687.

The Secretary also has noted the less desirable alternative of deferring maintenance and upkeep of facilities as a way of minimizing infrastructure costs. Available data suggests that DOD has taken such actions for several years as it made trade-offs in funding priorities. For example, we reported that over a 10-year period, from fiscal year 1987 to 1996, DOD\u2019s total operations and maintenance funding obligations for facilities maintenance and repair, excluding family housing, declined by 38 percent on average in real terms. The Army had the steepest decline of all the services, about 49 percent.

DOD collected some new data for its excess capacity analysis, but the methodology it used did not compare capacity to future requirements or lend itself to identifying the types of installations that needed to be closed. Further, DOD\u2019s conclusion that military capability has not suffered adverse long-term effects because of BRAC actions appears to be reasonable.

For example, DOD did not report estimated savings from future BRAC rounds by service as the legislation required.", "In stating that the savings data it cited are the best available, DOD notes that the data are imprecise indicators of the actual savings. We have consistently recommended to DOD that it periodically update its savings estimates.

If the efforts to improve future savings reporting DOD cites in its comments are successful, then DOD should be able to provide more accurate estimates in the future.", "DOD took issue with our observation that it had not reported excess capacity by type of military installation across all DOD components. DOD believes that such an analysis of excess capacity was not required by the statute and, because of differences in types of installations among the services, was not practical to conduct. DOD said that reporting on excess capacity across all DOD components would have required an effort similar to a full BRAC analysis. DOD therefore reported on excess capacity by type of installation only within each military service and the Defense Logistics Agency.

Also, DOD did not provide complete information in response to provisions in subsection 2824(b)(2) because it said complete information was not readily available to compare estimated costs by fiscal year, spending category, and installation type, in part because of the need to retrieve historical data and differences in the ways the services develop budget data.

DOD reported it could not meet this requirement because the estimates it submitted to the commissions were based on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s recommendations and were not the commissions\u2019 final, approved BRAC recommendations to the President and the Congress. According to DOD, differences in the Secretary\u2019s recommendations and the commissions\u2019 final BRAC actions created differences, sometimes significant, in costs and savings estimates. In addition, DOD\u2019s estimates of costs and savings submitted to the commissions excluded the costs associated with environmental restoration, since the BRAC criteria purposely excluded these costs as closure and realignment recommendations were developed. Environmental restoration costs were added to budget estimates for BRAC costs and savings after all BRAC actions became final.", "In general, DOD provided information on presentation requirements in subsections 2824(c)(1) through (c)(8) where data were available, but often the information is incomplete.

Finally, remaining bases may be more costly to close than the previous bases closed.

The types of installations included were not the same for each service. Also, capacity was often measured differently for each service. For example, the Air Force and the Army reported data for test and evaluation facilities in terms of physical space (square feet), while the Navy reported its capacity for test and evaluation facilities in terms of workyears. As a result of both these variances, DOD did not report excess capacity as a percentage of the total capacity of types of installations as required.", "To perform the capacity analysis, the services compared capacity in a sample of 371 bases in 1989 to the capacity for 259 bases that will remain in 2003 after all scheduled BRAC actions are implemented. The sample included most installations with over 300 authorized civilians and a small number of additional bases considered significant because of factors such as location or military function. The services then categorized the bases according to their primary missions and defined indicators of capacity, or metrics, for each category. Varied metrics were used as surrogates for defining capacity. For example, metrics included maneuver acres per maneuver brigades for Army training bases, square feet of parking apron space per aircraft for Air Force bases, or capacity direct labor hours compared to budgeted or programmed direct labor hours for Navy aviation depots. For several categories of bases, DOD used two metrics that established a range of potential excess capacity based on the different indicators\u2019 values. DOD divided the metric by measures of force structure to determine a ratio and calculated the extent to which the ratio of capacity in 2003 exceeded the ratio in 1989. DOD then weighted and averaged each categories\u2019 excess capacity to create a range\u2014minimum and maximum\u2014for each service. The weighted totals were averaged to give an overall increase in excess capacity of 23 percent.", "By using 1989 as a baseline, DOD did not take into account the excess capacity that existed in that year (prior to closing bases in previous BRAC rounds); as a result, the percentage of increased excess capacity reported understated actual excess capacity by an unknown amount for some categories and may have overstated excess capacity for others. For example, while DOD\u2019s analysis shows no increase in the excess capacity between 1989 and 2003 in the category of Army depots, our previous work has shown\u2014and DOD officials have agreed\u2014that DOD has excess depot capacity. At the same time, the analysis could overstate actual excess capacity to the extent there was a deficit of capacity in 1989. For example, the analysis shows a 16-percent increase in excess capacity in Marine Corps bases.

We revised our report language to clarify our point that DOD did not provide all of the information required by section 2824. In some cases, DOD explained why it could not provide such information, and we noted these reasons in our report. However, we pointed out other cases in which required information was not provided without any explanation from DOD. In its comments, DOD maintained that it addressed all requirements and provided explanations for why it did not provide all of the required information. Yet, in some other instances DOD\u2019s report did not provide required information and was silent on the reasons. 2. DOD could have allocated future costs and savings from future BRAC rounds by fiscal year and by military service by applying the same methodology it used to estimate the total costs of future rounds, that is, using the costs and savings from previous rounds by service and applying them to future rounds by service. As noted in our report, DOD\u2019s rationale for not allocating estimates of future costs and savings by service was that it had no basis on which to allocate these costs. This rationale that past costs may not be like future costs is applicable to the aggregate estimate as well. Allocating estimates by service could have been done and would have met the legislative requirements, although how useful that information would have been is unclear, given limitations we noted with the aggregate estimate. 3. We clarified our report to indicate more clearly that the military services have seldom updated cost and savings data, even though DOD may have requested that the services conduct such updates. 4. While our report does not disagree with DOD that using historical data as a basis for projecting future costs is a reasonable approach, we point out weaknesses in the data and DOD\u2019s assumptions about future BRAC rounds that make it unlikely that future costs will mirror costs from previous BRAC rounds. For example, during the last BRAC round, relatively lower implementation costs and quicker offset of closure costs were frequently factors in DOD\u2019s closure and realignment decisions. Our intent is to suggest that there are reasons to expect greater costs to close bases during any future implementation period than during previous BRAC rounds because many bases with lower implementation costs and quicker offset of closure costs have already been realigned or closed. DOD agreed that costs are likely to be higher than in previous BRAC rounds. These costs could reduce the net savings achieved during the implementation period. Nevertheless, we believe there still can be significant savings from future BRAC rounds. 5. While we believe there can be significant savings from future BRAC rounds, we point out in our report that the future costs DOD estimated do not include costs that extend past the 6-year implementation period. DOD\u2019s comments offer a fuller explanation of why it did not include such costs in its estimates. 6. DOD\u2019s comments provide a fuller explanation of DOD\u2019s experience with revenue from land sales. 7. DOD took issue with our statement that it had not reported excess capacity by type of military installation across all of the services, as required. DOD believes that such a breakdown of excess capacity was not required by the statute and, because of differences in types of installations among the services, was not practicable to include in the report. DOD therefore reported on excess capacity by type of installation only within each military service. The requirement in section 2824(b)(5)(C) to report excess capacity by \u201ctype of military installations\u201d is not limited, however, to types of installations within the services. Rather, we believe that the section contemplated a DOD-wide approach because it does not specify that the information should be provided by service. 8. In its comments, DOD indicated that its analysis of excess capacity provides the required information on the types of bases that might be closed in future BRAC rounds by providing an indication of areas where excess capacity continues to exist relative to 1989 levels. DOD reiterated that it would need to use the detailed analyses typical of a BRAC round to identify specific bases that might be closed or realigned. While we agree that more detailed analyses would be required to identify individual bases to close or realign, DOD could have been clearer about the types of bases that might be closed or realigned if it had a strategic plan that delineated future requirements, excess capacity, and plans for revitalizing remaining infrastructure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To provide our analysis of DOD\u2019s report on base realignment and closure, we made an overall assessment of DOD\u2019s responsiveness to the individual section 2824 reporting requirements and assessed individual reporting topics, including the costs and savings from prior BRAC rounds and estimated costs and savings from future BRAC rounds, the impact of prior BRAC rounds on military capabilities, excess capacity, base reuse and economic recovery of communities affected by BRAC actions, and processes DOD would use to select bases for closure or realignment should further BRAC rounds be authorized.", "To assess DOD\u2019s estimates of the costs and savings associated with previous BRAC rounds, we reviewed the methodology and original budget justification estimates DOD provided to the Congress.
