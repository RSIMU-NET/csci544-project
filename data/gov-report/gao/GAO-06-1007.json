We conducted interviews with Treasury officials and others and reviewed appropriate documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In response to the effects of the September 11 attacks on the financial markets, Treasury canceled a scheduled 4-week bill auction after communicating with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY). Treasury then used compensating balances from banks across the country to help meet its obligations on time. Compensating balances were replaced by direct payments in 2004. Also, in response to the attacks' financial effects, the Federal Reserve lent billions of dollars to both domestic and foreign financial institutions through a combination of methods to help markets recover. Federal Reserve actions and market behavior in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks are informative when considering potential alternative funding sources for Treasury during a future wide-scale financial market disruption. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and primary dealers have added contingency sites and systems intended to increase the resilience of the auction process. Regardless of resiliency efforts, the nature and impact of a potential future wide-scale disruption are unknown. In addition, Treasury has at least one less source of cash since the compensating balances Treasury relied upon during the September 11 attacks are no longer used. Finally, Treasury's cash management policy of minimal cash balances to lower borrowing costs further limits Treasury's access to cash during a wide-scale disruption. All these factors make it prudent for Treasury to explore other funding alternatives to use during a wide-scale disruption. Relevant parties with whom we spoke, including primary dealers, agreed. They also generally agreed on a list of main design features including source of funds, situations for use, approvals, and costs, among others, that should be considered when weighing alternative funding options. Discussions with Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and other relevant parties have led GAO to conclude that a two-tiered approach is promising. The first tier consists of two funding options involving a range of appropriate financial institutions, namely a credit line and a private placement of a flexible security known as a cash management (CM) bill. The second tier involves a direct draw from the Federal Reserve that would provide Treasury a last resort source of funds when other options are not viable. A credit line with several financial institutions would involve a prior transparent commitment or understanding by certain financial institutions to provide funds to Treasury. A private placement of a CM bill would involve a prior arrangement to issue a CM bill after communicating with certain senior executives at financial institutions who would have the ability and authority to meet Treasury's immediate funding needs. Finally, a direct draw from the Federal Reserve would require a change in the law to allow the Federal Reserve to directly lend to Treasury. Appropriate limitations, adequate flexibility, and accountability would have to be included in the design."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The massive destruction caused by the September 11, 2001, attacks on the  World Trade Center and the resulting loss of life, facilities,  telecommunications, and power significantly affected U.S. financial  markets, including the markets for U.S. Treasury (Treasury) securities.  The attacks exposed the vulnerability to a serious wide-scale disruption of  the markets that Treasury relies on as a regular source for financing  government operations and large, regularly occurring payments such as  Social Security benefits.

Dust and debris  blanketed the area, creating difficult and hazardous conditions that  complicated recovery efforts. Many financial organizations lost  telecommunications service when the 7 World Trade Center building  collapsed and debris struck a major Verizon central switching office that  served approximately 34,000 businesses and residences. Over 13,000  customers also lost power. To accommodate the rescue and recovery  efforts and maintain order, pedestrian and vehicle access to the area  encompassing the financial district was restricted through September 13,  2001.", "The attacks severely disrupted the secondary markets for government  securities and money market instruments primarily because of the impact  on the brokers that facilitate trading among dealers (broker-dealers) and  on one of the clearing banks for those trades. Two banks\u2014the Bank of  New York (BONY) and JPMorganChase\u2014provided clearing and settlement  services (and still do) for many major broker-dealers in the government  securities market. Clearing banks transferred funds and securities for their  customers that purchased or sold government securities based on  instructions received by the Government Securities Clearing Corporation  (GSCC). As a result of the attacks, BONY had difficulty reestablishing its  connections with GSCC and its own account at the Federal Reserve, and  its customers had difficulties connecting with BONY. These problems  contributed to the disruption of the secondary government securities  market. BONY had to evacuate four facilities, including its primary  telecommunications data center and over 8,300 staff, because they were  located near the World Trade Center. By September 14 BONY  reestablished connectivity with GSCC and began receiving and  transmitting instructions for securities transfers.", "Both the Federal Reserve\u2019s Fedwire Securities Service, which provides  safekeeping, transfer, and settlement services for securities issued by  Treasury and other federal agencies, and its Fedwire Funds Service, which  provides payments services associated with securities sales and other  large-value transactions, continued processing transactions without  interruption. Although the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY),  which manages the Fedwire services, sustained damage to some  communication lines, the Fedwire services were not interrupted because  the facilities that process transactions were not located in lower  Manhattan. Over 30 banks initially lost connectivity to Fedwire services,  but most were able to reestablish connections through backup systems,  and most payment system operations continued with minimal disruption.", "The Federal Reserve, Treasury, and primary dealers all play important  roles in Treasury auctions. The Federal Reserve and its associated Federal  Reserve banks function as the United States government\u2019s fiscal agent and  perform a variety of services for the Treasury including handling Treasury  auctions, accepting bids, communicating bids to Treasury, issuing  Treasury securities to winning bidders, and collecting payment for  securities.", "Treasury borrows the money needed to operate the federal government  and manages the government\u2019s outstanding debt subject to a statutory  limit. Treasury\u2019s primary debt management goal is to finance the  government\u2019s borrowing needs at the lowest cost over time. To meet this  objective, Treasury issues debt through auctions in a \u201cregular and  predictable\u201d pattern across a wide range of securities. Treasury publishes  a schedule with tentative announcement, auction, and settlement (issue)  dates up to 6 months in advance of regular security auctions. Depending  on the type of security, Treasury typically auctions and then issues a  security within a week or less. Treasury generally issues short-term  regular bills with 4-, 13-, and 26-week maturities every Thursday and issues  2- and 5-year notes at the end of each month. Three- and 10- year notes are  issued in the middle of each quarter. Treasury reopens 10-year notes\u2014or  increases the amount outstanding for these notes\u20141 month after their  initial issuance. In addition, Treasury issues Treasury Inflation-Protected  Securities (TIPS) in 5-, 10-, and 20-year maturities in certain months  according to the TIPS\u2019 maturity.  Finally, Treasury issues 30-year bonds in  February and August and reopens these issues in May and November,  respectively.", "Treasury supplements its regular and predictable schedule with flexible  securities called cash management (CM) bills. Unlike for other securities,  Treasury does not publish information on CM bills on its auction schedule.  Instead, Treasury generally announces CM bill auctions anywhere from 1  to 4 days ahead of the auction. The term to maturity\u2014the length of time  the bill is outstanding\u2014varies according to Treasury\u2019s cash needs. CM bills  allow Treasury to finance very short-term cash needs\u2014for as little as   1 day\u2014while providing short notice to market participants.", "As of the end of fiscal year 2005, about 46 percent of marketable Treasury  securities held by the public will mature during the next 24 months. As  these securities mature and are replaced by new debt, the cost to finance  the federal government\u2019s debt will vary with changing interest rates.", "The bidders in Treasury auctions include depository institutions,  individuals, dealers and brokers, pension and retirement funds, insurance  companies, investment funds, foreign and international entities, the  Federal Reserve, and others. In recent years the percentage of U.S.  Treasury securities held internationally has increased. Although the  categories of bidders are diverse, primary dealers, other commercial bank  dealer departments, and other nonbank dealers and brokers received  almost 60 percent of auction awards of marketable securities between  August 2001 and May 2006. Federal Reserve banks received almost   21 percent during that same time period for their own accounts. Primary  dealers are banks and securities brokers that trade in U.S. government  securities with the Federal Reserve. Primary dealers have functioned for  over 40 years as the distribution and support system for Treasury debt and  play a \u201cvital\u201d role in the price discovery process. The FRBNY designates  primary dealers based on certain capital requirements, and requires  primary dealers to participate meaningfully in both Federal Reserve open  market operations and Treasury auctions to maintain their designation.  However, the Federal Reserve does not have regulatory authority over  dealers acting in the primary dealer role.", "In the past, outside of the auction process, Treasury had access to a cash  draw authority intended for emergencies. Intermittently between 1942 and  1981, Treasury was able to directly sell (and purchase) certain short-term  obligations to (and from) the Federal Reserve in exchange for cash.  Treasury used the cash draw authority infrequently and mostly in times of  war or armed conflict. Congress last granted the authority in 1979 and  limited the amount Treasury could draw to $5 billion. Congress allowed  this authority to expire in 1981 (see app. II for more background  information).

The Federal Reserve communicated that it  was available as a source of liquidity and provided billions of dollars  through various means to banks and financial market participants  experiencing liquidity problems as a result of the September 11 attacks.", "The Federal Reserve announced its willingness to provide liquidity on  September 11 several times via systems and official statements. For  example, soon after the attacks the Federal Reserve broadcast that it was  fully operational on the Fedwire system\u2014the Federal Reserve\u2019s large- value electronic payment system. In a second broadcast message it  announced that it was available to meet liquidity needs. Around noon, the  Federal Reserve Board of Governors issued a press release stating that  \u201cThe Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window  is available to meet liquidity needs.\u201d These statements along with others by  a Federal Reserve governor and a Federal Reserve bank president on that  day were intended to reassure financial markets that the Federal Reserve  System was functioning normally and to encourage banks to view the  discount window as a source of liquidity. According to a then Director of  Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond who has since become  that bank\u2019s President, the statements also signaled to banks a \u201cdistinct\u201d  shift in how the Federal Reserve would view discount window  borrowing.", "The Federal Reserve provided liquidity through discount window and open  market operations. We previously reported that banking regulatory staff  told us that the attacks largely resulted in a funding liquidity problem  rather than a solvency crisis for banks. Thus, the challenge the Federal  Reserve faced was ensuring that banks had adequate funds to meet their  financial obligations. Settlement problems also prevented broker-dealers  and others from using the repo markets to fund their daily operations. In  4 days after the attacks, the Federal Reserve provided billions of dollars to  banks through various means to overcome the problems resulting from  unsettled government securities trades and financial market dislocations.  For example, the Federal Reserve provided $37 billion in overnight credit  through its discount window on September 11, $46 billion on September  12, and $8 billion on September 13. In contrast, no overnight discount  window credit was provided on September 10 and September 14. It also  conducted securities purchase transactions and other open market  operations to provide needed funds to illiquid institutions. For example,  the Federal Reserve held a zero end-of-day balance in overnight repos on  September 10 and September 11, but end-of-day balances increased to $38  billion on September 12 and peaked at $81 billion on September 14 during  the 4 days following the attacks. In addition, the Federal Reserve waived  daylight overdraft fees for all account holders and eliminated the penalty  on overnight overdrafts for depository institutions from September 11  through September 21. Had these actions not been taken, some firms  unable to receive payments may not have had sufficient liquidity to meet  their other financial obligations, which could have produced other defaults  and magnified the effects of September 11 into a systemic solvency crisis.", "The Federal Reserve provided additional liquidity by continuing its normal  check crediting schedule despite delays in transportation. The grounding  of air transportation complicated and delayed some check clearing, since  both the Federal Reserve and private providers relied on overnight air  delivery to transport checks between banks in which they are deposited  and banks on which they are drawn. The Federal Reserve continued to  credit the value of deposits to banks even when it could not present  checks and debit the accounts of paying banks. The Federal Reserve  decided to not offset this float through open market operations to  continue providing liquidity. Crediting banks for deposited checks before  receiving the corresponding credit from banks on which the checks were  drawn causes float. This additional liquidity\u2014normally less than $1 billion  outstanding at any one time\u2014peaked at over $47 billion on September 13,  2001.", "To provide dollars needed by foreign institutions, the Federal Reserve also  arranged new or expanded swap lines with the Bank of Canada, the  European Central Bank, and the Bank of England. The swap lines involved  exchanging dollars for the foreign currencies of these jurisdictions, with  agreements to re-exchange amounts later. These temporary arrangements  provided funds to settle dollar-denominated obligations of foreign banks  whose operations were affected by the attacks.", "According to a Federal Reserve official, the large injections of liquidity  were also necessary in part to offset large reserve drains from other  autonomous factors\u2014factors that affect the supply of balances but are  generally outside the control of the Federal Reserve. For example, as  previously noted, the level of check float peaked at $47 billion on  September 13 and a foreign currency swap added $20 billion of balances  on that same day, but another autonomous factor reduced balances by  over $30 billion on that day, which was between $15 billion and $20 billion  more than prior levels.", "To further increase liquidity, the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC) announced on September 17 that it would lower its federal funds  target rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent and the Federal Reserve Board  of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to   2-1/2 percent. In its announcement the Federal Reserve stated that it  would \u201ccontinue to supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the  financial markets, as needed, until normal market functioning is restored.\u201d  The FOMC acknowledged that the actual federal funds rate might fall  below its target in this situation. According to a then Director of Research  at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has since become that  bank\u2019s President, market participants expected a decline in the federal  funds rate driven perhaps by the large amount of liquidity injected by the  Federal Reserve, creating excess reserve balances.", "Market participants typically use government securities as collateral for  financing or to meet settlement obligations. When some broker and bank  facilities were destroyed or lost connectivity, the results of trading  information, such as amounts of securities or funds to transfer and the  ability to transfer funds, were lost or degraded for days. If trade  information is not correct and funds and securities are not properly  transferred, the trade will be considered a \u201cfail.\u201d To help alleviate failed  trades resulting from the attacks, the Federal Reserve and Treasury loaned  and auctioned securities respectively. From September 11 through  September 13, the Federal Reserve loaned $22 billion of securities from its  portfolio to broker-dealers that needed securities to complete settlements  of failed trades. The Federal Reserve also reduced restrictions on its  securities lending, leading to a sharp increase in borrowing at the end of  September 2001.", "Treasury also conducted an unplanned, special issuance of 10-year notes  in order to prevent a possible financial crisis. According to current and  former Treasury officials involved with this decision, on September 17 it  became evident that the stopped and incomplete trading on September 11  resulted in increasing fails in the secondary market. Treasury officials  described how a rapid rise in fails at the end of September and beginning  of October was based on demand for the 5- and 10-year notes. After  conferring with capital market participants who recommended a  reopening, or increasing the amount outstanding, of the 5- or 10-year  notes, Treasury officials decided to reopen the 10-year note. They  reasoned that since the note was already scheduled to reopen in  November, investors\u2014-who were anticipating the November reopening\u2014- would be better prepared for the issuance than for a 5-year note. Treasury  officials concluded that the additional supply of the 10-year note produced  a positive \u201cpsychological\u201d effect on markets by providing increased  confidence about the certainty of supply helping to decrease fails in the 5-  and 10-year notes trades."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Federal Reserve Actions and Financial Market Behavior Are Informative When Considering Alternative Funding Sources for Treasury", "paragraphs": ["Immediately after the September 11 attacks, many financial institutions,  including some foreign central banks, looked to the Federal Reserve to  provide liquidity through various methods.

Further, the amount and terms of the liquidity  provided by the Federal Reserve to financial institutions will likely affect  the characteristics of any funding alternatives available to Treasury. As  discussed previously, the Federal Reserve eased restrictions and lowered  interest rate targets to provide expanded liquidity to financial institutions.  Finally, the market fails and other collateral issues in the secondary  market may affect the type of security Treasury will want to issue in a  crisis.

The two-tiered approach is suggested as a strategy to be used only when  auctions are not viable based on some sort of wide-scale disruption to the  financial markets that Treasury relies upon, and not as a substitute or  complement to Treasury\u2019s normal auction process when market prices  become expensive, or cash balances are lower than expected. The first tier  consists of two funding options involving a range of appropriate financial  institutions, namely (1) a credit line and (2) a private placement of a CM  bill. The second tier involves a direct draw from the Federal Reserve that  would provide Treasury a last resort source of funds when other options  are not viable.

Most  market participants with whom we spoke preferred a direct draw  authority for the Treasury. Although that might be the most direct route,  we recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of the  central bank.

This in turn could worsen any problems in  the government\u2019s ability to finance operations. Given this, some relevant  parties suggested that if a wide-scale disruption occurred when Treasury  was at or near the debt limit, use of any alternative funding option during  such a disruption should be excluded from the debt ceiling.

Since a Federal  Reserve Chairman is unlikely to agree to a direct draw unless convinced  that other options are not viable, this would provide sufficient protection  against abuse of this authority. Since the authority is predicated on a wide- scale emergency and disruption, adding presidential approval might  unnecessarily delay necessary actions without adding any additional  protection beyond that provided by requiring agreement of the Chairman  of the Federal Reserve.

Congress first granted this cash  draw authority temporarily in 1942, allowed it to lapse several times, and  extended it 22 times until 1979, when it modified some of the terms and  added controls. In 1979, Congress also authorized a securities draw  authority, which permitted Treasury to borrow securities from the Federal  Reserve, sell them, and then repurchase the securities in the open market  and return the securities to the Federal Reserve within a specified period.  The securities draw authority was never used.", "After Congress authorized Treasury to earn interest on its Treasury Tax &  Loan (TT&L) account balances in 1977,,  Congress allowed both draw  authorities to expire in 1981. In a 1979 proceeding, one Member of  Congress said that after World War II, the cash draw authority allowed  Treasury to carry lower cash balances.

A Treasury Assistant Secretary said that  Treasury might not have sufficient time to raise funds through the  securities draw authority and that the cash draw authority provided  Treasury with immediate funds to meet unforeseen developments,  especially if these developments transpired late in the trading day.

According to a 1979 testimony by a Federal Reserve Governor,  Treasury had used the authority in earlier years to offset cash drains just  before funds became available from quarterly income tax payments. He  went on to explain that Treasury used the cash draw authority less in  recent years since it relied more often on cash management bills to \u201ccover  low points in its cash balance\u201d prior to tax payment dates. In that same  proceeding, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury credited the access to  short-term funds, specifically weekly bills and cash management bills, with  reduced use of the cash draw authority after 1975.", "After 1979, the cash draw authority was only to be used in emergencies,  while the securities draw authority could be used \u201cin more routine  circumstances.\u201d However, we did not find any evidence that Treasury  used the securities draw authority between 1979 and its expiration in 1981.  One Member of Congress described how the securities draw authority  could be used when Treasury did not have the time to \u201cprepare and  market\u201d a new security issue quickly enough to meet short-term cash  needs. He reasoned that since Treasury would borrow \u201cseasoned  securities\u201d from the Federal Reserve \u2014existing securities in the Federal  Reserve\u2019s portfolio\u2014that Treasury would be able to sell them quickly  enough to meet cash needs.

For example, a number of  members saw the cash draw authority as a way to monetize the debt and  in effect print new money, thereby complicating monetary policy.

The Federal  Reserve reported that Treasury paid a fixed .25 percent interest rate on the  amount borrowed when it used this authority through December 3, 1957;  after December 3, 1957, and through the expiration of this authority it paid  a rate set at .25 percent below the prevailing discount rate of the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.

A Federal Reserve Governor noted  that Treasury could pay a substantial premium for selling securities it  borrowed from the Federal Reserve late in the day because the action  would probably take market participants by surprise.
