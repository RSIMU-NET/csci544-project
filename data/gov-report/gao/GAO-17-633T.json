Since fiscal year 2003\u2014when certain agencies began reporting improper payments as required by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002\u2014cumulative improper payment estimates have totaled over $1.2 trillion. For fiscal year 2016, agencies reported improper payment estimates totaling $144.3 billion, an increase of about $7.6 billion from the prior year's estimate of $136.7 billion.", "For fiscal year 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) reported improper payment estimate totaled $5.5 billion. VA's Community Care and Purchased Long-Term Services and Support programs accounted for reported improper payment estimates of $3.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, or about 87 percent of VA's reported improper payment estimate for fiscal year 2016. VA's reported improper payment estimates increased significantly from $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2014 to $5.0 billion for fiscal year 2015. According to the VA Office of Inspector General, this increase was primarily due to a change in VA's evaluation procedures, which resulted in more improper payments being identified.", "In accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidance, to reduce improper payments, VA can use detailed root cause analysis to identify why improper payments are occurring and to develop corrective actions. For example, according to VA, the root cause for over 75 percent of VA's reported improper payments for fiscal year 2016 was program design or structural issues. Most of these errors occurred in VA's health care area. To reduce these improper payments, VA stated that it will make its procurement practices compliant with Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions. GAO has also recommended steps that VA can take to reduce the risk of improper payments related to disability benefits. For example, in November 2014, GAO reported that VA had shortcomings in quality review practices that could reduce its ability to ensure accurate and consistent processing of disability compensation claim decisions, and GAO made eight related recommendations to improve the program. To date, VA has implemented six of the report's eight recommendations and expects to implement the other two recommendations related to the effectiveness of quality assurance activities later this summer."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the steward of taxpayer dollars, the federal government is accountable  for how it spends hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars annually.

Among other  things, an improper payment includes payment to an ineligible recipient,  payment for an ineligible good or service, and any duplicate payment. In  addition, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance instructs  agencies to report as improper payments any payments for which  insufficient or no documentation was found.

VA measures the accuracy of disability compensation  claim decisions mainly through its Systematic Technical Accuracy Review  (STAR). Specifically, for each of the regional offices, completed claims  are randomly sampled each month and the data are used to produce  estimates of the accuracy of all completed claims.", "In our November 2014 report, we reported that VA had not always  followed generally accepted statistical practices when calculating  accuracy rates through STAR reviews, resulting in imprecise performance  information. We also identified shortcomings in quality review practices  that could reduce their effectiveness. We made eight recommendations to  VA to review the multiple sources of policy guidance available to claims  processors and evaluate the effectiveness of quality assurance activities,  among other things.

To begin receiving and remain eligible for TDIU  benefits, veterans must meet the income eligibility requirements. VA first  determines a claimant\u2019s income by requesting information on the last 5  years of employment on the claim form and subsequently requires  beneficiaries to annually attest to any income changes. VA uses the  information provided by claimants to request additional information from  employers and, when possible, verifies the claimant\u2019s reported income,  especially for the year prior to applying for the benefit. In order to receive  verification, VA sends a form to the employers identified on the veteran\u2019s  benefit claim and asks them to provide the amount of income earned by  the veteran. However, VA officials indicated that employers provided the  requested information only about 50 percent of the time.", "In our 2015 report, we reported that VA previously conducted audits of  beneficiaries\u2019 reported income by obtaining income verification matches  from Internal Revenue Service (IRS) earnings data through an agreement  with the Social Security Administration (SSA), but was no longer doing so  despite the standing agreement. In 2012, VA suspended income  verification matches in order to develop a new system that would allow for  more frequent, electronic information sharing. VA officials told us that they  planned to roll out a new electronic data system that would allow for  compatibility with SSA data sources in fiscal year 2015. They noted that  they planned to use this system to conduct more frequent and focused  income verifications to help ensure beneficiaries\u2019 continued entitlement.", "VA officials also anticipated being able to use the system to conduct  income verifications for initial TDIU applicants. However, at the time of  our 2015 report, VA could not provide us with a plan or timeline for  implementing this verification system. In the 2015 report, we  recommended that VA verify the self-reported income provided by  veterans (1) applying for TDIU benefits and (2) undergoing the annual  eligibility review process by comparing such information against IRS  earnings data, which VA currently has access to for this purpose.", "To date, VA is developing processes to use IRS earnings data from SSA  in verifying income eligibility requirements. According to VA, in February  2016, it launched a national workload distribution tool within its  management system to improve its overall production capacity and assist  with reaching claims processing goals that will be used in implementing  our recommendation. To determine if new beneficiaries are eligible for  TDIU benefits, VA stated that it is expanding the data-sharing agreement  with SSA to develop an upfront verification process. Specifically, when VA  receives a TDIU claim, it will electronically request the reported IRS  income information from SSA and receive a response within 16 days. In  addition, according to VA, it is also planning to begin a process for  checking incomes of veterans to determine whether they remain eligible  for TDIU benefits. Specifically, VA has reinstituted the data match  agreement with SSA that was set to expire in December 2016 to allow VA  to compare reported income earnings of TDIU beneficiaries to earnings  actually received. According to VA, it also has drafted a new guidance  manual for the annual eligibility review process. VA stated that it planned  to fully implement the upfront and annual eligibility verification processes  by the summer of 2017.", "In conclusion, in light of VA\u2019s significant financial management  challenges, we continue to be concerned about VA\u2019s ability to reasonably  ensure its resources are being used cost-effectively and efficiently.  Because VA\u2019s payment amounts are likely to increase with the increase in  appropriations for fiscal year 2017, it is critical that VA takes actions to  reduce the risks of improper payments.
