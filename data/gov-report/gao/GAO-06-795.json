This report discusses (1) EDS and ETD maintenance costs, (2) factors that played a role in these costs, and (3) the extent to which TSA conducts oversight of maintenance contracts. GAO reviewed TSA's contract files and processes for reviewing contractor cost and performance data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA obligated almost $470 million from fiscal years 2002 through 2005 for EDS and ETD maintenance, according to TSA budget documents. In fiscal year 2006, TSA estimates it will spend $199 million and has projected it will spend $234 million in fiscal year 2007. TSA was not able to provide GAO with data on the maintenance cost per machine before fiscal year 2005 because, according to TSA officials, its previous contract with Boeing to install and maintain EDS and ETD machines was not structured to capture these data. Several factors have played a role in EDS and ETD maintenance costs. According to a September 2004 Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General report, TSA did not follow sound contracting practices in administering the contract with Boeing, and TSA paid provisional award fees totaling $44 million through December 2003 without any evaluation of Boeing's performance. TSA agreed to recover any excessive award fees paid to Boeing if TSA determined that such fees were not warranted. In responding to our draft report, DHS told us that TSA and Boeing had reached an agreement in principle on this matter and that documentation was in the approval process with closure anticipated in July 2006. Moreover, TSA did not develop life-cycle cost models before any of the maintenance contracts were executed and, as a result, TSA does not have a sound estimate of maintenance costs for all the years the machines are expected to be in operation. DHS also stated in its comments on our draft report that a TSA contractor expected to complete a prototype life-cycle cost model by September 2006 and that TSA anticipated that the EDS model would be completed 12 months after the prototype was approved. Without such an analysis, TSA may not be identifying cost efficiencies and making informed procurement decisions on future purchases of EDS and ETD machines and maintenance contracts. TSA has taken actions to control costs, such as entering into firm-fixed-price contracts for maintenance starting in March 2005, which have advantages to the government because price certainty is guaranteed. Further, TSA incorporated standard performance requirements in the contracts including metrics related to machine reliability and monthly performance reviews. For EDS contractors, TSA has specified that the full agreed price would be paid only if mean downtime (i.e., the number of hours a machine is out of service in a month divided by the number of times that machine is out of service per month) requirements are met. Although TSA has policies for monitoring contracts, TSA officials provided no evidence that they are reviewing required contractor-submitted performance data, such as mean downtime data. TSA officials told GAO that they perform such reviews, but do not document their activities because there are no TSA policies and procedures requiring them to do so. As a result, without adequate documentation, TSA does not have reasonable assurance that contractors are performing as required and that full payment is justified based on meeting mean downtime requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which highlighted the  vulnerability of U.S. aircraft to acts of terrorism, Congress passed and the  President signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  (ATSA), mandating, among other things, that all checked baggage at U.S.  airports be screened using explosive detection systems by December 31,  2002. To meet this requirement, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) deployed two types of equipment to screen checked  baggage for explosives: (1) explosive detection systems (EDS) that use  specialized X-rays to detect characteristics of explosives that may be  contained in baggage as it moves along a conveyor belt and (2) explosive  trace detection (ETD) machines, whereby an individual (i.e., a baggage  screener, or transportation security officer) swabs baggage and then  inserts the swab into the ETD machine, which in turn can detect chemical  residues that may indicate the presence of explosives within a bag.", "Pursuant to ATSA, TSA assumed operational responsibility for conducting  the screening of checked baggage, which includes the procurement,  installation, and maintenance of EDS and ETD machines. By the end of  fiscal year 2006, TSA will have deployed over 1,400 EDS and 6,600 ETD  machines at baggage-screening locations in over 400 airports nationwide,  according to TSA budget documents. TSA has used contractors to perform  preventative and corrective maintenance on these EDS and ETD  machines.", "House Conference Report 109-241, which accompanied the Department of  Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2006 (Public Law 109-90) directed  that we report on the reasons for cost increases in maintaining TSA\u2019s  explosive detection systems, including TSA\u2019s contracting practices that  may have affected cost increases. With regard to this requirement, on  April 19, 2006, we provided you with information on the results of our  review (see app. I), which has been updated as appropriate in this report.  Subsequently, in May 2006, the House Appropriations Committee stated in  its report accompanying the Department of Homeland Security  Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2007 its long-standing concerns about  the increasing costs for EDS and ETD maintenance and specifically, TSA\u2019s  recovery of any excess award fees from a previous EDS and ETD  contractor. Further, the report stated that TSA should submit a report to  the House Appropriations Committee on any actions it has taken to collect  excessive award fees, how much has been received to date, and specific  plans to obligate these collections.", "This report addresses the following questions:    What are the historical, current, and projected costs for the  maintenance of EDS and ETD machines?", "What factors played a role in EDS and ETD maintenance costs, and  what factors could affect future costs?", "What has TSA done to control EDS and ETD maintenance costs?", "To what extent does TSA oversee the performance of EDS and ETD  maintenance contractors?", "To address our objectives, we reviewed TSA contract files and related cost  data, TSA processes for reviewing contract performance data, budget  documents for fiscal years 2003 through 2007, acquisition and strategic  plans, a Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of the Inspector  General (DHS OIG) report, GAO standards for internal controls, and our  previous work on TSA\u2019s acquisition function. We interviewed TSA  headquarters officials, DHS OIG officials, and EDS and ETD contractor  representatives. For purposes of our review, we focused on amounts  obligated under contracts to maintain the machines. We did not review  TSA\u2019s negotiations for maintenance services or the process for awarding  contracts. Nor did we assess other direct or indirect costs that may have  been related to TSA or DHS employees engaged in contract administration  or other related items.", "We performed our work from January 2006 through July 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["With the passage of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA)  in November 2001, TSA assumed from the Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA) the majority of the responsibility for civil aviation security,  including the commercial aviation system. ATSA required that TSA  screen 100 percent of checked baggage using explosive detection systems  by December 31, 2002. As it became apparent that certain airports would  not meet the December 2002 deadline, the Homeland Security Act of 2002  in effect extended the deadline to December 31, 2003, for noncompliant  airports. Under ATSA, TSA is responsible for the procurement,  installation, and maintenance of explosive detection systems used to  screen checked baggage for explosives. Airport operators and air carriers  continued to be responsible for processing and transporting passengers\u2019  checked baggage from the check-in counter to the airplane.", "Explosive detection systems include EDS and ETD machines (fig. 1). EDS  uses computer-aided tomography X-rays adapted from the medical field to  automatically recognize the characteristic signatures of threat explosives.  By taking the equivalent of hundreds of X-ray pictures of a bag from  different angles, EDS examines the objects inside of the baggage to  identify characteristic signatures of threat explosives. TSA has certified,  procured, and deployed EDS manufactured by three companies\u2014L-3  Communications Security and Detection Systems (L-3); General Electric  InVision, Inc. (GE InVision); and Reveal Imaging Technologies, Inc.  (Reveal). In general, EDS is used for checked baggage screening. ETD  machines work by detecting vapors and residues of explosives. Human  operators collect samples by rubbing bags with swabs, which are then  chemically analyzed in the ETD machine to identify any traces of  explosive materials. ETD machines are used for both checked baggage and  passenger carry-on baggage screening. TSA has certified, procured, and  deployed ETD machines from three manufacturers, Thermo Electron  Corporation, Smiths Detection, and General Electric Company.", "TSA\u2019s EDS and ETD maintenance contracts provide for preventative and  corrective maintenance. Preventative maintenance includes scheduled  activities, such as changing filters or cleaning brushes, to increase  machine reliability and are performed monthly, quarterly, or yearly based  on the contractors\u2019 maintenance schedules. Corrective maintenance  includes actions performed to restore machines to operating condition  after failure, such as repairing the conveyer belt mechanism after a bag  jams the machine. TSA is responsible for EDS and ETD maintenance costs  after warranties on the machines expire.", "From June 2002 through March 2005, Boeing was the prime contractor  primarily for the installation and maintenance of EDS and ETD machines  at over 400 U.S. airports. TSA officials stated that the Boeing contract was  awarded at a time when TSA was a new agency with many demands and  extremely tight schedules for meeting numerous congressional mandates  related to passenger and checked baggage screening. The cost  reimbursement contract entered into with Boeing had been competitively  bid and contained renewable options through 2007. Boeing subcontracted  for EDS maintenance through firm-fixed-price contracts with the original  EDS manufacturers, GE InVision and L-3, which performed the  maintenance on their respective EDS. Boeing subcontracted for ETD  maintenance through a firm-fixed-price contract with Siemens. Consistent  with language in the fiscal year 2005 House Appropriations Committee  report and due to TSA\u2019s acknowledgment of Boeing\u2019s failure to control  costs, TSA received DHS authorization to negotiate new EDS and ETD  maintenance contracts in January 2005.", "In March 2005, TSA signed firm-fixed-price contracts for EDS and ETD  maintenance. TSA awarded a competitively bid contract to Siemens to  provide maintenance for ETD machines. According to TSA, it negotiated  sole source contracts with L-3 and GE InVision for maintaining their  respective EDS because they are the original equipment manufacturers  and owners of the intellectual property rights of their respective EDS. In  September 2005, TSA awarded a competitively bid firm-fixed-price  contract to Reveal for both the procurement and maintenance of a  reduced size EDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["TSA obligated almost $470 million from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year  2005 for EDS and ETD maintenance, according to TSA budget documents.  In fiscal year 2006, TSA estimates it will spend $199 million and has  projected it will spend $234 million in fiscal year 2007. According to TSA  officials, in fiscal year 2004, TSA requested and received approval to  reprogram about $32 million from another account to EDS/ETD  maintenance due to higher levels of maintenance costs than expected.  Similarly, in fiscal year 2005, TSA requested and received approval to  reprogram $25 million to fund the L-3 contract and to close out the Boeing  contract. TSA was not able to provide us with data on the maintenance  cost per machine before fiscal year 2005 because, according to TSA  officials, TSA\u2019s previous contract with Boeing to maintain EDS and ETD  machines was not structured to capture these data. Table 1 identifies the  maintenance costs by type of EDS and ETD machine for fiscal years 2005  and 2006.", "TSA did not provide us with projections of EDS and ETD maintenance  costs beyond 2007. TSA officials told us that future costs will be  influenced by the number, type, quantity, and locations of machines  necessary to support system configurations at airports, such as the extent  to which EDS are integrated with airport baggage conveyor systems or are  operated in stand-alone modes. Further, TSA officials told us that future  EDS and ETD maintenance costs are dependent on decisions related to  the deployment of new technologies and the refurbishment of existing  equipment, among other things. The current contracts would have  negotiated maintenance prices per machine through March 2009, if TSA  decides to exercise option years in the contracts.", "We identified different factors that have played a role in costs to date and  that will influence future maintenance costs for EDS and ETD machines.  According to a September 2004 DHS OIG report, TSA did not follow sound  contracting practices in administering the Boeing contract, which was  primarily for the installation and maintenance of EDS and ETD machines.  According to DHS OIG officials, TSA\u2019s failure to control costs under the  Boeing contract, including the lack of sound contracting practices,  contributed to increases in maintenance costs. Among other things, the  DHS OIG report stated that TSA had paid provisional award fees totaling  $44 million through December 2003 without any evaluation of Boeing\u2019s  performance. In response to the DHS OIG, TSA agreed to recover any  excessive award fees paid to Boeing, if TSA determined that such fees  were not warranted. In commenting on our draft report in July 2006, DHS  stated that TSA has conducted a contract reconciliation process to ensure  that no fees would be paid on costs that exceeded the target due to poor  contractor performance. Further, DHS stated that TSA and Boeing had  reached an agreement in principle on this matter and that the  documentation was in the approval process with closure anticipated in  July 2006. In its report accompanying the DHS Appropriations Bill for  fiscal year 2007, the House Appropriations Committee stated its need for a  report from TSA on any actions it has taken to collect excessive award  fees, how much of the fees have been received to date, and specific plans  to obligate these collections and cited TSA\u2019s plans to use any cost  recoveries to purchase and install additional EDS. These actions were  based on the committee\u2019s long-standing concerns about the increasing  costs for EDS and ETD maintenance. In addition to matters related to the  Boeing contract, TSA officials stated that another factor contributing to  cost increases were the larger than expected number of machines that  came out of warranty and their related maintenance costs. According to  TSA officials, they were not able to determine the cost impact of these  additional machines because the Boeing contract was not structured to  provide maintenance costs for individual machines.", "With regard to future EDS and ETD maintenance costs under firm-fixed- price contracts, maintenance costs per machine will increase primarily by  an annual escalation factor in the contracts that takes into account the  employment cost index and the consumer price index, if TSA decides to  exercise contract options. In addition, future maintenance costs may be  affected by a range of factors, including the number of machines deployed  and out of warranty, conditions under which machines operate, contractor  performance requirements, the emergence of new technologies or  improved equipment, and alternative screening strategies. Lastly, life-cycle  cost estimates were not developed for the Boeing, Siemens, L-3, and GE  InVision contracts before the maintenance contracts were executed, and,  as a result, TSA did not have a sound estimate of maintenance costs for all  the years the machines are expected to be in operation. In August 2005,  TSA hired a contractor to define parameters for a life-cycle cost model,  among other things. This contract states that TSA and the contractor will  work together to ensure that the full scope of work is planned,  coordinated, and executed according to approved schedules. In  commenting on our draft report in July 2006, DHS stated that the TSA  contractor estimated completing a prototype life-cycle cost model by  September 2006. Further, DHS stated that TSA\u2019s evaluation of the  prototype would begin immediately upon delivery and that full  implementation of an EDS life-cycle cost model would be completed  within 12 months after the prototype had been approved. According to a  TSA official, the life-cycle cost model would be useful in determining  machine reliability and maintainability and to inform future contract  negotiations, such as when to replace a machine versus continuing to  repair it.", "We identified several actions TSA has taken to control EDS and ETD  maintenance costs. First, TSA entered into firm-fixed-price contracts  starting in March 2005 with maintenance contractors, which offer TSA  certain advantages over cost reimbursement contracts because price  certainty is guaranteed for up to 5 years if TSA exercises options to 2009.  Also, TSA included several performance requirements in the Siemens, L-3,  GE InVision, and Reveal contracts, including the collection of metrics  related to machine reliability, maintainability, and availability and  required specific cost data related to maintenance and repair. TSA officials  told us that these data will assist them in monitoring the contractor  performance as well as informing future contract negotiations for  equipment and maintenance. These contracts also stipulate that  maintenance contractors meet monthly with TSA to review all pertinent  technical schedules and cost aspects of contracts. TSA also incorporated  provisions in the L-3 and GE InVision contracts to specify that the agreed  price for maintaining EDS would be paid only if the contractor performs  within specified mean downtime (MDT) requirements. Contractors  submit monthly invoices for 95 percent of the negotiated contract price for  the month and then submit a MDT report to justify the additional 5  percent. Consequently, if the contractor fails to fulfill the MDT  requirements, it is penalized 5 percent of the negotiated monthly  maintenance price. As of February 2006, neither GE InVision nor L-3 had  been penalized for missing their MDT requirements. The allowable MDT is  lowered from 2005 to subsequent renewable years in the contract, as  shown in table 2.", "With regard to TSA\u2019s oversight of EDS and ETD contractor performance,  TSA\u2019s acquisition policies and GAO standards for internal controls call  for documenting transactions and other significant events, such as  monitoring contractor activities. The failure of TSA to develop internal  controls and performance measures has been recognized by other GAO  and DHS OIG reviews. TSA has policies and procedures for monitoring  its contracts and has included contractor performance requirements in the  current EDS and ETD maintenance contracts. However, TSA officials  provided no evidence that they are reviewing maintenance cost data  provided by the contractor because they are not required to document  such activities. For example, even though TSA officials told us that they  are reviewing required contractor data, including actual maintenance costs  related to labor hours and costs associated with replacing and shipping  machine parts, they did not have any documentation to support this. TSA  officials told us that they have begun to capture these data to assist them  in any future contract negotiations.", "Further, TSA officials provided no evidence that performance data for  corrective and preventative maintenance required under contracts are  being reviewed. TSA officials told us that they perform such reviews, but  do not document their activities since there are no TSA policies or  procedures requiring them to do so. Therefore, TSA could not provide  assurance that contractors are complying with contract performance  requirements. For example, although TSA documents monthly meetings  with contractors to discuss performance data, TSA officials did not  provide evidence that they independently determine the reliability and  validity of data required by the contracts, such as mean time between  failures and mean time to repair, which are important to making informed  decisions about future purchases of EDS and ETD equipment and their  associated maintenance costs. Further, TSA officials provided no evidence  that they ensure that contractors are performing scheduled preventative  maintenance. TSA officials told us that they review the contractor- submitted data to determine whether contractors are fulfilling their  contractual obligations, but do not document their activities because there  are no TSA policies or procedures to require such documentation.", "Additionally, for EDS contracts with possible financial penalties, TSA  officials told us that they review contractor-submitted mean downtime  data on a monthly basis to determine the reliability and validity of the data  and to determine whether contractors are meeting contract provisions or  should be penalized. However, TSA officials do not document these  activities because there are no TSA policies or procedures requiring them  to do so. As a result, without adequate documentation, there is no  assurance as to whether or not contractors are meeting contract  provisions or that TSA has ensured that it is making appropriate payments  for services provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The cost of maintaining checked baggage-screening equipment has  increased as more EDS and ETD machines have been deployed and  warranties expire. TSA\u2019s move in March 2005 to firm-fixed-price  maintenance contracts for EDS and ETD maintenance was advantageous  to the government in that it helps control present and future maintenance  costs. Firm-fixed-price contracts also help ensure price certainty and  therefore are more predictable. However, unresolved issues remain with  the past contractor, specifically fees awarded to former contractor Boeing  that may have been excessive due to a lack of timely evaluation of the  contractor\u2019s performance. The House Appropriations Committee has  expressed concern about these unresolved issues; specifically, what  actions TSA has taken to recover these excessive fees, and the extent to  which any collections might impact future TSA obligations. Closing out the  Boeing contract is essential to resolving these issues. In responding to our  draft report, DHS stated that the completion of an EDS life-cycle cost is  over a year away. Absent such a life-cycle cost model, TSA may not be  identifying cost efficiencies and making informed procurement decisions  regarding the future purchase of EDS and ETD machines and maintenance  contracts. Further, TSA must provide evidence of its reviews and analyses  of contractor-submitted data and perform analyses of contractor data to  determine the reliability and validity of the data and to provide assurance  of compliance with contract performance requirements and internal  control standards.
