These services differ from investment options offered within 401(k) plans. Because little is known about whether managed accounts are advantageous for participants and whether sponsors understand their own role and potential risks, GAO was asked to review these services.", "GAO examined (1) how providers structure managed accounts, (2) their advantages and disadvantages for participants, and (3) challenges sponsors face in selecting and overseeing providers. In conducting this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations and surveyed plan sponsors. GAO interviewed government officials, industry representatives, other service providers, and 12 plan sponsors of varying sizes and other characteristics. GAO also conducted case studies of eight managed account providers with varying characteristics by, in part, reviewing required government filings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's review of eight managed account providers who, in 2013, represented an estimated 95 percent of the industry involved in defined contribution plans, showed that they varied in how they structured managed accounts, including the services they offered and their reported fiduciary roles. Providers used varying strategies to manage participants' accounts and incorporated varying types and amounts of participant information. In addition, GAO found some variation in how providers reported their fiduciary roles. One of the eight providers GAO reviewed had a different fiduciary role than the other seven providers, which could ultimately provide less liability protection for sponsors for the consequences of the provider's choices. The Department of Labor (DOL) requires managed account providers who offer services to defaulted participants to generally have the type of fiduciary role that provides certain levels of fiduciary protection for sponsors and assurances to participants of the provider's qualifications. DOL does not have a similar explicit requirement for providers who offer services to participants on an opt-in basis. Absent explicit requirements from DOL, some providers may actively choose to structure their services to limit the fiduciary liability protection they offer.", "According to providers and sponsors, participants in managed accounts receive improved diversification and experience higher savings rates compared to those not enrolled in the service; however, these advantages can be offset by paying additional fees over time. Providers charge additional fees for managed accounts that range from $8 to $100 on every $10,000 in a participant's account. As a result, some participants pay a low fee each year while others pay a comparatively large fee on their account balance. Using the limited fee and performance data available, GAO found that the potential long-term effect of managed accounts could vary significantly, sometimes resulting in managed account participants paying substantial additional fees and experiencing lower account balances over time compared to other managed account participants. Further, participants generally do not receive performance and benchmarking information for their managed accounts. Without this information, participants cannot accurately evaluate the service and make effective decisions about their retirement investments. Even though DOL has required disclosure of similar information for 401(k) plan investments, it generally does not require sponsors to provide this type of information for managed accounts.", "Sponsors are challenged by insufficient guidance and inconsistent performance information when selecting and overseeing managed account providers. DOL has not issued guidance specific to managed accounts on how sponsors should select and oversee providers, as it has done for other funds. GAO found that the absence of guidance for managed accounts has led to inconsistency in sponsors' procedures for selecting and overseeing providers. Without better guidance, plan sponsors may be unable to select a provider who offers an effective service for a reasonable fee. In addition, DOL generally does not require providers to furnish sponsors with performance and benchmarking information for managed accounts, as it does for investments available in a plan, although some providers do furnish similar information. Without this information, sponsors cannot effectively compare providers when making a selection or determine whether managed accounts are positively affecting participants' retirement savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Among other things, GAO recommends that DOL consider provider fiduciary roles, require disclosure of performance and benchmarking information to plan sponsors and participants, and provide guidance to help sponsors better select and oversee managed account providers.

In response, plan sponsors have  increasingly offered managed account services to their participants. In  managed accounts, service providers make investment and portfolio  decisions for participants in employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. Managed  accounts typically provide customized investment management of  participants\u2019 401(k) accounts as they accumulate, and sometimes as they  spend down, their retirement savings. Similar investment arrangements  have been offered to retail investors since the 1970s, but managed  accounts have gained popularity in 401(k) plans in part due to regulations  issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) in 2007 providing that certain  managed accounts could be used as \u201cqualified default investment  alternatives\u201d in 401(k) plans. We estimate that the total amount of defined  contribution plan assets in managed accounts exceeded $100 billion at  the end of 2012. Demand for managed accounts may continue to grow,  as these services may be attractive to the many 401(k) plan participants  who may lack the knowledge or initiative to make prudent choices about  how much to contribute and how to direct their assets among investment  options in their plan. However, the increasing trend to offer managed  accounts in 401(k) plans has raised some concerns about whether such  services are advantageous for participants in terms of service and cost  and whether sponsors understand their role in overseeing the use of  managed accounts. In light of these concerns, you asked us to examine  managed accounts in 401(k) plans.", "In conducting this work, we answered the following questions:  1)  How do service providers structure managed accounts?  2)  What are the advantages and disadvantages of managed  accounts for 401(k) plan participants?  3)  What challenges, if any, do plan sponsors face in selecting and  overseeing managed account providers?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed relevant research and federal  laws, regulations, and guidance on managed accounts in 401(k) plans.  To examine the key issues related to managed accounts in 401(k) plans  and gather data about their prevalence and performance, we conducted  in-depth case studies of eight selected managed account providers that,  according to our estimates, represented over 95 percent of the managed  account industry in defined contribution plans, as measured by assets  under management in 2013. We selected providers based on their size,  location, and legal and fee structures. We also interviewed industry  representatives\u2014including academics, industry research firms, and  participant advocacy groups\u2014and government officials, including officials  from DOL\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA). To gain  additional information on the structure of managed accounts in 401(k)  plans and the role of service providers, we reviewed Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) filings for the eight managed account  providers in our case studies and 22 other providers we identified during  the course of our work. As part of our case studies, we reviewed available  documentation on the structure of managed accounts. To further  understand the different methodologies and structures of managed  accounts, we developed and submitted participant scenarios to the eight  providers and asked them to provide hypothetical asset allocations for  those participants, which seven of them completed and returned to us. To  identify the advantages and disadvantages of managed accounts for  401(k) plan participants and any challenges sponsors face in selecting  and overseeing managed account providers, we reviewed relevant  documentation such as quarterly managed account reports to plan  sponsors and conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 plan  sponsors. To identify sponsors for interviews, we conducted a non- generalizable survey facilitated through PLANSPONSOR. Based on their  responses to the survey, we selected sponsors with a variety of  characteristics, such as plan size and managed account provider.  Further, we used publicly available data to develop illustrations of how  various factors may affect the outcomes of participants in managed  accounts. To assess the reliability of these data, we considered the  reliability and familiarity of the source of the data or information and, when  necessary, interviewed representatives of those sources about their  methods, internal controls, and results. We found these data sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. For more information on the data and other  methodologies we used see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Typically, 401(k) plans\u2014the predominant type of defined  contribution plan in the United States\u2014allow employees who participate  in the plan to specify the size of their contributions and direct their assets  to one or more investments among the options offered within the plan.  Investment options generally include mutual funds, stable value funds,  company stock, and money market funds. To help participants make  optimal investment choices, an increasing number of plans are offering  professionally managed allocations\u2014including managed accounts\u2014in  their 401(k) plan lineups.", "Managed accounts are investment services under which providers make  investment decisions for specific participants to allocate their retirement  savings among a mix of assets they have determined to be appropriate  for the participant based on their personal information.

Target date funds (also known as life cycle funds) are products that  determine an asset allocation that would be appropriate for a participant  of a certain age or retirement date and adjust that allocation so it  becomes more conservative as the fund approaches its intended target  date. Target date funds do not place participants into an asset  allocation; instead, participants generally self-select into a target date  fund they feel is appropriate for them based on the fund\u2019s predetermined  glide path that governs asset allocation. Balanced funds are products that  generally invest in a fixed mix of assets (e.g., 60 percent equity and 40  percent fixed income assets). While target date funds manage the fund to  reach a target date, managed accounts may consider other, more  personalized factors such as a participant\u2019s stated risk tolerance, even  though they are not required to do so. As shown in figure 2, managed  accounts may offer higher levels of personalization than other types of  professionally managed allocations.", "Managed accounts are generally considered to be an investment  service\u2014not one of the plan\u2019s investment options\u2014while target date  funds are considered to be investment options. In the latter, participants  can invest all or a portion of their 401(k) plan contributions in a target date  fund, but generally cannot directly invest in a managed account. Instead,  the role of the participant is to enroll in the managed account service, or  be defaulted into it, generally relinquishing their ability to make investment  decisions unless they disenroll from, or opt out of, the managed account.  As shown in figure 3, managed account providers decide how to invest  contributions, generally among the investment options available in a  401(k) plan, and then manage these investments over time to help  participants reach their retirement savings goals.

DOL designated three categories of investments that  may be eligible as QDIAs if all requirements of the QDIA regulation have  been satisfied\u2014these categories generally include: (1) an investment  product or model portfolio that is designed to become more conservative  as the participant\u2019s age increases (e.g., a target date or lifecycle fund); (2)  an investment product or model portfolio that is designed with a mix of  equity and fixed income exposures appropriate for the participants of the  plan as a whole (e.g., a balanced fund); and (3) an investment  management service that uses investment alternatives available in the  plan and is designed to become more conservative as the participant\u2019s  age increases (e.g., a managed account). DOL regulations indicate that  plan fiduciaries who comply with the QDIA regulation will not be liable for  any loss to participants that occurs as a result of the investment of their  assets in a QDIA, including investments made through managed account  arrangements that satisfy the conditions of the QDIA regulation.  However, plan fiduciaries remain responsible for the prudent selection  and monitoring of any QDIA offered by the plan.

Managed account providers generally  help participants by constructing portfolios that attempt to provide  maximum expected returns with a given level of risk, but their strategies  can range from formal to informal. The formal way of determining this  type of portfolio is called \u201cmean-variance optimization\u201d (MVO), under  which providers plot risk and return characteristics of all combinations of  investment options in the plan and choose the portfolio that maximizes  expected return for a given level of risk. There are a number of specific  techniques that managed account providers can apply to improve the  quality and sophistication of asset allocations, including Monte Carlo  simulation. However, some providers incorporated less formal ways of  achieving a diversified portfolio, such as active management and  experience-based methods. The eight providers in our case studies use  varying strategies and participant goals to develop and adjust asset  allocations for participants, as shown in table 1. As a result, participants  with similar characteristics may end up with different asset allocations.", "Providers\u2019 use of different asset allocation strategies leads to variation in  the asset allocations participants actually experience.

The other six providers  also offer a personalized service that takes into account additional  personal information to inform asset allocations, such as risk tolerance or  spousal assets. Providers that offer a personalized service reported that  personalization could lead to better asset allocation for participants, but  they also reported that generally fewer than one-third, and sometimes  fewer than 15 percent, of participants furnish this personalized  information. As a result, some industry representatives felt that  participants may not be getting the full value of the service for which they  are paying. For example, participants who are defaulted into managed  accounts that offer a highly personalized service run the risk of paying for  services they are not using if they are disengaged from their retirement  investments. As shown in table 2, we found that among five of the seven  providers that furnished asset allocations for our hypothetical scenarios,  there was little relationship between the level of personalization and the  fee they charged to participants for the managed account service.", "Some managed account providers\u2019 services may become more beneficial  as participants age or as their situations become more complex because  personalization seeks to create a tailored asset allocation for each  participant. Such an individualized approach could even mean that older  participants who are close to retirement and very young participants just  starting their careers could be placed in equally risky allocations based on  their personalized circumstances.

For example, in two  recent reports on managed account performance, one record keeper  concluded that the expanded use of professionally managed allocations,  including managed accounts, is contributing to a reduction in extreme risk  and return outcomes for participants, and is also gradually mitigating  concerns about the quality of portfolio decision-making within defined  contribution plans. Managed account providers in our eight case studies  also claim that the increased personalization and more frequent  rebalancing of managed accounts create an appropriately diversified  portfolio that better meets a participant\u2019s retirement goals than target date  funds or balanced funds. According to these providers, periodic  rebalancing combats participant inertia, one of the main problems with a  self-directed 401(k) account, and the failure to update investment  strategies when financial circumstances change over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Encourage Larger Contributions", "paragraphs": ["Several managed account providers told us that another advantage of  managed accounts is the tendency for participants to save more for  retirement compared to those who are not enrolled in the service. For  example, in a study of managed accounts, a provider reported that  participants in plans for which this provider offers the service contributed  $2,070 more on average in 2012 than participants who self-directed  investments in their 401(k) accounts (1.9 percent of salary more in  contributions on average than participants who self-direct 401(k)  investments). This provider noted that managed account participants  are better at taking advantage of their plan\u2019s matching contribution than  participants who self-direct their 401(k) investments. For example, they  found that 69 percent of managed account participants contributed at  least to the level of the maximum employer matching contribution, while  only 62 percent of participants who self-directed investments contributed  to this level. This provider said that communication with managed account  participants can lead to increased savings rates when they are  encouraged to increase savings rates by at least 2 percentage points and  to save at least to the point where they receive the full employer match, if  such a match exists. Another service provider told us that it offers an  online calculator that managed account participants can use to  understand their retirement readiness.

Participants generally receive retirement readiness statements  that can help them assess whether they are on track to reach their  retirement goals, and the statements generally contain information about  their retirement investments, savings rate, asset allocations, and  projected retirement income. These statements help participants  understand the likelihood of reaching their retirement goals given their  current investment strategy and whether they should consider increasing  their savings rates or changing risk tolerances for their investments. In  some cases, these statements may provide participants with their first  look in one document at the overall progress they are making toward their  retirement goals. As shown in table 3, our review of three providers\u2019  statements shows that they use different metrics on participant readiness  statements to evaluate participants\u2019 retirement prospects. For example,  each statement provided participants with information on their retirement  goals and risk tolerance, and a projection of their future retirement income  to demonstrate the value of the service.", "Similar advantages, however, can be achieved through other retirement  investment vehicles outside of a managed account and without paying the  additional managed account fee. For example, in one recent study, a  record keeper that offers managed accounts through its platform showed  that there are other ways to diversify using professionally managed  allocations, such as target date funds, which can be less costly.  Although managed account providers may encourage participants to save  more and review their progress towards achieving a secure retirement,  participants still have to pay attention to these features of the managed  account for it to provide value.

Because of  these additional fees, 401(k) plan participants who do not receive higher  investment returns from the managed account services risk losing money  over time. Some managed account providers and record keepers have  reported that managed account participants earn higher returns than  participants who self-direct their 401(k) plan investments, which may help  participants offset the additional fee charged. For example, one provider  told us that participants enrolled in managed accounts saw about 1.82  percentage points better performance per year, net of fees, compared to  participants without managed accounts. Given these higher returns, this  provider projects that a 25-year-old enrolled in its managed account could  potentially see up to 35 percent more income at retirement than a  participant not enrolled in the service, according to this provider\u2019s  calculations. Another provider reported that the portfolios of participants  who were defaulted into managed accounts were projected to receive  returns of nearly 1 percentage point more annually, net of fees, after the  provider made allocation changes to the participants\u2019 portfolios.", "However, the higher rates of return projected by managed account  providers may not always be achievable. For instance, we found limited  data from one record keeper that published returns for managed account  participants that were generally less than or equal to the returns of other  professionally managed allocations (a single target date fund or balanced  fund) as shown in figure 8.", "We used these and other returns data published by this record keeper to  illustrate the potential effect over 20 years of different rates of return on  participant account balances. On the lower end, this record keeper  reported that, over a recent 5-year period, 25 percent of its participants  earned annualized returns of -0.1 percent or less, not even making up the  cost of the additional fee for the service. On the higher end, the record  keeper reported that, over a slightly different 5-year period, 25 percent of  its participants earned annualized returns of 2.4 percent or higher for the  service. These actual returns illustrate the substantial degree to which  returns can vary. If such a 2.5 percentage point difference (between these  higher and lower reported managed account rates of return of 2.4 percent  and -0.1 percent, respectively) were to persist over 20 years, a participant  earning the higher managed account rate of return could have nearly 26  percent more in their ending account balance at the end of 20 years than  a participant earning the lower rate of return in their managed account.  As shown in Figure 9, using these actual rates of return experienced by  participants in managed accounts, such a variation in rates of return can  substantially affect participant account balances over 20 years.", "Further, this record keeper\u2019s published data on managed account rates of  return were net of fees\u2014rates of return would be higher if participants did  not pay the additional fee for the service. For example, using this record  keeper\u2019s average fee rate in our analysis, we estimate that a  hypothetical managed account participant who earned a higher rate of  return of 2.4 percent will pay $8,400 more in additional fees over 20 years  than a participant who self-directs investments in their 401(k) account and  does not pay the additional fee. To illustrate the potential effect that fees  could have on a hypothetical participant\u2019s account balance over 20 years,  we used a higher fee of 1 percent reported to us by one provider to  estimate that a participant would pay $14,000 in additional fees compared  to a participant who self-directs investments in their 401(k) account over  the same period. However, based on the reported performance data we  found, there is no guarantee that participants will earn a higher rate of  return with a managed account compared to the returns for other  professionally managed allocations or self-directed 401(k) accounts. The  limited performance data we reviewed show that in most cases, managed  accounts underperformed these other professionally managed allocations  and self-directed 401(k) accounts over a 5-year period. However,  managed account participants with lower rates of return still pay  substantial additional fees for the service. To further illustrate the effect of  fees on account balances, a hypothetical participant who earns a lower  managed account rate of return of -0.1 percent would pay $6,900 in  additional fees using this record keeper\u2019s average fee over 20 years  compared to a participant who self-directed investments in their 401(k)  account, and the additional fees would increase to $11,500 at the 1  percent fee level using the lower rate of return.", "The additional managed account fees, which are charged to participants  over and above investment management and administrative fees, can  vary substantially, and as a result, some participants pay no fees, others  pay a flat fee each year, and still others pay a comparatively large  percentage of their account balance for generally similar services from  managed account providers. In our case studies, we reviewed the  additional fees charged to participants for the service. One managed  account provider charges a flat rate and fees for the other seven  providers ranged from 0.08 to 1 percent of the participant\u2019s account  balance annually, or $8 to $100 on every $10,000 in a participant\u2019s  account. Therefore, participants with similar balances but different  providers can pay different fees. As shown in table 4, participants with an  account balance of $10,000 whose provider charges the highest fee may  pay 12.5 times as much as participants whose provider charges the  lowest fee ($100 and $8, respectively). However, participants with an  account balance of $500,000 may pay up to 250 times as much as other  participants but one is subject to a provider who charges the highest fees  while the other is at the lowest fee provider ($5,000 and $20,  respectively).", "Participants with large account balances whose managed account  provider caps fees at a certain level benefit more than similar participants  whose fees are not capped. Of the providers we reviewed who charge  variable fees, one provider caps the fee at a certain amount per year. For  example, this provider charges 0.25 percent or $25 for every $10,000 in a  participant\u2019s account, with a maximum of $250 per year, so participants  who use this provider only pay fees on the first $100,000 in their  accounts. As a result, the difference in fees paid by participants using this  provider, or providers who charge flat rates, widens as participant account  balances increase.", "Plan characteristics can affect fees participants pay to managed account  providers. For example, at one managed account provider included in our  review, a participant in a small plan may pay more for a managed account  than a similar participant in a large plan. Similarly, a participant in a plan  with high enrollment or that uses managed accounts as the default may  pay less for a managed account than a participant with the same balance  in a plan with low enrollment or that offers managed accounts as an opt-in  service. We also found through our case studies that fees can vary based  on factors beyond the plan\u2019s characteristics, such as the types of  providers involved in offering the managed account, the size of participant  account balances, and the amount of revenue sharing received by the  managed account provider. Fees calculated through revenue sharing can  vary in accordance with the investment options the plan sponsor chooses  to include in the plan and the amount of revenue the provider actually  receives from these options. In these cases, initial fee estimates for the  managed account may differ from actual fees they pay. In addition, some  plan sponsors also pay fees to offer managed account services, but since  these fees may be paid out of plan assets, participants in these plans  may pay more than participants in plans that do not pay fees.", "As shown above, paying higher additional fees to a provider for a  managed account service offers no guarantee of higher rates of return  compared to other providers or compared to the reported rates of return  earned by participants who invest in other professionally managed  allocations or who self-direct investments in their 401(k) accounts.  Because the additional fee is charged to participants on a recurring basis,  such as every quarter or year, the costs incurred over time by participants  who use managed accounts can accumulate. We used fee data reported  by managed account providers to illustrate the effect that different fees  could have on a participant\u2019s managed account balance over time. As  shown in figure 10, a hypothetical participant in our illustration who is  charged an additional annual fee of 1 percent of their account balance for  their managed account may pay nearly $13,000 more over 20 years than  they would have paid in any other investment without the managed  account fee. This compares to about $1,100 in additional fees paid over  20 years by a participant who is charged an annual fee of 0.08 percent for  a managed account, the lowest variable non-capped fee we found."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of a Requirement for Performance and Benchmarking Information Inhibits Participant Evaluation of Managed Accounts", "paragraphs": ["The limited availability of returns-based performance data and lack of  standard metrics can also offset the reported advantages of managed  accounts. In its final rule on participant-level disclosures, DOL requires  that sponsors disclose performance data to help participants make  informed decisions about the management of their individual accounts  and the investment of their retirement savings, and that sponsors provide  appropriate benchmarks to help participants assess the various  investment options available under their plan. By requiring sponsors to  provide participants with performance data and benchmarking information  for 401(k) investments, DOL intends to reduce the time required for  participants to collect and organize fee and performance information and  increase participants\u2019 efficiency in choosing investment options that will  provide the highest value.", "Since the applicability date of the participant-level disclosure regulation,  for most plans in 2012, DOL has required plan sponsors to provide  participants who invest in a \u201cdesignated investment alternative\u201d in their  401(k) account with an annual disclosure describing the fees, expenses,  and performance of each of the investment funds available to them in the  plan. DOL defines a designated investment alternative as \u201cany  investment alternative designated by the plan into which participants and  beneficiaries may direct the investment of assets held in, or contributed  to, their individual accounts.\u201d For designated investment alternatives,  plan sponsors are required to disclose to participants specific information  identifying the funds available to them in the plan, results-based  performance information over varying time periods, and performance  benchmarks in a way that invites comparison with established  benchmarks and market indexes, as shown in table 5.", "Despite DOL\u2019s requirements for designated investment alternatives, with  respect to managed accounts offered either as an opt-in or default  service, plan sponsors are generally only required to disclose to 401(k)  participants the identity of the managed account provider or investment  manager and any fees and expenses associated with its management.  Neither plan sponsors nor managed account providers are required to  isolate within the participant-level disclosure investment-related  information on the individual funds that comprise the participant\u2019s  managed account or present aggregate performance of the account for a  given period. DOL generally does not consider most managed accounts  to be \u201cdesignated investment alternatives.\u201d Instead, according to DOL,  managed account providers are generally considered to be \u201cdesignated  investment managers\u201d as they provide a service to participants rather  than an investment option, such as a mutual fund. As a result, the  investment\u2013related information required in DOL\u2019s participant-level  disclosure regulation does not apply to investment services, such as  many managed accounts.", "Because DOL does not require plan sponsors to provide participants  information on the performance of their managed accounts or to compare  performance against a set of standard benchmarks, it is potentially  difficult for participants to evaluate whether the additional fees for  managed accounts are worth paying, considering the effect of fees on  returns and retirement account balances. As a result, participants may be  unable to effectively assess the overall value of the service and to  compare performance against a set of standard benchmarks. Not all of  the retirement readiness statements we reviewed included returns-based  performance data or information on the amount of additional fees the  participant had paid for the service. Some managed account providers  did include projections of a participant\u2019s future retirement income on these  statements. Even though the projections may be based on sound  methodologies, if standard returns-based performance data are absent  from these statements, participants will have to rely primarily on these  projections to gauge the overall value of the service. Without performance  and benchmarking information presented in a format designed to help  participants compare and evaluate their managed account, participants  cannot make informed decisions about the managed account service.", "Likewise, with respect to QDIAs, DOL only requires plan sponsors to  disclose to participants a description of each investment\u2019s objectives, risk  and return characteristics (if applicable), fees and expenses paid to  providers, and the right of the participant to elect not to have such  contributions made on their behalf, among other things. In 2010, DOL  proposed amendments to its QDIA disclosure requirements that would,  with respect to target date funds or similar investments, require sponsors  to provide participants historical returns-based performance data (e.g., 1-,  5-, and 10-year returns). According to DOL officials, the proposed QDIA  rule change may apply to managed accounts offered as a QDIA to  participants. However, the proposed requirements as written may be  difficult for plan sponsors to implement because they are not tailored  specifically for managed accounts. One participant advocacy group  noted that, without similar information, participants may not be able to  effectively assess managed account performance over time and compare  that performance to other professionally managed investment options  available under the plan or across different managed account providers.", "As mentioned above, DOL affirms in the participant-level disclosure  regulation that performance data are required to help participants in  401(k) plans to make informed decisions about managing investments in  their retirement accounts, and that appropriate benchmarks are helpful  tools participants can use to assess the various investment options  available under their plan. The benefits outlined in the participant-level  disclosure regulation would also apply to the proposed changes to the  QDIA regulation. Specifically, DOL expects that the enhanced disclosures  required by the proposed regulation would benefit participants by  providing them with critical information they need to evaluate the quality  of investments offered as QDIAs, leading to improved investment results  and retirement planning decisions by participants. DOL believes that the  disclosures under the proposed regulation, combined with performance  reporting requirement in the participant-level disclosure regulation, would  allow participants to determine whether efficiencies gained through these  investments are worth the price differential participants generally would  pay for such funds. However, absent DOL requirements that plan  sponsors use standard metrics to report on the performance of managed  accounts for participants who are defaulted into the service as a QDIA, it  would be potentially difficult for these participants to evaluate the effect  that additional fees could have on the performance of their managed  accounts, including how the additional fees could affect returns and  retirement account balances, possibly eroding the value of the service  over time for those participants.", "Improved performance reporting could help participants understand the  risks associated with the additional fees and possible effects on their  retirement account balances if the managed accounts underperform,  which is critical information that participants could use to take action to  mitigate those risks. Discussions with managed account providers  suggest that returns-based performance reports and custom  benchmarking can be provided to managed account participants. For  example, as shown in figure 11, one managed account provider we spoke  to already furnishes participants access to online reports that include  returns-based performance data and custom benchmarks, which can  allow them to compare performance for a given period with an  established equity index and bond index. Some providers told us that it  would be difficult to provide participants in managed accounts with  performance information and benchmarks because their retirement  portfolios contain highly personalized asset allocations. While it may be  more challenging for providers to furnish performance information on  personalized managed accounts compared to model portfolios, we  identified one participant statement that included performance information  from a provider who personalizes asset allocations for their participants\u2019  retirement portfolios.", "The provider told us that the blended custom benchmark described in  figure 11 allows participants to more accurately evaluate and compare the  aggregate performance of the different individual funds held in their  managed account because the benchmark is linked to the participant\u2019s  risk tolerance. The online report also describes any positive or negative  excess returns for the portfolio relative to the return of the custom  benchmark, net of fees. The provider said that the excess return statistic  is representative of the value that the provider or portfolio manager has  added or subtracted from the participant\u2019s portfolio return for a given  period. Another managed account provider furnishes retirement  readiness statements that include returns-based information for each of  the funds in participants\u2019 accounts.

Some record keepers voluntarily offered sponsors more  managed account provider options when sponsors asked for them.

In addition, record keepers may offer a limited number  of providers to avoid losing revenue and because they evaluate a  provider before deciding to offer its managed account service. Such steps  include reviewing the provider\u2019s investment strategy and assessing how  the provider interacts with participants. One managed account provider  estimated that sponsors might have to spend $400,000 and wait more  than a year before offering the provider\u2019s managed account to plan  participants if it is not already available on their record keeper\u2019s system.

Supplementing this guidance by requiring providers to furnish  consistent performance information to sponsors so that they can more  effectively compare providers can assist sponsors in their efforts to  provide a beneficial service that could help preserve and potentially  enhance participants\u2019 retirement security.", "Finally, DOL can also help participants evaluate whether their managed  account service is beneficial. Without standardized performance and  benchmarking information, participants may not be able to effectively  assess the performance of their managed account and determine  whether the additional fee for the service is worth paying. For participants  who opt into managed accounts, this information could help them more  effectively assess the performance of their managed account and  compare that performance to other professionally managed alternatives  that may be less expensive, such as target date funds. Alternatively, for  participants who are defaulted into managed accounts, this information  could be valuable when they start to pay more attention to their retirement  savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better protect plan sponsors and participants who use managed  account services, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the  Assistant Secretary for the Employee Benefits Security Administration  (EBSA) to:  a)  Review provider practices related to additional managed account  services offered to participants in or near retirement, with the aim  of determining whether conflicts of interest exist and, if it  determines it is necessary, taking the appropriate action to  remedy the issue.  b)  Consider the fiduciary status of managed account providers when  they offer services on an opt-in basis and, if necessary, make  regulatory changes or provide guidance to address any issues.", "To help sponsors who offer managed account services or who are  considering doing so better protect their 401(k) plan participants, we  recommend that the Secretary of Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for  EBSA to:  c)  Provide guidance to plan sponsors for selecting and overseeing  managed account providers that addresses: (1) the importance of  considering multiple providers when choosing a managed account  provider, (2) factors to consider when offering managed accounts  as a QDIA or on an opt-in basis, and (3) approaches for  evaluating the services of managed account providers.  d)  Require plan sponsors to request from record keepers more than  one managed account provider option, and notify the Department  of Labor if record keepers fail to do so.", "To help sponsors and participants more effectively assess the  performance of managed accounts, we recommend that the Secretary of  Labor direct the Assistant Secretary for EBSA to:  e)  Amend participant disclosure regulations to require that sponsors  furnish standardized performance and benchmarking information  to participants. To accomplish this, EBSA could promulgate  regulations that would require sponsors who offer managed  account services to provide their participants with standardized  performance and benchmarking information on managed  accounts. For example, sponsors could periodically furnish each  managed account participant with the aggregate performance of  participants\u2019 managed account portfolios and returns for broad- based securities market indexes and applicable customized  benchmarks, based on those benchmarks provided for the plan\u2019s  designated investment alternatives.  f)  Amend service provider disclosure regulations to require that  providers furnish standardized performance and benchmarking  information to sponsors. To accomplish this, EBSA could  promulgate regulations that would require service providers to  disclose to sponsors standardized performance and  benchmarking information on managed accounts. For example,  providers could, prior to selection and periodically thereafter, as  applicable, furnish sponsors with aggregated returns for  generalized conservative, moderate, and aggressive portfolios,  actual managed account portfolio returns for each of the sponsor\u2019s  participants, and returns for broad-based securities market  indexes and applicable customized benchmarks, based on those  benchmarks provided for the plan\u2019s designated investment  alternatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor, the  Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission,  and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for review and comment.

Regarding our second recommendation, to consider the  fiduciary status of managed account providers when they offer services  on an opt-in basis, DOL agreed to review existing guidance and consider  whether additional guidance is needed in light of the various business  models we described. By considering managed account service provider  practices and fiduciary roles in its current efforts and taking any  necessary action to address potential issues, we believe DOL will help  ensure that sponsors and participants receive unconflicted managed  account services from qualified managers.", "DOL also agreed to consider our other recommendations in connection  with its current regulatory project on standards for brokerage windows in  participant-directed individual account plans. We believe that this project  may be a good starting point for requesting additional information and  considering adjustments to those managed account services participants  obtain from advisers through brokerage windows. As we noted in our  report, we did not include these types of managed accounts in our review  because the plan sponsor is not usually involved in the selection and  monitoring of these advisers. Since participants can obtain managed  account services without using a brokerage window, we encourage DOL  to also consider our third and fourth recommendations outside of the  context of brokerage windows. Providing guidance to sponsors for  selecting and overseeing managed account providers, as suggested by  our third recommendation, may help sponsors understand their fiduciary  responsibilities with respect to managed accounts. Similarly, requiring  plan sponsors to ask for more than one choice of managed account  provider, as suggested by our fourth recommendation, could encourage  record keepers to offer additional choices. By taking the steps outlined in  these recommendations, DOL can help ensure that participants are being  offered effective managed account services for reasonable fees.", "With respect to our recommendation requiring plan sponsors to ask for  more than one choice of managed account provider, DOL noted that it  needs to review the extent of its legal authority to effectively require plans  to have more than one managed account service provider. We continue  to believe that the action we suggest in our recommendation\u2014that DOL  simply require plan sponsors to ask for more than one choice of a  provider, which is slightly different than how DOL has characterized it\u2014 may be an effective method of broadening plan sponsors\u2019 choices of  managed account providers.
