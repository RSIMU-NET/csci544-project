The combined damage to these two ships, which totaled about $21.6 million, was caused by two mines\u2014one estimated to cost $10,000 and the other about $1,500. Naval mines are extremely economical weapons and are readily available on the world\u2019s arms market.", "The Navy has identified naval mine countermeasures\u2014the ability to detect and disable enemy sea mines\u2014as a critical element for establishing maritime superiority to ensure access to ports, keep sea lanes open, and support amphibious assaults. During the Cold War, the major factor in developing mine countermeasures capabilities was the ability to clear Soviet-laid mines from U.S. harbors to enable U.S. ships to break out of U.S. ports. With the fall of the Soviet Union, however, the threat of enemy mining in U.S. coastal waters has greatly diminished.

The first major lesson was that the Navy lacked a unified command structure. The mine countermeasures commander\u2019s staff consisted of 23 individuals assembled from 21 different commands, resulting in a command staff that was ill-prepared for its task. Fortunately, the 4 months in theater before actual clearance operations provided for adequate command staff and mine countermeasures force training. The Navy has since consolidated operational command of all mine warfare forces in the Commander, Mine Warfare Command, who reports administratively and operationally to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. His responsibilities include ensuring the readiness of the mine warfare assets, enhancing the integrated training of all mine warfare forces, conducting training exercises with other fleet units, and commanding mine warfare forces when deployed to military operations. The Mine Warfare Command is located at the Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, Texas. Mine warfare ships are homeported nearby at Naval Station, Ingleside, Texas. Plans to move all mine hunting helicopters from Alameda, California, and Norfolk, Virginia, to Corpus Christi have not been finalized.", "A second lesson learned from Operation Desert Storm was the need to improve the readiness of mine warfare forces. Since that time, the Navy has conducted or participated in about a dozen exercises with U.S. and foreign naval battle groups. Mine warfare training courses have been expanded for both enlisted and officer personnel, and career paths for enlisted minemen have been revised to enhance opportunities for long-term tours of duty in mine warfare.", "Third, the Navy acknowledged the need to identify and acquire the necessary resources to carry out its mine countermeasures mission. In 1994, the Navy took delivery of the last of 14 mine countermeasures (MCM) ships and acquired the first 2 of 12 planned mine hunter, coastal (MHC) ships. In addition, the Navy is converting a helicopter landing ship to a mine countermeasures command, control, and support (MCS) ship.", "Last, the Navy recognized that it has very limited systems to counter mines in various water depths.

Mine hunting is the process of detecting, locating, and identifying mines through the use of sonar. Influence minesweeping activates electronic sensors within the mines using towed magnetic or acoustic sweep gear to detonate mines at a safe distance.

Therefore, the Navy must develop a set of complementary systems and tactics to effectively carry out its mine warfare operations.", "The mine warfare community is currently developing about 18 different projects to enhance its capability to conduct mine countermeasures at all water depths.

According to Navy officials, many of the projects have had to compete for limited financial resources, and the Navy has had to make tradeoffs among them. The Navy has started and stopped some projects repeatedly over different fiscal years to respond to changing priorities, and these repeated starts and stops have resulted in schedule delays. For example, officials explained that the airborne mine hunting sonar system (AN/AQS-20) program has experienced starts and stops that have resulted in a delay in the system\u2019s initial operating capability. The Navy began to develop this system in the late 1970s, yet has still not brought this system on line. Officials further explained that the Navy has had to place different management teams on this project over the years and that the program has suffered from the lack of continuity in expertise. Moreover, current procurement plans for this sonar system will only allow the Navy to fund procurement of two to three systems per year, despite the fact that mine countermeasures helicopters deploy in squadrons of four. According to mine countermeasures officials, the mine warfare community will consequently have to maintain support simultaneously for two different mine hunting systems until all of the helicopters are outfitted with the upgraded sonar.", "The airborne mine neutralization system program has also experienced starts and stops since the program began in the mid-1970s.

The Navy needs to develop this capability because enemy forces can easily lay mines and obstacles in shallow waters, since this area is closest to their shorelines and because surf action causes many mines to partially or totally bury, making them harder to detect. Without a shallow water mine countermeasures capability, the only alternative for amphibious forces would be to avoid an enemy minefield and make an approach in another area. The risk associated with this maneuver, however, is that enemy forces might intend for U.S. troops to make an amphibious landing right into harm\u2019s way.", "The Navy cannot operate its mine countermeasures ships in very shallow water due to the risk of running aground or damaging their hulls. The Navy would also have difficulty towing its mine sweeping gear because of the likelihood that the gear would snag on the bottom of the ocean.", "The Navy is currently developing six mine countermeasures systems to clear mines and obstacles in shallow water. Since Operation Desert Storm, however, the Navy has not added any of these systems to its fleet. Moreover, the Navy has not made final decisions about additional systems to conduct mechanical sweeping, hunt for buried mines, or perform reconnaissance of mines in very shallow water. In addition, the Navy is only developing the capability to counter light and medium obstacles and has not decided what it will do to counter heavy obstacles.", "The mine warfare program is experiencing budget constraints, and the Navy has not fully funded its shallow water mine countermeasures projects, even though it identified this area as a priority. The Navy plans to spend about $317 million between fiscal years 1991 and 2001 in the development of its shallow water projects. However, budget documents, as of February 1995, show that unmet requirements for fiscal years 1997 through 2001 will total about $99.5 million. This figure may be understated because the Navy still has to make final decisions on some projects. Appendix I shows the Navy\u2019s shallow water mine countermeasures projects and the shortfalls associated with each project.", "In addition to funding shortfalls, some of these projects are experiencing technical and developmental delays. The Navy\u2019s Distributed Explosive Technology (DET) and Shallow Water Assault Breaching System (SABRE) programs are examples of two of these projects. Initially, the Navy planned to destroy enemy mines in the surf zone by deploying these systems from the beach into the water. The Navy has since changed its strategy and is now planning to deploy these systems from the water onto the beach off of Landing Craft Air-Cushion vehicles. This change in strategy has resulted in an initial operating capability delay of about  2 years. Due to this decision, the Navy had to redesign the rocket propulsion mechanisms to deliver these systems to the targeted area and conduct additional testing to examine the impact of launching DET and SABRE from an unstable platform.", "In another example, the Navy does not anticipate making final decisions about its Explosive Neutralization Advanced Technology Demonstration program until fiscal year 1998.
