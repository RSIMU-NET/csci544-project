In addition, during the course of this work, GAO identified domestic and international examples of governments that invest in climate resilience and related projects.

Enhancing climate resilience means taking actions to reduce potential future losses by planning and preparing for potential climate hazards such as extreme rainfall, sea level rise, and drought. Some federal agencies have made efforts to manage climate change risk within existing programs and operations, and these efforts may convey climate resilience benefits. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' civil works program constructs flood control projects, such as sea walls, that may enhance climate resilience. However, additional strategic federal investments may be needed to manage some of the nation's most significant climate risks because climate change cuts across agency missions and presents fiscal exposures larger than any one agency can manage. GAO's analysis shows the federal government does not strategically identify and prioritize projects to ensure they address the nation's most significant climate risks. Likewise, GAO's past work shows an absence of government-wide climate change strategic planning.", "As of August 2019, no action had been taken to implement 14 of GAO's 17 recommendations to improve federal strategic planning for climate resilience. GAO's enterprise risk management framework calls for reviewing risks and selecting the most appropriate strategy to manage them. However, no federal agency, interagency collaborative effort, or other organizational arrangement has been established to implement a strategic approach to climate resilience investment that includes periodically identifying and prioritizing projects. Such an approach could supplement individual agency climate resilience efforts and help target federal resources toward high-priority projects.", "Six key steps provide an opportunity for the federal government to strategically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for investment, as GAO found based on its review of prior GAO work, relevant reports, and stakeholder interviews (see figure).", "GAO identified one domestic and one international example to illustrate these key steps: Louisiana's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) coastal master planning effort and Canada's Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund (DMAF).", "In the domestic example, in 2005 the Louisiana legislature consolidated coastal planning efforts previously carried out by multiple state entities into a single effort led by CPRA to address the lack of strategic coordination. CPRA periodically identifies high-priority coastal resilience projects designed to address two primary risks: flooding and coastal land loss. To identify potential projects, CPRA sought project proposals from citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and others. To prioritize projects, CPRA used quantitative modeling to estimate project outcomes under multiple future scenarios of varied climate and other conditions and coordinated with stakeholders to understand potential project impacts. In 2017, CPRA identified $50 billion in high-priority projects to be implemented as funds become available.", "In the international example, in 2018, the Canadian government launched the DMAF, a financial assistance program to provide US$1.5 billion over 10 years for large-scale, nationally significant projects to manage natural hazard risks, including those triggered by climate change. Infrastructure Canada, the entity responsible for administering the DMAF, seeks project ideas from provinces and territories, municipal and regional governments, indigenous groups, and others. These entities apply directly to Infrastructure Canada for funding. According to Canadian officials, two committees of experts\u2014one composed of experts from other federal departments and the other composed of nonfederal experts (e.g., urban planners and individuals with regional expertise)\u2014provide feedback on potential projects. These projects are prioritized based on multiple criteria such as the extent to which they reduce the impacts of natural disasters.", "On the basis of GAO's review of relevant reports and past GAO work, interviews with stakeholders, and illustrative examples, GAO identified two options\u2014each with strengths and limitations\u2014for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience projects. The options are (1) coordinating funding provided through multiple existing programs with varied purposes and (2) creating a new federal funding source specifically for investment in climate resilience.", "A strength of coordinating funding from existing sources is access to multiple funding sources for a project. For example, one stakeholder GAO interviewed\u2014whose community used federal funding to implement large-scale resilience projects\u2014said that having multiple programs is advantageous because when funding from one program is not available\u2014such as when the project does not match that program's purpose or when there are insufficient funds\u2014funds could be sought from another program. A limitation of that option, according to CPRA officials, is that coordinating funding from multiple sources could be administratively challenging and could require dedicated staff to identify programs, assess whether projects meet program funding criteria, apply for funds, and ensure program requirements are met. Alternatively, one strength of a new federal funding source is that it could encourage cross-sector projects designed to achieve benefits in multiple sectors. For example, according to one stakeholder, such a funding source could allow experts from multiple sectors\u2014such as infrastructure, housing, transportation, and health\u2014to collaborate on projects, leading to more creative, comprehensive approaches to enhance community resilience. However, such a new funding source would have to be created, which would require Congressional authorization.", "In addition, GAO identified opportunities to increase the climate resilience impact of federal funding options. For example, a federal resilience investment effort presents an opportunity to encourage several types of complementary resilience activities by nonfederal actors such as states, localities, and private-sector partners. In this example, the federal government could require or provide incentives for communities to use and enforce climate-resilient building codes or limit development in high-risk areas through zoning regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider establishing a federal organizational arrangement to periodically identify and prioritize climate resilience projects for federal investment.

The U.S.  Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) projects that disaster costs  will likely increase as certain extreme weather events become more  frequent and intense due to climate change. The rising number of natural  disasters and increasing reliance on the federal government for  assistance is a key source of federal fiscal exposure. Our work over the  last decade has pointed to a key federal role in recognizing and managing  climate risks to limit such fiscal exposure. In 2013, we added \u201cLimiting  the Federal Government\u2019s Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing Climate  Change Risks\u201d as an area on our high-risk list\u2014a list of federal programs  and operations at risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or that  need transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness  challenges.", "Greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere are expected to continue to  alter the climate system into the future, regardless of efforts to control  emissions, according to USGCRP and the National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies). As a  result, limiting the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to climate change  risks will be challenging. The cost of recent weather disasters has  illustrated the need to plan for climate change risks and consequences  and to invest in climate resilience. We have previously reported that  while it is not possible to link any individual weather event to climate  change, these events provide insight into the potential climate-related  vulnerabilities the United States faces.", "Enhancing climate resilience means taking actions to reduce potential  future losses by planning and preparing for potential climate hazards such  as extreme rainfall, sea level rise, and drought. Investing in resilience can  reduce the need for far more costly steps in the decades to come;  therefore, we and others have recommended enhancing climate  resilience to help limit the federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure to climate  change. For example, in September 2018, we reported that elevating  homes and strengthening building codes\u2014two distinct efforts to enhance  resilience\u2014in Texas and Florida prevented greater damages during the  2017 hurricane season. Enhancing climate resilience can cost additional  money up front, which may limit resources for other federal priorities, but  it can also reduce potential future damage from climate-related events  that would otherwise constrain federal programs.", "Many current and future climate change impacts require immediate  actions; therefore, climate resilience efforts need to be focused where  urgent action is needed, according to the National Academies. In  addition, while it will not be possible to eliminate all risks associated with  climate change, if the nation prioritizes federal climate risk management  activities, it may be possible to minimize negative impacts and maximize  the opportunities associated with climate change, according to the  National Academies. In September 2017, we recommended that the  appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President use information on the potential economic effects of climate change to help  identify and craft appropriate federal responses to significant climate risks  facing the federal government. Such responses could include  establishing a strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal  investments to enhance resilience against future disasters. The Executive  Office of the President neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation and as of August 2019 had not implemented it.", "Planning for federal investments in climate resilience projects to limit  fiscal exposure is no longer a hypothetical issue. The Disaster Recovery  Reform Act of 2018 (DRRA), enacted in October 2018, provides one  potential source of funding for climate resilience projects. The act allows  the President to set aside up to 6 percent of the estimated aggregate  amount of grants from certain emergency programs under a major  disaster declaration to implement pre-disaster hazard mitigation  activities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will  administer the associated program\u2014the Building Resilient Infrastructure  and Communities program. As of August 2019, FEMA had not yet  developed program guidance, although the agency has sought input from  the public on program design. FEMA officials estimate annual funds for  the program will average $300 million to $500 million.", "Other legislation to fund climate resilience activities has been introduced  in Congress but has not been enacted. For example, the Climate Change  Resiliency Fund for America Act of 2019, introduced in the House of  Representatives and the U.S. Senate in March 2019, would create a fund  that would provide financial assistance for climate adaptation projects  including infrastructure resiliency projects intended to reduce the  economic, social, and environmental impacts of the adverse effects of  climate change.", "You asked us to review the federal approach to prioritizing and funding  climate resilience projects that address the nation\u2019s most significant  climate risks.

According to  the framework, strategic resilience goals integrated across relevant  national strategies can help decision makers work toward a common  vision and help ensure focus on a wide variety of opportunities to reduce  disaster risk. Federal efforts can focus attention on disaster risk reduction  by creating resilience goals in all relevant national strategies and linking  those goals to an overarching strategic vision. Federal efforts can also  facilitate coordination and promote governance approaches that mitigate  fragmentation by requiring or funding mechanisms to enhance the  continuity of different efforts across jurisdictions. In addition, because  much of the nation\u2019s infrastructure is not owned and operated by the  federal government, many resilience-related decisions ultimately are  made by nonfederal actors, such as the states, and those decision  makers face competing priorities.

For example, a 2018 interim report by the National Institute of  Building Sciences estimated that benefits to society (i.e., homeowners  and communities) would exceed costs for several types of resilience  projects by protecting lives and property and preventing other losses,  though precise benefits are uncertain. Specifically, this interim report  examined a sample of hazard mitigation grants awarded by FEMA, the  Economic Development Administration, and the Department of Housing  and Urban Development (HUD) from 1993 through 2016 to address  various hazards. These hazards included fires in the wildland-urban  interface (i.e., fires in areas where homes are built near or among lands  prone to wildland fire), hurricane- and tornado-force winds, and riverine  floods.

This  information can help decision makers identify high-risk areas for targeted  resilience investment. First, a community\u2019s exposure is influenced by the  population or assets exposed to a potential climate hazard (e.g., sea level  rise, wildfire). For example, according to the Fourth National Climate  Assessment, the expansion of human activity into forests and other  wildland areas has been observed over the past few decades and is  expected to further increase the exposure of people and property to fire  risk. Second, the level of expected impact a community faces from a  given climate hazard is influenced by the probability of a given climate  hazard and its expected magnitude. Third, a community\u2019s vulnerability to  these hazards is influenced by its sensitivity to a given climate risk and its  adaptive capacity\u2014the ability to cope with stress or adjust to new  situations. An area with high exposure but low sensitivity to a given  climate hazard may have lower overall risk than an area with lower  exposure to the same hazard but higher sensitivity. The degree of  adaptive capacity can also serve to increase or decrease risks. For  example, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, tribal  nations are especially vulnerable to climate change because of their  reliance on threatened natural resources for their cultural, subsistence,  and economic needs.", "We reported in September 2017 that while estimates of the economic  effects of climate change are imprecise due to modeling and information  limitations, they can convey useful insight into broad themes about  potential damages in different U.S. sectors or regions. This information  could help decision makers identify significant climate risks as an initial  step toward managing them and provide insight into high-risk areas for  targeted investment. For example, we reported in September 2017 that  the two national-scale studies available at the time that examined the  economic effects of climate change across U.S. sectors suggested that  the potential economic effects of climate change could be significant and  unevenly distributed across sectors and regions.

Stakeholders we interviewed, the Louisiana example, and our past work  indicate the need to solicit feedback from communities on the potential  impacts of proposed projects. Furthermore, according to several  stakeholders we interviewed, projects should be prioritized by an  independent, interdisciplinary group of experts capable of assessing  projects against measurable criteria.

Several reports and several stakeholders suggested prioritizing  projects that, among other things, focus on severe or costly climate  hazards as well as climate hazards about which there is the most  scientific certainty. Several stakeholders we interviewed explained  that when prioritizing projects for implementation, it is important to  consider a project\u2019s potential to enhance resilience by protecting  human lives, health, and safety, and assets that are critical, high- value, or culturally significant.", "In addition, several stakeholders told us that decision makers should  not place too much emphasis on the monetary value of avoided  property losses from a project because doing so can overemphasize  projects that protect high-value assets and leave socially vulnerable  populations with limited economic resources less protected. According  to one report, the loss of assets is more difficult for a poor household  to absorb than a wealthy household that has more assets to begin  with and more access to insurance and credit. Similarly, the Fourth  National Climate Assessment notes that poor or marginalized  populations often face a higher risk from climate change because they  live in areas with higher exposure, are more sensitive to climate  impacts, or lack the capacity to respond to climate hazards. Several  stakeholders told us that to account for a lack of social equity, it is  important to prioritize projects in communities that have limited  capacity to enhance resilience without federal financial assistance,  including communities with limited financial means.", "In addition to these factors, several reports and several stakeholders  discussed the importance of considering a project\u2019s impacts on the  environment, including its ability to protect unique or sensitive  environmental habitats or species. Finally, several reports discussed  the importance of considering the potential system-wide impacts of a  project, including a project\u2019s potential to provide benefits as well as  the potential that risk may be transferred to neighboring communities.  The DMAF applicant\u2019s guide provides an example of potential risk  transfer, explaining that the construction of new dikes along a river to  protect a segment of the floodplain may confine the river, raising  water levels upstream and increasing the velocity of the river  downstream. This may reduce the hazard in the segment of river  immediately adjacent to the structure but will transfer risk to upstream  and downstream communities.", "Efficiency criteria. We identified several efficiency criteria\u2014criteria  that measure a project\u2019s ability to maximize net benefits\u2014that  decision makers may want to consider when evaluating which projects  to prioritize. Several reports we reviewed identified the importance  of considering how a project\u2019s expected benefits compare to its costs  to help ensure a project represents an efficient use of federal dollars.  With respect to costs, one stakeholder identified the importance of  considering the current costs of implementing a project as well as how  costs might change in the future if a project\u2019s implementation is  delayed to a later date. With respect to benefits, several stakeholders  indicated that while it can be difficult to estimate the monetary value of  some benefits, it is important to consider all expected benefits\u2014 including co-benefits\u2014as fully as possible to draw accurate  conclusions about how a project\u2019s benefits compare to its costs. For  example, several stakeholders discussed the need to account for  future benefits because much of the value of a climate resilience  project may be realized far in the future as climate risks become more  pronounced.", "In addition, several reports identified ways to account for uncertainty  about the specific nature of future climate risks when making  decisions about which projects to prioritize. This includes, for  example, prioritizing projects that provide benefits under a wide range  of future climate scenarios or prioritizing projects that can be modified  if future climate conditions are different than expected. In addition to  these considerations, several stakeholders also suggested  considering the long-term viability of communities being helped by a  project. These stakeholders explained that some communities may  face climate risks that are so severe over the long term that they  preclude cost-effective investments in resilience. They explained that  rather than make costly resilience investments in these communities,  a more efficient use of federal funds might involve making  investments in projects that help transition a community to a safer  location. Similarly, according to a 2015 study by the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers, given current and projected sea level and climate  change trends, some of the built environment will become  unsustainable for communities presently located there, which may  mean that communities may have to relocate in a responsible manner  to sustain their economic viability and social resilience. Another  stakeholder suggested prioritizing resilience projects that are unlikely  to be funded without federal investment, such as projects for the  public good that do not generate revenue and likely would not attract  private investors.", "Administrative criteria. We identified several additional criteria that  federal decision makers investing in climate resilience projects may  want to consider when evaluating which projects to prioritize, including  whether the project is feasible and timely.

For example, the Canadian  DMAF awards merit to projects that offer effective solutions through  unique innovative ideas.

For example,  the state of Louisiana\u2019s coastal master planning effort uses multi-program  coordination to fund projects. Specifically, funding for high-priority  resilience projects identified in the master plan is provided via several  federal and nonfederal programs designed for wetlands restoration,  hurricane risk reduction, oil spill recovery, and community development,  among other purposes, when the program\u2019s purpose aligns with the  project\u2019s purpose. For example, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation  Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund\u2014established in early 2013 as an  outcome of plea agreements for the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil  spill\u2014has been used to fund some projects consistent with the master  plan that restore barrier islands and implement river diversions.

We identified federal programs related to flood control  and hazard mitigation that could be used to fund individual projects that  may convey climate resilience benefits, including FEMA\u2019s hazard  mitigation assistance programs (i.e., Building Resilient Infrastructure and  Communities, Pre-Disaster Mitigation, Flood Mitigation Assistance, and  Hazard Mitigation Grant programs), HUD\u2019s Community Development  Block Grant Disaster Recovery program, and the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers\u2019 civil works program. These programs are managed  individually within their agencies and operate under different statutory  authorities. However, no federal entity oversees funding for high-priority  climate resilience projects, for example, by identifying which existing  federal programs could be used to fund particular high-priority projects  and coordinating the use of these programs to fund particular projects.", "Based on our review of the Louisiana example, interviews with  stakeholders, and a report we reviewed, we identified several strengths of  coordinating multiple existing federal programs with varied purposes to  fund high-priority climate resilience projects:", "Leveraging existing programs. This option leverages an existing  architecture of related federal programs and could encourage  consideration of climate change in routine agency decisions, based on  our interviews with several stakeholders and review of a related  report. The federal government already has programs that address  natural resources (e.g., coastlines, water resources, and forests) and  human systems (e.g., public health, housing, and infrastructure) that  will be affected by climate change, according to a 2010 report we  reviewed and two stakeholders we interviewed. According to this  report and stakeholders, rather than create an additional program to  address climate change, it would be better to incorporate  consideration of climate change into existing federal decision-making  processes. Providing funding for high-priority climate resilience  projects via existing federal programs could encourage agencies to  think more intentionally about climate change on a regular basis when  implementing their programs, according to several stakeholders we  interviewed.", "Providing access to specialists and expertise. Federal officials  who have specialized, sector-specific knowledge (e.g., infrastructure,  agriculture, or ecosystems) that can be useful when evaluating which  projects to fund may have a greater opportunity to provide input if  funding decisions are made within existing federal programs,  according to several stakeholders. According to one stakeholder,  specialized knowledge that resides within federal agencies is  necessary when evaluating the trade-offs of potential projects that  address diverse systems and assets. This stakeholder explained that,  for example, evaluating a project to strengthen a shipping port against  hurricanes requires different expertise than evaluating a project to  protect the surrounding community against these hurricanes, and  agency officials\u2019 specialized knowledge would be useful in evaluating  the value of such distinct projects.", "Providing access to multiple funding sources. Using multiple  existing federal programs means that multiple potential funding  streams are available for projects. For example, one stakeholder  whose community previously used federal funding to implement large- scale resilience projects said that when funding from one program is  not available\u2014for example, because the project does not match that  program\u2019s purpose or because of insufficient funds\u2014having multiple  existing programs from which to seek funding is advantageous.  Similarly, Louisiana makes use of multiple federal and nonfederal  funding sources to implement projects identified through its master  planning effort.", "On the basis of our review of the Louisiana example, relevant reports,  and interviews with stakeholders, as well as our past work\u2014including the  Disaster Resilience Framework\u2014we identified several limitations of using  existing programs to fund high-priority climate resilience projects:", "Administratively challenging to coordinate. Several stakeholders  and a 2016 report we reviewed identified potential administrative  challenges associated with using multiple existing programs with  varied purposes to fund high-priority projects. For example, CPRA  officials told us that the process of coordinating funding from multiple  programs for coastal projects is complicated and requires dedicated  staff to identify programs, assess whether projects meet program  funding criteria, apply for funds, and ensure that program  requirements are met. Several stakeholders told us that the budgets  of existing programs may be too limited to fund large-scale climate  resilience projects and that acquiring funding for a single project  through multiple federal programs can be difficult. For example, FEMA  officials told us that a potentially relevant FEMA program\u2014the Pre- Disaster Mitigation Grant Program\u2014has limited overall funding and  restricts the financial size of a project, making it challenging to fund  large-scale projects such as community relocation. Furthermore,  according to a 2016 report about lessons learned from the HUD  Rebuild by Design competition, grantees faced challenges combining  funds from multiple programs to support comprehensive rebuilding  visions because each program had its own procedural and  administrative requirements, including different timelines for how and  when the funds were made available. Similarly, according to our  Disaster Resilience Framework, when multiple programs and activities  and multiple funding streams are involved, there is a risk that the  array of requirements will increase administrative complexity. As we  reported in July 2015, jurisdictional officials engaged in disaster  recovery have encountered complex review processes, conflicting  federal guidance, and competing federal priorities that diminished the  desire of localities to participate in resilience programs.", "Programs may be siloed. Existing federal programs may be \u201csiloed,\u201d  according to several stakeholders and two reports we reviewed,  meaning that agencies may have limited visibility over how their  projects affect other agencies\u2019 mission areas or a limited ability to  consider those effects. The two reports we reviewed identified  challenges with siloed agency programs, including that they can  discourage more holistic resilience projects with benefits in multiple  sectors. For example, according to the 2016 report about lessons  learned from the HUD Rebuild by Design competition, program rules  may restrict the use of federal funds to certain activities (e.g., flood  control), which can make it difficult to justify the additional cost of a  more holistic resilience project with benefits in other sectors (e.g., a  larger-scale flood control project with water quality co-benefits).  According to the National Academies, climate resilience activities  have the potential to be redundant or to work at cross purposes if they  are not coordinated across sectors, actors, scale, and time frames.  For example, the National Academies identified potential tradeoffs  between resilience activities in the agricultural, water, and ecosystem  sectors, such as increased irrigation in response to drought competing  with natural ecosystem flows and domestic water needs.", "Climate resilience is not the primary focus. Though it may be  possible to use some existing federal programs to fund high-priority  climate resilience projects, the primary purpose of these programs is  not enhancing resilience to climate change, and they are not  coordinated toward a common climate resilience goal, according to  our work for this report. As a result, relying on existing programs for  funding could result in inadvertent, ad hoc funding rather than  intentional, coordinated, and strategic funding of high-priority projects,  based on our past work and interviews with several stakeholders. In  particular, according to FEMA officials, statutory and regulatory  limitations could make it challenging to incorporate consideration of  climate resilience into existing programs. Furthermore, according to  several stakeholders, program funding criteria may not relate directly  to climate resilience\u2014this can lower the chance that climate resilience  projects will receive funding. In our May 2014 report about DOD\u2019s  consideration of climate change in infrastructure planning, we  reported that military installation officials rarely proposed climate  resilience projects because the services\u2019 criteria for ranking and  funding potential military construction projects did not include climate  change adaptation. In addition, a 2018 report about federal  resilience policy we reviewed and several stakeholders we  interviewed identified challenges with how cost-benefit formulas  account for future climate risk when evaluating the costs and benefits  of a project under consideration. Two stakeholders we interviewed  told us that the discount rate\u2014the interest rate used to convert  benefits and costs occurring in different time periods to a common  present value\u2014used in federal cost benefit formulas may too heavily  discount future benefits. They explained that when benefits accrue  over long time horizons, this can result in future climate benefits  appearing small relative to the current cost of project implementation  and thus result in some climate resilience projects not being funded.", "Existing programs may be reactive, not proactive. Some existing  programs\u2014for example, HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant  Disaster Recovery program and FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Grant  Program\u2014are limited to funding resilience projects after a disaster  occurs, which may result in reactive instead of proactive funding,  based on our review of our past work and discussions with several  stakeholders. We concluded in July 2015 that funding hazard  mitigation efforts in a post-disaster environment can create a reactive  and fragmented approach in which disasters determine when and for  what purpose the federal government invests in disaster resilience.  Furthermore, tying climate resilience funding to a disaster can result in projects going unfunded in communities where there has not yet been  a disaster but where there are legitimate risks from future climate  change impacts\u2014including chronic climate hazards such as sea level  rise\u2014according to several stakeholders we interviewed. For example,  our past work and several stakeholders identified challenges in  accessing funding from existing federal programs to relocate  communities threatened by climate hazards, such as Alaskan native  villages threatened by flooding and erosion caused by sea level rise.  According to our June 2009 report, since many Alaskan native  villages facing gradual erosion problems had not received a declared  disaster designation, they did not qualify for some FEMA disaster  recovery and hazard mitigation programs. In addition, according to  a 2016 report we reviewed, disaster recovery programs tend to be  reactive and backward looking, focusing on areas immediately  affected by a disaster. This can limit the ability of grantees to fund  projects that could more holistically reduce the full suite of future risks  that a region or community face."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Climate Resilience Funding Source", "paragraphs": ["Another option for focusing federal funding on high-priority climate  resilience projects involves creating a new funding source specifically for  such projects. We identified two main ways a new funding source could  be designed in the United States: (1) a federal financial assistance  program that could provide grants, loans, or loan guarantees to  nonfederal entities implementing high-priority climate resilience projects,  or (2) a climate resilience infrastructure bank that could combine federal  funds with funds from other sources to provide funding to nonfederal  entities for implementing high-priority climate resilience projects.", "The government of Canada employs both of these methods. Specifically,  Canada created the DMAF as a one-time, centralized fund of about  US$1.5 billion dollars for climate resilience projects over a 10-year period.  Applications not eligible for or not selected to receive DMAF funding could  be eligible under other infrastructure programs. Projects that could  generate revenue are shared with Canada\u2019s Infrastructure Bank for  consideration.", "Based on our review of the DMAF and interviews with stakeholders, we  identified several strengths of creating a new funding source for high- priority climate resilience projects:", "Administrative simplicity. Several stakeholders said that a new  funding source avoids the administrative challenge of coordinating  multiple funding sources to implement a large project or portfolio of  projects. According to two stakeholders, such an option would avoid  the challenge of having to utilize multiple programs with varying  program rules, solicitation periods, and funding terms. Another  stakeholder suggested that a single source would make it easier to  track spending on climate resilience projects.", "Focusing on high-priority climate resilience projects. Several  stakeholders said that an advantage of a new funding source is that it  would provide dedicated funding for projects undertaken for the  explicit purpose of climate resilience. For example, Canadian officials  said that with the DMAF, climate resilience projects do not have to  compete with other infrastructure projects for funding as they do within  other programs administered in Canada that include multiple eligible  project categories (e.g., water, wastewater, public transit). Canadian  officials told us that this increases the likelihood that large-scale,  nationally significant climate resilience projects will be funded.  According to another stakeholder, a new funding source for high- priority climate resilience projects would allow for a proactive focus on  the most pressing climate resilience needs instead of reactive project  funding through post-disaster spending. In addition, another  stakeholder told us this option could encourage communities to think  \u201cintentionally\u201d about developing resilience, rather than climate  resilience being an afterthought. Furthermore, several stakeholders  said that such a funding source could be used for projects that  otherwise would not receive funding through existing programs. For  example, some projects may not receive funding because they are not  compatible with current programs or because current programs have  limited funding.", "Encouraging cross-sector projects. Several stakeholders told us  that a new funding source for high-priority climate resilience projects  could encourage cross-sector projects designed to achieve benefits in  multiple sectors. According to one of these stakeholders, a dedicated  fund for climate resilience could allow experts from multiple sectors\u2014 such as infrastructure, housing, transportation, and health\u2014to  collaborate on projects, leading to more creative, comprehensive  approaches to enhance community resilience than would occur when  funding projects through individual, existing federal programs.  According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, exploring the  climate resilience nexus between sectors can identify co-benefits of  resilience solutions and inform cost-effective resilience strategies.  For example, the assessment describes co-benefits that resilience  actions related to water consumption can have on the electricity  sector. According to the assessment, California\u2019s mandate to reduce  urban water consumption to address drought conditions in 2015  resulted in significant reductions in both water use and use of  electricity to treat and convey water and wastewater.", "Based on interviews with stakeholders, we identified some limitations of  creating a new funding source for high-priority climate resilience projects:", "Practical challenges. Several stakeholders identified practical  challenges with a funding source specifically for high-priority climate  resilience projects.

Furthermore, several  stakeholders identified decisions that would have to be made about  how to design such a funding source, including which agencies would  be responsible for administering the fund. Two stakeholders identified  additional challenges to success, such as designing effective  programmatic rules and eliminating duplication with existing  programs. For instance, if the funding source had overly restrictive or  poorly designed rules, it might be challenging to use and provide only  limited benefits relative to existing programs, according to one of  these stakeholders.", "Discouraging mainstreaming in existing federal programs.", "Several stakeholders raised concerns that a new funding source for  high-priority climate resilience projects could discourage  mainstreaming climate change considerations into existing federal  programs or lead to the elimination of other sources of funding for  climate resilience projects. Several stakeholders explained that  mainstreaming is a fundamental way the federal government will  enhance resilience to climate risks. In particular, several stakeholders  raised concerns that if federal agencies viewed a single funding  source specifically for climate resilience projects as sufficient for  addressing climate resilience, federal agencies might be less likely to  consider climate change impacts when making routine agency  decisions or place a lower value on climate resilience project  attributes when making funding decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Increase the Climate Resilience Impact of Federal Funding Options", "paragraphs": ["Opportunities exist to increase the climate resilience impact of options for  focusing federal funding on high-priority climate resilience projects, based  on our review of our past work, related reports, an international standard,  and the Louisiana and Canadian examples, as well as interviews with  stakeholders:", "Using both existing and new funding options.

Several stakeholders told us that directing both funding options at  high-priority projects could result in a more effective approach that  makes it less likely that high-priority projects fall through the cracks  and more likely that these projects will help agencies work toward a  common strategic goal. Two stakeholders told us that in practice,  multiple, existing federal funding sources that are not specific to  climate resilience could be coordinated to fund projects when their  purposes and rules align and adequate funding is available.

Several  stakeholders we interviewed identified the need for adequate and  consistent funding to implement high-priority climate resilience  projects. For example, according to one stakeholder we interviewed,  inconsistent, inadequate funding makes it difficult to complete large- scale projects and can lead to additional costs if significant delays  occur during which existing work deteriorates. In addition, according  to some international officials we interviewed for a May 2016 report,  long-term consistency in budgeting provides predictable, reliable  resources for climate resilience projects. According to USGCRP\u2019s  Fourth National Climate Assessment, adequate funding is a factor that  contributes to the successful adoption and implementation of climate  resilience by public-sector organizations. Furthermore, an industry  standard identified the need to ensure that resources\u2014including  financial, human, and technical resources\u2014needed for climate  resilience actions are available. In addition to adequate and  consistent funding, funding options should be designed to  accommodate long-term projects since high-priority climate resilience  projects can take multiple years to design and implement, according  to two stakeholders we interviewed.", "Encouraging nonfederal investment. Several stakeholders we  interviewed told us that the federal government could use a federal  climate resilience investment effort to encourage nonfederal  investment in high-priority climate resilience projects, thereby  increasing the impact of federal investment. For example, several  stakeholders identified the importance of a cost-share component so  that funding recipients are invested in a project\u2019s success. Canada\u2019s  DMAF encourages nonfederal investment by partially funding projects  of national significance and requiring different levels of cost-share  from funding recipients, ranging from 25 percent for Indigenous  recipients to 75 percent for private-sector and other for-profit  recipients. Several stakeholders also identified potential funding  mechanisms\u2014for example, public-private partnerships and loan  guarantees\u2014that could leverage federal dollars to encourage  additional investment in climate resilience projects by nonfederal  entities, including the private sector. According to the 2014  President\u2019s State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force report, one  way the federal government can drive more resilient community  choices is by encouraging innovative approaches that leverage  private capital.", "Encouraging complementary resilience activities. To increase the  impact of federal investment, a federal resilience investment effort  presents an opportunity to encourage complementary resilience  activities by nonfederal actors such as states, localities, and private- sector partners, based on interviews with several stakeholders, the  Canadian example, and reports we reviewed. Several stakeholders  suggested establishing conditions that funding recipients must meet in  exchange for receiving federal funding. Alternatively, according to the  2014 President\u2019s State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force report  and two stakeholders we interviewed, the federal government could  use incentives (e.g., providing greater federal cost-share or giving  additional preference in the project prioritization process) to  encourage complementary resilience activities by nonfederal  actors. Furthermore, our Disaster Resilience Framework states that  incentives can make long-term, forward-looking risk reduction  investments more viable and attractive among competing priorities.  Specifically, incentives can lower the costs or increase the benefits of  risk-reduction measures, which can help stimulate investment by state  and local governments, individuals, and the private sector.", "The federal government could use a federal resilience investment  effort to encourage several types of complementary resilience  activities by nonfederal actors. For example, the federal government  could encourage the use and enforcement of building codes that  require stronger risk-reduction measures, according to two reports we  reviewed and several stakeholders we interviewed. In the case of  the DMAF, to be eligible for federal funding, all projects under the  DMAF must meet or exceed building code requirements for their  jurisdiction. In addition, several stakeholders suggested using a  federal investment effort to encourage communities to limit or prohibit  development in high-risk areas to minimize risks to people and assets  exposed to future climate hazards. One example of this would be  through zoning regulations. Another stakeholder suggested that  communities receiving federal funding for resilience projects should  be adequately insured against future climate risks so they have a  potential source of funding for rebuilding in the event of a disaster.", "Allowing funds to be used at various stages of project  development. Several stakeholders suggested that federal funds be  allowed for use at multiple stages of project development\u2014such as  project design, implementation, or monitoring\u2014to increase the impact  of federal funds. For example, two stakeholders we interviewed told  us that resilience projects can require significant amounts of design  work to develop an implementable and effective project concept and  that making funds available for project design could improve the  quality of project proposals, thereby maximizing the impact of federal  funds. Similarly, a CPRA official explained that many project  proposals for Louisiana\u2019s Comprehensive Master Plan for a  Sustainable Coast are in the \u201cconcept stage\u201d when they are received  so funds are needed to refine the concept and craft an implementable  project design.

We used a snowball approach to  identify stakeholders with expertise on the topics addressed by our report.  This involved identifying an initial list of stakeholders with expertise in  climate resilience and hazard mitigation by reviewing related reports and  based on stakeholder involvement in related present or past federal  efforts\u2014for example, work conducted by the U.S. Global Change  Research Program (USGCRP)\u2014the federal program responsible for  coordinating climate change research and preparing the Fourth National  Climate Assessment. We identified additional stakeholders with  expertise in these and other relevant areas through interviews with this  initial group of stakeholders and review of additional reports. We  considered several factors when selecting stakeholders: the relevance of  their expertise, the number of times they were recommended to us by  other stakeholders as having relevant expertise, and their current or  previous federal experience. We sought a balanced set of stakeholders  with expertise in a variety of fields that could inform climate resilience  decisions: climate resilience, decision sciences, hazard mitigation,  economics and finance, insurance, engineering and project design,  economic and community development, potentially related federal  programs (e.g., Federal Emergency Management Agency  hazard  mitigation programs), and several affected resources (e.g., coasts,  infrastructure, water resources, and ecosystems).

We also reviewed approximately 50 reports and other sources to identify  steps that provide an opportunity for the federal government to  strategically identify high-priority climate resilience projects, several of  which contained examples of potential criteria the federal government  could consider when prioritizing these projects. We identified these  reports and other sources through our review of other reports and related  news, discussions with stakeholders, and searches of databases such as  Scopus and ProQuest. The reports we reviewed included climate  resilience planning guidebooks that outline steps communities can follow  to design a resilience plan to address climate risks. We also interviewed  stakeholders with relevant expertise to gather information on key steps  the federal government could take and criteria it could consider to  strategically prioritize climate resilience projects for federal investment.  During the course of this work, we identified domestic and international  examples of governments that invest in climate resilience and related  projects. We selected two of these examples for more in-depth review  and presentation in the report: the state of Louisiana\u2019s coastal master  planning effort and the country of Canada\u2019s Disaster Mitigation and  Adaptation Fund. These examples represent distinct approaches for  investing in high-priority projects that help communities adapt to emerging  risks such as those associated with climate change. We selected these  examples for further review because they focus on projects that are large  in scale; are of national or statewide significance; address multiple risks;  represent well-defined, current processes for identifying and prioritizing  projects; and had sufficient information available to understand their  approach.", "To examine the strengths and limitations of options for focusing federal  funding on high-priority climate resilience projects, we identified relevant  examples of the strengths and limitations of federal funding options in  several of the reports we mentioned above. Where appropriate, we  supplemented this review with a review of additional reports that  discussed specific financial mechanisms that the federal government  could use to fund large-scale climate resilience projects. We also  interviewed stakeholders to discuss the strengths and limitations of  options the federal government could use to fund climate resilience  projects. When available, we gathered their views on specific funding  sources that the federal government could use to fund large-scale climate  resilience projects and additional steps that the federal government could  take to enable more targeted federal resilience investment.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2018 to October 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Joe Thompson (Assistant  Director), Paige Gilbreath (Analyst in Charge), Taiyshawna Battle and  Celia Rosario Mendive made key contributions to this report.
