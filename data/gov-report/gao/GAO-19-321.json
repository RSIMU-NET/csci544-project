F-35 aircraft were unable to fly nearly 30 percent of the May\u2014November 2018 time period due to spare parts shortages. Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) had a repair backlog of about 4,300 F-35 parts. DOD is taking steps to fix these issues, such as improving the reliability of parts. However, it has not fully determined actions needed to close the gap between warfighter requirements and the performance the F-35 supply chain can deliver.", "Mismatched parts for deploying aircraft. DOD purchases certain sets of F-35 parts years ahead of time to support aircraft on deployments, including on ships. But the parts do not fully match the military services' needs because F-35 aircraft have been modified over time. For example, 44 percent of purchased parts were incompatible with aircraft the Marine Corps took on a recent deployment. Without a process to modify the sets of parts for deployments, DOD may be unable to meet the services' operational needs.", "An immature global network to move F-35 parts. DOD's networks for moving F-35 parts around the world are immature, and overseas F-35 customers have experienced long wait times for parts needed to repair aircraft. Without a detailed plan for the network, DOD may not be ready to support an expanding fleet.", "In addressing these challenges, DOD must grapple with affordability. The Air Force and Marine Corps recently identified the need to reduce their sustainment costs per aircraft per year by 43 and 24 percent, respectively. DOD has spent billions of dollars on F-35 spare parts but does not have records for all the parts it has purchased, where they are, or how much they cost. For example, DOD is not maintaining a database with information on F-35 parts the U.S. owns, and it lacks the necessary data to be able to do so. Without a policy that clearly defines how it will keep track of purchased F-35 parts, DOD will continue to operate with a limited understanding of the F-35 spare parts it owns and how they are being managed.

It is also the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) most costly weapon system, with sustainment costs for  the U.S. alone estimated at $1.12 trillion. The F-35 program is a highly  concurrent acquisition program, meaning that aircraft are simultaneously  being developed, tested, and fielded. As of February 2019, there were  more than 350 U.S. and international F-35 aircraft in operation at 16 sites,  with more than 3,300 aircraft expected to be fielded throughout the 60- year life cycle of the program. The F-35\u2019s unique supply chain is central to  DOD\u2019s strategy to sustain this growing fleet. Rather than owning the  spare parts for their aircraft, the program is designed so that the Air  Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, along with eight international partners  and other foreign military sales customers, share a common, global pool  of parts (hereinafter referred to as the global spares pool) that is  managed by the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin. Citing less than  desirable aircraft performance, in September 2018, the Secretary of  Defense directed the military services to achieve and maintain 80 percent  mission capability rates for their critical aviation platforms, including the  F-35 fleet, by the end of fiscal year 2019.", "While the construct for the F-35 supply chain was intended to ease the  logistical burden on and provide economies of scale for the military  services and international partners, we have previously reported that the  F-35 program faces affordability, reliability, and sustainment challenges.  For instance, in 2014, we reported that annual F-35 operating and  support costs were estimated to be considerably higher than the  combined annual costs of several legacy aircraft, and that while DOD had  begun some cost-savings efforts and had established sustainment  affordability targets, DOD did not use the military services\u2019 budgets to set  these targets. In 2016, we found that DOD faced risks that could affect  the F-35\u2019s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)\u2014a complex  system supporting operations, mission planning, supply-chain  management, maintenance, and other processes. In 2017, we reported  that DOD was experiencing sustainment challenges that were reducing  warfighter readiness, including delays of 6 years in standing up repair  capabilities for F-35 parts at its depots and significant spare parts  shortages that were preventing the F-35 fleet from flying about 20 percent  of the time. We recommended that DOD develop affordability constraints  linked to the military services\u2019 budgets, develop a plan to address ALIS  risks, and revise its sustainment plans, among other things. The  department generally concurred with our recommendations, and has  taken some actions in response. In particular, in 2018, DOD established  affordability constraints based on the military services\u2019 future budget  projections. These new affordability constraints will require DOD to  reduce F-35 sustainment costs per aircraft per year by 43 percent for the  Air Force, 24 percent for the Marine Corps, and 5 percent for the Navy.

To interview  officials and observe F-35 supply and maintenance operations, we  conducted site visits to two F-35 operational locations\u2014Hill Air Force  Base, Utah, and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; and one  training location\u2014Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. We selected these  locations to obtain perspectives from both operational and training units  from multiple U.S. military services using different variants of the aircraft,  and to gather insights of international partners co-located at these bases,  among other factors. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the only  overseas-based U.S. F-35 operational squadron\u2014at Marine Corps Air  Station Iwakuni, Japan. We used criteria from DOD and service guidance  and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government as bases  against which to assess DOD\u2019s actions for each of these objectives.", "In support of these objectives, we gathered various data related to the F- 35 supply chain, such as parts availability, repair, aircraft performance,  and customer wait time data.

The F-35 Joint Program  Office, through its Product Support Manager, is responsible for managing  and overseeing the support functions required to field and maintain the  readiness and operational capability of the F-35 aircraft across the  enterprise. As such, it establishes sustainment requirements, manages  funding, develops contracts, and provides direction for and oversees the  execution of F-35 sustainment strategy and policy.", "Additionally, in 2016, DOD established a Hybrid Product Support  Integrator organization within the Joint Program Office, and it expects to  fully implement this organization by the end of 2019. Once fully  implemented, DOD intends for the Hybrid Product Support Integrator to  bring together all government and commercial capabilities necessary to  execute the F-35 sustainment strategy. The organization is led by a  general officer, who is responsible for providing government oversight of  all support providers to ensure that they deliver the required levels of  performance. In particular, the F-35 program relies heavily on contractors  to provide support for its F-35 aircraft. DOD has two primary contractors  for the F-35 program: Lockheed Martin for the overall aircraft system and  Pratt & Whitney for the engine. As the prime contractor for the overall  aircraft system, Lockheed Martin (hereinafter referred to as the prime  contractor) is responsible for managing the F-35 supply chain, depot  maintenance, and pilot and maintainer training, as well as for providing  engineering and technical support. Currently, DOD is contracting for this  support with the prime contractor largely through annual contracts, and it  plans to transition to multiple-year, fixed-price, performance-based  sustainment contracts when the program achieves certain condition- based criteria, including the establishment of critical sustainment  capabilities and the government\u2019s ability to collect and more fully assess  performance and cost data. In addition, the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and  Marine Corps have each established an F-35 integration office or similar  construct focused on how the services will operate and afford the F-35,  among other things.

Figure 8 shows the difficulty  that DOD will face in meeting the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 80 percent  mission capability target when planning for an S-rate of 20 percent given  the time that is also required for maintenance.", "According to program and prime contractor documentation, DOD would  need to model and fund the spare parts pool to achieve an S-rate of no  higher than 10 percent in order to achieve requirements for aircraft  performance, such as the mission capability target set by the Secretary of  Defense and the services\u2019 goals for air vehicle availability. Doing so would  significantly increase the costs for spare parts. According to the prime  contractor, in order to achieve a fleet-wide S-rate of 10 percent, the U.S.  government would need to initially pay hundreds of millions of dollars to  buy more parts for already-fielded aircraft. Costs would also increase on  an annual basis\u2014above the nearly $1 billion the U.S. services collectively  paid in fiscal year 2018\u2014to buy more parts each year. The current  projected costs of F-35 sustainment are not affordable for the services. In  2018, DOD established constraints based on the military services\u2019 future  budget projections that indicate that DOD needs to reduce F-35  sustainment costs per aircraft per year by 43 percent for the F-35A, 24  percent for the F-35B, and 5 percent for the F-35C in order for the aircraft  to be affordable for the services. DOD will be challenged to support this  increase in annual costs for spare parts given its need to make significant  cost reductions.", "Furthermore, as part of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2020 program budget review,  DOD conducted modeling and analysis to project how various courses of  action\u2014such as increasing purchases of spare parts to compensate for  how long it actually takes to repair parts or reducing aircraft production\u2013 would affect F-35 fleet performance. DOD\u2019s analysis projected that if no  additional actions were taken beyond what the U.S. services had already  planned for and funded, F-35 aircraft performance would increase for a  period of time. However, it would then worsen significantly with the growth  of the fleet. Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense said that,  as a result of this analysis, DOD is considering some additional  investments to increase the availability of parts that would result in  increased funding requirements for the U.S. services, but that as of  January 2019, decisions were not finalized. They further said that their  recent modeling and analysis efforts for the fiscal year 2020 program  budget review did not formally consider additional investments to lower  the planned S-rate to 10 percent as a course of action, but that this  misalignment between the quantity of parts that DOD is planning to  purchase and what is needed will hinder DOD\u2019s ability to meet warfighter  performance requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD May Have Limited Options to Increase F-35 Spare Parts Availability for Its Operational Fleet", "paragraphs": ["Supporting Recent F-35 Shipboard  Deployments  The F-35 program was not able to fill the  Marine Corps\u2019 afloat spares packages  (packages of spare parts designed for aircraft  stationed on ships) for the first F-35  deployments aboard the U.S.S. Essex and  U.S.S. Wasp in 2018 in time to support those  deployments. As a result, the F-35 program  pulled spare parts from inventories at Marine  Corps Stations Yuma, Arizona, and Iwakuni,  Japan. Marine Corps officials stated that  these actions reduced F-35 readiness in  Iwakuni.", "Moreover, DOD may have limited options to increase spare parts  availability for its operational fleet because of the way in which the  program is currently structured to allocate parts. Within the F-35 program,  the U.S. services do not have control over how F-35 parts are allocated,  but rather share access to the parts along with the rest of the global fleet.  The prime contractor is responsible for allocating parts to meet the  requirements of all participants who share in the global spares pool. In  response to parts shortages to date, Air Force and Marine Corps officials  have said that the program has generally supported big events, such as  the 2018 operational deployments of the U.S. services, by shifting parts to  those units from the broader global spares pool (see sidebar). According  to service officials, decisions to shift parts to different locations to support  operational priorities could potentially be made by either a military service  that owns those parts or DOD leadership within a legacy program.  However, Office of the Secretary of Defense and program officials said  that there is no mechanism within the current construct of the F-35\u2019s  global support strategy for program participants to optimize readiness for  certain units by increasing the allocation of parts to those locations, short  of deviating from existing program rules or contractual arrangements. As  the size of the fleet and number of operational squadrons grow, the F-35  program will face increasing demands on its supply chain and competing  operational priorities across participants that will likely make it more  difficult for the program and the U.S. services to mitigate fleet-wide  shortages of F-35 parts.", "GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states  that agencies should define objectives clearly to identify risk, including  considering external requirements and internal expectations, and to  design and implement activities to respond to those risks.

These risks are related to (1) the make-up of the afloat and deployment  F-35 parts packages, (2) the prioritization process for distributing scarce  parts among global F-35 participants, and (3) the F-35 program\u2019s global  networks for moving parts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spare Parts for Deploying Aircraft Do Not Always Match Military Service Needs", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces challenges in ensuring that the parts in its purchased afloat  and deployment spares packages match the needs of deploying  operational aircraft. According to Air Force and Marine Corps officials,  ensuring that these parts packages are appropriately configured is of  significant operational concern because units may be completely reliant  on them while deployed to locations that the F-35 supply chain cannot yet  readily support.", "The afloat and deployment spare parts packages are purchased  according to a list of parts planned and paid for by an F-35 program  participant at least 2 to 3 years in advance, aligning with the aircraft being  purchased at that time and the best projections of what the demand for  the parts will be. However, given the immaturity of the F-35 program,  continued modifications to parts and aircraft can make such packages  out-of-date by the time F-35 units are preparing to deploy. For example,  Air Force officials told us that the spare parts packages for its November  2017\u2014May 2018 operational F-35 deployment in Japan included parts  that were not compatible with the aircraft with which they intended to  deploy. Thus, the Air Force had to change its plans and deploy with older  aircraft with less advanced capabilities that matched the parts in the  package instead of the aircraft that best met their operational  requirements. The Marine Corps faced similar challenges with its first  shipboard deployments in 2018. Table 1 shows the number of parts and  examples of parts in the Marine Corps\u2019 afloat spares packages for the  U.S.S. Wasp and U.S.S. Essex deployments that were not initially  configured to be compatible with the Marine Corps\u2019 deploying aircraft.", "Air Force and Marine Corps officials also said the quantity of parts within  their parts packages were not fully reflective of the actual demands for  certain parts, based on updated information about the reliability of certain  parts and how frequently they needed to be replaced. In other words, the  initially built packages did not have enough of the right parts to meet  mission requirements. For example, Marine Corps officials said they were  able to identify more than a dozen different parts in one of their afloat  spares packages prior to deploying that were not provided in sufficient  quantities because the program did not account for the actual fleet  demand for these parts in its modeling for the afloat spares package. Air  Force officials expressed similar concerns and said that they have had  difficulty in getting information from the program that would enable the Air  Force to assess whether there are enough of the right parts in its  deployment spares packages relative to the actual demands for these  parts. This is a concern for the Air Force as it prepares for its next F-35  deployment, because officials said that they cannot be sure that the  package of parts with which they will deploy will have sufficient parts to  support the deployment.", "The F-35 program does not have a process in place for changing out the  parts within the afloat and deployment spares packages that are put on  contract years before a deployment. Such a process is needed to ensure  that the packages reflect the actual configurations of the deploying aircraft  or updated demand projections for parts. Service and program officials  said that such a process would need to include a review of the parts  within the packages to ensure that they match deploying aircraft and  aligning the funds to pay for any necessary updates or modifications to  the parts, which could potentially cost tens of millions of dollars. F-35  program policy recognizes that the program may need to adjust the  configurations or quantity of parts in the packages based on updated  information, noting that such actions may necessitate contractual  changes, but it does not specify the process for these adjustments. In our  discussions with the prime contractor, program office, and military  services, officials have lacked clarity regarding who is responsible for  reviewing the parts in the package to ensure that they are appropriately  configured and for determining whether additional contract actions or  funding are needed to update the packages.", "In lieu of an established process to refresh these parts, service and  contractor officials described an ad hoc and manual effort to review the  packages prior to deployment. To address non-matching parts, contractor  officials said that the program had to pull parts from the global and base  spares packages to make exchanges. Officials said that this cuts into the  parts that are available for the other F-35 units that rely on those  packages, because the global and base packages are not stocked with  the parts to support the deployments. For example, the program used 187  parts from the inventory at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni to backfill  parts for the U.S.S. Wasp. The Marine Corps\u2019 squadron in Iwakuni stated  that this had a measurable effect on the squadron\u2019s readiness to support  its operational requirements, as reflected by lower availability of parts  within their inventory to support broken aircraft. Specifically, during the  time of the U.S.S. Wasp deployment, only about 46 percent of the critical  parts (that is, parts needed to fix aircraft that cannot fly) that the squadron  at Iwakuni needed were available in its inventory, and the squadron had  to wait an average of about 12 days to receive these parts from off-base.  As the F-35 fleet continues to expand and the number of operational  deployments increases, military service officials said that these manual  workarounds and the singular focus on ensuring that one unit has the  appropriate parts to deploy will not be tenable. Program officials said that  they have started a working group to look at options for addressing this  issue, but they could not provide a timeframe or details about this effort.", "DOD guidance for risk management in acquisition programs states that  defense programs must anticipate and address risks on a continuing  basis, and suggests that programs implement processes that include risk  identification, analysis, mitigation, monitoring, and planning. Further, the  services have recognized that, to meet operational readiness objectives  in a deployed environment, it is critical to have mechanisms ensuring that  spare parts packages with which units plan to deploy are built to support  the configurations and expected missions of the deploying aircraft, and  have established guidance and processes to that effect. DOD also has  a separate, ongoing initiative to determine whether using risk-based  assumptions can produce a more efficient and effective mix of parts  within deployment parts packages across a range of weapon systems,  including the F-35. While this effort is nascent, it could potentially offer  insights for the F-35 program to consider when reviewing the make-up of  the F-35 deployment and afloat spares packages. Without a process for  DOD to modify the F-35 afloat and deployment spares packages, to  include reviewing the parts within the packages to ensure that they match  deploying aircraft and accounting for updated parts demand, and without  aligning any necessary funding for needed updates, the military services  face risk that the parts that they have specifically purchased to meet their  operational requirements will not be sufficient to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty Exists about How Scarce Spare Parts Will Be Prioritized among All F-35 Customers", "paragraphs": ["Uncertainty exists about how the program will prioritize scarce F-35 spare  parts among global participants. The program has developed a set of  business rules to govern the prioritization of scarce F-35 parts. The  business rules are to differentiate between the relative significance of  competing needs and create a structure to be responsive to customer  requirements during both peacetime and war. These rules are critical to  ensuring fair and transparent allocation of parts to all program  participants, particularly given the significant shortages of spare parts  throughout the F-35 program. Under these rules, F-35 units are assigned  numerical designations based on the importance of their mission (that is,  force activity designators), and their part requests are similarly assigned  designations based on how important the part is to aircraft functionality  (that is, urgency of need). Under these rules, the force activity  designators of each unit and the urgency of need for each part request  are combined to create an analysis that is applied to requests for scarce  parts to determine which unit should receive the part. For example,  according to such an analysis, a deployed F-35 unit that orders a part for  an aircraft that cannot fly without that part would have priority over all  other units. Conversely, an F-35 training unit that needs a part to  replenish the inventory of parts on its shelves would have very low priority  for the part relative to that of other units. See figure 10 for a general  depiction of the prioritization scheme for F-35 parts.", "According to program and contractor officials, the prime contractor has  been allocating parts according to these business rules, but these rules  are not comprehensive. Officials from the Joint Staff, Office of the  Secretary of Defense, program office, and military services cited a  number of areas where the rules lack clarity and detail. For example,  there is a lack of clarity around how force activity designations will be  assigned and by whom. The business rules state that each unit\u2019s force  activity designation will be assigned by the participant\u2019s national  command authority, but they do not specify the process for doing so;  provide for a clear role for the U.S. combatant commanders in the  process; or specify the level of U.S. and international leadership required  in order to make changes to this designation. In addition, stakeholders  with whom we spoke said that the existing force activity designations do  not provide for enough differentiation between types of activities or  account for the unit\u2019s unique mission requirements when determining how  important a part is to aircraft functionality. For example, military units that  are engaged in combat operations are assigned the same force activity  designations as units that are forward-based to react to potential threats.  These officials expressed concern that as the global fleet expands and  more units are engaged in operations, this practice could lead to a  situation in which too many units are a \u201cpriority\u201d at any one time.  Stakeholders have also raised questions about whether and how F-35  participants should be charged for increases in their force activity  designations, as this matter is not addressed within the current business  rules.", "Furthermore, the F-35 Product Support Manager has at times waived  these business rules to support deployments and other activities, such as  aircraft operational tests. For example, the Air Force unit that deployed to  Japan in 2017 experienced significant readiness challenges because the  business rules had established the replenishment of its spare parts  package as a low priority relative to other competing demands for scarce  parts. Air Force officials said that this contributed to its aircraft being  unable to fly due to shortages of parts more than 30 percent of the time  (cumulative over a month). According to Air Force and contractor officials,  Air Force leadership then made a number of calls to the program office to  request that its replenishment requirements be given higher priority.  Subsequently, the F-35 Product Support Manager directed that the  contractor deviate from the business rules to place a higher priority on the  replenishment of the deployed unit\u2019s parts package so that it could get  parts faster. Service and program officials said that such deviations may  be necessary to meet operational requirements, and that program  leadership needs some flexibility in the business rules to make those  decisions. According to program officials, the F-35 Product Support  Manager has the authority to issue waivers to the business rules, but the  business rules do not clearly grant this waiver authority to the Product  Support Manager, or address how and when such waivers should occur.", "Stakeholders have been raising some of these concerns for several  years. For example, the Office of the Secretary Defense and the Joint  Staff developed related position papers that identified gaps in the  business rules. Officials from these offices said that the papers were sent  to the program office in 2014 and early 2017, respectively. In response,  the F-35 program established a working group in May 2018 to begin  revising the business rules. As of January 2019, program officials said  that the revised business rules were undergoing internal review, but the  date for completion was not yet determined due to potentially lengthy  timeframes associated with obtaining formal approval through the F-35  governance process. This ongoing effort is promising, but the specific  action items that the working group was tasked with incorporating into the  business rules do not clearly address some of the areas of concern raised  by stakeholders. For example, these action items do not include the issue  of deviations from the business rules.", "DOD directs its components to comply with DOD\u2019s established materiel  management guidance, which outlines DOD policy, assigns  responsibilities and specifically provides procedures for how parts and  materiel should be prioritized for responding to customer supply chain  demands for all DOD components, including outlining the application of  force activity designators and the role of the combatant commanders.  The F-35 program\u2019s existing business rules incorporate many aspects of  this standard DOD prioritization guidance, but they are not fully aligned  with this guidance. For example, DOD\u2019s standard process outlines the  use of five potential force activity designators, while the F-35 program  provides for only three different designations. Additionally, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government states that agencies should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks,  including implementing control activities through policies. U.S. service  and international officials said that, as the fleet and competition for spare  parts increases, they are concerned that participants may try to  manipulate the system due to the lack of clarity within the existing rules.  Without ensuring that the revisions to its business rules for the  prioritization of scarce F-35 parts across all program participants define  stakeholder roles and responsibilities, the process for assigning and  arbitrating force activity designations, and the manner in which deviations  from the business rules will be conducted, the F-35 program may face  challenges allocating parts to support competing U.S. and international  warfighter requirements. Further, F-35 program participants may lack  confidence in the equity of decisions regarding scarce parts that affect  their operational requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Networks to Move F-35 Parts around the World Are Immature", "paragraphs": ["DOD is now moving F-35 parts around the world, but its global networks  for doing so are immature and there is risk that they will not be fully  capable to support an expanding fleet. The F-35 program has a growing  number of U.S. and international participant bases outside of the United  States and is providing supply support from its global spares pool for an  increasing number of operational deployments. For its supply chain  construct to work as intended, F-35 parts must be able to move freely and  efficiently among U.S. and international program participants, suppliers,  and repair facilities, regardless of the country or company of origin. The  program has projected that F-35 parts could potentially be moved on 132  different paths between participating countries (for example, Italy to  United Kingdom, Italy to Norway) and 2,162 paths between F-35 sites (for  example, a warehouse in the Netherlands to a base in Norway). This will  require the program to establish strategically located warehouses,  synchronize global distribution networks, and navigate a complex web of  import and export activities and international weapon control laws.", "However, the envisioned global network is not yet in place. For instance,  regional warehouses planned for the Netherlands and Australia are not  expected to reach initial operational capability until, at the earliest, late  2019 and 2020, respectively. Furthermore, the program is still working to  establish functional shipping networks and locations at which to receive  parts. It also does not have mechanisms in place to support the range of  required import and export activities. Spare parts are instead being  moved under a less efficient system, with the parts originating from and  returning to the United States before being delivered to an international  program participant.

The 2018 F-35 sustainment contract  establishes minimum and objective targets for customer wait times across  the F-35 fleet. The targets are the same regardless of whether the aircraft  are located inside or outside of the United States, thus reflecting the  intended global nature of the network. However, customer wait times for  parts for units located outside of the continental United States have been  significantly higher than those for units located inside of the continental  United States, as shown in figure 12. Unless otherwise noted, the data  are inclusive of customer wait times for both U.S. and international  participants.", "Officials from Marine Corps, Air Force, and international F-35 squadrons  that were based or deployed overseas in Japan and the United Kingdom  described long wait times of up to 17 days\u2014well outside of the 6-and 10- day customer wait-time metric ranges for critical parts\u2014to receive  available parts overseas that have degraded their readiness. They cited  several reasons for these delays, such as export and import licenses not  being in place, delays in customs, inefficient routing or processing of  parts, and ineffective commercial freight forwarders. For example, Air  Force and contractor officials said that it was initially taking parts up to 14  to 16 days to reach the deployed Air Force unit in Japan using a  commercial shipper, which was hurting the unit\u2019s readiness. According to  DOD and contractor officials, these concerns drove the prime contractor  to start shipping parts via military air, which subsequently decreased  customer wait times significantly. However, these officials said that the  program did not have the appropriate contracting and funding  mechanisms in place to utilize military air and had to return to using a  different commercial shipper.", "The F-35 program\u2019s plan for full establishment of the global networks for  moving parts is not complete. Program officials and contractor officials  told us that planning for this network is 3 to 4 years behind the need  because the program was more focused on producing the aircraft than on  sustainment. Prime contractor officials also said that they did not realize  the complexity of setting up the network, which will require them to  establish export and import authorizations in every country and to work  through the Department of State to establish export licenses. In addition,  the construct necessitates that each of the international participants takes  actions within its own government to ensure that the appropriate  arrangements are in place, such as obtaining waivers for taxes, tariffs,  and duties, or pursuing any necessary changes to its own government\u2019s  laws. The F-35 program initiated its focused planning for this network in  2018, with the establishment of a working group tasked to develop plans  for implementing the network. In January 2019, the F-35 program issued  a high-level strategy that provided some limited information on the  program\u2019s objective and key principles for the network. It also indicated  that a forthcoming F-35 program instruction would provide a framework  for executing the strategy, but it did not have a timeline or details for the  completion of this instruction.", "Also in January 2019, DOD selected the U.S. Transportation Command  and the Defense Logistics Agency as the entities responsible for the  global transportation and distribution networks for F-35 parts\u2014a transition  that is expected to occur over the next 12 to 24 months. According to  Department of Defense documentation, existing U.S. Transportation  Command and Defense Logistics Agency networks are already in place  to support much of the required F-35 global parts movements, particularly  for U.S. units and foreign military sales customers. However, these  organizations will still be reliant on the F-35 program to establish the  necessary licenses and legal frameworks for the movement of parts  between partner countries.", "The program has established a target date of September 1, 2021 for full  operational capability of the network, at which point spare parts are  intended to be able to be moved freely throughout the F-35 enterprise.

However, there are risks to the program\u2019s planning effort.  Beyond the complexity of the network, the F-35 program office and  contractors do not control all elements needed to support the successful  implementation of the network. Specifically, each international partner is  responsible for establishing the necessary legal framework in its own  country to support the network, which can be a lengthy process. Program  officials further noted that other international participants have national  laws or have made decisions that are not conducive to the free flow of  parts throughout the global network. F-35 program policy provides some  provisions to address non-conformance by partners\u2014for example, stating  that partners will be responsible for any taxes or tariffs charged to the  program by their own countries. However, program officials said that the  mechanisms to manage any such deviations will be complex to  implement and are still being developed.", "Our prior work on acquisition management has identified a number of key  program management practices that can improve program outcomes if  implemented, such as clearly establishing well-defined requirements and  developing realistic schedules that include risk analysis.

However, program  officials told us that DOD did not develop a corresponding plan to  maintain accountability over the parts that it already owned or would  purchase in the future. According to program officials, this is due in part to  property accountability not being a priority for the program in its effort to  field aircraft. This is evidenced by the number of staff within the program  office dedicated to this mission; program officials said that until recently  there was only one government official at the program office overseeing  property accountability for the F-35 system.", "In order to maintain accountability for government property, such as the  spare parts within the F-35 supply chain, DOD guidance requires that  DOD components establish and maintain a physical inventory control  program for assets within the DOD supply chain to serve as a key internal  control for providing information to inform inventory financial statements.  Defense Contract Management Agency officials also told us that in order  to improve F-35 readiness and decrease costs, DOD must have an  understanding of the F-35 spare parts it owns, where those parts are  located, and how those parts are being used to support the weapon  system. However, the F-35 program has not consistently followed DOD  guidance for property accountability. For example:", "As of December 2018, the program office had not populated an  accountable property system of record with data for its F-35 parts.  DOD components are required to establish and maintain accountable  property systems of record for property that DOD components own  and manage. An accountable property system of record is required to  contain information such as cost, location, and custodial ownership  data for property, including individual parts, that meet certain criteria,  and to provide a comprehensive log of transactions that can be  audited. Such a system would allow the F-35 program office to have  asset visibility for spare parts within the F-35 supply chain. The  program office has identified a database to use as its accountable  property system of record, but DOD officials stated that the program  office does not have the data necessary to populate it. According to  program officials, the prime contractor keeps some of the required  data in proprietary databases to which the program office does not  have access. In addition, DOD officials told us that the program office  is working through some limitations that need to be addressed with  the system the program office has chosen to be its accountable  property system of record in order to properly maintain data records.", "The program office has not fully identified which spare parts the prime  contractor is required to enter into DOD\u2019s Item Unique Identification  registry (hereinafter referred to as DOD\u2019s central registry for  government property). In addition to component-specific accountable  property systems of record, DOD\u2019s central registry for government  property is DOD\u2019s primary data source for government furnished  property, and it is intended to provide department-wide asset visibility  for all government property and links with financial and accountability  systems in order to maintain accountability over the assets DOD  owns. DOD guidance states that agencies are to require contractors  to report government furnished property in DOD\u2019s central registry for  government property. DOD guidance also states that DOD agencies  are to identify which assets require unique item-level traceability.  However, the program office has not clearly defined for the prime  contractor all F-35 spare parts that should be entered into DOD\u2019s  central registry. As a result, DOD officials said the prime contractor is  not entering in information about all required parts. Moreover, a  property accountability official said that the prime contractor is not  consistently entering F-35 parts into DOD\u2019s central registry when the  parts are delivered, because the prime contractor may delay entering  information into DOD\u2019s central registry until all items associated with a specific contract line item have been delivered to DOD. This official  also said that there are some contract line items dating back to the  first production lot, which delivered aircraft in 2011, that remain open,  and thus there are potentially thousands of F-35 parts that are being  used within the global spares pool that have not been entered into the  registry, thereby impeding DOD\u2019s visibility over these parts.", "DOD has not established a program policy that explicitly defines how it  will maintain accountability of F-35 spare parts in accordance with DOD  guidance. According to program officials, DOD has made some recent  progress to address accountability issues, such as taking steps to bring  contracts into compliance with property accountability regulations and  increasing the number of staff focused on property accountability within  the F-35 program office. However, DOD faces continued challenges in  accounting for F-35 assets. In the absence of a program policy, the  program lacks clarity on how to categorize assets and which property  data the contractor is required to provide for those assets, how to  implement policies and regulations, and how to define prime contractor  roles and responsibilities. For example, F-35 contracts contain Federal  Acquisition Regulation clauses that convey requirements for the prime  contractor related to the accountability of government furnished property,  including specifying the data that the contractor must maintain and  provide to DOD. However, DOD officials said that the F-35 program office  has not contractually established which items\u2014including spare parts\u2014are  government furnished property, which has made it difficult for the program  office to hold the contractor accountable for those required functions. As a  result, the contractor has disputed which items should be considered as  government furnished property, which has implications for how the prime  contractor maintains accountability and provides data for F-35 spare parts  it manages.", "Property accountability officials at the F-35 program office have  developed a draft directive that seeks to address the factors currently  impeding the program from being compliant with property accountability  guidance by clarifying roles and responsibilities within the program office  for maintaining accountability of all government furnished property and  pooled assets, including the F-35 spare parts in the supply chain, and  defining prime contractor responsibilities for managing these items and  providing data to the program office for them. Officials told us, however,  that the draft directive is undergoing internal review, and that its timeline  for approval and implementation has not been established. Program  officials said they are also in the process of developing a program  instruction that may provide general procedures for implementing the  policies that will be established in the directive.", "Furthermore, while the draft program directive defines property  accountability goals for the F-35 program, it does not detail the actions  the program office will take to achieve these goals. The program office  will face challenges that may impede its ability to achieve the goals of the  draft directive, both retroactively and prospectively, for the billions of  dollars in F-35 spare parts for which it currently cannot fully account. For  example, DOD officials said that the costs for the prime contractor to  obtain the data required to meet DOD\u2019s requirements for property  accountability will likely be high, as the prime contractor does not centrally  maintain all the data, nor do they maintain the data in a readily usable  format for property accountability purposes. The contractor has estimated  that more than 450,000 hours of labor could be necessary to provide the  data. Program officials also acknowledged that the successful  implementation of the draft directive is dependent upon support from  program office leadership to ensure that its guidance is followed by both  program officials and the prime contractor. However, according to these  officials, the program has not historically prioritized property accountability  in negotiations with the prime contractor because the program office has  been focused on the production and fielding of aircraft and developing  contracts to which the prime contractor will agree.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agencies should define objectives to identify risk, and to design and  implement control activities to respond to those risks. These standards  also state that without a strong tone at the top to support an internal  control system, the entity\u2019s risk identification may be incomplete, risk  responses may be inappropriate, control activities may not be  appropriately designed or implemented, information and communication  may falter, and results of monitoring may not be understood or acted  upon to remediate deficiencies. DOD\u2019s recent efforts related to property  accountability are positive, but DOD stakeholders have raised concerns  about issues related to property accountability within the F-35 program  dating back to 2012 that have not been resolved, such as the program\u2019s  lack of a populated property system of record.", "As the fleet expands and the number of spare parts in the supply chain  continues to grow, the program office will only continue to face increasing  difficulty  in  obtaining  accountability  over  its  F-35  assets  if  it  does  not  address  these  challenges.  To  address  the  scope  of  these  challenges,  DOD will need to establish a unified approach that provides clarity on how  to  categorize  these  assets,  implement  policies  and  regulations,  and  define  prime  contractor  roles  and  responsibilities.  Without  developing  a  policy  that  clearly  resolves  these  issues  and  defines  how  the  F-35  program  will  maintain  accountability  for  spare  parts  within  the  supply  chain  that  is  consistent  with  DOD  guidance\u2014and  identifying  the  steps  that it will take to implement it retrospectively and prospectively, such as  how  the  program  will  obtain  the  necessary  data  from  the  contractor\u2014 DOD  cannot  ensure  that  it  will  be  able  to  obtain  and  maintain  comprehensive accountability and visibility over spare parts within the F- 35  supply  chain.

DOD purchases a high volume of spare parts across several  contracts each year.

DOD does not have a consistent, methodical  process to identify and track the costs of individual F-35 spare parts,  which would typically be done through the purchase contracts for the  parts. However, the F-35 contracts do not identify the individual parts or  their costs. Instead, these costs are aggregated under broad contract line  items, such that individual pricing for spare parts cannot be determined.  For example, the annual sustainment contract for fiscal year 2018   aggregates the costs to repair and replace spare parts for F-35A aircraft  under one contract line item totaling $276 million. The contracts and  related documentation do not specify how the money will be distributed  among costs for repair or replacement, nor do they specify how many  spare parts the contractor will purchase and at what cost.", "Program officials said that their system for contract management has  limitations that make it difficult to separate individual F-35 parts into their  own line items. Since those costs are not being specifically provided in  the contracts, program officials said that DOD has relied upon several ad  hoc, manual workarounds in an attempt to obtain such data for the  thousands of F-35 spare parts it owns, but these efforts are not  comprehensive. For example, a program official said that they are  obtaining cost information from the inspection and receiving forms  accompanying deliveries of F-35 spare parts and then manually entering  these cost data into attachments to the sustainment contracts. However,  DOD officials said that the inspection and receiving forms for deliveries of  F-35 spare parts are often not being entered into the registry until years  after the parts are delivered, because such forms are not required until  the delivery of all parts purchased under the same contract line item are  complete. Furthermore, DOD officials said that this process is not an  effective long-term solution for maintaining cost data of the billions of  dollars in F-35 spare parts that DOD owns, because data entered in the  program\u2019s contract management system through manual workarounds do  not automatically link to the program office\u2019s other data systems. Program  officials said that such linkages are necessary to maintain proper  accounting of F-35 spare parts, as cost data constitute one of the  required data elements for an accountable property system of record.", "Similar to the challenges that DOD faces with property accountability,  program officials said that DOD faces significant hurdles in obtaining cost  data from the prime contractor for individual F-35 spare parts because the  contracts have not been written to require those data from the outset of  the program. According to program officials, the program office has  attempted to negotiate for cost data for F-35 spare parts, but the attempts  have not been successful because of the high price the prime contractor  would have charged the government for these data.", "DOD guidance states that understanding program costs, such as those  for F-35 spare parts, is critical to both achieving desired performance and  supporting financial audits. Specifically, DOD guidance states that the  government should clearly understand program costs in order to have  effective performance-based arrangements. Along these lines, we have  previously reported that DOD\u2019s limited understanding of the actual  sustainment costs of the F-35 system will hinder its ability to accurately  determine how much fleet performance should cost under performance- based contracts, thus putting DOD at risk of overpaying the prime  contractor while not receiving the expected level of sustainment support.  Additionally, DOD guidance requires that DOD agencies assign dollar  values for spare parts in financial accounting systems.", "Without a methodical process for consistently obtaining comprehensive  cost information from the prime contractor for individual F-35 spare parts,  the program office will not be able to maintain financial or property  accountability over these parts in accordance with DOD guidance.

However, there is no  established accounting methodology for defining how to track funding to  the spare parts such that the military services can properly report assets  on financial statements.

Furthermore, according to Office of the Secretary of Defense  and service officials, many of the military services\u2019 sustainment  organizations that provide supply and maintenance support to other  platforms have had almost no role in the planning for and establishment  of sustainment capabilities or ongoing sustainment support for the F-35.", "Of these common items, more than 6,000  100,000 demands for these common  items, 435 of which had impacts on fleet  readiness.", "In April 2018, in a departure from the strategy and structure of the  program and at the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Logistics and Materiel Readiness), the Defense Logistics Agency and the  military services\u2019 supply and sustainment organizations initiated planning  efforts to develop an option for organic\u2014that is, DOD-managed\u2014supply  chain management support that would include increased roles for the  services\u2019 supply organizations and the Defense Logistics Agency in  assuming responsibility for F-35 supply chain management. In support  of this effort, these organizations have begun to develop notional plans to  provision an organic supply chain for F-35 aircraft, which includes  determining how many parts are required to support the system and how  they can be procured. In addition, the Defense Logistics Agency has  begun to catalogue a limited portion of F-35 consumable parts from  production lots 6 and 7 into DOD\u2019s supply system (see sidebar).", "However, officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  Defense Logistics Agency said that this initial cataloguing effort only  includes the level of detail necessary to support disposal of the parts, and  that more comprehensive cataloguing would require DOD to have access  to significantly more technical data than are currently available. Prior to  this effort, parts used on F-35 aircraft were not tracked by DOD in its  logistics information systems.", "Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense said that there are  multiple reasons behind DOD\u2019s recent effort to develop an option for  DOD-led, organic supply chain management, including DOD\u2019s need to  significantly reduce sustainment costs and improve readiness. For  example, according to DOD officials, DOD\u2019s early cataloguing efforts  have identified more than 7,300 F-35 consumable items that are common  to other DOD platforms. Defense Logistics Agency officials said that they  are actively working with the program office and prime contractor to  identify opportunities for the program to leverage the parts that are  already on DOD\u2019s shelves. In the longer term, identifying common parts  could potentially allow DOD to directly procure them at a lower cost rather  than through the prime contractor, and thereby provide economies of  scale across other aviation platforms. Furthermore, the prime contractor  and F-35 Joint Program Office have not been able to deliver the supply  chain performance that the services need under the current sustainment  strategy and structure, as discussed earlier in this report. According to an  official from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DOD is supposed to  have a viable back-up plan for contractor logistics support under  performance-based logistics contracts, in case the contractor cannot  meet the government\u2019s performance requirements. Prior to the ongoing  effort, DOD did not have such a plan. Similarly, DOD guidance on  performance-based agreements states that robust performance-based  logistics solutions include appropriate criteria to cease the arrangement if  necessary in order to manage risk.", "DOD officials involved in the cataloguing and provisioning efforts  described a long-term (5 to 10 years) and phased approach to the  potential development of DOD-led supply chain management capabilities  for the F-35 that would require major changes to the F-35 program  structure and contracts. It would also require DOD to obtain significant  amounts of technical data on F-35 parts from the manufacturers of those  parts (see sidebar). DOD has submitted a request to the prime contractor  for a proposal regarding supplying the data necessary to provision an  organic supply chain and to catalogue all F-35 parts into DOD\u2019s supply  inventory, but as of October 2018, DOD officials said that the prime  contractor had not yet provided the costs of these data.", "Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense told us that DOD had  initially planned to negotiate for these data as part of the annual  sustainment contract for fiscal year 2019, but that the prime contractor  had cautioned that this could delay the awarding of the sustainment  contract because of the complexity around the data negotiations. Officials  said that there were also questions about the type of funds that should be  used for the acquisition of these data (that is, procurement or operations  and maintenance), and whether some data would need to be directly  procured by DOD from the original equipment manufacturers. The lack of  data from the contractor to support competition in the F-35 supply chain  and DOD\u2019s understanding of the costs and performance of the system  has long been a challenge, as we have previously reported. In September  2014, we recommended that DOD develop an Intellectual Property  Strategy, to include identification of all critical technical data needs and  associated costs. Further, in October 2017, we recommended that prior  to entering into multi-year, fixed-price, performance-based contracts,  DOD should ensure that it has sufficient knowledge of the actual costs of  sustainment and technical characteristics of the aircraft after baseline  development is complete and the system reaches maturity. DOD  concurred with both recommendations but has not yet implemented  them.", "In addition, ongoing dialogue among stakeholders within the Department  of Defense demonstrates a growing desire for more direct military service  influence and access to information within the F-35 program. In 2018, the  Secretary of Defense directed the U.S. military service chiefs to correct  the F-35 parts shortages and to be agents of change in pursuing 80  percent mission capability for the F-35 aircraft. In a September 2018  memorandum responding to the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction to  address F-35 parts shortages, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Chief of  Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps raised  concerns about the program\u2019s inadequate supply chain and repair  networks and reported on the funding that the services, as customers,  provided to the Joint Program office to improve delivery of spare parts  and accelerate depot maintenance capability. Furthermore, officials  whom we interviewed from each of the military service headquarters  expressed frustration with the current sustainment construct of the F-35  program in which they pay large sums of money for less-than-required  readiness outcomes but have minimal influence on actions being taken to  improve readiness and limited visibility into supply chain modeling and  data to support their operational decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Determined the Actions and Investments Needed to Support Its Future Strategy for F-35 Supply Chain Management", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not yet determined the actions and investments needed to  support the F-35 supply chain in the future, because the department has  not charted a clear strategy for F-35 supply chain management.

According to program officials, the Product  Support Manager organization at the F-35 Joint Program Office was  structured for management of a program in which the primary contractors  would be providing comprehensive contractor logistics support for the life  of the program, and it has not grown in size as the fleet has grown.

DOD guidance for program managers states that a  sound program strategy requires understanding and clarity of the  program\u2019s desired outcomes, and the plans and resources necessary to  achieve those outcomes. Furthermore, federal internal control standards  demonstrate the necessity of programs defining a clear strategy in order  to support program actions.

Simply purchasing more F- 35 parts without other trade-offs may not be a viable long-term solution  for DOD, given the steep reductions in sustainment costs that the military  services have recognized are needed to make the aircraft affordable.  These complex problems necessitate a comprehensive review by DOD to  determine what actions should be taken to close the gap between  warfighter requirements and the capabilities that the F-35 supply chain  can deliver. Absent such actions, DOD risks that the F-35 will not be able  to conduct the full range of intended missions.", "The military services are integrating the F-35 into their operations with  recent deployments and the establishment of F-35 bases overseas, but  these events have also highlighted key risks for DOD in how it is  managing and moving aircraft parts around the world. If not addressed,  these risks could hinder the readiness of the global fleet. To date, DOD  has been able to mitigate some of these risks by placing singular focus on  ensuring the success of early F-35 deployments, but this will not be  possible with the rapid expansion of the fleet in the next few years.  Specifically, without a process and funding to make changes to the spare  parts within their afloat and deployment spares packages to ensure that  these match their needs, the military services risk not meeting operational  requirements during future deployments. Fleet-wide spare parts  shortages are also putting the F-35 program\u2019s process for prioritizing  scarce F-35 parts to the test. Absent comprehensive business rules, the  F-35 program could face challenges in transparently allocating parts to  support competing U.S. and international requirements. Further, because  the F-35 program did not fully recognize the complexity of establishing a  global network for moving F-35 parts, this network is now several years  behind schedule. Without a detailed plan that includes clear requirements  and milestones to fully establish the network, as well as mechanisms to  identify and mitigate the risk posed by any gaps or delays, DOD cannot  ensure that it will be able to take the network from concept to reality so  that F-35 participants do not experience long wait-times for parts in order  to fly their aircraft.", "Moreover, in its rush to field aircraft and its heavy reliance on the prime  contractor, DOD has not focused on property and financial accountability  of F-35 spare parts. Simply put, DOD does not have records of all the F- 35 spare parts it has purchased; where those parts are located; and how  much the military services paid for them. Until DOD establishes a policy  that clearly defines how the F-35 program will maintain accountability for  spare parts within the supply chain and lays out the steps that it will take  to implement that policy, DOD will continue to lack critical visibility of F-35  assets, which is necessary to hold the prime contractor accountable for  providing sufficient readiness at a reasonable cost. Additionally, without a  process to consistently obtain comprehensive cost information from the  prime contractor for F-35 spare parts, DOD will not have a full picture of  F-35 costs, which could impede its ability to effectively negotiate with the  prime contractor for sustainment support and to improve readiness of the  expanding F-35 fleet. Further, absent a DOD Comptroller-approved  methodology for the military services to record on their financial  statements the funds spent on F-35 parts, DOD will be hindered in its  efforts to comply with financial improvement and audit readiness  requirements. As a result, DOD will not be able to assure the taxpayer  that it fully understands how funds have been spent on this costly weapon  system.", "Finally, from the start of the F-35 program, the U.S. military services have  been largely reliant on the prime contractor to manage the F-35 supply  chain and to support their operations, with oversight from the program  office. However, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the services  have grown dissatisfied with the program\u2019s inability to meet their  readiness requirements and reduce costs, and they have begun to take  actions that indicate the potential for a significant shift in DOD\u2019s F-35  sustainment strategy that would have far-reaching implications for the  program. This shift, if fully implemented, would give more control of the  supply chain to the federal government, but it also would run counter to  the way in which agreements with industry and international participants  have been constructed. Until DOD clearly defines its strategy for  managing the F-35 supply chain in the future\u2014to include any additional  actions and investments necessary to support that strategy\u2014the F-35  program will lack the certainty and unity of effort necessary to  meaningfully improve supply chain performance and reduce costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following eight recommendations to DOD.", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, conducts a comprehensive review of  the F-35 supply chain to determine what additional actions are needed to  close the gap between warfighter requirements for aircraft performance  and the capabilities that the F-35 supply chain can deliver, in light of the  U.S. services\u2019 affordability constraints. Potential actions could include  adjustments to the quantities of parts DOD is planning to procure, or  developing a mechanism for providing increased availability of parts to  operational units, as a means to mitigate fleet-wide shortages.  (Recommendation 1)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, develops a process to modify the  afloat and deployment spares packages, to include reviewing the parts  within the packages to ensure that they match deploying aircraft and  account for updated parts demand, and aligning any necessary funding  needed for the parts updates. (Recommendation 2)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps, revises the business rules for the  prioritization of scarce F-35 parts across all program participants so as to  clearly define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, the  process for assigning force activity designations, and the way in which  deviations from the business rules will be conducted. (Recommendation  3)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, completes a detailed plan for the establishment of the  global network for moving F-35 parts that outlines clear requirements and  milestones to reach full operational capability, and that includes  mechanisms to identify and mitigate risks to the F-35 global spares pool.  (Recommendation 4)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, issues a policy consistent with DOD guidance that  clearly establishes how DOD will maintain accountability for F-35 parts  within the supply chain, and identify the steps needed to implement the  policy retrospectively and prospectively\u2014for example, how DOD will  obtain the necessary data from the contractor. This policy should provide  clarity on how F-35 parts will be categorized, specify how the program will  implement DOD regulations, and define prime contractor roles and  responsibilities. (Recommendation 5)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the F-35 Program  Executive Officer, develops a methodical approach to consistently obtain  comprehensive cost information from the prime contractor for F-35 spare  parts within the supply chain. (Recommendation 6)", "The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, together with the Department of  Defense Comptroller, the Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy, and the  F-35 Program Executive Officer, completes and formalizes a  methodology for the U.S. services to use in recording on their financial  statements the funds spent on F-35 parts within the global spares pool.

To interview officials and  observe F-35 supply and maintenance operations, we conducted site  visits to two F-35 operational locations\u2014Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and  Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona; and one training location\u2014Luke  Air Force Base, Arizona. We selected these locations to obtain  perspectives from both operational and training units from multiple U.S.  military services using different variants of the aircraft, and to gather  insights of international partners co-located at these bases, among other  factors. Additionally, we interviewed officials from the only overseas- based U.S. F-35 operational squadron at Marine Corps Air Station  Iwakuni, Japan, by phone. A complete listing of organizations we  contacted for this review is provided later in this appendix.", "In support of our objectives, we gathered various data related to the F-35  supply chain, such as parts availability, repair, aircraft performance, and  customer wait time data. We gathered data for fiscal year 2018 (October  2017 \u2013 September 2018) and available data from the F-35 program\u2019s  2018 sustainment contract period (May \u2013 November 2018) in order to  provide the most recent information for F-35 fleet performance and overall  supply chain management available during our audit timeframes. To  determine the reliability of these data, we collected information on how  the data were collected, managed, and used through a questionnaire and  interviews with relevant DOD officials and the prime contractor. Although  we identified some limitations in the way that certain data are being  collected and reported\u2014 such as data related to aircraft performance,  aircraft that are not mission capable due to a lack of parts, and parts  cannibalization that could potentially result in inaccuracies\u2014we  determined that they are sufficiently reliable for the way in which we  reported them and our purposes of providing information on the progress  and challenges within the program. Specifically, the parts cannibalization  rates that we discuss are sufficiently reliable to discuss generally in  comparison to program objectives. All other supply chain and  performance data presented in our report are sufficiently reliable to  present as specific data points.", "To assess the extent to which F-35 performance is meeting warfighter  requirements and any challenges with spare parts availability, we  reviewed DOD and contractor sustainment and supply chain plans,  briefings, and reports, and interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense,  U.S. service, program office, and prime contractor officials to determine  the degree to which the supply chain is currently able to provide parts to  meet the U.S. services\u2019 requirements. In addition, we obtained data  related to F-35 parts availability and aircraft performance data for May  through November 2018 and compared these to the program\u2019s target and  the U.S. services\u2019 requirements for these metrics to identify any gaps  between requirements and actual performance. We also obtained data  related to 3-month average part repair times and part repair backlogs as  of November 2018\u2014the most currently available data at the time of our  review. In order to assess the extent to which the supply chain is  positioned to meet future warfighter requirements, we examined program  plans, briefs, and other related documentation, and we interviewed Office  of the Secretary of Defense, U.S. service, program office, and prime  contractor officials to identify the actions that DOD is taking to increase  the availability of F-35 spare parts, DOD\u2019s projections for when these  actions will result in improvements in F-35 aircraft performance, and  ongoing areas of challenge that could create risk for the program in  meeting future warfighter requirements. Finally, we used principles from  the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and DOD  guidance for performance-based arrangements related to how programs  should be structured to meet requirements and respond to risk as a basis  to determine whether DOD needs to take further actions to ensure that  the F-35 supply chain is positioned to meet future warfighter  requirements.", "To assess the extent to which DOD can effectively manage and move F- 35 parts to support aircraft around the world, we reviewed military service  and program briefings and data related to DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2018 F-35  operational deployments, and we interviewed service, program office, and contractor officials about how the F-35 supply chain and its global spares  pool were able to support these deployments, including the extent to  which the packages of parts that the military services purchased to  support these deployments were built to meet their requirements. We  reviewed DOD guidance related to managing risk in acquisition  programs and the Navy\u2019s process and guidance for ensuring that the  packages of parts for legacy aircraft are built to meet the requirements of  deploying aircraft, and we assessed the F-35 program\u2019s processes for  identifying and addressing risks related to the sufficiency of its  deployment parts packages against these criteria.", "We also reviewed the F-35 program\u2019s business rules for allocating and  prioritizing scarce F-35 assets and related documentation, and we  interviewed officials from the Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of  Defense, the services, the program office, and the prime contractor to  understand how the business rules are being applied and to identify any  related F-35 program participant perspectives about or gaps in the rules.  We also reviewed DOD guidance related to prioritizing materiel and parts  to identify standard DOD policies for legacy aircraft, and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, and we used these as a  basis to assess whether the F-35 program\u2019s business rules for allocating  scarce F-35 parts are sufficiently clear and comprehensive.", "In addition, we reviewed available plans, briefs, and other documentation  to understand the F-35 program\u2019s envisioned global network for moving  F-35 parts, the current state of the network, and the program\u2019s projections  for full implementation of the network. Further, we obtained data from  December 2017 through November 2018 related to customer wait times  for parts to determine whether program participants located outside of the  continental United States are waiting longer for parts than those located  inside of the continental United States. We also interviewed officials from  the program office, prime contractor, Office of the Secretary of Defense,  the services, and U.S. Transportation Command to discuss the progress  being made and challenges the program faces in developing the global  network to move F-35 spare parts.

In addition, we reviewed draft guidance and program briefs and  documentation, as well as interviewed officials from the program office, to  identify the actions the program is taking to improve its ability to maintain  accountability of parts in the F-35 program. We compared these efforts  against criteria in DOD guidance for property accountability and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government to assess  whether the program\u2019s current efforts to obtain and maintain  accountability for F-35 spare parts are sufficient to bring the program into  alignment with DOD guidance, and whether any additional actions are  needed.", "To assess the extent to which DOD is maintaining accountability over  costs associated with F-35 spare parts, we reviewed program plans and  documentation related to the construct of the global spares pool. We also  reviewed sustainment contracts and supplemental contract  documentation, and we interviewed officials from the program office,  Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Defense Contract Management  Agency to determine what information DOD has been able to obtain  about the quantity and cost of F-35 spare parts and the approaches that  DOD uses to collect such information. Additionally, we identified criteria  within DOD guidance for performance-based arrangements and the  DOD Financial Management Regulation to serve as a basis to assess  whether the program office\u2019s approach for obtaining cost information is  sufficient to support program and financial management requirements.  We also reviewed DOD and program office documentation and spoke  with officials from the program office and the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to determine the extent to which the  program office has developed a methodology to track the funds paid by  the U.S. military services for F-35 parts to the actual parts within the  global spares pool.
