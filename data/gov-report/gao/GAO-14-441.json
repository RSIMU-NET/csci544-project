Specifically, Form 5500 service provider fee information does not align with other information that service providers must disclose to plan sponsors, forcing providers to produce two different sets of information. Also, differences in service provider compensation types and the lack of definitions for codes designating the types of services provided can result in inconsistent and incomplete data being reported. Other exceptions and gaps in service provider information result in an incomplete picture of plan fees. For example, large plans\u2014those with 100 or more participants\u2014are not required to report fee information for certain types of compensation and small plans file only limited fee information.", "The Department of Labor (DOL), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) face significant administrative, statutory, and contractual challenges to collecting and revising the annual reporting information required for regulating private pensions. While the rulemaking process and other informal efforts to solicit stakeholder input have provided opportunities for public reaction to proposed changes to the form, these opportunities have been limited and have not included the advance testing OMB guidance suggests. Stakeholder input could lower costs by reducing subsequent changes, improve filer comprehension, and increase the comparability and reliability of the form's data. Additionally, a statutory prohibition against requiring electronic filing caused IRS to remove certain data elements from the Form 5500 after DOL mandated electronic filing of the form. If IRS were able to require electronic filing, it could add the data elements back to the form, which would improve its compliance, restore robust information to its enforcement activities, and decrease its data collection costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOL, Treasury, and PBGC consider modifying Form 5500 plan investment and service provider fee information to address challenges identified by our panel.

To protect this key source of retirement security,  the federal government needs information to ensure that plans are  operated in accordance with certain prescribed standards and that  sufficient information is provided to protect participant interests. The Form  5500 Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan (Form 5500) is the  primary source of information for both the federal government and the  private sector regarding the funding, assets, investments, and fees of  pension and other employee benefit plans. The Department of Labor  (DOL), the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), jointly developed  the form so plan sponsors could satisfy annual reporting requirements  under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)5500 to collect information for their various roles in regulating and  monitoring private pension plans. Close to 700,000 plans filed a Form  5500 in 2011, representing over $6 trillion in assets and more than 130  . The three agencies use the Form  million participants and beneficiaries. Additional federal agencies and  many private sector stakeholders use the plan investment and service  provider fee information collected via the Form 5500 to assess plan  benefits, fees, economic trends, public policy implications, and other  issues. Although a large number of retirees rely on employer-sponsored  plans, participants rarely review Form 5500 data themselves. Instead,  participant advocates such as ERISA plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and retirement  counselors use the data to help protect participants\u2019 interests.", "Despite widespread use of and reliance on Form 5500 data, concerns  have long been raised by stakeholders\u2014especially those who prepare  and use the form data\u2014about the quality and usefulness of data it  collects on plan investments and service provider fees. Data on those  fees are crucial in assessing the financial risk, health, and cost of the  plans, including service provider fee disclosures. Along with some  researchers, we have expressed concerns that the form does not collect  all of the information stakeholders need, including sufficient detail to fully  understand plan investments, performance, and fees. We and the filing  community have also found aspects of the form to be burdensome to  complete and difficult to interpret.

To satisfy the annual reporting requirements, DOL, IRS, and  PBGC jointly developed and maintain the Form 5500. The form is the  primary source of information collected by the federal government  regarding the operation, funding, expenses, and investments of employee  benefit plans. In 2011, plan sponsors filed close to 700,000 Form 5500  reports, covering more than 130 million active participants and more than  $6 trillion in investments.

IRS uses the form to enforce standards that relate to such  matters as how employees become eligible to participate in benefit plans,  how they become eligible to earn rights to benefits, and the minimum  amount employers must contribute. PBGC uses the form as a tool to  inform its efforts to insure the benefits of participants in most private  sector defined benefit pension plans and help carry out its mission under  Title IV of ERISA to encourage the continuation and maintenance of  private pension plans. In March 2014, the DOL Office of Inspector  General issued an audit report examining whether EBSA was effectively  overseeing the Form 5500 reporting process.agencies and Congress use information collected through the form to  assess economic trends and develop policy initiatives. The Form 5500 is  also a source of information and data for various nongovernmental  stakeholders, who use it to assess employee benefit, tax, and economic  trends and policies.

Because there was no electronic filing  requirement when EFAST was implemented, most forms were submitted  on paper. In January 2010, DOL completed its effort to begin collecting  Form 5500 information electronically, an initiative known as ERISA Filing  Acceptance System (EFAST2). DOL contracted with an information  technology firm to design, develop, test, implement, operate, and  maintain the EFAST2 system. While the form and its attachments are  collected electronically, attachments are not all required to be in a single  structured, data-searchable format. The move to EFAST2 and the  implementation of an electronic filing requirement have addressed some  long-standing issues with the timeliness of Form 5500 data, but additional  timeliness concerns have not been addressed. Specifically, in a 2005  report we raised concerns about the timeliness of Form 5500 information  due to statutory reporting requirements that allow filers a substantial  amount of time to file the Form 5500, which did not change with the  implementation of EFAST2.", "DOL issued regulations revising the form in November 2007 in an effort to  facilitate the transition to an electronic filing system; reduce and  streamline annual reporting burdens; and update the annual reporting  forms to reflect current issues, agency priorities, and requirements of the  Pension Protection Act of 2006.expanded the fee and compensation disclosures of the Form 5500.  According to DOL officials, these changes were made to increase  transparency regarding the fees and expenses employee benefit plans  pay. DOL officials explained that they also wanted to ensure that plan  officials would obtain the information needed to assess the compensation  paid for services rendered to the plan while taking into consideration  revenue-sharing arrangements among plan service providers and  potential conflicts of interest. Since the 2009 plan year, Schedule C  requires plan sponsors to classify the fees they pay service providers as  either \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d compensation. These fees are separated into  those the plan pays directly to a service provider and those that service  providers receive from third parties (such as another service provider) or  plan investments.", "Among other things, these changes  DOL, IRS, and PBGC have established committees to work collectively  on a number of initiatives related to the form. The tri-agency Form 5500  working group, which consists of representatives from all three agencies,  meets monthly to propose updates and discuss how to implement  updates provided by each agency that should be made to the Form 5500.  Proposed updates include minor technical changes, changes to the  instructions, and changes that must be made as a result of statutory or  regulatory changes. This working group facilitates discussion between the  agencies, but according to DOL officials it is not a decision-making body.  Each of the three agencies decides independently whether to proceed  with changes to the form. Recently the three agencies established the  21st Century Initiative to examine, among other things, the possibility of  modernizing the form by making major, substantive revisions to all its  parts. In addition, the initiative plans to examine the feasibility of  streamlining the lengthy rulemaking process which generally requires  DOL to take several steps, including obtaining review and clearance to  publish by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and publishing a  notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, providing  interested persons the opportunity to comment on the proposed  regulation, and publishing a final regulation.

Table 1 lists the top challenges respondents to the second phase of the  survey rated as having a very or extremely significant impact to their work  with the Form 5500."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Challenges with Plan Asset Categories", "paragraphs": ["Some Form 5500 stakeholders stated that the plan asset categories on  Schedule H are not representative of current plan investments, which has  several consequences. Ten of 31 respondents noted that it\u2019s a very or  extremely significant challenge to break out plan assets on Schedule H  differently than the investment industry typically reports this information.  That makes it difficult to determine how to properly categorize  investments based on the asset categories provided, according to a plan  fiduciary. For example, large plans typically use an investment manager  for each asset category (such as fixed income, equities, hedge funds, or  private equity), but Schedule H\u2019s plan asset categories are broken out by  the type of investment vehicle (such as partnerships, collective trusts,  pooled separate accounts, or mutual funds). Thus, it can be difficult to  understand the categories, apply them, and disaggregate the data by  investment vehicle rather than asset class. As one pension consultant  said, the asset categories provide little insight into the investments  themselves, the level of associated risk, or the structures of these  investments. Furthermore, as one preparer pointed out, the trust reports  and the audited financial statement do not match Form 5500 asset  categories\u2014forcing plan sponsors and their service providers to produce  multiple sets of information. In addition, they often found inconsistencies,  incomplete information, or miscategorized investments in the information  service providers submitted.", "A second consequence of misaligned plan asset categories, according to  Form 5500 stakeholders, is that the \u201cother\u201d plan asset category is too  broad. The \u201cother\u201d plan asset category may contain a variety of different  types of disparate investments, such as options, index futures, state and  municipal securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Seventeen of the  31 respondents indicated that the \u201cother plan asset\u201d category is too broad  and poses a very or extremely significant challenge to their work with  Form 5500 data. One respondent said that while hedge fund and private  equity have very different risk, return, and disclosure considerations from  state and municipal securities, all these investments could be included in  the \u201cother plan asset\u201d category. This is a growing issue as plan  investment in some of these vehicles has grown considerably in recent  years. As we found in 2012, according to a Pensions & Investments  survey, the percentage of large plans (as measured by total plan assets)  investing in hedge funds grew from 47 percent in 2007 to 60 percent in  2010 and the percentage of large plans that invested in private equity  grew from 80 percent to 92 percent. Similarly, several respondents said  they have seen forms where large portions of plan assets were recorded  in the \u201cother\u201d category.", "A third consequence of misaligned plan asset categories is that the  current reporting format of plan investments makes it difficult to see the  underlying holdings of indirect investments. According to a recent  study, large single-employer defined benefit plans invested about 64  percent of their total assets, on average, in four types of indirect  investments in 2010 (see table 2). Thus, a majority of the assets of large  single-employer defined benefit plans are reported only as  \u201cundifferentiated indirect investments\u201d on Schedule H. Similarly, large  single-employer defined contribution plans in 2010 held about 34 percent  of their total assets, on average, in indirect investments (see table 2).  Almost half of our survey respondents indicated that Schedule H\u2019s lack of  transparency into the breakdown of investments held within each trust  was a very or extremely significant challenge. Eight out of 11 researchers  and 5 of 6 participant representatives from our survey panel indicated this  was a very or extremely significant challenge. One ERISA attorney we  spoke to noted that he needed to hire a consulting actuary to provide  clarity of one plan\u2019s financial investments. Without clear information on  these indirect investment vehicles, it is more difficult for Form 5500  stakeholders to assess and analyze the risk of underlying investments of  plans using Form 5500 data. For example, PBGC officials acknowledged  that plan asset information as currently reported is not very useful to their  work and that they have to ask plans for additional information, such as  actuarial reports and audited financial statements, to help identify the  underlying assets in indirect investments to assess the financial health of  the plan.", "The ability to see into the underlying holdings of indirect investments is  further complicated by the difficulty in matching a plan\u2019s investments and  returns with those reported in the indirect investment\u2019s filing. Seven of  11 researchers and 3 of 6 participant representatives from our panel cited  difficulty in matching up an individual plan\u2019s investment and returns from  indirect investments as a very or extremely significant challenge. When  plan assets are invested in indirect investments, plan sponsors file a  Schedule D, which lists the plan\u2019s interests in each indirect investment;  the indirect investment\u2019s filing then provides a breakdown of assets in its  own Schedule H (see figs.1 and 2). Although indirect investments are  required to file their own Form 5500, they report on their general asset  holdings, not the holdings of individual plans invested with them.  According to one respondent, there is no way to calculate the fees  charged to individual plans. Furthermore, the information reported on  Schedule D may not be reliable or complete and may not match the  information in the indirect investment\u2019s filing. According to a recent study  of 2008 plan year Form 5500 data, more than 35 percent of plans that  invested in indirect investments reported data on their Schedules H and D  that were inconsistent. In addition to internal inconsistencies, the study  showed that matching a plan\u2019s indirect investments with the indirect  investment\u2019s own filing can be challenging since 18 percent of reported  plan investments could not be matched to a corresponding indirect  investment filing. Furthermore, there may be multiple layers of indirect  investment entities that complicate efforts to identify the underlying  investments individual plans held because it required linking multiple  indirect investment filings to a single plan filing (see fig. 1).", "The top rated change to plan investment information suggested by  respondents was to revise Schedule H asset categories to better match  current investment vehicles (see appendix II). Consistent with the results  of our survey panel, DOL, IRS, and PBGC officials all concurred that plan  asset categories do not reflect investments in the current marketplace  and should be revised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with Finding Key Information", "paragraphs": ["In addition to challenges with the reporting format, Form 5500  stakeholders identified various instances where information is not  collected or easily extracted from Form 5500 data.

Attachments to the form can be large\u2014 some may be as long as 400 pages\u2014presenting a challenge for users to  find necessary information. Also, it can be difficult to conduct aggregate  analyses of the information without a unique identifier, such as a  Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP)  number, as one respondent suggested. Our survey results showed that  while most researchers indicated that a lack of a standard reporting  format or unique identifier for plan assets attachment is a major  challenge, representatives of plan sponsors and service providers and  participant representatives did not.indicated that standardizing the format would be a somewhat positive or  very positive change and only 3 respondents indicated this change would  have a negative impact. Both DOL and PBGC officials said there is no  uniform format or uniform identifier to the Schedule of Assets  Attachments; however, they acknowledged that attachments would be  more useful if they were submitted in a structured, data-searchable  format.", "However, 22 of 31 respondents  Respondents also identified additional plan investment information that  would be beneficial to add to the Form 5500. First, some respondents\u2014 mainly researchers and participant representatives\u2014indicated that a lack  of detailed plan asset information on Schedule I (Financial Information- Small Plan) creates a very or extremely significant challenge for their  work with the Form 5500. In addition, the Schedule H (Financial  Information) is required only with larger plans (plans with 100 or more  participants)\u2014which account for approximately 12.5 percent of all plans  that filed a form in 2011\u2014leaving the vast majority of plan filings without  this critical information. According to one respondent, without the  Schedule H, it is not possible to build a complete picture of a plan\u2019s  health. Schedule H and the accompanying attachments can help  determine if a plan provides a variety of investment options, can help  calculate the total cost of the plan for participants, and provide a more  complete understanding of plan investments. However, another  respondent cautioned against treating small employers like large  employers and burdening them with additional filing requirements to  satisfy researchers or commercial data mining firms. Second, although  the form requires plan sponsors to indicate if a plan includes an auto  enrollment feature through the plan characteristic codes, it does not  capture which default investment is used.respondents indicated that not knowing the default investment is a very or  extremely significant challenge, it was a top-rated suggested change, with  only one respondent citing it would have a negative impact.

One plan preparer said that  compiling and recording EINs and Plan Numbers (PN) for each entity  recorded on Schedule D can be difficult and time-consuming because  plan sponsors, trustees, or service providers do not always provide this  information. In addition, one researcher stated that plans often report the  wrong number for indirect investments, which hinders the ability to link the  indirect investment\u2019s filing with the plan\u2019s filing and prevents accurate  attribution of indirect investments. Thirteen of 31 respondents indicated  that providing a central repository of EINs and PNs would be a very  positive change. PBGC officials also acknowledged that inconsistent EINs  and PNs can hinder their ability to analyze records across years. While  IRS officials said they have a repository of EINs and assign EINs to filers,  they do not share the EINs with the other agencies or make this  information publicly available to filers. DOL has taken some steps to  improve the reliability of PNs, EINs, and names that filers reported. For  example, EFAST2 enables filers to identify previously used names and  EINs and form instructions state filers should use the same name and PN  as in previous years. In addition, DOL examines plans that stop filing  Form 5500s as part of its enforcement activities, and often finds that  plans have continued filing, but with inconsistent identification. According  to DOL, in an effort to improve filer consistency in entering key identifying  information, such as the EIN, PN and Plan Name, DOL\u2019s EFAST program  office is developing specifications for cross-year edit checks. These  checks aim to verify identifying information submitted on the Form 5500 in  order to notify the filer and government agencies of instances where  inconsistencies may exist. IRS works with filers to file amended returns to  update and correct EINs when they become aware of an issue, according  to IRS officials.", "Some respondents still find the timeliness of Form 5500 to be problematic  (see table 1).

The challenges identified by our broad-based panel,  while not generalizeable to the broader filing community, provide insight  into the difficulties that preparers, researchers, and participant advocates  still face with respect to reporting and analyzing critical information on  plan investments and fees. The challenges preparers expressed are  particularly troubling as DOL and IRS depend on this information to  conduct crucial compliance and enforcement activities.

Moreover, if enforcement agencies  are working from incomplete, inconsistent, and incomparable data to  understand, assess, and oversee plans, vital enforcement activities may  be at risk.

We  focused our review on our key objectives: disclosure requirements  regarding plan investments and service provider fees. This research  helped us develop key themes for our two-phase survey of non- government stakeholders. Additionally, we reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and agency documentation and guidance related to the  administration and maintenance of the Form 5500 series, including  proposed rules, documentation of current initiatives aimed towards Form  improvement, and the ERISA Filing Acceptance System (EFAST2)  vendor contract.", "To address the research questions in terms of recent changes to Form  5500\u2019s disclosure requirements and possible issues related to the form,  we conducted interviews with knowledgeable individuals and  organizations and reviewed relevant agency documents. Specifically, we  conducted interviews with relevant officials at DOL, IRS, and PBGC. We  also conducted interviews with non-government parties who interact with  the Form 5500 in different ways\u2014representatives of plan sponsors,  service providers, retirement consultants, attorneys, and researchers\u2014to  learn how they use the form and what recent challenges, if any, they have  encountered. In addition, we reviewed a nonrepresentative sample of 20  Form 5500 Annual Return/Report filings\u201410 defined contribution plan  filings and 10 defined benefit plan filings\u2014from the DOL\u2019s 2012 Freedom  of Information Act EFAST2 Form 5500 data set to find potential examples  of some of the challenges identified by non-government Form 5500  stakeholders. Specifically, we limited our universe of plan fillings based  on the following criteria:  filings with plan year ending in calendar year 2012,  filings for a defined benefit or defined contribution plan,  filings that included a Schedule C, H, and a Schedule of Assets  Attachments, and  filings that have a non-zero value in the \u201cOther\u201d plan asset category in  Schedule H.", "Based on these criteria, our universe included 4,782 defined contribution  plans and 1,361 defined benefit plans. Then, we randomly selected 10  records from defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans from the  universe for review. We chose to pull our sample from the Form 5500  dataset for the 2012 plan year because it was the most current and  accurate dataset available as of December 2013. To assess the reliability  of DOL\u2019s data, we conducted data reliability discussions with EBSA  officials to understand the limitations to the data and ensure we were  using the correct variables to develop our universe of plans to sample.  We found the dataset to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  study."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Two-phase Online Panel Survey", "paragraphs": ["To further address the first and second research questions, we gathered  the opinions of a non-representative sample of professionals outside  government who interact with the Form 5500 or rely on it in their work by  conducting a two-phase questionnaire survey of a panel of 43 non- government stakeholders. We identified initial candidates for this panel  from the following sources:", "Contacts developed from past reports related to employee benefit  plan investment and service provider fee information,", "Participants in our 2011 and 2012 Comptroller General\u2019s Retirement  Security Advisory Panel sessions,", "Form 5500 users identified by the DOL", "Large pension and investment plan administrators and plan", "Contacts obtained during interviews and research for our present  study.", "To ensure we had a range of views in our panel, we identified  stakeholders from several backgrounds: representatives of plan  sponsors, participants, and service providers; researchers and  academics; and other subject matter experts from relevant national  organizations. We contacted an initial list of 102 stakeholders to explain  our research, invite them to participate in our panel, and ask for the  names of other potential panelists who may have had expertise in this  area. This allowed us to both expand our initial list of potential panelists  and to validate the relevance of the potential panelists we had already  identified. To be eligible for the panel, we required stakeholders to have  at least 5 years of experience with Form 5500. We categorized eligible  panelists into one of three groups: representatives of participants,  representatives of plan sponsors and their service providers, and  researchers. Of the 102 stakeholders we contacted, 43 stakeholders were  eligible and agreed to participate in our two-phase panel survey. Panelists  had an average of 16 years experience with the Form 5500. In the first  phase, we asked this sample of panelists to identify challenges with the  Form 5500 plan investment and service provider fee data collection, and  to suggest changes that could improve the efficiency, clarity, and  usefulness of those data. We compiled their answers and aggregated  them into lists of distinct challenges and suggested changes. In the  second phase, we asked panelists to rate the importance and potential  impact of those challenges and suggested changes respectively. The  numbers of panelists surveyed and the sample outcomes of this non- probability sample over both phases are shown in table 4. Additional  details of the design and administration of the two phases are provided  below.", "In the first phase of the survey, which was conducted from May 28th to  July 9th, 2013, we asked panelists questions about their roles and  experiences related to Form 5500 and asked them to describe, in two  open-ended questions, any specific challenges that (1) plan investment  information, and (2) service provider and fee information collected on the  Form 5500 presented for their work. We then asked them, in two  corresponding open-ended questions, to suggest potential changes to  improve the form. The wording of the four key open-ended questions is  presented in table 5 below.", "Thirty-five of the 43 panelists completed the first phase of the survey, and  two of the original panelists had been determined ineligible during the  survey due to insufficient experience with the form, resulting in an 85  percent response rate. Panelists who did not complete the first phase  were dropped from the panel and did not participate in the second phase.", "We performed a content analysis on responses from the first phase to the  four open-ended questions to aggregate responses into lists of distinct  challenges and suggested changes. Two GAO analysts developed an  initial coding scheme and coded each of the participant\u2019s responses  together and, when necessary, the coding scheme was updated to reflect  participants\u2019 responses. We re-contacted respondents when a response  to be coded was unclear. Any disagreements in coding decisions were  discussed until consensus was reached. A third GAO analyst reviewed a  sample of the coded responses to check the validity of the coding  decisions. We used the lists of coded answers to each of the four survey  questions to develop closed-ended rating questions for the second phase  of the survey.", "In the second phase of the survey, which was conducted from October  23rd to December 11th, 2013, we asked each panelist to rate the  significance of the challenges and the impact of the suggested changes  the panel had collectively identified in the first phase. Specifically, in the  second phase panelists were asked whether each potential challenge  was \u201cNot at all,\u201d \u201cSlightly,\u201d Moderately,\u201d \u201cVery,\u201d or \u201cExtremely\u201d significant  or if they had \u201cNo basis to judge,\u201d and were asked whether each  suggested change would have \u201cVery negative,\u201d \u201cSomewhat negative,\u201d  \u201cNeutral,\u201d \u201cSomewhat positive,\u201d or \u201cVery positive\u201d impact or if they had  \u201cNo basis to judge.\u201d Usable responses were provided by 32 of the 35  participants in the second phase, resulting in an overall response rate of  78 percent across both phases. Because the surveys were not  administered to a probability sample of all Form 5500 stakeholders, the  results cannot be statistically generalized to all Form 5500 stakeholders;  the results describe only the experiences and opinions of the  stakeholders we included in our panel. Tabulations of the results of the  Phase 2 ratings and corresponding question wording are presented in  appendix II.", "We administered both phases of the survey over the Internet. For both  phases, we sent each stakeholder an email invitation to complete the  survey on a GAO web server using a unique username and password.  Because our sample of panelists constituted the entire, unique population  of stakeholders we had identified, the survey results are not subject to  sampling error. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce other errors. We took steps to minimize errors in  measurement, from nonresponse, and in data processing.", "To minimize the risk of measurement error, we designed draft  questionnaires for both phases in close collaboration with GAO survey  specialists. Two independent GAO staff members familiar with Form 5500  provided technical comments on the draft questionnaires. We pretested  the questionnaires in paper form with 5 individuals representing the range  of our stakeholders (representatives of plan sponsors and their service  providers, representatives of plan participants, and researchers). We  made revisions of the questionnaires based on these efforts before we  finalized the surveys. We applied eligibility criteria in the selection of our  panelists to ensure that they had sufficient qualifications for their role. We  performed quality checks on response data to identify and edit specific  response errors.", "To reduce the impact of nonresponse error, panelists received several  emails and phone calls encouraging them to complete the surveys. To  increase participation and the validity of answers, panelists were informed  that their personally-identifiable information would not be linked to their  responses during the survey nor in the final report. We examined the  distribution of those not responding across the three stakeholder  categories in the survey population, and determined that response rates  did not differ markedly across them. A second analyst checked the  accuracy of all computer analyses to minimize the likelihood of errors in  data processing.", "We conducted our work from November 2012 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
