According to EPA officials, WASA has thus far met the terms of a June 2004 consent order by enhancing its coordination with EPA and the D.C. Department of Health. For example, WASA developed a plan to improve its public education efforts and collaborated with the department to set priorities for replacing lead service lines. EPA expects the August 2004 addition of a corrosion inhibitor to eventually reduce lead in drinking water, though it may take more than one year for full improvements to be observed. Tap water test results reported in January 2005 show that D.C. drinking water still exceeds the standard for lead. WASA is identifying those customers most at risk from exposure to lead in drinking water and reducing their exposure. WASA is focusing on lead service lines as the primary source of lead in drinking water. It is updating its inventory of lead service lines, accelerating its rate of service line replacement, and providing priority replacement for customers most vulnerable to lead's health effects. However, questions remain about the success of the replacement program because, by law, WASA can only pay to replace the portion of the service line that it owns. Homeowners may pay to replace their portion of the service line, but few homeowners chose to do so in 2003 and 2004. Other water systems use innovative methods to educate their customers and to judge the effectiveness of their efforts. These practices include using a variety of media to inform the public, forming partnerships with government and nonprofit agencies, and targeting and adapting information to the audiences most susceptible to lead exposure through drinking water. Many of these practices go well beyond the requirements of the Lead and Copper Rule. In this connection, water industry representatives and others noted several shortcomings with the rule's public education provisions, including confusing language and the lack of a requirement to notify homeowners of the specific lead levels in their drinking water. Additionally, EPA has not evaluated water systems' public education efforts on lead in drinking water since the rule was established more than a decade ago. Much is known about the health effects of lead exposure, particularly its impact on brain development and functioning in young children. However, limited studies have been conducted on the health effects of exposure to low levels of lead in drinking water. EPA plans to prepare a health advisory document to help utilities explain the risks of lead exposure to the public, and a paper summarizing lead research conducted since the Lead and Copper Rule was published in 1991. However, the timetable for these projects is not clear, and it is also not clear how this work will fit into a broader research agenda, or if this effort needs to involve other key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2004, local media reported that the District of Columbia Water  and Sewer Authority (WASA) had found elevated lead levels in the drinking  water of more than 4,000 homes in the city\u2014the results of tests conducted  during the summer of 2003. The lack of timely disclosure of this problem  and the subsequent confused effort by government agencies to inform the  public on steps to protect itself resulted in numerous congressional  hearings and ongoing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) efforts to  review the adequacy of federal regulations on lead in drinking water. In  July 2004 testimony before your subcommittee, we made preliminary  observations on issues surrounding the elevated levels of lead found in  Washington, D.C.\u2019s drinking water and highlighted areas for further  examination. This letter discusses our findings and recommendations from  that further review.", "Although rarely the sole cause of lead poisoning, lead in drinking water can  significantly increase a person\u2019s total lead exposure. EPA estimates that  drinking water is the source of up to 20 percent of Americans\u2019 lead  exposure, and recent research suggests that drinking water may provide as  much as 60 percent of total lead exposure for infants who drink baby  formula and concentrated juices that are mixed with water. Adults exposed  to high levels of lead could develop kidney problems or high blood  pressure. Developing fetuses, infants, and young children are more  vulnerable to lead from all sources, including drinking water. Their  exposure to lead may harm their physical or mental development.", "Lead is unusual among drinking water contaminants because it generally  does not come from source water supplies like rivers and lakes. Rather,  lead enters drinking water primarily from the corrosion of materials  containing lead in the water distribution system and in household  plumbing. These materials include lead service lines that connect a house  to the water main, lead-based solder used in a house to join copper pipe,  and brass plumbing fixtures such as faucets. The 1986 Amendments to the  Safe Drinking Water Act limited the amount of lead used in solder, faucets,  pipes, and other plumbing components. However, older leaded  components are still present in many homes, and many new components  still contain some lead.", "The Safe Drinking Water Act is the key federal law protecting public water  supplies from harmful contaminants. Its 1991 Lead and Copper Rule  requires water systems to protect consumers against exposure to elevated  levels of lead in drinking water by chemically treating water to reduce its  corrosiveness and by collecting water samples from consumer taps and  testing them for evidence of lead corrosion. Because lead contamination  generally occurs after water leaves the treatment plant, the Lead and  Copper Rule requires testing for lead at consumer taps. Large water  systems, like WASA\u2019s, generally must take 100 samples in a 6-month period.  EPA considers lead to be over the \u201caction level\u201d when lead levels are higher  than 15 parts per billion in over 10 percent of tap water samples taken. If a  water system exceeds the action level, it must notify and educate the public  about ways to reduce exposure. If lead levels exceed the action level after  treatment to minimize water\u2019s corrosiveness, the water system must  annually replace 7 percent of the lead service lines that it owns.", "Implementation and enforcement of the Lead and Copper Rule in the  District of Columbia is complicated because of the number and nature of  the entities involved. The Washington Aqueduct, owned and operated by  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, treats the water (including controlling  for corrosion). WASA purchases water from the Washington Aqueduct and  delivers it to District residents, and is responsible for monitoring tap water  samples for lead. EPA Region III in Philadelphia has oversight and  enforcement authority for the District\u2019s public water systems.", "You asked us to determine (1) what the key government entities that  implement the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s regulations for lead in the District  of Columbia are doing to increase their level of coordination and reduce  lead levels, (2) to what extent WASA and other agencies are determining  which adult and child populations in the District of Columbia are at  greatest risk of exposure to elevated lead levels in drinking water and how  the agencies are reducing the public\u2019s lead exposure, (3) how other  drinking water systems that exceeded EPA\u2019s action level for lead conducted  public notification and education, and (4) the state of research on lead  exposure and how this information could help inform other drinking water  utilities of potential problems in their systems.", "To answer the first two questions, we interviewed officials responsible for  the delivery and regulation of drinking water in the District of Columbia,  including WASA, EPA, the Washington Aqueduct, and officials from  community advocacy groups. We also reviewed key documents, such as the  consent orders between WASA and EPA and testimony by the involved  entities. Additionally, we spoke to officials with the D.C. Department of  Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and  reviewed a March 2004 CDC study on lead exposure from drinking water in  the District of Columbia. To answer the third question, we interviewed  officials responsible for the delivery and regulation of drinking water in  several cities around the country, reviewed documents these officials  produced, and observed aspects of their public education programs. We  also spoke with EPA, water industry groups, and public advocacy groups  and reviewed reports these entities produced.

Except for Wyoming  and the District of Columbia, all states and territories have received  primacy. For contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public  water systems and that the EPA Administrator determines may have an  adverse impact on health, the act requires EPA to set a nonenforceable  maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) at which no known or  anticipated adverse health effects occur and that allows an adequate  margin of safety. Once the MCLG is established, EPA may set an  enforceable standard for water as it leaves the treatment plant, the  maximum contaminant level (MCL). The MCL generally must be set as  close to the MCLG as is feasible using the best technology or other means  available, taking costs into consideration. Alternatively, EPA can establish a  treatment technique, which requires a treatment procedure or level of  technological performance to reduce the level of the contaminant.", "The fact that lead contamination occurs after water leaves the treatment  facility has complicated efforts to regulate lead in the same way as most  other drinking water contaminants. In 1975, EPA established an interim  MCL for lead of 50 parts per billion (ppb), but did not require sampling of  tap water to show compliance with the standard. Rather, the standard had  to be met at the water system before the water was distributed. The 1986  amendments to the act directed EPA to issue a new lead regulation, and in  1991, EPA adopted the Lead and Copper Rule.", "Instead of an MCL, the rule established an \u201caction level\u201d of 15 ppb for lead  in drinking water. To reduce the amount of lead entering the water as it  flows through distribution lines and home plumbing to customers\u2019 taps, the  rule required that water systems, if needed, treat the water to limit its  corrosiveness. Under the rule, the action level is exceeded if lead levels are  higher than 15 ppb in over 10 percent of tap water samples. Large systems,  including WASA\u2019s, generally must take at least 100 tap water samples in a 6- month monitoring period, though reduced monitoring schedules are also  allowed for some systems. If a water system exceeds the action level, it has  60 days to deliver a public education program that meets EPA  requirements, including a notice in customers\u2019 water bills; delivery of  public service announcements to television and radio stations; and the  distribution of information to locations likely to serve populations  vulnerable to lead exposure, including hospitals, clinics, and local welfare  agencies. In addition, if lead levels exceed the action level after treatment  to minimize water\u2019s corrosiveness, the water system must annually replace  7 percent of the lead service lines under its ownership and offer to replace  the private portion of the lead service line (at the owner\u2019s expense) until  the tap water 90th percentile lead levels drop below the action level for two  consecutive six month monitoring periods.", "Drinking water is provided to District of Columbia residents under a unique  organizational structure:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 Washington Aqueduct draws water  from the Potomac River that it filters and chemically treats to meet EPA  specifications.

Three examples follow:  MWRA provides training workshops on drinking water issues, including  lead in drinking water, for local health officials. These officials can then  educate the public about drinking water issues when they arise.", "MWRA also sends the local health department the same drinking water  data that it sends to the state drinking water regulator, so local health  officials are well informed.", "The Portland Water Bureau participates in an integrated program to  educate the public and reduce exposure to all sources of lead, including  drinking water. The water bureau\u2019s partners in this program include the  Multnomah County Health Department, the State Lead Poisoning  Prevention Program, the Portland Bureau of Housing and Community  Development, and community nonprofit agencies.", "The Lead and Copper Rule requires water systems that exceed the action  level to provide written education materials to facilities and organizations  that serve high-risk segments of the population, including people more  susceptible to the adverse effects of lead and people at greater risk of  exposure to lead in drinking water. Some water systems have gone beyond  this basic requirement to better reach high-risk populations. For example,  in January 2004, the Portland Water Bureau sent a targeted mailing of  approximately 2,600 postcards to the homes of an age most likely to  contain lead solder that it identified as having a child 6 years old or  younger. These postcards encouraged residents to get their water tested for  lead, learn about childhood blood lead screening, and reduce lead hazards  in their homes. Water bureau officials said that they obtained the  information needed to target the mailing from a commercial marketing  company and that the information was inexpensive and easy to obtain. The  rule specifies that educational materials be delivered to Women, Infants,  and Children (WIC) and Head Start programs, where available. Both  Portland and MWRA have cultivated relationships with these programs.  MWRA worked with local WIC officials to add information about lead in  drinking water to WIC\u2019s postpartum program for new mothers, and to  prepare an easy-to-understand brochure explaining how to avoid exposure  to lead in drinking water. Portland funded efforts with Head Start to  provide free blood lead testing and to present puppet shows teaching  children how to avoid lead hazards. Table 3 shows how the Portland Water  Bureau targets its lead education program to community groups.", "Some other water systems measure the impact of their public education  programs. MWRA has conducted focus groups to judge the effectiveness of  its public education program, and routinely refines the information  presented about lead in drinking water. The Portland Water Bureau tracks  calls received by its lead information hotline and surveys callers to  determine their satisfaction with the program and the extent to which it  changed their behavior. An official from St. Paul (Minnesota) Regional  Water Services told us that the utility surveys its customers about water  quality issues. During the time the utility was conducting public education  about lead in drinking water, it surveyed customers each year to ask if  customers believed they were receiving enough information about the  quality of their water."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lead and Copper Rule Public Education Requirements Have Several Shortcomings", "paragraphs": ["Responding to concerns about the Lead and Copper Rule\u2019s public  education requirements, EPA conducted a workshop in September 2004 at  which representatives from the water industry and community groups  discussed their views of the rule\u2019s requirements. Representatives from the  water industry also told us they went beyond the rule\u2019s requirements to  ensure the success of their public education programs. At the EPA  workshop and in interviews, water industry officials, experts, and  community groups identified the following problems:  The public cannot easily understand the required public education  language. Representatives of several water utilities told us the required  language was too long and the reading level too advanced for many  customers to understand. One expert estimated that understanding the  EPA language required at least an 11th grade reading level, while  approximately half the adult population of the United States reads at an  8th grade level or lower. Water industry officials suggested customizing  education materials about lead in drinking water for those who have  limited reading ability.", "The rule does not require utilities to send results to homeowners  whose water is sampled for lead compliance. EPA officials told us that  many water systems do provide this information to customers, but in the  past, WASA did not provide this information in a timely fashion. The  consent order requires WASA to provide lead results to homeowners  within 3 days of receiving the results from the laboratory, and  encourages WASA to provide this data within 30 days of collecting the  sample.", "Public notification under the rule is less timely than that required for  other violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The rule requires a  water system to notify the public within 60 days if it exceeds the action  level for lead. Other violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act with the  potential to cause serious adverse effects on human health require  public notification within 30 days, including violations of MCLs and  treatment techniques.", "EPA has not evaluated the effectiveness of the public education  requirements of the rule since it was implemented in 1991. Water  industry officials at the EPA workshop suggested several methods to  evaluate the effectiveness of public outreach, including surveying the  public to determine its knowledge of lead in drinking water issues and  comparing the level of knowledge in areas where public education has  and has not been conducted. These officials also suggested that EPA  identify public education activities conducted by utilities around the  country that are following EPA guidelines and doing additional  voluntary education work to identify good practices.", "In response to elevated lead levels in the District of Columbia, EPA is  conducting a national review of compliance and implementation of the  Lead and Copper Rule, including its public education requirements.  Additionally, EPA conducted the public education expert workshop to gain  information to use in its deliberations about changing the Lead and Copper  Rule and possibly its accompanying guidance documents and training.

While many  body systems can be severely affected by high chronic and acute lead  exposures, lead is dangerous in large part because moderate to low chronic  exposure can result in adverse health effects. The threshold for harmful  effects of lead remains unknown. Over the years, as new data has become  available, CDC has revised its recommendations on the threshold of blood  lead levels that should raise concern and trigger interventions. In 1975,  CDC\u2019s blood lead level threshold of concern stood at 30 micrograms per  deciliter. In 1991, CDC lowered the blood lead level of concern to 10  micrograms per deciliter. Research conducted since 1991 provides  evidence of adverse effects at even lower levels\u2014at less than 10  micrograms per deciliter among children younger than 6.", "Because of their behavior and physiology, children are more sensitive than  adults to exposure to lead in a given environment. For example, children  generally come into more contact with lead because they spend more time  on the ground, where there may be lead-contaminated soil or dust.  Mouthing and hand-to-mouth behaviors also increase the likelihood that  children may ingest soil or dust. Physiologically, children take in more food  and water per pound of body weight, and their absorption of lead is  estimated to be 5 to 10 times greater than adults. Finally, children are more  sensitive than adults to elevated blood lead levels because organ systems,  including their brain and nervous system, are still developing. This ongoing  development increases the risk of lead\u2019s entry into the brain and nervous  system, and can result in prolonged or permanent neurobehavioral  disorders.", "In contrast, most adult exposures to lead are occupational and occur in  lead-related industries, such as lead smelting, refining, and manufacturing.  Adults exposed to lead can develop high blood pressure, anemia, and  kidney damage. Lead poses a substantial threat to pregnant women and  their developing fetuses because blood lead readily crosses the placenta.  Pregnant women with elevated blood lead levels may have an increased  chance of miscarriage, premature birth, and newborns with low birth  weight or neurologic problems.", "CDC tracks children\u2019s blood lead levels in the United States through the  National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and state and local  surveillance data. The surveys between 1976 and 1980 found evidence of  an estimated 88 percent prevalence of lead levels greater than or equal to  10 micrograms per deciliter in children aged 1 to 5 compared with an  estimated prevalence of 2.2 percent in 1999 to 2000. Health experts  generally attribute this decline to the elimination of leaded gasoline and  lead solder from canned foods, and a ban on leaded paint used in housing  and other consumer products. Data provided by the District of Columbia to  CDC for 2001 show that, of an estimated 39,356 children younger than 6,  16,036 were tested for lead. Of those, 437, or 2.73 percent, had blood lead  levels greater than or equal to 10 micrograms per deciliter.", "More recently, in response to the discovery of high lead levels in drinking  water in the District of Columbia, CDC and the D.C. Department of Health  studied blood lead levels of residents most at risk for lead exposure. This  study was designed to determine the extent to which lead in drinking water  was contributing to blood lead levels of District residents. One portion of  the study focused on residents of homes with known lead levels in drinking  water greater than 300 ppb, much greater than the EPA action level of 15  ppb. Health officials attempted to contact nearly all residents of homes  with lead concentrations at this level, and collected blood samples for lead  analysis from residents who agreed to the procedure. Of the 201 residents  tested, all were found to have blood lead levels less than CDC\u2019s levels of  concern for adults or children, as appropriate.", "Another portion of this study examined blood lead data collected by the  District of Columbia Department of Health\u2019s blood lead surveillance  system. Results of blood lead tests conducted from January 1998 through  December 2003 were compared for a nonprobability sample of homes with  known lead service lines and homes with nonlead service lines. During  2000 through 2003, the period when lead levels in drinking water increased,  the number of people with blood lead levels greater than 5 micrograms per  deciliter decreased for the sample without lead service lines but did not  decrease in a statistically significant way for the sample with lead service  lines. In the District of Columbia, blood lead levels are generally greater in  homes with lead service lines.

However, the most relevant studies on the isolated health effects  of lead in drinking water date back nearly 20 years\u2014including the Glasgow  Duplicate Diet Study on lead levels in children, upon which the Lead and  Copper Rule is partially based.", "While lead in drinking water is rarely thought to be the sole cause of lead  poisoning, it can significantly increase a person\u2019s total lead exposure\u2014 particularly for infants who drink baby formula or concentrated juices that  are mixed with water from homes with lead service lines or plumbing  systems. For children with high levels of lead exposure from paint, soil, and  dust, drinking water is thought to contribute a much lower proportion of  total exposure. For residents of dwellings with lead solder or lead service  lines, however, drinking water could be the primary source of exposure. As  exposure declines from sources of lead other than drinking water, such as  gasoline and soldered food cans, drinking water will account for a larger  proportion of total intake. Thus, according to EPA\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule,  the total drinking water contribution to overall lead levels may range from  as little as 5 percent to more than 50 percent of a child\u2019s total lead  exposure.", "According to recent medical literature and the public health experts we  contacted, the key uncertainties about the effects of lead in drinking water  requiring clarification include the incremental effects of lead-contaminated  drinking water on people whose blood lead levels are already elevated from  other sources of lead contamination and the potential health effects of  exposure to low levels of lead."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Is Beginning to Address Certain Information Gaps in the Health Risks of Lead in Drinking Water", "paragraphs": ["EPA has acknowledged the need to improve health risk information  available to drinking water systems and local governments about lead in  drinking water.

EPA health advisories are written documents that provide information on  the health effects, analytical methodology, and treatment technology that  would be useful in dealing with the contamination of drinking water and  have been issued for many other water contaminants, such as  cryptosporidium (a water-borne microbe). The advisories serve as informal  technical guidance to assist federal, state, and local officials responsible for  protecting public health when contamination occurs. For example, a  cryptosporidium health advisory was prompted, in part, by an outbreak of  the microbe in 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where an estimated 400,000  people became ill.", "Office of Water officials note that the agency currently does not have a  health advisory for lead and believe the problems local District agencies  had in communicating the health risks of lead in drinking water highlight  the need for one. Office of Water officials also noted a health advisory  document for lead would be useful for other water systems and state and  local officials in communicating risk if they identify problems with lead  during monitoring under the Lead and Copper Rule. In 1985, EPA drafted a  health advisory for lead, but never issued it to the public. At present, EPA\u2019s  Office of Water has drafted a plan to prepare a lead health advisory and  have it reviewed by experts within EPA and by external peer reviewers.  However the anticipated completion date for the advisory has not been  determined.", "To ensure that the health advisory for lead is up-to-date, the Office of Water  also plans to produce a \u201cwhite paper\u201d that documents how research data  were used in setting the action level for lead and updates that assessment  using new data on lead exposure and uptake in the body. Officials in these  offices told us that the white paper should provide sufficient information to  allow health risk at the action level to be discussed in the lead health  advisory. They told us that data used to develop the 15 ppb action level in  the 1991 rule were based on a small group of studies published before 1989  and on early models of the agency\u2019s Integrated Exposure Uptake Biokinetic  Model for Lead (IEUBK), which predicts blood lead concentrations for  children exposed to different types of lead sources. The Office of Research  and Development is currently developing an \u201call ages lead model\u201d that  supplements the IEUBK model, and should allow for new predictions of  fetal blood lead levels derived from maternal exposure levels. According to  EPA, the agency plans to have the model peer reviewed first and any issues  from the peer review addressed before the model is used in regulatory  decision making. These predictions may be incorporated into the white  paper being prepared by the Office of Water. However, a timetable for  completing the updated model and the white paper has not been  determined.
