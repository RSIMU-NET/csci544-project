Since then, the judiciary has made the changes we  recommended. With regard to courtroom sharing that could help reduce  costs, we found that the judiciary did not collect sufficient data to  determine how much sharing could occur.

By 2002, the  estimated backlog of repairs had reached $5.7 billion, and consequences  included poor health and safety conditions, higher operating costs,  restricted capacity for modern information technology, and continued  structural deterioration. GSA charges agencies rent for the space they  occupy, and the receipts from the rent are deposited in FBF and are then  available for the purposes of the fund.

The judiciary has requested the  exemption, equal to about half of its annual rent payment, because of  budget problems that it believes its growing rent payments have caused.

In 1993, the judiciary identified 160 court  facilities that required either the construction of a new building or a major  annex to an existing building. From fiscal year 1993 through fiscal year  2005, Congress appropriated approximately $4.5 billion for 78 courthouse  construction projects. Since fiscal year 1996, the judiciary has used a 5\u00ad year plan to prioritize new courthouse construction projects, taking into  account a court\u2019s need for space, security concerns, growth in judicial  appointments, and any existing operational inefficiencies. The judiciary\u2019s  most recent 5-year plan (covering fiscal years 2005 through 2009) identifies  57 needed projects that are expected to cost $3.8 billion. GSA and the  judiciary are responsible for managing the multibillion-dollar federal  courthouse construction program, which is designed to address the  judiciary\u2019s long-term facility needs. The Administrative Office of the  United States Courts (AOUSC), the judiciary\u2019s administrative agency,  works with the nation\u2019s 94 judicial districts to identify and prioritize needs  for new and expanded courthouses. The U.S. Courts Design Guide  (Design Guide) specifies the judiciary\u2019s criteria for designing new court  facilities and sets the space and design standards that GSA uses for  courthouse construction. First published in 1991, the Design Guide has  been revised several times to address budgetary considerations,  technological advancements, and other issues, and the guide is currently  undergoing another revision.", "GSA provides a range of real property services including maintenance,  repairs, alterations, and leasing to numerous federal agencies and the  federal judiciary. The Public Buildings Amendments of 1972 made several  important revisions to the Federal Property and Administrative Services  Act. First, the 1972 law created a new revolving fund, later named FBF.  Next, it required agencies that occupy GSA-controlled buildings to pay  rent to GSA, which is to be deposited in the revolving fund to be used for  GSA real property services. GSA charges rent based on appraisals for  facilities it owns and the actual lease amount for facilities it leases on the  tenants\u2019 behalf. The legislation also authorized any executive agency other  than GSA that provides space and services to charge for the space and  services. The rent requirement is intended to reduce costs and encourage  more efficient space utilization by making agencies accountable for the  space they use. GSA proposes spending from FBF for courthouses as part  of the President\u2019s annual budget request to Congress.", "GSA has been using the judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan for new courthouse projects  since fiscal year 1996 to develop requests for both new courthouses and  expanded court facilities. GSA also prepares feasibility studies to assess  various courthouse construction alternatives and serves as the central  point of contact with the judiciary and other stakeholders throughout the  construction process. For courthouses that are to be selected for  construction, GSA prepares detailed project descriptions called  prospectuses that include the justification, location, size, and estimated  cost of the new or annexed facility. GSA typically submits two  prospectuses to Congress. The first prospectus generally requests  authorization and funding to purchase the site and design the building, and  the second prospectus generally requests authorization and funding for  construction, as well as any additional funding needed for site and design  work. Once Congress authorizes and appropriates funds for a project, GSA  refines the project budget and selects private-sector firms for the design  and construction work. Figure 1 illustrates the process for planning,  approving, and constructing a courthouse project.", "Courthouse projects continue to be costly, and increasing rents and  budgetary constraints have given the judiciary further incentive to control  its costs. The judiciary pays rent to GSA for the use of the courthouses,  which GSA owns, and the proportion of the judiciary\u2019s budget that goes to  rent has increased as the judiciary\u2019s space requirements have grown.  According to the judiciary, rent currently accounts for just over 20 percent  of its operating budget and is expected to increase to over 25 percent of its  operating budget in fiscal year 2009, when the rental costs of new court  buildings are included. Additionally, in fiscal year 2004, the judiciary faced  a budgetary shortfall and, according to the judiciary, reduced its staff by 6  percent.", "In September 2004, the judiciary announced a 2-year moratorium on new  courthouse construction projects as part of an effort to address its  increasing operating costs and budgetary constraints. During this  moratorium, AOUSC officials said that they plan to reevaluate the  courthouse construction program, including reassessing the size and  scope of projects in the current 5-year plan, reviewing the Design Guide\u2019s  standards, and reviewing the criteria and methodology used to prioritize  projects. Judiciary officials also said that they plan to reevaluate their  space standards in light of technological advancements and opportunities  to share space and administrative services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Courthouse Construction Work Has Focused on Costs, Planning, and Courtroom Sharing", "paragraphs": ["Our work in the 1990s showed that decision makers within GSA and the  judiciary had wide latitude in making choices that significantly affected  costs.

We also found that the judiciary did not  compile data that would allow it to determine how many and what types of  courtrooms it needs. The judiciary concluded that additional data and  analysis were not necessary."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Courthouse Construction Costs", "paragraphs": ["In 1995, we testified that a primary reason for differences in the  construction costs of courthouses was that GSA and the judiciary had  wide latitude in making choices about the location, design, construction,  and finishes of courthouse projects. These choices were made under  circumstances in which budgets or designs were often committed to  before requirements were established. In addition, design guidance was  flexible, and systematic oversight was limited. As a result, some  courthouses had more expensive features than others. While recognizing  that some flexibility was needed and that some costly features may be  justifiable, we found that the flexibility in the process should have been  better managed. We recommended that GSA and AOUSC clearly define the scope of construction projects and refine construction  cost estimates before requesting project approval and final funding levels; establish and implement a systematic and ongoing project oversight and  evaluation process to compare courthouse projects, identify opportunities  for reducing costs, and apply lessons learned to future projects; and establish a mechanism to monitor and assess the use of flexibility within  design guidance to better balance choices made about courthouse design,  features, and finishes.", "GSA and the judiciary said that since 1996, they have also taken several  actions to improve the courthouse construction program, including  developing priority lists of locations needing additional space (the 5-year  plan), revising the Design Guide, and placing greater emphasis on cost  consciousness in its courthouse construction guidance for GSA.", "In a 2004 congressional briefing, we reported that GSA had attributed  some cost growth in courthouse construction projects to a number of  factors, including changes in the scope of the projects. In Buffalo, New  York, for example, GSA had to change the scope of the courthouse project  and acquire an entirely new site in order to achieve the necessary security\u00ad based setbacks from the street. The judiciary said that funding delays have  slowed the progress of the program by creating a backlog of projects, and  increased costs by 3 to 4 percent per year because of inflation. The  judiciary also indicated that limiting the size of courthouses to stay within  budget has resulted in space shortages sooner than expected at some  courthouses. In a 2004 report related specifically to a new federal  courthouse proposed for Los Angeles, we found that the government will  likely incur additional construction and operational costs beyond the $400  million estimated as needed for the new courthouse. Some of these  additional costs are attributable to operational inefficiencies. Specifically,  the court is split between a new building and an existing courthouse in Los  Angeles, both of which will, according to the judiciary, require additional  courtrooms to meet the district court\u2019s projected space requirements in  2031."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judiciary Long- and Short- Term Space Planning", "paragraphs": ["In 1993, we reviewed the long-term planning process used by the judiciary  to estimate its space requirements. We found that AOUSC\u2019s process for  projecting long-term space requirements did not produce results that were  sufficiently reliable to form the basis for congressional authorization and  funding approval of new construction and renovation projects for court  space. Specifically, three key problems impaired the accuracy and  reliability of the judiciary\u2019s projections. First, AOUSC did not treat all  districts consistently. For example, the procedure used to convert  caseload estimates to staffing requirements did not reflect differences  among districts that affect space requirements. Second, according to  AOUSC\u2019s assumptions about the relationship between caseloads and staff  needs, many district baseline estimates did not reflect the districts\u2019 current  space requirements. For example, when a district occupied more space  than the caseload warranted, future estimates of needs were overstated.  Third, AOUSC\u2019s process did not provide reliable estimates of future space  requirements because the methodology used to project caseloads did not  use standard acceptable statistical methods.", "We recommended that AOUSC revise the long-term planning process to  increase consistency across regions, establish accurate caseload baselines  for each district, and increase the reliability of the projected caseloads by  applying an accepted statistical methodology and reducing subjectivity in  the process. In May 1994, we testified that the judiciary had implemented  some of these recommendations. For example, on the basis of our  recommendation, whenever a decision was made to proceed on a  particular building project, AOUSC provided GSA with detailed 10-year  space requirements for prospectus development and an overall summary  of its projected 30-year space requirements for purposes of site planning.  In 2001, we reported that since 1994, AOUSC had continued its efforts to  improve its long-term planning process in implementing our previous  recommendations. Specifically, the judiciary began (1) using an  automated computer program that applied Design Guide standards to  estimate space requirements, (2) employing a standard statistical  forecasting technique to improve caseload projections, and (3) providing  GSA with data on its 10-year projected space requirements to support the  judiciary\u2019s request for congressional approval of funds to build new  facilities.", "In 1996 we reported that the judiciary had developed a methodology for  assessing project urgency and a short-term (5-year) construction plan to  communicate its urgent courthouse construction needs. Our analysis  suggested that its 5-year plan did not reflect all of the judiciary\u2019s most  urgent construction needs.  We found that the judiciary, in preparing the 5\u00ad year plan, developed urgency scores for 45 projects, but did not develop  urgency scores for other locations that, according to AOUSC, also needed  new courthouses. Our analysis of available data on conditions at the 80  other locations showed that 30 of them likely would have had an urgency  score higher than some projects in the plan. We recommended that the  Director of AOUSC work with the Judicial Conference Committee on  Security, Space, and Facilities to make improvements to the 5-year plan,  including fully disclosing the relative urgency of all competing projects  and articulating the rationale or justification for project priorities,  including information on the conditions that are driving urgency\u2014such as  specific security concerns or operational inefficiencies. In commenting on  the report, AOUSC generally agreed with our recommendations and  indicated that many of the improvements we recommended were already  under consideration.

We concluded that the judiciary did not have  sufficient data to support its practice of providing a trial courtroom for  every district judge. We recommended that the judiciary establish criteria for determining effective courtroom utilization and a  mechanism for collecting and analyzing data at a representative number of  locations so that trends can be identified over time and better insights  obtained on court activity and courtroom usage; design and implement a methodology for capturing and analyzing data on  usage, courtroom scheduling, and other factors that may substantially  affect the relationship between the availability of courtrooms and judges\u2019  ability to effectively administer justice; use the data and criteria to explore whether the one-judge, one-courtroom  practice is needed to promote efficient courtroom management or  whether other courtroom assignment alternatives exist; and establish an action plan with time frames for implementing and overseeing  these efforts.", "In 1999, AOUSC contracted for a study of the judiciary\u2019s facilities program  to address, among other things, the courtroom-sharing issue and identify  ways to improve its space and facility efforts. As part of this study, the  contractor analyzed how courtrooms are used, assigned, and shared by  judges. We reviewed the courtroom use and sharing portion of this study  and concluded, along with others, that the study was not sufficient to  resolve the courtroom sharing issue. We recommended that the Director,  AOUSC, in conjunction with the Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee on  Court Administration and Case Management and Committee on Security  and Facilities, design and implement cost-effective research more in line  with the recommendations in our 1997 report. We also recommended that  AOUSC establish an advisory group made up of interested stakeholders  and experts to assist in identifying study objectives, potential  methodologies, and reasonable approaches for doing this work. In  responding to the report, AOUSC disagreed with our recommendations  because it believed the contractor study was sufficient and additional  statistical studies would not be productive.", "In a 2002 report, we found that the judiciary\u2019s policies recognized that  senior district judges with reduced caseloads were the most likely  candidates to share courtrooms and some active and senior judges were  sharing courtrooms in some locations primarily when there were not  enough courtrooms for all judges to have their own courtroom. However,  because of the judiciary\u2019s belief in the strong relationship between  ensured courtroom availability and the administration of justice and the  wide discretion given to circuits and districts in determining how and  when courtroom sharing may be implemented, we concluded that there  would not be a significant amount of courtroom sharing in the foreseeable  future, even among senior judges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues Related to FBF", "paragraphs": ["We have reported over the years that GSA has struggled to address its  repair and alteration needs identified in its inventory of owned buildings.

We found that FBF\u2019s inability to generate  sufficient revenue during that time was compounded by restrictions  imposed on the amount of rent GSA could charge federal agencies.  Congress and OMB had instituted across-the-board rent restrictions that  reduced FBF by billions of dollars over several years, and later continued  to restrict what GSA could charge some agencies, such as the Departments  of Agriculture and Transportation. Because these rent restrictions were a  principal reason why FBF has accumulated insufficient money for capital  investment, we recommended that Congress remove all rent restrictions  and not mandate any further restrictions.", "According to GSA, most of the restrictions initiated by Congress and OMB  have been lifted.
