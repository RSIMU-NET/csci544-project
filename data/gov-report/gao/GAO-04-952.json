State and USAID attributed this practice to a lack of full simultaneous funding for construction at nine locations through fiscal year 2004. Concurrent construction of USAID annexes could help decrease overall costs to the government and help achieve security goals. Concurrent construction would eliminate the second expensive mobilization of contractor staff and equipment and added supervision, security, and procurement support expenses that result from nonconcurrent construction. State has estimated that if nine future USAID annexes scheduled for nonconcurrent construction are built concurrently, it could save taxpayers $35 million. Extrapolating from data provided by State, GAO estimated a total cost savings of around $68 million to $78 million if all 18 future USAID projects are built concurrently. GAO also found that designing additional space for USAID within the main office building, or chancery, may cost less than erecting a separate annex, depending on a number of factors, including the size and configuration of the planned buildings. In addition to cost considerations, concurrent construction could help State and USAID comply with the colocation requirement and decrease the security risks associated with staff remaining outside of the embassy compound. For example, USAID staff who remain in a temporary USAID facility after other U.S. government personnel move into a new embassy compound may be more vulnerable to terrorist attack because the temporary facility does not meet security standards for new buildings and may be perceived to be a \"softer\" target relative to the new, more secure embassy compound. State's current plans call for continued nonconcurrent construction through fiscal year 2009. State acknowledged that there are substantial advantages to concurrent construction and has indicated that it may revise its building schedule to allow for more concurrent construction if a new cost-sharing proposal to fund new embassies by allocating construction costs among all agencies having an overseas presence is implemented in fiscal year 2005. However, even if cost sharing is not implemented, there are still opportunities for building some USAID facilities concurrently with the overall construction of the embassy compound if State, with congressional consent, revised its plan and rescheduled some projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, the State  Department embarked on a multibillion-dollar, multiyear program to build  new, secure facilities on compounds at posts around the world.

Funding from fiscal year  1999 to 2004 totaled about $3.4 billion. In addition, Congress passed the  Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999. The act  established a number of security requirements for diplomatic facilities  overseas, one of which was that all U.S. government personnel (except  those under the command of an area military commander) at any new U.S.  diplomatic facility abroad must be located at the same site. State identified  facilities at about 185 posts that would need to be replaced to meet the  security standards.", "To help manage this large-scale construction program, OBO developed the  Long-Range Overseas Buildings Plan, first published in July 2001 and  recently updated in March 2004. The plan is updated annually, adding new  projects as scheduled projects\u2019 construction contracts are awarded. The  plan prioritizes posts based on security and operational considerations,  including input from State\u2019s regional bureaus and the Bureau of Diplomatic  Security. The most recent version of the plan prioritizes 77 proposed  security capital and regular capital projects from fiscal years 2004 through  2009, including 18 separate USAID annex buildings.", "Until the late 1990s, the majority of USAID missions were not colocated  with embassies but existed in separate commercial or freestanding  buildings.

In its fiscal year 2001 report on Commerce, Justice, and State  funding, the House Committee on Appropriations wrote that it did not  approve the use of the funds for the USAID annexes because  appropriations requirements of USAID fall under the jurisdiction of the  Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs  Subcommittee. In an effort to overcome funding problems, USAID  requested that the Foreign Operations subcommittee fund a new account  for fiscal year 2003, the Capital Investment Fund, to fund information  technology enhancements and construction of colocated USAID facilities.  Although the fund has been established, USAID has not obtained full  funding to construct all of its buildings. In its report on the fiscal year 2003  Foreign Operations appropriation, the House Committee on  Appropriations noted that buildings and space for all other government  agencies overseas were appropriated through State\u2019s account for overseas  construction, and stated that therefore the committee had not funded all  requests for USAID buildings on new embassy compounds.

So far, OBO has completed the annex  for USAID only at the compound in Dar es Salaam. Initially, OBO awarded a  construction contract that did not include the USAID annex, but USAID  received $15 million in additional operating expense funds through the  regular appropriation process to pay for new construction. In addition, $2.5  million from program funds were used with $25 million obtained from the  Security Supplemental Account for security upgrades. The funding became  available in time for OBO to modify the original construction contract and  complete the USAID annex at the same time as the rest of the compound.", "For Nairobi, OBO awarded a construction contract for a new embassy  compound in September 1999 that did not include the USAID facility  because there were no funds for this USAID annex. Subsequently, OBO and  the contractor negotiated to include the USAID annex as a modification to  the original contract, but sufficient funding did not become available in  time. Construction of the chancery building was completed in 2003. USAID  received funding for its annex in fiscal year 2003; construction began in  June 2004 and is scheduled to end in June 2006, 3 years after the compound  was completed and became operational (see fig. 1). In the meantime,  USAID is leasing space at a cost of about $300,000 per year on the campus  of a nongovernmental research facility.", "A construction contract for the new embassy compound in Kampala was  awarded in 1999 and construction was completed in fiscal year 2002, but  USAID did not receive funding for its annex until fiscal year 2004. OBO  expects to award a construction contract for the USAID annex sometime in  2004, according to an OBO official. USAID plans to remain in its interim  location outside the new compound\u2014an office converted from a residence  in Kampala and leased for $144,000 per year\u2014until its new facility is built  in about 2006.", "In addition, contracts have been awarded or construction is under way on  the following seven compounds that do not include a separate building for  USAID because the agency lacked funding for the construction: Yerevan,  Armenia; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Tbilisi, Georgia; Conakry, Guinea;  Bamako, Mali; Kingston, Jamaica; and Abuja, Nigeria. At most of these  posts, construction of the USAID facility will start between 2 to 4 years  after OBO awarded the contract for the compound. For example, OBO  awarded construction contracts for the new embassy compounds in  Phnom Penh and Conakry in fiscal year 2002 and plans to solicit bids to  construct the USAID annexes on these compounds during fiscal year 2004.  In Yerevan, the U.S. Ambassador and OBO devised an alternative to waiting  for funds to build a separate facility for USAID:  OBO is adding a floor to a  warehouse building under construction on the compound to house USAID.  OBO can add a floor to the building for less money than it would cost to  build a separate annex, although USAID will have less space, according to  State and USAID officials. Table 1 shows the contract award dates for  selected new embassy compounds and the award dates for the  corresponding USAID annex.

Building nonconcurrently can result in a second expensive mobilization of  contractor staff and equipment, additional work to procure building  materials, and added construction management oversight. According to  contractors experienced in building embassy compounds overseas, such  remobilization and duplication of support activities can add 20 percent to  25 percent to what a concurrent construction contract would have cost,  depending on the location. They said that when the U.S. government does  not receive funds for the USAID annex until after the contractor has  finished building the embassy, there is no chance of maximizing economies  of scale that result from contractor staff and equipment already on site. In  Nairobi, for example, according to one of the contractors we met with,  OBO could have built the USAID annex for $19 million using the same  contractor building the embassy chancery, but OBO awarded a contract for  almost $30 million to a different builder since funding was not available  until 4 years later. OBO officials have also said that in addition to  contractor mobilization costs, nonconcurrent expenses must include  OBO\u2019s added supervision and site security costs for a second project. For  instance, in Nairobi, OBO\u2019s project supervision and construction security  cost estimates for the USAID annex rose from $683,000 for concurrent  building to $2.9 million for nonconcurrent building.", "Nonconcurrent construction also increases security enhancement  expenses. Until secure office space is built, USAID must either remain in or  move to interim facilities. The interim site may require significant security  upgrades to obtain some minimum level of protection for staff, including  the leasing of surrounding property to create setbacks from roads, as well  as the addition of perimeter fencing and installation of anti-ram barriers.  Security, supervision, and maintenance personnel costs would continue to  accrue until the new USAID facility were completed. For instance, in  Kampala, Uganda, USAID will likely spend $3.2 million for operational and  security expenses from the time the new chancery opened in 2002 until the  annex in the new embassy compound is finished in 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concurrent Construction of Future USAID Annexes Could Save Millions of Dollars", "paragraphs": ["OBO estimates that future USAID annex projects now scheduled for  nonconcurrent construction will increase costs to taxpayers by $35 million.  Extrapolating from these data, we project that annex construction costs  could rise between $68 million to $78 million if all 18 future annexes were  delayed. These expenses do not include the $27 million to $30 million cost  increase that, based on OBO\u2019s data, we inferred was generated by  nonconcurrent construction of annexes for embassy compounds awarded  before 2004. There are no opportunities to significantly reduce this expense  because these compounds are already built or under construction without  USAID annexes. Estimates from OBO calculate the cost increase for  building the 9 USAID annexes now scheduled for nonconcurrent  construction over the next 5 budget years at $43 million (or $35 million at  present value) above the cost for building at the same time. We further  extrapolated from these and other OBO cost estimates, an average cost  differential increase for a USAID annex of about 24 percent to 31 percent  for nonconcurrent construction. Using OBO\u2019s cost data, we calculated the  range of the potential cost increase of nonconcurrent construction for all  future annex projects to be between $88 million to $101 million over the  next five budget years (or $68 million to $78 million at present value).

For example,  OBO has estimated that in one European location, USAID will have to pay  an additional $690,000 for rent because of a 1-year delay in awarding the  construction contract. In two African locations, USAID officials estimate  they will have to pay an additional $5.5 million for 3 or more years of rent  and continuing security expenses until their new facilities are built."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Including USAID Space within a Larger Chancery Rather Than Constructing a Separate USAID Annex May Decrease Costs", "paragraphs": ["Depending on a number of factors, building a separate annex for USAID  increases costs over designing additional space for USAID within the  chancery. Two of the contractors we met with stated that constructing one  building could be more cost effective than constructing two. OBO has  estimated that in two African locations where new embassy construction is  scheduled for 2006, building a separate USAID annex would cost at least  $6.5 million per site more than housing USAID in the chancery, assuming  nonconcurrent construction. OBO officials have said that, except for very  large USAID missions, there may be little reason to build a separate USAID  annex other than the ease of allocating construction costs to USAID.  Further, OBO has recently re-evaluated the office space parameters for  new overseas missions, significantly reducing the sizes of proposed USAID  annexes. Assuming these revised space allocations are adequate, an  additional five to eight proposed USAID annexes would be similar in size  (2,500 gross square meters or less) to those at the two African locations  OBO analyzed. The cost differentials between a separate annex versus  locating USAID within the chancery in those locations could be similar if  other key factors, such as building configuration and site conditions, were  also comparable.", "However, there are factors other than costs that should be considered  when determining whether to build a separate annex or include space for  USAID in the chancery, according to USAID.

Moreover, a separate unclassified USAID annex  may allow greater access for local staff and visitors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Nonconcurrent Construction Poses Security Risks", "paragraphs": ["In addition to cost considerations, nonconcurrent construction of the  USAID annexes raises a number of security concerns, according to State  Diplomatic Security and embassy officials as well as USAID security  officials. For example, some officials expressed concern about the safety of  USAID employees who remain in interim facilities after other U.S.  government personnel have moved to the new embassy compounds. State  is building the compounds to provide safe, secure facilities because U.S.  facilities and personnel have faced continued threats from terrorist and  other attacks since the Kenya and Tanzania embassy bombings. For  example, from 1998 through 2002, there were 30 terrorist attacks against  overseas posts, personnel, and diplomatic residences. During that same  period, overseas posts were forced to evacuate personnel or suspend  operations 83 times in response to direct threats or unstable security  situations in the host country.", "Terrorists continue to look for targets, according to the security officials,  and an interim USAID facility might be perceived to be a \u201csofter\u201d target  than a new, more secure embassy, thus making USAID employees more  vulnerable to attack. For example, figure 3 shows a new embassy  compound main gate with an anti-vehicle delta barrier, anti-ram perimeter  wall, and blast-resistant guardhouse containing bomb detection equipment,  compared with an interim USAID facility entrance with temporary barriers  that are removed after work hours.", "State, USAID, and embassy officials described a number of actions taken to  mitigate the risks for USAID employees who are not colocated in new  embassy compounds. For example, a post may construct special jersey  barriers and fences, dig trenches, close streets adjacent to a USAID facility  to create a setback around the building during the day, and lease properties  adjacent to its facilities to create a buffer. A post may also use contract  guard services, deploy surveillance detection teams and mobile response  teams, and use the services of local police.", "Despite actions to mitigate the security risks of nonconcurrent  construction, State and USAID officials remain concerned because interim  facilities do not meet the security standards established by the Overseas  Security Policy Board. In addition to the Secure Embassy Construction and  Counterrorism Act of 1999, which requires a 100-foot setback and  colocation of all U.S. government employees at a new site, the security  standards for new office buildings include anti-ram perimeter walls and  barriers, construction to meet blast protection, forced entry/ballistic  resistant protection for doors and windows, and controlled access points.  A USAID security official stated that, despite measures to reduce security  risks, facilities are vulnerable when they are not controlled by the U.S.  government. For example, the official said that posts using temporary  jersey barriers eliminate the setback each evening when the barriers are  removed and the streets are reopened to normal traffic. Further, a State  security official stated that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security was an early  advocate of colocating all U.S. personnel when the new embassy  compound is built. He said that the bureau is concerned from a threat  perspective and that the threat to U.S. personnel remains high. He said that  when USAID cannot be colocated, the bureau tries to find ways to mitigate  the risk but there is no perfect solution. However, he said the bureau does  not recommend delaying the construction of a compound until funding for  the USAID annex is available because that would leave a greater number of  staff vulnerable.", "Nonconcurrent construction also has security implications for the  employees who move into the newly constructed compound. Subsequent  construction of the USAID annex on the compound results in more  workers, vehicles, and equipment on site, which may increase the  vulnerability of the overall embassy compound and its personnel by giving  terrorists the opportunity to conduct surveillance or attack the embassy,  according to State and USAID officials. To address this issue, OBO and  regional security officers in Nairobi, Kenya, and Kampala, Uganda,  described a number actions required to control the access of construction  personnel and equipment to the compound. For example, the regional  security officers told us that they need to hire additional security guards to  inspect trucks bringing building materials to the compound. The regional  security officer in Nairobi said he would need about 14 additional guards to  perform these inspections. For some sites, destruction of part of the  perimeter wall to add an entrance for the construction vehicles and  equipment has been discussed as a way of allowing contractor access to  the compound. Construction workers need to undergo background checks  and receive identification cards, according to regional security officers;  these requirements could place a significant burden on their time and  workload unless State hires a site security manager."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist for More Concurrent Construction", "paragraphs": ["OBO acknowledged that it would be advantageous to the U.S. government  to build embassy compounds concurrently.

However, even without  cost sharing, there are opportunities for more concurrent and efficient  construction. By delaying one project slated for fiscal year 2006 and  estimated to cost more than $100 million, State would have sufficient funds  to eliminate the backlog of USAID projects. Moreover, it is not  unprecedented for projects in successive annual plans to be moved from  one year to another. For example, over the last three planning cycles,  several planned projects have had to be moved from one year to another  due to factors such as a failure to acquire land in a timely manner or a  change in executive branch priorities.
