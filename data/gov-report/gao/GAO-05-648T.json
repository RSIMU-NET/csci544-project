Before the act, an  individual seeking access to federal records had faced the burden of  establishing a right to examine them. FOIA established a \u201cright to  know\u201d standard for access, instead of a \u201cneed to know,\u201d and shifted  the burden of proof from the individual to the government agency  seeking to deny access. The act has been amended several times,  including in 1974, 1976, 1986, 1996, and 2002.", "FOIA provides the public with access to government information  either through \u201caffirmative agency disclosure\u201d\u2014publishing  information in the Federal Register or making it available in reading  rooms\u2014or in response to public requests for disclosure. Public  requests for disclosure of records are the best known type of FOIA  disclosure. Any member of the public may request access to  information held by federal agencies, without showing a need or  reason for seeking the information.", "The act prescribes nine specific categories of information that is  exempt from disclosure; agencies may cite these exemptions in  denying access to material (see table 1). The act also includes  provisions for excluding specific sensitive records held by law  enforcement agencies. The act requires agencies to notify requesters  of the reasons for any adverse determination and grants requesters  the right to appeal agency decisions to deny access.", "In addition, agencies are required to meet certain time frames for  making key determinations: whether to comply with requests (20  business days from receipt of the request), responses to appeals of  adverse determinations (20 business days from filing of the appeal),  and whether to provide expedited processing of requests (10  business days from receipt of the request). Congress did not  establish a statutory deadline for making releasable records  available, but instead required agencies to make them available  promptly.", "We have reported several times in the past on the contents of the  annual reports of 25 major agencies, covering fiscal years 1998  through 2002. We first reported information in 2001 on the  implementation of the 1996 amendments to FOIA. At that time we  recommended that Justice (1) encourage agencies to make material  electronically available and (2) review agency annual reports to  address specific data quality issues. Since our report was issued,  Justice has taken steps to implement both of these  recommendations. In 2002, we reported that the number of requests  received and processed appeared for most agencies\u2014except the  Department of Veterans Affairs\u2014to peak in fiscal year 2000 and  decline slightly in fiscal year 2001. In our 2004 report, we reported  that between 2000 and 2002, the number of requests received and  processed declined when the Department of Veterans Affairs is  excluded.

OIP also periodically issues guidance on compliance, provides  training, and maintains a counselors service to provide expert, one- on-one assistance to agency FOIA staff.

Further, fees can be charged for three types of FOIA-related  activities\u2014search, duplication, and review\u2014depending on the  requester\u2019s fee category. In addition, fees may not be charged to a  requester in certain situations, such as when a fee waiver is granted  or when the applicable fees are below a certain threshold.", "Commercial users can be charged for the broadest range of FOIA- related activities, including document search, review, and  duplication. Commercial use is defined in the OMB fee schedule  guidelines as \u201ca use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade  or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the  request is being made.\u201d The second category exempts search and  review fees for documents sought for noncommercial use by  educational or noncommercial scientific institutions, and for  documents sought by representatives of the news media. The third  category of fees, which applies to all requesters who do not fall  within either of the other two categories, allows for \u201creasonable\u201d  charges for document search and duplication. Table 3 shows the  FOIA-related activities for which agencies can charge by fee  category, as stipulated in the act.", "Although the act generally requires that requesters pay fees to cover  the costs of processing their requests, in certain circumstances, fees  are not to be charged. For example, as stipulated in the act, fees  may not be charged when the government\u2019s cost of collecting and  processing the fee is likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee  itself.", "Further, under certain circumstances, the act requires an agency to  furnish documents without charge, or at reduced charges. This is  commonly referred to as the FOIA fee-waiver provision. Based on  this provision, an agency must provide a fee waiver if two  conditions are met:  \u25cf  disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest  because it is likely to contribute significantly to public  understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and  \u25cf  disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial  interest of the requester.", "Under the act and guidance, when these requirements are both  satisfied, based upon information supplied by a requester or  otherwise made known to the agency, the fee waiver or reduction is  to be granted by the FOIA officer. When one or both of these  requirements are not satisfied, a fee waiver is not warranted. As  these criteria suggest, fee waivers are to be granted on a case-by- case basis.

Figure 1 is an overview of the process,  from the receipt of a request to the release of records.", "During the initial processing phase, a request is logged into the  agency\u2019s FOIA system, and a case file is started. The request is then  reviewed to determine its scope, estimate fees, and provide an initial  response to the requester. After this point, the FOIA staff begins its  search to retrieve responsive records. This step may include  searching for records from multiple locations and program offices.  After potentially responsive records are located, the documents are  reviewed to ensure that they are within the scope of the request.", "During the next two phases, the agency ensures that appropriate  information is to be released under the provisions of the act. First,  the agency reviews the responsive records to make any redactions  based on the statutory exemptions. Once the exemption review is  complete, the final set of responsive records is turned over to the  FOIA office, which calculates appropriate fees, if applicable. Before  release, the redacted responsive records are then given a final  review, possibly by the agency\u2019s general counsel, and then a  response letter is generated, summarizing the agency\u2019s actions  regarding the request. Finally, the responsive records are released to  the requester.", "Some requests are relatively simple to process, such as requests for  specific pieces of information that the requester sends directly to  the appropriate office. Other requests may require more extensive  processing, depending on their complexity, the volume of  information involved, the need for the agency FOIA office to work  with offices that have relevant subject-matter expertise to find and  obtain information, the need for a FOIA officer to review and redact  information in the responsive material, the need to communicate  with the requester about the scope of the request, and the need to  communicate with the requester about the fees that will be charged  for fulfilling the request (or whether fees will be waived).", "Specific details of agency processes for handling requests vary,  depending on the agency\u2019s organizational structure and the  complexity of the requests received. While some agencies centralize  processing in one main office, other agencies have separate FOIA  offices for each agency component and field office. Agencies also  vary in how they allow requests to be made. Depending on the  agency, requesters can submit requests by telephone, fax, letter, or  e-mail or through the Web. In addition, agencies may process  requests in two ways, known as \u201cmultitrack\u201d and \u201csingle track.\u201d  Multitrack processing involves dividing requests into two groups:  (1) simple requests requiring relatively minimal review, which are  placed in one processing track, and (2) more voluminous and  complex requests, which are placed in another track. In contrast,  single-track processing does not distinguish between simple and  complex requests. With single-track processing, agencies process all  requests on a first-in/first-out basis.

While the creation of DHS in fiscal  year 2003 led to a shift in some FOIA requests from agencies  affected by the creation of the new department, the same major  component entities are reflected in all 3 years that we reviewed. For  example, in 2002, before DHS was formed, FEMA independently  reported on its FOIA requests, and its annual report is reflected in  our analysis. However, beginning in 2003, FEMA became part of  DHS, and thus its FOIA requests are reflected in DHS figures for  2003 and 2004.", "In recent years, Veterans Affairs (VA) has accounted for a large  portion\u2014about half\u2014of governmentwide FOIA requests received  and processed. This is because the agency includes in its totals the  many first-party medical records requests that it processes.  However, VA\u2019s numbers have not driven the large increases in FOIA  requests. In fact, in 2004, the agency had a decline in the number of  requests received, processed, and pending compared to 2003. Thus,  when VA is excluded from governmentwide FOIA request totals,  the increase between 2003 and 2004 changes from 25 percent to 61  percent.

Agencies other than VA, SSA, HHS, and DHS  accounted for only 9 percent of all requests.", "Three of the four agencies that handled the largest numbers of  requests\u2014VA, SSA, and HHS\u2014also granted the largest percentages  of requests in full. However, as shown in figure 4, the numbers of  fully granted requests varied widely among agencies in fiscal year  2004. For example, three agencies\u2014State, the Central Intelligence  Agency, and the National Science Foundation \u2014made full grants of  requested records in less than 20 percent of the cases they  processed. Eight of the 25 agencies we reviewed made full grants of  requested records in over 60 percent of their cases.

Six of the  25 agencies we reviewed reported processing fewer requests than  they received each year for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004\u2014 therefore increasing their backlogs (see fig. 4). Nine additional  agencies also processed less than they received in two of these three  years. In contrast, five agencies (CIA, Energy, Labor, SBA, and  State) had processing rates above 100 percent in all three years,  meaning that each made continued progress in reducing their  backlogs of pending cases. Thirteen agencies were able to make at  least a small reduction in their backlogs in 1 or more years between  fiscal years 2002 and 2004.", "FOIA does not require agencies to make records available within a  specific amount of time. As I mentioned earlier, Congress did not  establish a statutory deadline for making releasable records  available, but instead required agencies to make them available  promptly. Agencies, however, are required to inform requesters  within 20 days of receipt of a request as to whether the agency will  comply with the request.", "For 2004, the reported time required to process requests by track  varied considerably among agencies (see table 5). Eleven agency  components reported processing simple requests in less than 10  days, as evidenced by the lower value of the reported ranges. These  components are part of the Departments of Energy, Education,  Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, the Interior,  Justice, Labor, Transportation, the Treasury, and Agriculture. On the  other hand, some organizations are taking much more time to  process simple requests, such as components of Energy, Interior,  and Justice. This can be seen in upper end values of the median  ranges greater than 100 days. Components of four agencies (Interior,  Education, Treasury, and VA) reported processing complex requests  quickly\u2014in less than 10 days. In contrast, several other agencies  (DHS, Energy, Justice, Transportation, Education, HHS, HUD, State,  Treasury, and Agriculture) reported components taking longer to  process complex requests, with median days greater than 100. Four  agencies (HHS, NSF, OPM, and SBA) reported using single-track  processing. The processing times for single track varied from 5 days  (at SBA) to 182 days (at an HHS component).", "Based on the data in agency annual reports, it was not feasible to  determine trends at the agency level in the amount of time taken to  process requests (reported annually as the median number of days  to process requests). This is largely because many agencies have  reported median processing times at a component level, making it  difficult to derive overall agency median processing times. Nearly  half (12 of 25) of the agencies reported median times at a  component level. Although this practice does not provide agency- level indicators, it provides visibility into differences in processing  times among the various components of agencies, which can  sometimes be substantial.", "In summary, FOIA continues to be a valuable tool for citizens to  obtain information about the operation and decisions of the federal  government. Agencies have received steadily increasing numbers of  requests and have also continued to increase the number of requests  that they process. Despite this increase in processing requests, the  backlog of pending cases continues to grow. Given this steadily  increasing workload, it will remain critically important that strong  oversight of FOIA implementation continue in order to ensure that  agencies remain responsive to the needs of citizens.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.

With regard to access, the Privacy Act gives  individuals the right to have access to information about themselves  that is maintained in a system of records so that they can review,  challenge, and correct the accuracy of personal information held by  the government.", "While both laws generally give individuals the right of access to  information (subject to exemptions), there are several important  differences:  \u25cf  While FOIA generally gives a right of access to all federal  government records, the Privacy Act applies only to records  pertaining to an individual that are retrieved by individual identifier.  \u25cf  While FOIA generally gives \u201cany person\u201d a right of access to records,  the Privacy Act gives access to only the subject of a particular  record and only if that person is a U.S. citizen or a lawfully admitted  permanent resident alien.  \u25cf  While FOIA exempts categories of records from public release,  including where disclosure would constitute an unwarranted  invasion of personal privacy, the Privacy Act\u2019s exemptions pertain  to a variety of the act\u2019s requirements, not just access (e.g., that  agencies account for all disclosures of personal information, that  they maintain only relevant and necessary personal information, and  that they notify the public of their sources for obtaining records of  personal information).", "Under current Department of Justice guidance, agencies are to treat  an individual\u2019s requests for his or her own records as a request  under FOIA as well as the Privacy Act. This is intended to ensure  that individuals are fully afforded their rights under both laws. As a  practical matter, it appears that agencies generally consider requests  for access to one\u2019s own records as FOIA requests, without any  separate accounting as Privacy Act requests. These requests are  referred to as \u201cfirst-party requests\u201d and their addition to agency  FOIA statistics can been seen, for example, in the large numbers of  FOIA requests reported by agencies such as VA and SSA.", "Apart from questions about the role of the Privacy Act in FOIA  decisions, privacy questions are often dealt with independently  under FOIA. The act\u2019s two privacy exemptions  protect  from public release information about individuals in \u201cpersonnel and  medical files and similar files\u201d and \u201cinformation compiled for law  enforcement purposes,\u201d the disclosure of which would constitute an  \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d These statutory  provisions have resulted in an analysis that involves a \u201cbalancing of  the public\u2019s right to disclosure against the individual\u2019s right to  privacy.\u201d This approach led, for example, the Supreme Court to  decide that there is a significant private interest in the \u201cpractical  obscurity\u201d of criminal history records even though they are officially  public records. The development and refinement of such privacy  principles continues as agencies and the courts make new  \u201cbalancing\u201d decisions in FOIA cases.
