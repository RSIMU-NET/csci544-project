Lacking access to detailed data from tax returns, most researchers have estimated ETRs based on data from financial statements. A common measure of tax liability used in past estimates has been the current tax expense--either federal only or worldwide (which comprises federal, foreign, and U.S. state and local income taxes). The most common measure of income for these estimates has been some variant of pretax net book income. GAO was able to compare book tax expenses to tax liabilities actually reported on corporate income tax returns.", "For tax year 2010 (the most recent information available), profitable U.S. corporations that filed a Schedule M-3 paid U.S. federal income taxes amounting to about 13 percent of the pretax worldwide income that they reported in their financial statements (for those entities included in their tax returns). When foreign and state and local income taxes are included, the ETR for profitable filers increases to around 17 percent. The inclusion of unprofitable firms, which pay little if any tax, also raises the ETRs because the losses of unprofitable corporations greatly reduce the denominator of the measures. Even with the inclusion of unprofitable filers, which increased the average worldwide ETR to 22.7 percent, all of the ETRs were well below the top statutory tax rate of 35 percent. GAO could only estimate average ETRs with the data available and could not determine the variation in rates across corporations. The limited available data from Schedules M-3, along with prior GAO work relating to corporate taxpayers, suggest that ETRs are likely to vary considerably across corporations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO does not make recommendations in this report.

It also includes net income that  corporations earn in the form of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and  realized capital gains. The statutory rate of tax on net corporate income  ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income  earned. The United States taxes the worldwide income of domestic  corporations, regardless of where the income is earned, with a foreign tax  credit for certain taxes paid to other countries. The timing of the tax  liability depends on several factors. For example, income earned not by  the domestic corporation, but by a foreign subsidiary is generally not  taxed until a distribution\u2014such as a dividend\u2014is made to the U.S.  corporation.", "At about $242 billion, corporate income taxes are far smaller than the  $845 billion in social insurance taxes and $1.1 trillion in individual income  taxes that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimates were  paid in fiscal year 2012 to fund the federal government.  Figure 1 shows the relative distribution of federal taxes.", "Figures 1 and 2 show the trend in corporate income tax revenues since  1950. According to tax experts, corporate income tax revenues fell from  the 1960s to the early 1980s for several reasons. For example, corporate  income became a smaller share of gross domestic product (GDP) during  these years, partly due to the fact that corporate debt, and therefore  deductible interest payments, increased relative to corporate equity,  reducing the tax base. In addition, tax expenditures, such as more  generous depreciation rules also grew over that period.1980s, the corporate income tax has accounted for about 6 to 15 percent   Since the early  of federal revenue. Consequently, although not the largest, it remains an  important source of federal revenue. Relative to GDP, the corporate  income tax has ranged from a little over 1 percent to just under 2.7  percent during those same years, as shown in figure 2. The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently projected that despite the  recent uptick, corporate income tax revenue for the next 10 years as a  percentage of GDP is expected to stay within this same range.", "Businesses operating as publicly traded corporations in the United States  are required to report the income they earn and the expenses (including  taxes) they incur each year according to two separate standards. First,  they must produce financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP), based on standards established  by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Income and expense items  reported in these statements are commonly known as book items.  Second, in general, domestic corporations, including publicly traded  corporations, must file corporate income tax returns on which they report  income, expenses, and tax liabilities according to rules set out in the  Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and associated Department of Treasury  regulations.", "The measurement of business net income is inherently difficult and some components  of both tax and book net income are estimates subject to some imprecision. (Net income  equals total income minus expenses.) One important source of imprecision is the difficulty  of measuring costs associated with the use of capital assets. Both book and tax  depreciation rules allocate capital costs over the expected useful lives of different types of  assets.

Concern over the growing  difference observed between pretax book net income and tax net income  and the lack of detail available from the Schedule M-1 on the sources of  these differences led to the development of the more extensive reporting  on book-tax differences that is now required on Schedule M-3. One  important concern with Schedule M-1 arose from the fact that GAAP  governing which components of large multinational corporate groups  need to be included in financial statements differ from tax rules that  specify which of those components need to be included in consolidated  tax returns. Consequently, the financial statement data that taxpayers  reported on their M-1s could relate to a much different business entity  from the one covered by the tax return. A Schedule M-3 filer is now  required to report the worldwide income of the entity represented in its  financial statements and then follow a well-defined series of steps\u2014 subtracting out income and losses of foreign and U.S. entities that are  included in the financial statements but not in consolidated tax returns;  adding in the income and losses of entities that are included in  consolidated tax returns but not in financial statements; and making other  adjustments to arrive at the book income of tax-includible entities. The  Schedule M-3 also requires filers to report many more specific income  and expense items according to both financial statement and tax rules  than the M-1 required. The items causing the largest book-tax differences  are identified later in this report.

Any remaining  burden is borne by the corporation\u2019s shareholders or other owners of  capital. A marginal effective tax rate focuses on the tax burden associated  with a specific investment (usually over the full life of that investment) and  is a better measure of the effects that taxes have on incentives to  invest.

Profitable filers had aggregate  pretax net book income of $1.4 trillion while unprofitable filers had losses  totaling $315 billion, resulting in total net book income of $1.1 trillion for  the full population. As these numbers suggest, average effective tax  rates can vary significantly depending on the population of corporations  covered by the estimate.

Firms cannot take deductions for qualified stock  options (unless the stock is held for less than 2 years), although recipients get special beneficial tax  treatment. For nonqualified stock options, the firm granting the option can deduct the fair market  value when the recipient has an unrestricted right to the property and the fair market value can be  reasonably ascertained.", "This line shows the difference between the amounts of foreign income taxes that corporations report  as expenses in their financial statements and the amounts that they claim as deductions for tax  purposes.
