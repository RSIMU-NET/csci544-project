After discussions with congressional staff, GAO agreed to examine federal programs benefiting Alaska Native villages. Specifically, this report (1) provides information on the amount of federal assistance provided to Alaska Native villages during fiscal years 1998 through 2003, (2) describes how selected federal funds have been used to assist Alaska Native villages, and (3) provides data on the number and average cost of houses built by villages and Alaska Native regional housing authorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of available data indicates that Alaska Native villages and regional Native nonprofits--including Native associations, and regional health and housing nonprofits--received over $3 billion in federal assistance from fiscal years 1998 through 2003. Specifically, total federal funding included approximately $483 million to 216 Alaska Native villages and about $3 billion to 33 regional Native nonprofits. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) accounted for 63 percent of all funding over the period. According to federal and state officials, Alaska Native villages also likely benefited from federal funding to the state of Alaska and to cities and boroughs that contain villages, such as when federal funding is used by municipalities to provide water services. Based on data GAO obtained from the state of Alaska, during fiscal years 1998 through 2003, the state passed through more than $105 million in federal funding to Native villages and regional Native nonprofits. Based on available information for 13 programs GAO reviewed, federal funding was used to provide Alaska Natives with assistance in health care, housing, infrastructure, and other areas. For example, according to information from HHS, its Tribal Self-Governance Program was used by 13 regional Native nonprofits, three Native villages, four groups of Alaska Native villages, and one statewide Native health care provider to provide clinical services at tribally run hospitals and health clinics that had over 1 million total visits throughout Alaska in 2002. Another program, HUD's Indian Housing Block Grant, provided funds used by villages and regional housing authorities to build, rehabilitate, modernize, and operate single-family homes and multifamily housing properties. However, the extent of readily available information on how funds were used from the 13 programs GAO reviewed varied, in part due to different agency reporting requirements. Results from GAO's survey of Alaska Native villages and regional housing authorities indicated that, during calendar years 1998 through 2003, responding entities constructed a total of 874 single-family units. GAO's survey indicated that the average cost of units constructed by responding entities varied by region and by whether they were developed by villages or housing authorities. For example, the 6-year average regional cost (in 2003 dollars) of all units constructed ranged from a low of $138,944 per unit, or $122 per square foot, to a high of $305,634 per unit, or $267 per square foot. GAO also found that the cost of new housing units developed by housing authorities was slightly higher than units developed by Native villages, and that regional housing authorities constructed more than three times the number of units compared with villages. However, various factors could account for differences in the cost and number of units completed among regions or between villages and regional housing authorities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Census Bureau, about 120,000 people who live in Alaska  are Native\u2014aboriginal Americans, many of whom reside in rural areas of  the state long inhabited by their ancestors.

In addition, we met with  representatives of Native villages, regional Native nonprofit organizations,  and other organizations that assist Alaska Natives. To report on the amount  of federal funding that has been provided to assist Alaska Native villages,  we examined data on both funding to over 200 federally recognized Alaska  Native villages and regional Native nonprofits, and funding to Native  villages that was passed through the state of Alaska. We classified as  regional Native nonprofits: Native associations that were identified in the  Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) or the organizations that  succeeded them, which, throughout this report, we refer to as ANCSA  regional nonprofits; Native health organizations identified in P.L. 105-83;  and Alaska regional housing authorities identified by the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD). To provide information on  funding to Alaska Native villages, we analyzed data from the Federal  Assistance Award Data System (FAADS), which identifies recipients of  federal awards, federal programs for which awards were made, and award  amounts. To verify the accuracy of our data, we provided federal agencies  with data on their programs that we obtained from FAADS. Based on  agency responses, where appropriate, we made adjustments to data we  obtained from FAADS. To provide information on the amount of federal  funding to assist Alaska Native villages that was passed through by the  state, we obtained information from the state of Alaska Department of  Administration, Division of Finance. To describe how selected federal  funds were used to assist Alaska Native communities, we selected 13 major programs from among 11 agencies. For each of these programs, we met  with federal officials and, where appropriate, state, local, village and other  tribal officials, as well as officials representing organizations that primarily  serve Alaska Natives. We also reviewed program descriptions from the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) and reviewed agency  documents on how recipients used program funds. To determine the  number of housing units completed and their costs, we surveyed all villages  and regional housing authorities that had received HUD funds from the  Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996,  as amended (NAHASDA), during fiscal years 1998 through 2003. In carrying  out our work, we did not conduct audit work to assess whether funds were  spent in compliance with federal regulations, and we did not assess the  efficiency or effectiveness of how federal funds were distributed or spent.

Many Alaska Natives,  however, live in rural areas of western, northern, and interior Alaska long  inhabited by their ancestors. Alaska Natives are generally divided into six  major groupings: Unangan (Aleuts), Alutiiq (Pacific Eskimos), Inupiat  (Northern Eskimos), Yup\u2019ik (Bering Sea Eskimos), Athabascan (Interior  Indians), and Tlingit and Haida (Southeast Coastal Indians)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Variety of Entities Facilitates the Provision of Federal Assistance to Alaska Native Villages", "paragraphs": ["A variety of entities facilitates federal assistance to Alaska Native villages.

However,  with the passage of several key pieces of legislation, Alaska Native villages  and other tribal organizations began to take on more responsibility for  directly administering programs to assist their communities, and began to  receive direct funding to carry out these tasks. For example, in 1971,  Congress passed ANCSA, which was intended to resolve Native claims to  land in the state. Under ANCSA, the Secretary of the Interior divided the  state into 12 geographic regions so that each would include Natives \u201chaving  a common heritage and sharing common interests.\u201d All Natives became  shareholders in one of 12 regional corporations or in a 13th corporation for  nonresident Natives.

Under the 1975  Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act, as amended,  and further through the Tribal Self-Governance Act of 1994 and the Tribal  Self-Governance Amendments of 2000, tribes and tribal organizations were  allowed to participate in and manage programs that for years had been  administered on their behalf by the Departments of the Interior and of  Health and Human Services. Also, prior to NAHASDA, Alaska Natives were  served by 14 regional housing authorities that were authorized by previous  federal housing laws to provide services for Alaska Natives. NAHASDA  further expanded the ability of Native villages to directly receive federal  funding for the purpose of providing services to eligible Alaska Natives.  The regional housing authorities and Native villages engage in a variety of  affordable housing activities, including construction, rehabilitation, and  management.

Public Law 108-447 temporarily limits the ability of  IHS from directly funding villages that are already located within the area  of a Native Alaska regional health facility. This restriction was put in place  due to congressional concerns about the efficiency of providing direct  federal funding to Alaska Native villages. Also, 25 USC 13f prohibits the  provision of certain BIA funding to villages with fewer than 25 members;  and 25 USC 3651 (note) limits which entities can receive certain  Department of Justice funds.

According to federal and tribal officials  and documentation, the following factors could account for these  differences:   Differences in housing goals and objectives. In order to receive  NAHASDA funding, housing authorities and villages are required to  submit to HUD a 1-year and 5-year Indian Housing Plan (IHP), which  outlines the housing goals and objectives for their communities. To  carry out their plans, housing authorities and villages can determine the  extent to which they focus their resources on new construction,  rehabilitation, or other affordable housing activities. For example,  Bristol Bay Housing Authority outlined in its fiscal year 2003 IHP that it  would allocate a fixed amount of funds for new construction in villages,  based on an assessment of needs.", "Differences in the amount of NAHASDA funding. Regional housing  authorities generally receive considerably larger amounts of annual  funding compared with villages because regional housing authorities  receive funding on behalf of villages that have designated them to  receive their NAHASDA funds, as well as modernization and operating  funds for units developed under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. Lack of  additional funding in some cases limits the affordable housing villages  can construct or rehabilitate. For example, in fiscal year 2003, the  housing authority in the Maniilaq Association region received about  twice the amount of funds of the single-largest amount provided to a  village in that region. In addition, the amount of funding housing  authorities and villages receive from the HUD formula takes into  account Native population of the service area. Some of the populations  that regional housing authorities serve are considerably higher than that  of villages, and some regions have higher populations than other  regions.  For example, the total Native population in the Cook Inlet  Native Association region is more than 10 times that of the Aleutian  Pribilof Islands Association region.", "Differences in the extent to which NAHASDA funds were leveraged.  Variations in the number of units constructed and rehabilitated may  reflect the extent to which NAHASDA funds were leveraged. For  example, according to the Cook Inlet housing authority, it leveraged  IHBG funds with other sources of funding to complete a recent housing  development. Cook Inlet housing authority used NAHASDA funds for  about 10 percent of project costs and leveraged the remaining costs with  private mortgages and other funding.", "Similarly, federal and state housing officials informed us that several  factors may account for differences in regional construction and  rehabilitation costs, as well as differences in costs reported by villages and  housing authorities. These factors include the following:   Transportation costs: Many Alaska Native villages are in remote  locations, requiring equipment and building supplies to be transported  to the construction sites. In general, regions that are farthest from  Seattle\u2014a major source of building materials\u2014incur higher costs for  transporting building material and equipment than regions that are  closer.", "Length of construction season: Villages that experience extremely cold  weather, such as those in the north and the interior of Alaska, have short  construction seasons. For example, the construction season in the  Arctic Slope Native Association is usually 2 or 3 months long, depending  on ice conditions in the Bering Strait and north of the Arctic Circle. A  short construction season means higher costs due to limited barge  access to remote communities (with barge access the only viable  method for moving construction materials and equipment to remote  villages), less time available for site preparation and actual  construction, overtime pay for working longer hours each day, and  climate changes that suddenly stop construction or excavation.", "Using outside expertise: Higher costs are associated with transporting,  housing and feeding outside construction workers, engineers, and  housing inspectors. This could be for both regional housing authorities  and rural Native villages. Larger villages may be able to use local  construction workers, but smaller, more isolated villages with a limited  skilled labor pool to choose from may have to rely on outside workers  with required technical skills (e.g., electricians, plumbers, etc.). Many  housing authorities rely on outside contractors, who usually provide a  core crew of their own construction workers\u2014supplemented by the  local workforce\u2014to construct housing.", "Land costs: Generally, urban areas cost more than rural areas because  they are closer to utilities and roads and are located in active real estate  markets in high-density areas. Rural Native villages often donate land  for housing development, though in many cases they have less access to  infrastructure.", "Wage costs: The hourly wage rates for new construction and  rehabilitation of housing vary across Alaska\u2019s regions. Generally, labor  costs are higher in the more remote areas of Alaska, such as the north,  and lower in the southern areas. For example, under the Davis-Bacon  Act, carpenters are required to be paid $15.83 (without fringe benefits)  in the Anchorage area; $25.05 plus $7.80 for fringe benefits in the  Northern area; and $17.68 (without fringe benefits) in the southern  area. In 2000, NAHASDA was amended to allow Native villages to  establish tribally determined wage rates for their IHBG construction  projects instead of using Davis-Bacon wages rates. However, according  to HUD officials, Davis-Bacon wage rates and tribally determined wage  rates within the same region are frequently similar.", "Type of terrain: Many of the houses in Alaska Native communities,  particularly in northern and central Alaska, were constructed on  permafrost\u2014land that is permanently frozen. It generally costs more to  build on this type of terrain due to the need for specialized engineered  foundation systems. It also generally costs more to build on hilly terrain  or rocky soil, such as Kodiak Island in the Kodiak Area Native  Association region.", "Site preparation: Building or extending roads and installing power,  water, and sewer lines\u2014both on-site and off-site, particularly in rural  communities\u2014can be costly. Also, the same type of terrain problems  mentioned above apply to site preparation.", "Energy efficiency standards: The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation  (AHFC) requires any recipient of its funds to follow the Building Energy  Efficiency Standard (BEES). Each regional housing authority receives  annual funding from AHFC, but the villages do not receive any such  funds. Therefore, each regional housing authority is required to adhere  to the BEES for each newly constructed unit whenever they use AHFC  funding. According to an AHFC official responsible for administering  the BEES program, there are additional costs associated with  compliance with the BEES standards, although these costs will vary  depending on several factors, such as whether an independent inspector  is required to inspect the housing unit. Villages may also voluntarily  choose to use some or all of the BEES standards.", "Building code standards: Alaska\u2019s Construction Inspection Guidelines  require each builder to retain an independent, licensed inspector to  perform each of the inspections set forth in the guidelines. According an  AHFC official, this could amount to between 5 to 12 inspector site visits  during the construction period. Since only regional housing authorities  receive AHFC funds, Native villages are not required to follow any state  building codes, unless they are located in one of the 13 municipalities  that have adopted building code standards. However, similar to the  BEES, Native villages may voluntarily choose to use some or all of the  building code standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the federal  co-chair of the Denali Commission and the Secretaries of Agriculture,  Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban  Development, Justice, the Interior, Labor, and Transportation, and the  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the  Governor of Alaska.

To address these objectives, we met with officials of various  federal agencies, the state of Alaska, boroughs, and cities. In addition, we  met with representatives of Native villages, regional Native nonprofit  organizations, and other organizations that primarily focus on Alaska  Natives. We also met with officials from advocacy groups that represent  Alaska Natives, including the Alaska Federation of Natives, the Alaska  Inter-Tribal Council, and the National Congress of American Indians.", "To report on the amount of federal funding that has been provided to assist  Alaska Native villages, we examined data on both funding to over 200  federally recognized Alaska Native villages and regional Native nonprofits.  We classified as regional Native nonprofits the Native associations that  were identified in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and  the organizations that succeeded them, which, throughout this report, we  refer to as ANCSA Native nonprofits; Native health organizations identified  in Public Law 105-83; and housing authorities identified by the Department  of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). To provide information on  federal funding to Alaska Native villages, we analyzed data from the  Federal Assistance Award Data System (FAADS), which identifies  recipients of federal awards, federal programs for which awards were  made, and award amounts. The analysis sought to isolate funding provided  to Alaska Native villages, regional Native nonprofits, other nonprofits that  primarily focus on Alaska Natives, incorporated cities that have villages  within their borders, boroughs, and the state of Alaska. In providing FAADS  data to the Census Bureau, each federal agency codes recipients of its  federal funds into 13 categories. Two of these categories apply to Native  recipients: Indian tribes and other nonprofit agencies. During electronic  testing, GAO identified reliability problems with these categories. Similar  problems were identified by other researchers (e.g., University of Alaska  Anchorage and the Alaska Legislature Legislative Research Service) that  have used this data. For example, agencies did not consistently apply the  recipient codes to the same recipients. Therefore, we conducted our own  coding of the recipient type, and in some cases, recipients were recoded  into a new category. Specifically, we classified entities as Alaska Native  villages based on whether they were recognized as such by the Bureau of  Indian Affairs (BIA). We classified entities as regional Native nonprofits  based on whether there were (1) regional Native associations identified in  ANCSA and the organizations that succeeded them, (2) regional Native  health organizations identified in Public Law 105-83, or (3) Alaska regional  housing authorities identified by the Department of Housing and Urban  Development. We classified entities as other nonprofits that primarily focus  on Alaska Natives based our review of published information and on  consultations with the Denali Commission and the Alaska Federation of  Natives. In addition, we classified entities as state entities based on  whether they were state of Alaska agencies or subagencies; boroughs  based on whether there were recognized Alaska borough governments;  cities based on whether they were incorporated cities that contain Alaska  Native villages within their borders; and Independent School Districts  based on whether they are Alaska public school districts.", "Maintained by the Census Bureau, FAADS produces a quarterly file of  standardized data records on all types of financial assistance awards made  by federal agencies to all types of recipients during the indicated quarter.  Each transaction record identifies, by the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance (CFDA) program code number and name, the type and amount  of financial assistance, the type and location of the recipient, and the  geographic place of performance. Also, GAO\u2019s FAADS analyses uses  constant 2003 dollars. We assessed the reliability of the FAADS data by (1)  performing electronic testing of the required data elements for obvious  errors in accuracy and completeness, (2) comparing program totals by  fiscal year to similar data from the Single Audit Act database, (3) reviewing  related documentation, (4) reviewing related studies that used FAADS data,  and (5) interviewing Census Bureau officials knowledgeable about the  data. In addition, for 10 federal agencies whose programs are focused on in  this report, we provided agency officials with FAADS program dollar  amount totals for all entities receiving funds in Alaska, by fiscal year, and  asked agencies to verify that the totals were correct. In cases where there  was a greater than 10 percent difference between our totals based on  FAADS compared with data provided directly to us by the agencies, we  identified the agency programs producing the largest dollar differences and  the largest percentage differences, and discussed those differences with  agency officials. If we determined that the agency data were reliable, we  adjusted our data to reflect the verified agency data. We did this by  obtaining the agency obligations provided to individual recipients in Alaska  for agency programs from 1998 through 2003. The FAADS data was  obtained from Census in March 2005.", "To provide information on the amount of federal funds passed through to  Alaska Native villages and other entities by the state of Alaska to carry out  federal programs, we analyzed information obtained from the state of  Alaska\u2019s Department of Administration, Division of Finance; and the  University of Alaska. The Division of Finance coordinated our request for  \u201cpass through\u201d data with 15 state departments and component units. The  information we obtained from the Division of Finance and the University of  Alaska included the amount of federal funds passed through to various  entities for state fiscal years 1998 through 2003, including the specific  federal program that provided the funds. We limited our review to Alaska  Native villages, regional Native nonprofits, incorporated cities that have  Native villages within their borders, and boroughs. To assess the reliability  of the state data, we discussed the data system with Division of Finance  officials and the University of Alaska. We also discussed the process they  used to satisfy our request. We concluded that the data we obtained from  the state of Alaska were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.   The state data were obtained from the Division of Finance and University  of Alaska during February and March 2005.", "To describe how selected federal funds were used to assist Alaska Native  communities, we judgmentally selected 13 major programs from 11  agencies\u20141 each from 9 agencies and 2 each from the remaining 2  agencies. We selected 1 program each from the Denali Commission, the  Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education, Health and Human  Services (HHS), Justice, Interior, Labor, and Transportation (DOT), and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also selected two programs  each from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the  Department of Commerce. Generally, the selected programs provided the  largest amount of funding to Alaska Native villages and regional Native  nonprofits during fiscal years 1998 through 2003 for their respective agencies, based on our analysis of FAADS. These programs also  represented 84 percent of total federal funding to Alaska Native villages  and regional native nonprofits during the period. For USDA, we selected  CFDA 10.760\u2014Water and Waste Disposal Systems for Rural  Communities\u2014even though it did not provide the most direct funding to  Native villages and regional Native nonprofits, because it also provided  significant funding to cities and to the state, through the state\u2019s Village Safe  Water program, which used funds to benefit Native villages and Alaska  Natives. For Labor, we selected Youth Opportunity Grants (CFDA 17.263),  which provided almost $16 million to regional Native nonprofits during the  period. Our FAADS analysis identified Workforce Investment Act program  (CFDA 17.255) as the program that provided the most funding, which was  used to provide funding for youth opportunity activities and was  subsequently replaced during the period with 6 new programs, including  CFDA 17.263\u2014Youth Opportunity Grants. For Education, we selected the  Alaska Native Education Program (CFDA 84.356), which represented the  largest program when combining amounts provided by 2 other programs  that were consolidated into this program during the period\u2014Alaska Native  Home-Based Education for Preschool Children (CFDA 84.321) and Alaska  Native Educational Planning, Curriculum Development, Teacher Training,  and Recruitment Program (CFDA 84.320). For Commerce, FAADS  indicated that the Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) program  provided the largest amount of department funding to Alaska Native  villages and regional Native nonprofits during 1998 through 2003. We also  selected Commerce\u2019s Public Works and Economic Development Facilities  program for review after department officials informed us that EAA  provided atypically high funding to Alaska Native villages in 2001 in  response to an Alaska salmon-fishing disaster. Also, we selected 2 HUD  programs: the Indian Housing Block Grant program, which provided the  largest amount of department funding to Alaska Native villages and  regional Native nonprofits, according to our FAADS analysis; and the  Indian Community Development Block Grant program, because it also can  be used to construct new housing in Alaska Native villages.", "For each of the 13 programs we reviewed, we met with federal officials  and, where appropriate, state, local, and village officials, as well as other  officials representing organizations that primarily serve Alaska Natives. We  also reviewed program descriptions from the CFDA and reviewed agency  documents on how recipients used program funds, including grantee  reports, annual reports to Congress, and reports prepared in compliance  with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. To better  understand certain programs administered by the state of Alaska, we spoke  with officials from the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public  Facilities, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, and the  Alaska Housing Finance Corporation. Where program data are reported,  we interviewed agency officials and reviewed program documents to  assure ourselves that data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "To better understand the need for and uses of the selected programs, we  visited several Alaska Native villages. Based on our analysis of FAADS,  each of the villages received funding from at least 1 of the 13 selected  programs.  During our visit, we interviewed representatives of Alaska  Native villages, regional Native nonprofits, and incorporated cities with  villages within their borders.  We saw several examples of projects  completed using the selected programs, including housing, water and  waste treatment facilities, bulk fuel tank farms, and primary health care  facilities.", "To provide information on the cost and number of houses built by Native  villages and Alaska Native regional housing authorities, we surveyed  Alaska Native villages and regional housing authorities (also known as  tribally designated housing entities) that were identified as having received  Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) funds for at least 1 year from fiscal  year 1998 through 2003. We identified 78 Alaska Native villages and 15  regional housing authorities that have received IHBG funds. We provided  each of the 93 villages and regional housing authorities with a  questionnaire delivered by e-mail or by U.S. mail. Questionnaire items  covered the number developed and the cost of new single-family units and  multifamily properties, the number developed and the cost of rehabilitated  single-family units and multifamily housing properties, and the number  developed and the cost of modernized single-family units and multifamily  housing properties. To prepare for the survey, we conducted interviews  with HUD officials, Alaska state officials, and members of various Alaska  Native villages and regional housing authorities. We had HUD Alaska field  office officials review the survey for content, and we pretested the  questionnaire with two regional housing authorities and five villages to  determine whether respondents would understand questions the way we  intended. Since the questionnaire was administered via e-mail as well as  U.S. mail, usability tests also were conducted with all of the pretests to  observe respondents answering the questionnaire as it would appear when  opened and displayed on their computer screen.", "We took the following steps to increase the response rate for both village  and housing authority participants. We sent two reminder notices via e-mail  and conducted follow-up telephone calls to those offices that did not  respond to our survey by the initial deadline. Collection of survey data  ended on March 15, 2005. We received responses from 57 villages and 13  regional housing authorities, providing a response rate of 73.1 percent for  villages and 86.7 percent for regional housing authorities. Table 9 details  the responding regional housing authorities and villages that were  constructing or rehabilitating single-family homes between calendar years  1998-2003. We did not attempt to verify the respondents\u2019 answers against an  independent source of information; however, questionnaire items were  tested by probing pretest participants about their answers using in-depth  interviewing techniques. Interviewers judged that all the respondents\u2019  answers to the questions were correct. In addition, answers to the final  questionnaire were compared with data in HUD\u2019s Annual Performance  Reports for 1998 through 2003. These data are not directly comparable with  data obtained in the survey, but do indicate whether survey respondents\u2019  answers were reasonable. We conducted follow-up phone calls to clarify  responses where there appeared to be discrepancies.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce certain  types of errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not  respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. Steps  such as pretesting and follow-up contacts to increase response rates serve  to minimize nonresponse error. In addition, steps such as performing  statistical analyses to identify inconsistencies and having a second  independent reviewer for the data analysis can further minimize such error.  Data from surveys returned via e-mail were entered electronically by  participants and imported into an electronic data file. Data from all fax- returned or mail-returned surveys were edited for consistency before  sending them for keypunching. These surveys were \u201cdouble key entered\u201d  into our database (that is, the entries were 100 percent verified), and a  random sample of the surveys was further verified for completeness and  accuracy.
