This testimony addresses (1) the extent to which there has been a proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs, (2) federal agencies' responsibility for tracking this proliferation and determining the associated risks, and (3) the lessons that can be learned from recent incidents at three high-containment biosafety labs. To address these objectives, GAO asked 12 federal agencies involved with high-containment labs about their missions and whether they tracked the number of labs overall. GAO also reviewed documents from these agencies, such as pertinent legislation, regulation, and guidance. Finally, GAO interviewed academic experts in microbiological research."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A major proliferation of high-containment BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs is taking place in the United States, according to the literature, federal agency officials, and experts. The expansion is taking place across many sectors--federal, academic, state, and private--and all over the United States. Concerning BSL-4 labs, which handle the most dangerous agents, the number of these labs has increased from 5--before the terrorist attacks of 2001--to 15, including at least 1 in planning stage. Information on expansion is available about high-containment labs that are registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Select Agent Program, and that are federally funded. However, much less is known about the expansion of labs outside the Select Agent Program, as well as the nonfederally funded labs, including location, activities, and ownership. No single federal agency, according to 12 agencies' responses to our survey, has the mission to track the overall number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs in the United States. Though several agencies have a need to know, no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the United States. Consequently, no agency is responsible for determining the risks associated with the proliferation of these labs. We identified six lessons from three recent incidents: failure to report to CDC exposures to select agents by Texas A&M University (TAMU); power outage at the CDC's new BSL-4 lab in Atlanta, Georgia; and release of foot-and-mouth disease virus at Pirbright in the United Kingdom. These lessons highlight the importance of (1) identifying and overcoming barriers to reporting in order to enhance biosafety through shared learning from mistakes and to assure the public that accidents are examined and contained; (2) training lab staff in general biosafety, as well as in specific agents being used in the labs to ensure maximum protection; (3) developing mechanisms for informing medical providers about all the agents that lab staff work with to ensure quick diagnosis and effective treatment; (4) addressing confusion over the definition of exposure to aid in the consistency of reporting; (5) ensuring that BSL-4 labs' safety and security measures are commensurate with the level of risk these labs present; and (6) maintenance of high-containment labs to ensure integrity of physical infrastructure over time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss our preliminary findings on the  oversight of the expansion of high-containment biosafety level (BSL)-3 and  BSL-4 laboratories (labs) in the United States.

Confirmation of infection with brucellosis was made on April 16, 2006, by  the Texas State Public Health Lab\u201462 days after the exposure. During  much of this time, the worker had resumed her normal activities,  interacting with many people.", "In fact, the exposed lab worker had become seriously ill and the delay in  recognizing her infection as brucellosis aggravated her condition. Such  misdiagnosis is not uncommon with infectious diseases, as the initial  symptoms often appear flu-like and brucellosis is not generally endemic in  the population. If the worker had not recalled the experiment with  Brucella and alerted her physician to this fact, according to the CDC, she  might have developed an even more severe infection, possibly affecting  her central nervous system or the lining of her heart.", "In this incident, it was also fortunate that the disease was such that  transmission beyond the initial exposed individual was difficult and that  there were no risk of spread to the surrounding community. While  brucellosis is not easily transferred between humans, many agents cause  diseases that are easily transferred from human to human through  coughing or fluid transfer, including some agents that are not select  agents, such as SARS and tuberculosis.", "According to BMBL, the causative incident for most laboratory-acquired  infections is often unknown. It can only be concluded that an exposure  took place after a worker reports illness\u2014with symptoms suggestive of a  disease caused by the relevant agent\u2014some time later. Since clinical  symptoms can take weeks to become apparent, during which time an  infected person may be contagious, it is important that exposure be  identified as soon as possible and proper diagnosis and prompt medical  treatment provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addressing Confusion over the Definition of Exposure", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the incident of exposure to Brucella, the CDC noted several  incidents of potential exposure to Coxiella burnetii that TAMU had failed  to report. While the Brucella exposure eventually became apparent  because of clinical symptoms in the lab worker, the C. burnetii incidents  illustrate situations where the determination of exposure can be more  problematic. In attempting to address the failure to report, questions were  raised about what constitutes sufficient evidence of an exposure that the  entity must report to the CDC.", "One indication of exposure that can be used for C. burnetii and other  agents is to periodically measure the titer levels\u2014antibody levels\u2014within  the blood serum of lab workers working with those agents. If a person has  a raised level over his or her baseline level, then a conclusion can be  drawn that the person has been exposed to the agent. However, there are  issues with using titer levels as an indication of exposure. For example,  determining when the exposure took place is not straightforward.", "TAMU has a program of monitoring blood serum for workers with  C. burnetii\u2014a select agent and the causative agent for Q fever in humans.  While humans are very susceptible to Q fever, only about one-half of all  people infected with C. burnetii show signs of clinical illness. During the  CDC inspection, triggered by the uncovering of the Brucella incident, CDC  came across clinical records that showed that several lab workers were  found to have elevated titers for C. burnetii. But no reports had been sent  to the CDC. The CDC noted this issue and, on April 24, 2007, TAMU  submitted the required Form 3 to report the possible exposure.", "However, as a result of subsequent discussion with the individuals who  had the elevated titers, TAMU officials began to have doubts about  whether or not the elevated titers resulted from exposures that had  occurred at TAMU. In one case, TAMU said, one of the infected lab  workers had only recently been hired by TAMU but had worked in a  clinical lab in China, where C. burnetii was known to have been present.  In another, the worker claimed to have been exposed many years earlier  and had always registered high, although the actual levels varied. CDC  officials disagree with this interpretation and believe the high titers  resulted from exposures at TAMU.", "TAMU initially responded to the uncovering of the elevated titer incidents  by reporting, to the CDC, any subsequent elevated titer level uncovered in  any of their lab workers.  But TAMU is now unsure how to proceed. It has  notified the CDC that, in its opinion, an exposure suggested by an elevated  titer should be defined to have occurred only after clinical symptoms  appear in the individual. TAMU has, therefore, ceased reporting incidents  of merely elevated titers. In the absence of clarity over the definition of  exposure, TAMU officials have chosen to define it as they see fit.", "When we asked the CDC about the confusion over the definition of an  exposure, officials agreed that terms need to be clearly defined and are  drafting new guidance. CDC officials noted, however, that it is unwise to  wait until clinical symptoms appear before determining that an exposure  has taken place, as this could potentially endanger a worker\u2019s life and  potentially, in the case of a communicable disease, others.", "Experts have told us that correctly interpreting the meaning of elevated  titers\u2014whose characteristics can vary by agent, host, and testing lab\u2014is  challenging since many serological testing methods have not been  validated. Gaps in the scientific understanding of infectious diseases\u2014 such as the meaning of elevated titers\u2014may become more problematic as  the expansion of labs continues. The development of scientifically sound  and standardized methods of identifying exposure is critical, so that  individual lab owners are not left to determine for themselves what is and  what is not reportable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring that BSL-4 Labs\u2019 Safety and Security Measures Are Commensurate with the Level of Risk These Labs Present", "paragraphs": ["An hour-long power outage, in June 2007, at the CDC\u2019s newest BSL-4  facility raised questions about safety and security, as well as the backup  power system design. The incident showed that, even in the hands of  experienced owners and operators, safety and security of high- containment labs can still be compromised. The incident also raises  concerns about the security of other similar labs being built around the  nation.", "On June 8, 2007, the CDC campus in Atlanta experienced lightning strikes  in and around its new BSL-4 facility, and both primary and backup power  to that facility were unavailable. The facility was left with only battery  power\u2014a condition that provides limited power for functions such as  emergency lighting to aid in evacuation. Among other things, the outage  shut down the negative air pressure system, one of the important  components in place to keep dangerous agents from escaping the  containment areas. In looking into the power outage, the CDC determined  that, some time earlier, a critical grounding cable buried in the ground  outside the building had been cut by construction workers digging at an  adjacent site. The cutting of the grounding cable, which had gone  unnoticed by CDC facility managers, compromised the electrical system of  the facility that housed the BSL-4 lab.", "According to CDC officials, the new BSL-4 facility is still in preparation to  become fully operational and no live agents were inside the facility at the  time of the power outage. However, given that the cable was cut, it is  apparent that the construction was not supervised to ensure the integrity  of necessary safeguards that had been put in place.", "Further, according to CDC officials, it was not standard procedure to  monitor the integrity of the electrical grounding of the new BSL-4 facility.  However, CDC has now instituted annual testing of the electrical  grounding system.", "Because of the power outage incident, questions about the design of the  backup power system for the new facility resurfaced. When the CDC  designed the backup power system for the new BSL-4 facility, it used  backup generators at a central utility plant which serve other facilities, as  well as functions such as chillers, on campus besides the new BSL-4  facility. According to internal documents provided to us, during design  phase for the facility, some CDC engineers had questioned the remotely  placed, integrated design rather than a simpler design using local backup  generators near the facility.", "According to CDC facility officials, the full backup power capabilities for  the new BSL-4 facility are not in place yet, but are awaiting completion of  other construction projects on campus. Once these projects are  completed, these officials said, the new BSL-4 facility will have multiple  levels of backup power, including the ability to get power from a second  central utility plant on campus, if needed. But some CDC engineers that  we talked to questioned the degree of complexity in the design. They are  worried that an overly integrated backup might be more susceptible to  failure. As a result of this power outage incident, CDC officials said, the  CDC is doing a reliability assessment for the entire campus power system,  which will include the backup power design for the new BSL-4 facility.", "Some experts have suggested that BSL-4 labs be similar in design to a  nuclear power plant, with a redundant backup-to-backup power system,  along with adequate oversight. Like such plants, BSL-4 labs are considered  targets for terrorists and people with malicious intent. Release of an agent  from any of these labs could have devastating consequences.  Therefore,  appropriate design of labs and adequate oversight of any nearby  activities\u2014such as adjacent construction with its potential to compromise  buried utilities\u2014are essential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintenance of High- Containment Labs", "paragraphs": ["High-containment labs are highly sophisticated facilities, which require  specialized expertise to design, construct, operate, and maintain.

Supporting infrastructure, such as drainage and  waste treatment systems, must also be secure.", "In August 2007, contamination of foot-and-mouth disease was discovered  at several local farms near Pirbright in the U.K., the site of several high- containment labs that work with live foot-and-mouth disease virus. Foot- and-mouth disease is one of the most highly infectious livestock diseases  and can have devastating economic consequences. For example, a 2001  epidemic in the U.K. cost taxpayers over \u00a33 billion, including some \u00a31.4  billion paid in compensation for culled animals. Therefore, the U.K.  government officials worked quickly to contain and investigate this recent  incident.", "The investigation of the physical infrastructure at the Pirbright site found  evidence of long-term damage and leakage of the drainage system  servicing the site, including cracked and leaky pipes, displaced joints,  debris buildup, and tree root ingress. While the definitive cause of the  release has not been determined, it is suspected that contaminated waste  water from Pirbright\u2019s labs leaked into the surrounding soil from the  deteriorated drainage pipes and that live virus was then carried offsite by  vehicles splashed with contaminated mud.", "The cracked and leaky pipes found at Pirbright are indicative of poor  maintenance practice at the site. The investigation found that  (1) monitoring and testing for the preventative maintenance of pipework  for the drainage system was not a regular practice on site and (2) the  investigation found that a contributing factor might have been a difference  of opinion over responsibilities for maintenance of a key pipe within the  drainage system.", "High-containment labs are expensive to build and expensive to maintain.  Adequate funding for each stage needs to be addressed. Typically, in large- scale construction projects, funding for initial construction comes from  one source.  But funding for ongoing operations and maintenance comes  from somewhere else. For example, in the NIAID\u2019s recent funding of the  13 BSL-3 labs as RBLs and 2 BSL-4 labs as National Biocontainment Labs  (NBL), the NIAID contributed to the initial costs for planning, design,  construction, and commissioning. But the NIAID did not provide funding  to support the operation of these facilities. In this case, the universities  themselves are responsible for funding any maintenance costs after initial  construction.", "The Pirbright incident shows that beyond initial design and construction,  ongoing maintenance plays a critical role in ensuring that high- containment labs operate safely and securely over time.

Since the full  extent of the expansion is not known, it is unclear how the federal  government can ensure that sufficient but not superfluous capacity\u2014that  brings with it additional, unnecessary risk\u2014is being created.", "The limited federal oversight that does exist for high-containment labs is  fragmented among different federal agencies, and for the most part relies  on self-policing. The inherent weaknesses of an oversight system based on  self-policing are highlighted by the Texas A&M University case. While CDC  inspected the labs at Texas A&M in April 2006, as part of its routine  inspection, its inspectors failed to identify that (1) a worker became  exposed and ill; (2) unauthorized experiments were being conducted and  unauthorized individuals were entering the labs; and (3) agents and  infected animals were missing. It was not until a public advocacy group  found out about the Brucella incident and, according to this group, applied  pressure\u2014by demanding records about the incident\u2014that TAMU reported  this incident to the CDC. This report prompted the subsequent in-depth  investigations by the CDC.", "However, this incident raises serious concerns about (1) how well the  CDC polices select agent research being conducted in over 400 high- containment labs at various universities around the country, which are  registered under the Select Agent Program, and (2) whether the safety of  the public is compromised. Moreover, if similar safety breaches are  occurring at other labs, they are not being reported. And the CDC is not  finding them either.
