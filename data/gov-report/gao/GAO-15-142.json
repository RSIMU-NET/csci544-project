The study prepared for HRSA,  dated 2009, reported the responses from 107 petitioners whose claims  were compensated or dismissed in fiscal years 2004-2008. Because this  was a voluntary survey with a low response rate, its results cannot be  generalized to all petitioners who completed the VICP process; instead, it  reflects only the experience of the VICP petitioners who responded to the  survey. We also obtained comments from stakeholders, including  officials from organizations representing providers, petitioners\u2019 attorneys,  and parents. These stakeholder comments, while providing insight into  petitioner experiences, are anecdotal and do not represent the  experience of all petitioners who have filed VICP claims.

Similarly, one stakeholder said that petitioners view the vaccine injury  claims process as confusing, time-consuming, too lengthy, and  traumatic. Another stakeholder, on the other hand, commented that  while vaccine-related injuries do not happen often, the program  handles them efficiently and fairly when they do happen.", "Other comments from petitioners responding to the HRSA survey and  stakeholders were related to the payment process and amount of  compensation. More than half of the 61 petitioners who responded to  a question on the method of payment in the HRSA survey reported  being somewhat or very satisfied with the method of award payment;  however, 14 respondents suggested more timely and flexible payment  mechanisms. About half of the 63 respondents to the question on the  amount of compensation reported the award amount was inadequate  to cover past and future medical care. Similarly, stakeholders we  interviewed reported concerns with the amounts petitioners receive,  the method of payment, and a perceived lack of transparency  regarding how the money from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust  Fund has been spent. For example, one stakeholder told us that  petitioners felt forced to settle for less than what it will cost them to  care for their children or themselves for their lifetimes, and another  stakeholder raised concerns about the choice of annuities for  petitioners.", "Other comments on the program from stakeholders were related to  the perception of an adversarial or unfriendly environment throughout  the process, the use of settlements and perceived pressure to settle  claims, the use of omnibus proceedings to group claims together, and  concerns about confidentiality of the medical information filed by the  petitioner. Some petitioners responding to the HRSA survey and  some stakeholders also reported difficulties finding an attorney to  represent petitioners in the process; however, petitioners responding  to the survey were split on this issue\u2014about the same number  reported that finding an attorney was difficult as reported that finding  an attorney was easy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Is Taking Steps to Address Criticism of Its Efforts to Inform the Public of the Program", "paragraphs": ["HRSA has acknowledged being criticized for years for not adequately  promoting public awareness of VICP, and has recently taken some steps,  such as developing and starting to implement an outreach plan for fiscal  year 2014 and developing an outreach plan for fiscal year 2015, to  improve its efforts to reach out to providers and the public. In its 2006  VICP strategic plan, HRSA noted that one of the critical issues facing the  program from 2005 to 2010 was that many parents, the general public,  attorneys, and health care professionals were not aware VICP existed.  In 2009, HRSA contracted for the development of a comprehensive  national marketing and outreach communication plan; the contactor  presented the plan to HRSA in November 2010. According to HRSA,  the agency used this plan to guide outreach efforts. Prior to the fiscal  year 2014 plan, HRSA also reported exhibiting at professional  conferences; updating the VICP website and the VICP booklet that is  available from the website (including translating the booklet into Spanish);  facilitating the review of vaccine information statements (which include a  statement on VICP) by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines;  and responding to media inquiries and inquiries received via e-mail,  letters, and the program\u2019s toll-free number. HRSA officials also noted  the need to carefully balance messages that increase awareness of VICP  with public health messages that encourage and promote immunizations.", "HRSA shared an overview of its outreach plans with its Advisory  Commission on Childhood Vaccines in September 2014. HRSA reported  that many of the activities in the agency\u2019s 2014 outreach plan were in  process at the end of the fiscal year. These activities included reviewing  the VICP booklets to use plain language and make them more user- friendly, reviewing and upgrading the VICP website to improve navigation,  developing VICP message points for target audiences and slides about  the program to be used in speeches and other presentations by HRSA  staff, and requesting federal websites to provide information on the  program and to link to the VICP website. In its outreach plan for fiscal  year 2015, the agency is targeting health care providers, parents and  expectant parents, adults aged 50 years and older (including Spanish- speaking older adults), and civil litigation and health attorneys, with the  goal of informing target audiences of the availability of the program.  According to HRSA, these target audiences were selected because they  include individuals who administer vaccines and individuals (or their  caregivers) who receive vaccinations. HRSA has identified a number of  measures to assist in tracking performance of its fiscal year 2015 plan,  including website metrics, the number of \u201cretweets\u201d and \u201cshares\u201d from  social media initiatives, the number of media inquiries, and the number of  attendees or participants at outreach events. Because the agency has not  completed many of its planned efforts to improve how it informs the public  of the availability of the program, it is too early to determine the effect of  HRSA\u2019s current and planned outreach efforts.", "Without awareness of the program, individuals who might otherwise  receive compensation for a vaccine-related injury or death could be  denied compensation because of a failure to file their claim within the  statutory deadlines. One stakeholder commented that the public is largely  unaware of the program, and this lack of awareness contributes to  missing filing deadlines and individuals being denied the opportunity for  compensation. Members of the Advisory Commission on Childhood  Vaccines also told us that many individuals may not know there is a  statute of limitations on filing a claim and many miss the opportunity to file  a claim because of the statute of limitations. In December 2013, the  commission recommended extending the statute of limitations for  vaccine-related injuries and deaths. Extending the statute of limitations  would require amending the applicable statutory provision."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["It has been more than 25 years since VICP went into effect in 1988. In  that time, the program has awarded more than $2.8 billion to thousands  of petitioners. Several aspects of the program have changed over the  years. First, while claims alleging injuries on the vaccine injury table made  up the majority of claims filed in the first decade of the program, today\u2014 after the addition of new vaccines, particularly influenza vaccine, to the  table without associated injuries\u2014the majority of the claims filed involve  off-table injuries. Stakeholders report that the program has an adversarial  environment, as petitioners are required to demonstrate a covered  vaccine caused the injury on their VICP claim when there are no  associated injuries on the table. The extent to which this will change if  HHS updates the vaccine injury table to include more injuries, as  expected, is yet to be seen. Second, most of the compensated cases are  now adjudicated through negotiated settlement, rather than contested  decisions before the special master. And while the vaccines covered by  the program are included because they are recommended for children,  many of the program\u2019s petitioners in recent years are adults who received  covered vaccines.", "Addressing one criticism of the program by stakeholders\u2014specifically the  need to increase the statute of limitations\u2014would require a statutory  change in the program. Regardless of whether the statute of limitations is  increased, HHS\u2019s efforts to increase awareness of the availability of the  program will be important to help ensure that potential petitioners are  aware of the program and can file claims in time. While HHS has recently  taken or planned steps to improve its outreach activities, what effect, if  any, these efforts will have remains to be seen. As the agency moves  forward, it will be important for HRSA to identify which activities are  reaching its target audiences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS, DOJ, USCFC, and Treasury.

The court also  commented that, while considerable strides have been made in reducing  the average processing time for claims in recent years, the climbing and  changing nature of the caseload, coupled with the statutory cap on the  number of special masters, present a continuing challenge to the Office of  Special Masters\u2019 ability to continue to reduce average processing times.  USCFC also commented that following omnibus proceedings, claims  have been resolved more expeditiously in recent years, and often through  settlements.
