The Convention has been in force since 1996. GAO was asked to assess (1) parties' views on the benefits and limitations of the Convention, (2) efforts to improve implementation of the Convention, and (3) how International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programs complement the Convention's safety goals.

In particular, parties indicated that the Convention's obligations to (1) establish effective legislative and regulatory frameworks and strong, independent nuclear regulatory bodies and (2) prepare a national report every 3 years that describes the measures the country has taken to achieve the Convention's nuclear safety goals, are among its most useful contributions. The countries present their national reports at review meetings, address questions that may arise about the reports, and assess and ask questions about the reports of other parties. This is known as the peer review process. Some concerns were raised about limited public access to Convention proceedings, some countries' lack of resources to fully participate in the review meetings, and the absence of performance metrics in the national reports to gauge progress toward meeting safety goals and objectives. Half of the parties responding to GAO's survey stated that the lack of performance metrics limited the usefulness of the Convention. Neither the Department of State nor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has formally proposed the adoption of performance metrics. However, NRC officials told GAO that performance metrics could be useful. In addition, the number of parties posting their national reports to IAEA's public Web site has declined since 2005. NRC and Department of State officials told GAO that the United States has always made its national report available on the Internet. However, the U.S. approach has been to lead by example rather than taking an active role in encouraging other parties to post their reports. Further, universal participation would advance achievement of the Convention's goals. Several representatives from countries who are parties to the Convention told GAO that Iran should ratify the Convention. In their view, without Iran's participation, the international community has limited or no insight on, or access to, Iran's civilian nuclear power program. Russia, which is helping Iran build the nuclear reactor at Bushehr, may condition continued assistance on Iran becoming a party to the Convention, according to Russian officials. The parties have taken some actions to improve the Convention's implementation, and more proposals are being considered. Steps have been taken to make the process for asking questions during peer review meetings more open and to increase the amount of time available for preparing for the review meetings. IAEA nuclear safety programs, which predate the Convention, complement the Convention's safety goals through the Technical Cooperation program, safety standards, and peer review missions. The Technical Cooperation program supports, among other things, the development of nuclear power. IAEA has established nuclear safety standards and also promotes nuclear safety through peer review missions that evaluate the operations of a member state's nuclear regulatory system and nuclear power plant operational safety"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["There are currently 437 civilian nuclear power reactors operating in 29  countries, generating about 14 percent of the world\u2019s electricity, and 56  more nuclear power reactors are currently under construction. The safe  operation of nuclear power reactors worldwide has been a long-standing  concern of the international community. In the aftermath of the Chernobyl  accident, representatives of over 50 nations, including the United States,  participated in the development of the Convention on Nuclear Safety (the  Convention), a multilateral treaty that seeks to strengthen the safety of  civilian nuclear power reactors. Established in the mid-1990s, the  Convention seeks to achieve its safety objectives through countries\u2019  adherence to general safety principles rather than through technical  standards. Officials describe the Convention as incentive-oriented,  designed to maximize the number of countries that will support and sign  it, with the goal of making it acceptable and useful to countries with  potentially unsafe power reactors in Eastern Europe and the countries of  the former Soviet Union. According to U.S. officials, the main purpose of  the Convention is to get these countries, as well as developing nations, to  make commitments to improve their reactors and develop a safety  culture.", "Currently, 65 countries and 1 international organization are parties to the  Convention, including all countries that currently operate civilian nuclear  power reactors. For the purpose of this report, we refer to countries that  have ratified, accepted, or approved the Convention as parties. The United  States ratified the Convention in 1999.", "The Convention calls on parties to, among other things, (1) establish and  maintain a legislative framework and an independent regulatory body to  govern the safety of nuclear installations; (2) establish procedures to  ensure that technical aspects of safety, such as the siting, design,  construction, and operation of nuclear power reactors, are adequately  considered; (3) maintain an acceptable level of safety throughout the life  of the installations by, for example, considering safety to be a priority and  establishing a quality assurance program; and (4) prepare and routinely  test emergency plans. The Convention does not impose sanctions when  countries do not follow these safety principles.", "Under the terms of the Convention, each country\u2014regardless of whether  it operates nuclear power plants or not\u2014is required to submit a national  report that identifies the measures taken to implement each of the nuclear  safety obligations contained in the Convention. Obligations cover such  points as siting, design, construction, and operation of civilian nuclear  power installations. The parties to the Convention have also established  detailed guidance to help parties prepare their national reports. The  purpose of the guidance is to encourage parties to describe the steps they  are taking to meet the Convention\u2019s obligations and to facilitate other  parties\u2019 review of the national reports of other countries. The countries  meet every 3 years in Vienna, Austria, to present their national report,  address questions that may arise about the report, and assess and ask  questions about the reports of other parties. This is known as the peer  review process, and it is considered central to the Convention\u2019s success  because it is the means by which the parties assess the steps being taken  to meet safety obligations. As part of this peer review process, countries  meet in six groups composed primarily on the basis of the number of  reactors that each country operates. This process ensures that the six  countries with the most reactors\u2014the United States, France, Japan,  Russia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom\u2014are never in the same  group. Within this confidential group setting, all member countries have  the opportunity to examine and review what each country reports it is  doing to meet its nuclear safety obligations. These meetings are hosted by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which serves as the  Convention\u2019s secretariat and provides administrative support. To date,  four review meetings have taken place, and the fifth is scheduled for April  2011.", "The Convention has taken on increased significance in recent years as  countries are either expanding their existing nuclear power capacity or  planning to establish new programs. In 2009, IAEA estimated that by 2030  the world\u2019s capacity for nuclear electricity production will significantly  increase. Most of this increase in capacity is expected to occur in  countries that have established civilian nuclear power programs, such as  China, Japan, and South Korea. China, for example, has announced its  intention to spend $50 billion to build 32 new nuclear plants by 2020 and  currently has 21 plants under construction. Both India and Pakistan are  also moving forward with plans to significantly increase their production  of nuclear power, building plants that will more than double their  production of nuclear energy in the next decade.", "In addition, countries such as Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which  do not yet have civilian nuclear power programs, are actively moving to  build the necessary regulatory infrastructure for such programs as they  explore agreements with the world\u2019s leading nuclear reactor vendors. The  United Arab Emirates, for example, recently signed a $20 billion  agreement with a consortium of South Korean vendors to begin  construction of four 1,400-megawatt nuclear power reactors in 2012. Other  countries, such as Indonesia, Libya, Thailand, and Vietnam, have  expressed their intent to build civilian nuclear power plants. Still others,  such as Algeria, Belarus, Egypt, Nigeria, and Yemen, are considering  moving forward with civilian nuclear power programs.", "To assist Congress in its deliberations in the past, we identified some  limitations of the Convention. Specifically, we noted that (1) public  access to the peer review process was unclear and (2) the effectiveness the peer review process was uncertain because of concerns about how  well the country groups formed for peer review meetings would function. We also pointed out that the Convention lacked an enforcement  mechanism.", "Now that the Convention has been in force for more than a decade, you  y goal:  asked us to evaluate the extent to which it is achieving its primar promoting the safe operation of civilian nuclear power reactors  worldwide. Accordingly, we assessed (1) parties\u2019 views on the perceived  benefits and limitations of the Convention, (2) efforts to improve implementation of the Convention, and (3) how IAEA progr complement the Convention\u2019s safety goals and objectives.", "To assess parties\u2019 views on the perceived benefits and limitations of the Convention for improving the safety of civilian nuclear power reactors  worldwide, we administered a Web-based survey\u2014which can be v GAO-10-550SP\u2014to 64 parties to the Convention and analyzed the  responses of the 32 that completed it. This report does not contain all th results from the survey. To assess the potential for nonrespo our survey results, we compared selected characteristics of  nonresponding countries, such as (1) length of time as a party to the  Convention, (2) nuclear power status and number of nuclear power pla (3) region, (4) countries that operate Soviet-designed reactors, and (5)  European Union (EU) membership, to those of the responding parties. The  distribution of these characteristics among responding and nonrespond ing  parties was well-balanced. To encourage respondents to complete the  survey, we sent an e-mail reminder to each nonrespondent about 2 week s  after our initial e-mail message and followed up with additional e- and telephone calls. Additionally, to encourage honest and open  responses, in the introduction to the survey, we pledged that we would  report information in the aggregate and not report data that could identify  a particular respondent. We also interviewed representatives of 17 nucl ear  and nonnuclear parties to the Convention, including officials from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Department of State  (State) who represent the United States at the Convention. Of the 17 we  interviewed, 9 completed the survey, and 8 did not. In total, we obtai ned  the views of 40 parties to the Convention. We also analyzed various  Convention-related documents from NRC and State as well as from I and the EU. To assess efforts to improve the implementation of the  Convention, we reviewed Convention documents and interviewed NRC  and State officials who have attended Convention organizational, workin group, and review meetings where such efforts have been discussed. To  assess the extent to which IAEA programs complement the Convention\u2019s  safety goals and objectives, we analyzed, among other things, Conventio minutes of meetings and rules of procedure. We also interviewed IAEA  officials, U.S. officials at the U.S. Missions in Vienna and Brussels, and the representatives of 17 parties to the Convention. To determine the cost t the United States to participate in the Convention and IAEA\u2019s cost support the Convention for one 3-year cycle, we analyzed budget s to  information from NRC, State, and IAEA. We also assessed the reliability of the data we obtained and interviewed knowledgeable NRC, Department of Energy (DOE), State, EU, and IAEA officials on the reliability of the data.  s  We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report.

For example, as we previou sly  reported, the United States and 20 other countries and internationa organizations contributed $1.9 billion to improve nuclear safety in  countries operating Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. The United States  alone has spent over $770 million since the Chernobyl accident on nuclear  safety assistance to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia, and several  other countries through DOE and NRC programs. According to an agency  official, DOE\u2019s nuclear safety assistance programs have focused on  physical safety enhancements to Soviet-designed reactors, while NRC has  worked to increase the capacity and stature of recipient countries\u2019  regulatory bodies to ensure the continuing operational safety of such  reactors. In addition, a separate fund was established to help stabilize the  damaged reactor at Chernobyl by constructing a new containment  structure. As we reported, the estimated cost of this effort was $1.2 billion  as of 2007, of which the United States pledged $203 million. Since 1991  the EU has spent over $1.9 billion on international nuclear safety  assistance. See appendix II for more information about U.S. and EU  expenditures to promote international nuclear safety. These expenditures  are not used to support the implementation of the Convention.

The NEA, for example, has created several specialized  committees to facilitate exchanges of technical information and to  organize joint research projects to improve national safety practices.  WENRA works to develop common approaches to nuclear safety among  the chief nuclear regulators in Europe. ENSREG, among other things, aims  to maintain and continuously improve the safety of nuclear installations in  the EU. In June 2009, the EU adopted a directive creating a framework f or  (1) maintaining and promoting the continuous improvement of nuclear  safety and its regulation and (2) ensuring that EU member states prov high level of nuclear safety to protect workers and the public against  radiation from nuclear installations.

In all, these parties operate  404\u2014or more than 92 percent\u2014of the world\u2019s 437 operating civilian  nuclear power reactors. In addition, we also interviewed representatives  from IAEA member states, nuclear regulatory organizations, and the EU  (17 in all) who expressed similar views about the Convention. Survey  respondents and parties we interviewed identified several Convention  obligations as having helped strengthen the safety of civilian nuclear  power programs. The obligations cited most frequently were (1)  establishing an effective legislative and regulatory framework (laws and  regulations) and a strong, effective, and independent nuclear regulatory  body and (2) preparing a national report every 3 years that describes the  measures the country has taken to achieve the Convention\u2019s safety goals.", "In addition, some of the 17 parties we interviewed stated that the  Convention has contributed to and promoted the independence and  effectiveness of their country\u2019s nuclear regulatory bodies. For example, an  Austrian nuclear regulator told us he thought that this promotion of  effective regulatory capacity is one of the Convention\u2019s greatest  contributions to international nuclear safety. Moreover, representatives of  China and Pakistan told us that the Convention was influential in leading  their countries to increase the independence and effectiveness of their  nuclear regulators. NRC officials expressed a similar view, noting that  parties to the Convention have taken many steps to develop more effective  laws and regulations and increase the capacities and independence of  their nuclear regulators.", "The requirement to prepare a national report describing the steps parties  have taken to meet the Convention\u2019s nuclear safety obligations also plays a  large role in strengthening the safety of civilian nuclear power programs,  according to survey respondents. Almost all survey respondents indicated  that the presentation of national reports in country groups was a very or  somewhat effective way for sharing best safety practices. Most survey  respondents reported that preparing the national report has either greatly  or somewhat improved opportunities to examine their country\u2019s civilian  nuclear power program. A number of parties we interviewed also said that  this national report has been helpful in strengthening nuclear safety  worldwide. NRC officials told us one effect of a national report is that  nuclear regulators and plant operators are forced to think about even  routine safety procedures and policies because the reports will be  scrutinized by their peers. For example, as a result of questions raised by  other parties on the national report prepared for the 2008 review meeting,  the United States agreed to discuss with state governments and NRC  licensees the benefits and costs of adopting stricter standards for  protecting nuclear power plant workers and the public from exposure to  radiation.", "In our survey, we also asked some additional questions about parties\u2019  perceptions about how the peer review process affected the preparation of  the 2008 reports. Specifically, among other things, we asked how likely  parties thought reports were to include (1) comprehensive, detailed  descriptions of measures taken to strengthen safety; (2) evidence that  safety issues discussed in one review meeting were revisited in the next  meeting and that the actions taken to address the issues were discussed in  sufficient detail for parties to evaluate whether the safety concerns had  been adequately addressed; and (3) sufficient technical detail to  understand specific safety concerns. In each case, most survey  respondents indicated that they thought reports were very or somewhat  likely to include such information. We also asked how effectively the peer  review process encouraged parties to provide detailed information in their  2008 national reports.

There was  wide agreement among the survey respondents that the Convention has  improved communication among nuclear regulators; nuclear power plant  operators; and other national organizations involved in the civilian nuclear  power industry, such as, in the case of the United States, the Institute of  Nuclear Power Operations (INPO). More than half of the respondents to  our survey indicated the Convention had \u201cgreatly\u201d improved  communication about safety issues affecting civilian nuclear power  reactors. Most respondents to our survey agreed that the Convention had  improved opportunities for sharing technical solutions to improve safety,  such as reactor design improvements or fire safety enhancements. Russian  and Ukrainian officials we spoke to provided examples of how the  Convention has led to the sharing of nuclear safety information. Following  are some examples:    Russian nuclear regulatory officials told us that the Convention has played  a useful role in promoting technical solutions to problems shared by  countries operating similar types of reactors. Specifically, Russia and  Finland have been developing a system to improve communication  between their plant operators based on discussions that began with  contacts made at Convention review meetings.", "A Ukrainian official told us his country\u2019s participation in the Convention  has increased other countries\u2019 awareness of the safety problems  confronting Ukraine\u2019s aging Soviet-designed nuclear reactors.

Currently, only summary  information of the peer review meeting is released to the public. This  summary provides a brief introduction containing background on the  Convention, an overview of the review process, and a synopsis of what the  parties agree were the most important points discussed at the meeting. For  example, the public report on the fourth review meeting, which took place  in 2008, briefly summarizes the discussions of the parties on many topics  discussed at the meeting, including parties\u2019 efforts to meet the challenges  of maintaining adequate staffing and competence levels and ongoing  concerns about the degree of independence of some parties\u2019 regulatory  bodies.

In July 2009, in written responses to our questions, French  officials stated that parties to the Convention should consider making the  opening and closing sessions of review meetings open to the media.  Further, a Norwegian official we spoke with suggested that some  nongovernmental organizations should be allowed to attend review  meetings as observers.", "One way that some parties have attempted to increase public access to the  Convention\u2019s proceedings is by posting their national reports and answers  to written questions received on their national reports to IAEA\u2019s public  Web site. While the number of parties to the Convention making their  national reports available in this way has increased since the first review  meeting was held in 1999, it has not increased significantly in several years  and actually declined between the third review meeting in 2005 and the  fourth review meeting in 2008. Specifically, 26 parties\u2014about 43 percent  of the 60 parties for whom the Convention had come into force by the due  date for submitting the national report\u2014posted their national report  prepared for the 2008 review meeting. This was down from the 30  parties\u2014or about 55 percent of parties to the Convention\u2014 posting  reports prepared for the 2005 review meeting.

However, the U.S.  approach has been to lead by example rather than taking an active role in  encouraging other parties to the Convention to post their national reports  to the Internet. IAEA officials told us it was important for parties to make  as much information about their civilian nuclear power programs  accessible as possible, but that it was for each party to determine how  much information should be made public and how much should remain  confidential. In addition to its public Web site, IAEA also maintains a  secure, members-only Web site where parties are encouraged to post their  national reports. According to NRC officials, parties have improved their  participation in posting their reports to this Web site. Parties posted 17, 22,  57, and 61 national reports in 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008, respectively.", "The overwhelming majority of parties have never posted their answers to  written questions about their nuclear power programs to the IAEA public  Web site. The written questions and answers provide a great deal of  information about each country\u2019s nuclear power program. According to an  IAEA official, over 4,000 questions were prepared for the 2008 review  meeting, and almost all were answered. As figure 2 shows, 3 countries  posted these questions and answers to the IAEA public Web site for the  first review meeting in 1999. While 11 countries posted questions and their  answers to the IAEA\u2019s public Web site for the second review meeting,  including the United States, 6 did so for the third review meeting, and 5 did  so for the 2008 meeting. Only Slovenia and Switzerland\u2014both nuclear  power countries\u2014have posted these questions and answers for all four  meetings; the United Kingdom and Canada\u2014 the sixth and eighth largest  nuclear power countries as measured by the number of operating reactors,  respectively\u2014have done so since 2002. The United States had not posted  its answers to written questions received on its national report to IAEA\u2019s  public Web site since 2002, although NRC officials stated that they have  always posted them to the NRC Web site. We also found that other nuclear  power countries such as Finland, Germany, Japan, and Spain have not  posted their answers to written questions to the IAEA\u2019s public Web site  since 2002, either.

As we noted in our March 1999 testimony, NRC officials  anticipated this lack of staff resources and/or travel money could be a  problem. We reported that NRC officials told us that, because of  differences in parties\u2019 nuclear safety programs and available resources,  they anticipated unevenness in the quality and detail of some national  reports. In addition, half of the parties responding to our survey reported  that a lack of resources has limited their ability to attend review meetings,  and more than three-quarters indicated that a lack of resources has  inhibited their ability to send representatives to all of the country group  meetings. According to NRC officials, this is important because the  country groups meet simultaneously, and it is in these meetings where the  national reports are presented and questions about them are addressed.", "Not being able to attend country group meetings reduces opportunities to  learn from other parties\u2019 nuclear safety experiences. In addition, NRC  officials recently told us that since much of the peer review of national  reports can occur in the 7 months before the review meeting, limited  resources may reduce the ability of some parties to take full advantage of  this opportunity.

The guidelines can be revised by consensus at review meetings.  The guidelines provide only suggestions for drafting the reports; parties  remain free to structure their reports as they see fit. However, the  suggestions provided are very detailed and touch upon more than just  form and structure.

These reactors pose the highest risk,  according to Western safety experts, because of their inherent design  deficiencies, including their lack of a containment structure. The  containment structure, generally a steel-lined concrete dome, serves as the  ultimate barrier to the release of radioactive material in the event of a  severe accident. Russian nuclear regulators told us that adequate safety  upgrades have been made to all 11 RBMK reactors and that they will  continue to operate for the foreseeable future. We also discussed the  matter of shutdown of Soviet-designed reactors with EU officials, who told  us that the Convention was never intended to be a mechanism for closing  unsafe Soviet-designed reactors. The European Union has used a different  strategy to accomplish shutdown of the unsafe nuclear reactors in its  member countries: making EU membership contingent upon the closure of  these reactors. As a result, all eight RBMK and first-generation VVER 440  Model 230 reactors in Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Slovakia have been  permanently shut down in order for these countries to obtain EU  membership.", "According to NRC officials, as is the case in other international law on  reactor safety, under the Convention each country is responsible for  regulating the safety of its own reactors.

The importance of its role in providing this type of assistance  was corroborated by our survey results. A majority of survey respondents  reported that IAEA was either very effective or somewhat effective in  serving as a technical advisor to countries requesting assistance to  improve civilian nuclear power safety. IAEA\u2019s TC program supports,  among other things, nuclear safety and the development of nuclear  power. For the 2009-2011 activities under the TC program, nuclear safety  remains one of the top three priorities for IAEA member states. IAEA  currently conducts 551 TC projects in 115 countries and territories, and  program activities are tailored to the needs of each region. Specific TC  projects have included activities to extend the operating life of nuclear  power plants and establishing safety culture in nuclear facilities. TC  projects that support member states considering or developing nuclear  power also include strengthening nuclear regulatory authorities and  preparing an emergency plan for a nuclear power plant. In 2007, IAEA  disbursed approximately $5.6 million to support the safety of civilian  nuclear installations worldwide through the TC program. In addition to its  TC program budget, IAEA plans to spend approximately $15.1 million in  2010 on other efforts to promote nuclear safety, such as strengthening  countries\u2019 abilities to respond to nuclear incidents and emergencies and to  assess the safety of the siting and design of nuclear installations. The role  and importance of IAEA in promoting nuclear safety will likely grow if the  cost of fossil fuels and the threat of climate change spur a nuclear  renaissance, as an independent commission assessing the role of IAEA to  2020 and beyond reported recently. According to this independent  commission, this growing role may involve (1) leading an international  effort to establish a global nuclear safety network, (2) helping countries  with emerging nuclear power programs put in place the infrastructure  needed to develop nuclear energy safely, and (3) ensuring that critical  safety knowledge is widely shared among IAEA member states.", "In addition, IAEA has established safety standards that provide a  framework for fundamental safety principles, requirements, and guidance  for member states. The standards, which reflect international consensus,  cover a wide range of topics, including nuclear power plant design and  operation, site evaluation, and emergency preparedness and response.  Committees of senior experts from IAEA member states use an open and  transparent process to develop the standards and any subsequent  revisions. The guidelines governing the drafting of national reports state  that IAEA safety standards can give valuable guidance on how to meet the  Convention\u2019s safety obligations.", "IAEA also promotes nuclear safety through advisory and voluntary peer  review missions\u2014the most prominent are Integrated Regulatory Review  Service (IRRS) missions and Operational Safety Review Team (OSART)  missions. These missions evaluate the operations of a member state\u2019s  nuclear regulatory system and civilian nuclear power plant operational  safety, respectively. IRRS missions assess the safety practices of the  requesting country through an examination of its regulatory framework  and organization and compare the country\u2019s practices with IAEA safety  standards. Since 1992, IAEA has conducted 44 IRRS missions in 26  countries, with 15 of these missions taking place in countries that have  operated\u2014and in some cases continue to operate\u2014Soviet-designed  reactors. Table 1 shows the number of IRRS missions that member  countries had hosted through 2009. The United States has sent  approximately 20 experts on IRRS missions and has agreed to host an  IRRS mission in October 2010.", "Some parties that responded to our survey reported that they found IRRS  and OSART missions effective at improving civilian nuclear power safety.  In addition, according to the summary report of the Convention\u2019s fourth  meeting in 2008, many parties reported that they had positive experiences  with IRRS and OSART missions, and parties who had not already hosted  one of these missions were encouraged to do so. In February and March  2010, IAEA conducted an IRRS mission to Iran, which included a site visit  to the nearly completed Bushehr nuclear power plant. IAEA  recommended, among other things, that Iran join the Convention.", "According to a senior Swedish official who was involved in drafting the  Convention, these missions are increasingly being used to measure the  safety standards of parties to the Convention. Parties face peer pressure to  submit to these voluntary missions, as they provide a way for a country to  show its commitment to enhancing safety. For example, ENSREG has  promoted the use of IRRS missions by EU countries. Describing the  missions as \u201cwell established and well respected,\u201d ENSREG has  encouraged all EU member states to participate in one to obtain advice on  improvements and to learn from the best practices of others.", "IAEA also manages the OSART missions through which teams of experts  drawn from IAEA member countries\u2014including the United States, which  has sent over 100 experts on missions\u2014review operational safety at  specific nuclear power plants. IAEA has conducted over 150 OSART  missions in 32 countries since 1983, and has 9 more scheduled through the  end of 2011. Table 2 shows the number of OSART missions that member  countries had hosted through 2009.", "As table 2 shows, the 2 countries that have hosted the most OSART  missions are France and Ukraine, 21 and 14, respectively. Combined, those  2 countries have 73 reactors. China and the Czech Republic have hosted  the second most missions, 10 and 8, respectively. These countries have a  combined total of 17 operating reactors. Japan, which has 54 reactors, has  hosted 5 OSART missions. Russia, which has 32 operating reactors, has  hosted 6, and the United States, which has 104 operating reactors, has also  hosted 6 missions. The only countries with operating civilian nuclear  power programs that have not hosted OSART missions are Armenia and  India, which operate 1 and 18 reactors, respectively.", "While recommendations that result from safety review services such as  IRRS and OSART missions are not mandates, IAEA officials told us that  the agency nevertheless sees a high rate of implementation of those  recommendations. IAEA also makes available on its public Web site a  compilation of best practices learned from recent OSART missions, as well  as the mission reports as authorized by the member states. This  compilation serves to help member states improve the operational safety  of their power plants and includes emergency plans and preparedness,  training, and maintenance.", "Finally, IAEA also promotes civilian nuclear safety through other means.  For example, IAEA offers additional review services to member states by  focusing on issues such as siting, seismic safety, research reactor safety,  fuel cycle facilities\u2019 safety, power plant accident management, and safety  culture assessments. IAEA also promotes education and training in  nuclear safety through Web-based courses, electronic textbooks, and  workshops. This training covers topics such as basic safety concepts,  regulatory control of nuclear power plants, and instruction on IAEA safety  standards. Much of this information is available to the public to download  from IAEA\u2019s Web site. One survey respondent from Eastern Europe  commented that the training courses and workshops had contributed  significantly to the promotion of high safety standards and best practices.  Moreover, IAEA regularly holds conferences and symposia on issues  related to nuclear safety, with some event summaries available online.

This report does  not contain all the results from the survey; the survey and a more complete  tabulation of the results are provided in an electronic supplement to this  report (this supplement can be viewed online at GAO-10-550SP).", "To assess how IAEA programs complement the Convention\u2019s safety goals  and objectives, we analyzed budget and other relevant documents from  the Convention, such as meeting minutes and rules of procedure. We also  interviewed IAEA officials; U.S. officials at the U.S. Missions in Vienna and  Brussels; and the representatives of 17 parties to the Convention in  Vienna, Brussels, Moscow, and Washington, D.C. To determine the amount  of money the United States has spent promoting nuclear safety from the  early 1990s through September 30, 2009, we obtained expenditure  information from DOE and NRC. To assess the reliability of the  information provided, we interviewed knowledgeable officials from each  agency to understand (1) how they had developed the estimates and   (2) what supporting documentation had been used to develop them; we  determined the information provided was sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To determine the amount of money the EU has spent promoting  nuclear safety from 1991 through 2006, and the amount they have  budgeted to spend from 2007 to 2013, we obtained budget information  from EU officials. However, the reliability of these EU estimates is  undetermined because we did not receive responses to our data reliability  questions. Given these limitations, we characterize these costs as  estimates, and we use them only as background. Because the EU budget  information was provided in euros, we converted the original values to  dollars. In all instances, when converting euros to dollars, we used  nominal and purchasing power parity average annual exchange rates from  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. When  converting euro values for future projections into dollars, we used the  latest available annual exchange rate. In addition, to determine the amount  of money IAEA has budgeted for nuclear safety in 2010, we obtained  information from the agency\u2019s Programme and Budget for 2010-11. These  IAEA budget figures\u2014which we converted to dollars from euros\u2014are also  of undetermined reliability because we were unable to obtain sufficient  detail about how they developed the estimates or the data sources that  supported them. To determine the cost to the United States to participate  in the Convention, and IAEA\u2019s costs to support the Convention for one   3-year cycle, we obtained expenditure information from NRC, State, and  IAEA. To assess the reliability of this information, we also interviewed  knowledgeable officials from each agency to understand (1) how they had  developed the estimates and (2) what supporting documentation had been  used to develop them.  We determined the information provided by NRC  was sufficiently reliable for our purposes. However, the reliability of the  State and IAEA information is undetermined. The reliability of State  estimates are unknown because staff typically combined work and travel  related to the Convention with other work duties, so it is not possible to  accurately determine the amount of money spent exclusively on  Convention participation. IAEA estimates\u2014which we converted to dollars  from euros\u2014are of undetermined reliability because they do not formally  track costs to run the review meetings.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 to April 2010, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Glen Levis, Assistant Director;  Dr. Timothy Persons, Chief Scientist; Antoinette Capaccio; Frederick  Childers; Nancy Crothers; Bridget Grimes; Kirsten Lauber; Rebecca Shea;  and Kevin Tarmann made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
