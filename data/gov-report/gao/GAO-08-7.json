In this context, GAO examined (1) the rationale for and resources of federal and state programs that provide natural catastrophe insurance; (2) the extent to which Americans living in catastrophe-prone areas of the United States are uninsured and underinsured, and the types and amounts of federal payments to such individuals since the 2005 hurricanes; and (3) public policy options for revising the federal role in natural catastrophe insurance markets. To address these questions, GAO analyzed state and federal programs, examined studies of uninsured and underinsured homeowners and federal payments to them, identified and analyzed policy options, and interviewed officials from private and public sectors in both high- and low-risk areas of the United States. GAO also developed a four-goal framework to help analyze the available options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The federal government and some states have developed natural catastrophe insurance programs that supplement or substitute for private natural catastrophe insurance. These programs were created because homeowner coverage for catastrophic events is often not available from private insurers at prices deemed affordable by insurance regulators. Large losses associated with natural catastrophes are some of the biggest exposures that insurers face. Particularly in catastrophe-prone locations, government insurance programs have tended not to charge premiums that reflect the actual risks that homeowners face, resulting in financial deficits. After a resource-depleting disaster, the programs have postfunded themselves through, among other sources, payments from insurance companies and policyholders and appropriations from state and federal taxpayers. Large numbers of Americans are not insured for natural catastrophes. Homeowners may not purchase natural catastrophe insurance because doing so is voluntary and they may not believe that the risk justifies the expenditure. In addition, some homes may be underinsured--that is, not insured for the full replacement value. GAO estimates that the federal government made about $26 billion available to homeowners who lacked adequate insurance in response to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Given the unsustainable fiscal path of federal and state governments, they will be challenged to maintain their current fiscal role. As Congress reevaluates the role of the federal government in insuring for natural catastrophes, Congress is faced with balancing the often-competing goals of ensuring that citizens are protected and limiting taxpayer exposure. This report examines seven public policy options for changing the federal government's role, including establishing an all-perils homeowner insurance policy, providing reinsurance for state catastrophe funds, and creating a mechanism to provide federal loans for state catastrophe funds. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, especially when weighed against competing public policy goals. For example, establishing an all-perils homeowner policy is a private sector approach that could help create broad participation. But low-income residents living in parts of the United States with high catastrophe risk could require subsidies, resulting in costs to the government. Similarly, federal reinsurance for state programs could lead to broader coverage, but could displace private reinsurance. GAO also identified several policy options for tax-based incentives for insurance companies, homeowners, investors, and state governments. But these options, which could help recipients better address catastrophe risk, could also result in ongoing costs to taxpayers. While some options would address the public policy goals of charging risk-based rates, encourage broad participation, or promote greater private sector participation, these policy goals need to be balanced with the desire to make rates affordable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Natural disasters not only devastate communities and individuals but also  are costly to insurers, state governments, and the federal government. As  the 2005 hurricane season showed, costs associated with a large natural  disaster, such as a hurricane or major earthquake, can be enormous. Aside  from the human toll, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma caused insured  losses of an estimated $56.5 billion and total economic losses\u2014including  both insured and uninsured losses\u2014of more than $100 billion. The federal  government alone has appropriated more than $88 billion for disaster relief  and recovery from the 2005 hurricanes. Future disasters could be even  more expensive. One catastrophe modeling firm estimates that a large  hurricane in southeast Florida could cause insured losses of more than  $130 billion and a total economic loss of more than $260 billion. Similarly,  if San Francisco\u2019s 1906 earthquake were to be repeated today, it is  estimated that it would cause insured losses of more than $70 billion and a  total economic loss of more than $280 billion. Also, a rupture of the Puente  Hills fault in the Los Angeles basin could lead to estimated insured losses of  more than $140 billion and a total economic loss of more than $500 billion.", "As we reported earlier in 2007, large losses associated with natural  catastrophes are some of the biggest exposures that property and casualty  insurers face. To remain financially solvent, these companies must  estimate and prepare for the potential impact of such events. Because of  the increased risk of natural catastrophes and the challenges of predicting  losses from them, insurance companies have started limiting both renewals  of existing contracts and the writing of new contracts in catastrophe-prone  regions of the United States, such as coastal areas (from Massachusetts to  Texas), earthquake zones in California, and the Mississippi River area of  the central United States along the New Madrid earthquake fault.", "Such events place enormous stress on insurance markets and  governments, carry huge costs, and have raised concerns about who  ultimately bears the costs and receives the benefits of government disaster  insurance programs. For these reasons, debate has arisen about the  appropriate role for the federal government in insuring against and in  recovering from natural catastrophes. While many public policy observers  agree that the federal government does and should play an integral role in  disaster relief and infrastructure recovery, some other public policy  observers have asked whether the government\u2019s current role is the most  appropriate and have suggested alternatives. Some have argued for more  federal involvement, but others believe that the federal government may be  doing too much, crowding out private insurance and reducing the private  market\u2019s ability and willingness to provide insurance-based solutions.  Public policy observers have raised moral hazard concerns, noting that  generous federal disaster relief may discourage homeowners from  purchasing natural catastrophe insurance. These observers have also  pointed out that government catastrophe insurance programs are  vulnerable to adverse selection, in that homeowners who are at the most  risk are also the most likely to buy catastrophe insurance.", "In the context of your concerns about finding ways to ensure that the  federal government and the private sector each play an appropriate role in  the provision of natural catastrophe insurance, we examined (1) the  rationale for and resources of the federal and state programs that have  supplemented or substituted for private natural catastrophe insurance and  their funding; (2) the extent to which Americans living in catastrophe- prone areas of the United States are uninsured and underinsured and the  federal payments that have been made to such individuals since the 2005  hurricanes; and (3) public policy options for revising the federal role in  natural catastrophe insurance markets.", "We reviewed or analyzed documents on federal and state catastrophe  insurance programs, the numbers of uninsured and underinsured and  federal payments that have been made, options to redefine the federal role  in natural catastrophe insurance, and goals that could be used as a basis for  designing and evaluating options for change. We interviewed officials from  public interest groups, insurance companies, reinsurance companies,  insurance agents, insurance brokers, insurance and reinsurance  associations, insurance agent associations, state catastrophe insurance and  reinsurance plans, state insurance departments, state economic  development departments, the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC), the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Risk Management Agency, the Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD), the Small Business Administration (SBA),  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, rating agencies, risk modeling organizations,  academia, law firms, a hedge fund, an insurance research organization, a  private research organization, a consumer group, and others. To determine  the mechanisms that governments use to supplement or substitute for  private catastrophe insurance markets, we collected oral and documentary  information from public and private officials in various states with high and  low catastrophe risk and from Washington, D.C. To determine the number  of uninsured and underinsured Americans and payments made to such  individuals after the 2005 hurricanes, we collected information from states,  examined federal agency data, interviewed federal officials who prepared  these data, sought information from the private sector, and interviewed  state officials responsible for disbursing federal disaster funds. Data on the  numbers and amounts of money going to the uninsured and underinsured  were incomplete and had a number of limitations, which are described in  appendix I. We determined that these data were sufficient for the purposes  of this engagement.", "We identified various options for altering the role of the federal government  in catastrophe insurance by looking at bills before the current and previous  Congresses as well as other options that were not included in current  legislative proposals\u2014for example, a proposal before a committee of  NAIC. After fieldwork for this report concluded, we were informed that  additional public policy options not considered in this report were being  discussed before a committee of NAIC. We sought out both supporters and  critics of each option, and our discussion of the third objective presents  mainly advantages and disadvantages that they have identified. We  developed a four-goal framework that was based on challenges faced by  current government natural catastrophe insurance programs and used the  framework to analyze current options for changing the federal role in  natural catastrophe insurance. We developed these goals by drawing  insights from the following: past GAO work, legislative histories of laws  that changed the roles of state governments and the federal government  after disasters, bills before the current and previous Congresses, interviews  with public and private sector officials, and refereed articles written by  academics in insurance economics. Although we identified numerous  possible goals that could assist our analysis, we believe the four goals that  we chose accurately capture the essential concerns of the federal  government. The congressional policy choices ahead involve striking an  appropriate balance among these goals.", "The scope of our work covered hurricane and earthquake perils. We did not  investigate tornado, hail, or other perils, such as wildfires. We focused on  the property and casualty insurance line, especially homeowners  insurance. In reporting on the amount of federal disaster assistance to  individuals who lacked adequate insurance in the Gulf Coast states  following the 2005 hurricanes, we attempted to identify payments to  homeowners only. However, because in some instances we could not  separate out payments to renters, we included payments to both  homeowners and renters in some of our calculations. Judgments about  whether market failure did or did not exist in any particular state\u2019s property  and casualty insurance market\u2014and whether the cost of doing something  about it was or was not more expensive than the federal government\u2019s not  acting\u2014were outside the scope of this report. Appendix I contains  additional details of our objectives, scope, and methodology. We did  fieldwork in Alabama; California; Connecticut; Florida; Illinois; Indiana;  Louisiana; Massachusetts; Mississippi; Missouri; New York; Ohio; Texas;  and Washington, D.C.

Moreover, the total coastal population increased by 33 million people, or   28 percent, between 1980 and 2003. California led in coastal population  change, with the number of residents increasing by 9.9 million people.  Florida showed the greatest percentage population change between 1980  and 2003, increasing nearly 75 percent. The nation\u2019s coastal population is  expected to increase by more than 7 million people by 2008 (over current  levels) and by 12 million people by 2015.", "The housing supply in coastal areas also continues to grow, despite the  high risk of earthquakes and hurricanes. NOAA reported that coastal  counties contained 52 percent of the nation\u2019s total housing supply in 2000.  The leading states in terms of total housing units in coastal counties were  California, Florida, and New York, which together have 41 percent of the  total housing supply in these counties. One study put the estimated insured  value of coastal property in states bordering the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of  Mexico at $7.2 trillion as of December 2004. As shown in figure 2,  properties along the Pacific and North-Atlantic Coasts and the Gulf of  Mexico have some of the highest insured property values.

Similarly, earthquake coverage is  commonly excluded from homeowners insurance contracts and instead is  sold separately by insurance companies or, in the case of California,  through a state-managed program.", "The price of property and casualty insurance is affected by both the annual  expected loss and the cost of diversifying the risk of catastrophic losses.  Insurers can diversify the risk of catastrophic losses by, among other  things, purchasing reinsurance, which is insurance for insurance  companies, or by selling financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds.  Insurance companies do not know in advance what their actual costs are  going to be, because they can determine these costs only after a policy has  expired. The insurer\u2019s objectives are to calculate premiums that will make  the business profitable, enable the company to compete effectively with  other insurers, and allow the company to pay claims and expenses as they  occur.", "When insurers, reinsurers, and investors in catastrophe financial  instruments perceive that the expected frequency or severity of natural  catastrophes has increased, they may increase the price of insurance.

State insurance  commissioners are responsible for regulating rates, monitoring the  availability of insurance, and assessing insurance firms\u2019 solvency. The  insurance regulators of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S.  territories have created NAIC to coordinate regulation of multistate  insurers. NAIC serves as a forum for the development of uniform policy,  and its committees develop model laws and regulations that, when adopted  by state legislatures or promulgated by state regulators, govern the U.S.  insurance industry.", "Critics of state insurance regulation argue that insurance prices and terms  of coverage, particularly for homeowners insurance in areas prone to  natural catastrophes, are highly regulated and that the insurance industry is  generally not allowed to respond freely to changing risks or market  conditions. In particular, these critics say that  insurance regulators do not allow private insurers in catastrophe-prone  areas to charge rates sufficient to build surpluses or transfer risks to  reinsurers,  regulators may be subject to voter pressure and thus to legislative  pressure to keep insurance premiums affordable and coverage readily  available, and  regulatory and political restrictions prevent markets from giving  consumers accurate price signals regarding the risks of living in  catastrophe-prone areas.", "NAIC officials told us that projected loss costs to cover the insurer\u2019s  catastrophe exposure vary widely depending on which risk-modeling firm  the insurer selects to produce its catastrophe loss costs. Only future results  prove whether insurance company actuaries or insurance regulator  actuaries are correct. The officials said that one should not assume that  insurers and their actuaries have perfect information about what  catastrophes will occur during the next year and about how the economy  will behave. They added that one should also not assume that actuaries  working for insurance companies are always correct in their projections of  the needed price for the future experience period and that actuaries  working for insurance regulators are always wrong.", "In the aftermath of natural catastrophes, some insurers responded by  limiting their exposure in catastrophe-prone areas with restrictions on  underwriting, higher deductibles, and lower coverage limits. In particular,  there were property insurance affordability and availability crises in the  Gulf Coast states or Florida after Hurricane Camille in 1969, Hurricane  Celia in 1970, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the 2005 hurricanes; and in  California following the Northridge Earthquake in 1994. Various proposals  have been put forth over the past 15 years seeking to have the federal  government take a larger role\u2014for example, as a reinsurer or by allowing  insurance companies to accumulate tax-deferred reserves\u2014in addressing  the affordability and availability of natural catastrophe insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Natural Catastrophe Insurance and Disaster Aid", "paragraphs": ["The federal government engages in a wide variety of insurance activities,  among them providing multiperil crop insurance to farmers and flood  insurance to homeowners and businesses.

IHP includes Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs  Assistance (ONA). FEMA may provide five types of HA: financial assistance  to rent temporary housing, \u201cdirect\u201d temporary housing assistance, repair  assistance, replacement assistance, and permanent housing construction in  certain areas outside of the continental United States and other remote  areas. FEMA may provide ONA grant funding for transportation expenses,  medical and dental expenses, and funeral and burial expenses.

IHP is not intended to restore damaged property to  its predisaster condition.", "SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program (DLP) is the primary federal program for  funding long-range recovery for private sector, nonfarm disaster victims.  Eligible losses include under or uninsured damages and can not duplicate  benefits received from another source (i.e. insurance recovery, FEMA,  etc.). The Small Business Act authorizes SBA to make available the  following two types of disaster loans: (1) physical disaster home loans to  homeowners, renters, and businesses of all sizes, and (2) economic injury  disaster loans to small businesses. Homeowners and renters can borrow  up to $40,000 for repair or replacement of household and personal effects.  Homeowners can also borrow up to $200,000 to repair or replace a primary  residence. Businesses of all sizes can borrow up to $1.5 million to repair or  replace disaster damaged real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory,  etc. Small businesses can borrow up to $1.5 million for disaster related  economic injury resulting from the declared disaster. The combined loans  to a business for physical loss and economic injury cannot exceed   $1.5 million. Homeowners and businesses must provide reasonable  assurance that they can repay the loan out of personal or business cash  flow, and they must have satisfactory credit and character.", "HUD also provides disaster recovery assistance through several programs.  After the 2005 hurricanes, Congress appropriated $16.7 billion to the  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for disaster  recovery. The CDBG program generally provides funding to metropolitan  cities and urban counties that have been designated as entitlement  communities and to states for distribution to other communities. Grant  recipients must give maximum feasible priority to activities, including  emergency-related activities, that (1) benefit low- and moderate-income  families or aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight, or   (2) meet urgent community development needs.

To keep natural  catastrophe insurance available and affordable, government insurance  programs operate differently than private insurance companies. Private  insurance companies generally rely on premiums collected from those they  insure to cover operating costs and losses and set premium rates at levels  that are designed to reflect the risk that the company assumes in providing  the insurance. These companies may also accumulate reserves to cover  large losses. Federal and state government insurance programs also collect  up-front premiums, but their rates do not always reflect the risks that the  programs assume. Because premiums are inadequate to cover operating  costs and losses, the government programs generally have limited  resources and often face deficits after disasters. However, unlike private  insurers, federal insurers may obtain funds after a catastrophic event  through emergency appropriations. State programs may also access  postevent funding through various means, including assessments on  private insurers, bonds, and private reinsurance. State programs may also  be postfunded through state general revenue funds and federal disaster  relief payments. This structure has several implications. First, it may  encourage homeowners in catastrophe-prone locations to seek coverage  from government programs, crowding out the private market and  increasing the government\u2019s financial exposure. Second, homeowners may  not receive appropriate price signals about the risk of living in catastrophe- prone locations. Third, taxpayers who live in less risky locations may be  subsidizing those living in catastrophe-prone locations. Finally, the added  burden of private insurers\u2019 assessment obligations may provide another  reason for them to leave already stressed markets.", "Federal natural catastrophe insurance programs fill gaps in private  insurance markets and help limit disaster relief payments. For example,  FCIC and NFIP were created because private insurers had determined that  multiperil crop and flood losses were uninsurable and declined to provide  coverage. A 1937 study by the Executive Committee on Crop Insurance,  which noted that commercial attempts to insure against crop losses had  been unsuccessful, provided the impetus for creating FCIC in 1938. Initially,  the program was experimental and suffered heavy losses. The Federal Crop  Insurance Act of 1980 expanded the program to replace free disaster  coverage (in the form of compensation to farmers who were unable to  plant crops and who suffer yield losses) with insurance. The flood  insurance program was initiated because it had become clear by the 1950s  that private insurance companies could not profitably provide affordable  flood coverage because of the catastrophic nature of flooding and the  impossibility of developing an actuarial rate structure that could  adequately reflect the risk to flood-prone properties, among other reasons.  One of the primary purposes of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968,  which created NFIP, was to reduce federal expenditures for disaster  assistance and flood control.", "State natural catastrophe insurance programs were created to avoid  homeowners insurance crises that threatened the states\u2019 housing markets.  For example, the California Earthquake Authority was formed in 1996 in  response to a crisis in the residential property insurance market following  the Northridge earthquake in 1994. According to the Insurance Information  Institute, California insurers had collected only $3.4 billion in earthquake  premiums in the 25-year period prior to the Northridge earthquake but had  paid out more than $15 billion on Northridge claims alone. Moreover,  insurers representing about 95 percent of the homeowners insurance  market in California began to limit their exposure to earthquakes by writing  fewer or no new homeowners insurance policies, triggering a crisis that  threatened California\u2019s housing market and stalled the state\u2019s recovery  from recession. See appendix II for a more detailed description of state  natural catastrophe insurance programs.", "Florida Citizens is a nonprofit tax-exempt entity that provides residential  and commercial property insurance coverage when private insurance is not  available. Florida Citizens was established in 2002 after two separate  insurance pools\u2014the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association  (FWUA) and the Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint  Underwriting Association (JUA)\u2014were combined. In addition, the  Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (FHCF) provides an alternative to  traditional hurricane reinsurance, reducing the cost of coverage  significantly below that of private reinsurance and lowering the cost of  insurance to homeowners. The FHCF was established in 1993 in response  to Hurricane Andrew, which resulted in a severe shortage of catastrophe  property reinsurance capacity, stricter policy terms and conditions, and  sharp increases in property catastrophe reinsurance rates in the year  following the storm. The post-Andrew reaction of a number of insurance  companies was to attempt to reduce their underwriting exposure, and 39  insurers stated in early 1993 that they intended to either cancel or not  renew approximately 844,000 policies in Florida. Other states\u2014including  Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas\u2014have created state funds to  make natural catastrophe insurance available and affordable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Premium Rates for Government Natural Catastrophe Insurance Programs Are Often Determined by Factors Other Than Risk", "paragraphs": ["Because government natural catastrophe insurance programs are often  created to ensure the availability and affordability of natural catastrophe  insurance, homeowner premiums for these programs\u2014although risk- related\u2014are generally not based entirely on the homeowners level of risk.  Federal natural catastrophe insurance program premium rates are often set  by statute and involve government subsidies. For example, to encourage  broad participation in the crop insurance program, federal law seeks to  ensure that the premiums are affordable to all farmers by requiring FCIC to  pay a portion of the premium cost. Specifically, FCIC offers farmers  varying subsidy rates for crop insurance, depending on the level of  protection they seek. Crop insurance subsidies totaled about $2.3 billion  in crop years 2005 and 2006. In addition, federal crop insurance legislation  directs FCIC to operate at a loss ratio of no more than 1.075. A loss ratio  greater than 1.00 indicates that the program paid more in claims than it  collected in premiums. Furthermore, we have previously reported that  NFIP is not designed to be actuarially sound. Annually, flood insurance  subsidies total about $1.3 billion.", "State natural catastrophe insurance program premium rates may also be  set by statute. Florida Citizens historically has been required to maintain  premium rates that were not competitive with the private insurance  market. However, in January 2007, the Florida Legislature allowed Florida  Citizens to charge competitive rates. Even by 2006, Florida Citizens was  the largest property insurer in Florida. It receives much of its reinsurance  coverage from the FHCF, which charges premium rates that are estimated  to be about a quarter to a third the cost of private market reinsurance. The  program can charge these rates because of its tax-exempt status and ability  to postfund claims losses through bonds, among other advantages. These  two state programs are able to charge lower premiums than private  insurance companies, encouraging more people to seek coverage in the  state programs and leaving the state more financially vulnerable in the  event of a large hurricane.", "State natural catastrophe insurance program premium rates are also  subject to approval by state insurance regulators that have generally  resisted rate increases. The Mississippi Windstorm Underwriting  Association (Mississippi Windpool) provides coverage against windstorms  and hail for people in the six coastal counties of Mississippi who might not  be able to get wind coverage in the private insurance market. After  Hurricane Katrina, the Mississippi Windpool sought a rate increase of  almost 400 percent, primarily to cover the increased cost of reinsurance.  The state insurance regulator granted a 90 percent increase. Furthermore,  the state government will use $50 million in federal disaster recovery funds  provided by HUD to offset the increased cost of reinsurance in 2007 and  2008. In addition, the state government created a reinsurance fund that  uses state general revenue funds to offset the increased cost of  reinsurance.", "Similarly, the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (Texas Windpool)  offers wind and hail coverage in 14 coastal counties and other specified  areas. By law, Texas Windpool residential and commercial premium rates  may not increase more than 10 percent above the rates for noncommercial  windstorm or hail insurance that are in effect at the time the request for an  increase is filed. However, the insurance commissioner may suspend this  rule to ensure rate adequacy in the catastrophe area. In May 2006, the  Texas Windpool sought a 19 percent residential and 24 percent commercial  rate increase, but the insurance commissioner approved a 3.1 percent  residential and 8 percent commercial rate increase. When the Texas  Windpool sought a 20 percent residential and 22 percent commercial rate  increase in November 2006, the insurance commissioner approved a 4.2  percent residential and 3.7 percent commercial rate increase. In both  instances, the insurance commissioner stated that he favored an  incremental approach to strengthening the Texas Windpool that did not put  an undue economic burden on coastal homeowners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Natural Catastrophe Insurance Programs Have Incurred Large Postdisaster Deficits Because of Inadequate Resources and Reliance on Postfunding", "paragraphs": ["Unlike private insurance companies, government natural catastrophe  insurance programs often do not employ accrual accounting and are not  always required to accumulate adequate resources to meet their  obligations. Generally, insurance premiums are paid in advance, but the  period of protection extends into the future. Private insurers are required  by statutory accounting rules to establish reserves for incurred or known  claims and for the cost of \u201cincurred but not reported\u201d claims to ensure that  the premiums collected in advance will be available to pay future losses.  Incurred but not reported claims are insured losses that have already  happened but that for any of a variety of reasons have not yet been  reported to the insurer. Most government natural catastrophe insurance  programs are not required to have these resources, because they are  structured to postfund losses. As we have previously mentioned, NFIP and  the federal crop insurance program are postfunded by emergency  appropriations from federal taxpayers. State programs are generally  postfunded by several mechanisms, including assessments on private  insurers, bonds, and proceeds from general revenues. In most property and  casualty insurance lines, state assessments are often passed through to  policyholders. As a result, homeowners living in less risky locations also  contribute to cover the shortfall\u2014a scenario known as cross-subsidization.  In those states where assessments cannot be passed through in some  manner, private insurers must pay the assessments, while at the same time  paying large claims from their own policyholders. In such instances, some  companies may be reluctant to continue offering coverage in the state or  may become insolvent.", "In the wake of recent natural catastrophes, some government natural  catastrophe insurance programs suffered losses that eliminated their  accumulated resources. For example, NFIP reported unexpended cash of  approximately $1 billion following fiscal year 2004, but the program had  suffered almost $16 billion in losses from Hurricane Katrina alone as of  May 31, 2007. Similarly, Florida Citizens\u2019 high-risk account had a surplus  of approximately $1.1 billion prior to the 2004 hurricane season, but the  program incurred over $2 billion in losses from the 2004 hurricanes and  almost $2 billion in losses from the 2005 hurricanes. The FHCF had  accumulated net assets of $5.5 billion at the end of the 2004 fiscal year but  had an estimated shortfall of approximately $1.4 billion following  reimbursements to participating insurers after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane  seasons. Prior to 2007, the Mississippi Windpool did not have resources  beyond premiums and reinsurance because year-end profits and losses  were shared by member companies. By the end of 2005, following  Hurricane Katrina, the Mississippi Windpool had incurred a net loss of   $473 million. In Louisiana, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation  (Louisiana Citizens), which has a structure similar to that of Florida  Citizens, had $80 million in cash reserves prior to the 2005 hurricane  season but suffered more than $1 billion in losses after Hurricanes Katrina  and Rita.", "Emergency appropriations authorizing funding for federal natural  catastrophe insurance programs after disasters have often been significant.  In the case of FCIC, not only are premium rates subsidized by almost 59  percent for the most popular coverage, but farmers may receive additional  emergency disaster relief\u2014for example, farmers received $1.6 billion  following Hurricane Katrina. In the case of NFIP, not only are premium  rates for pre-FIRM homes subsidized up to 60 percent on average, but after  Hurricane Katrina NFIP was authorized to borrow over $20 billion to pay  claims.", "State natural catastrophe insurance programs have also often required  postfunding to satisfy their obligations in the wake of large natural  catastrophes. For example, to fund its 2004 and 2005 deficits, Florida  Citizens assessed insurance companies in most property and casualty lines  $516 million and $205 million, respectively, and these amounts will be  passed through to policyholders. In addition, the Florida Legislature  appropriated $715 million from the general revenue fund to reduce the size  of the 2005 deficit. Furthermore, to fund a bond issuance to cover the  FHCF\u2019s shortfall, eligible Florida insurance policyholders incurred a   1 percent assessment that will be levied over at least 6 years beginning in  January 2007. In June 2006, the FHCF issued a $1.35 billion postevent  revenue bond to cover 2005 losses, and in July 2006 it issued a $2.8 billion  preevent financing bond to provide liquidity for 2006 and future years.", "Similarly, Louisiana Citizens assessed all property insurance companies in  the state $193 million after the 2005 hurricanes. It has also issued a  postevent bond for $978 million to cover 2005 losses that will be financed  by emergency assessments on insurers in certain lines of property and  casualty insurance. These assessments are levied directly on policyholders,  who may claim a tax credit against state income tax. The assessments will  continue for as many years as needed to cover the plan\u2019s deficit. Both  Florida Citizens and Louisiana Citizens have been declared to be  municipalities rather than insurance companies by their respective state  legislatures, and as a result cannot declare bankruptcy until the bond  obligations are satisfied. In addition, the Mississippi Windpool funded its  deficit through $525 million in assessments on member companies in  proportion to their share of business in the state. At the time, these  assessments could not be directly passed through to policyholders. At least  one private insurance company found that its assessment liability was  more than the entire amount of premiums it collected in the state and was  forced to liquidate.

An analysis by HUD found that of the  192,820 owner-occupied homes with major or severe damage from  Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, approximately 78,000, or about   41 percent, did not have any insurance or did not have enough insurance to  cover the damage incurred. Homeowners do not purchase natural  catastrophe insurance for a variety of reasons, including financial reasons.  Moreover, buying a natural catastrophe insurance policy does not  guarantee complete coverage for a dwelling. For example, if the home\u2019s  replacement value is calculated inaccurately, the homeowner will buy too  little insurance to cover all of the damage. More and more frequently,  responsibility for supporting the needs of individuals who lack adequate  insurance against natural catastrophe risk is falling to the federal  government.

About   41 percent of homes that sustained severe damage from any peril during  the 2005 hurricanes were uninsured or underinsured. HUD reported that of  the 60,196 owner-occupied homes with major or severe wind damage,  almost 23,000, or 38 percent, lacked insurance against wind loss. Also, the  Insurance Information Institute reported that about 86 percent of  Californians did not have earthquake insurance on their homes in 2004.  Furthermore, only about one half of eligible single-family homes in Special  Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) nationwide have purchased flood insurance.  In areas outside of SFHAs, where flood insurance is voluntary, only about 1  percent of owners of single-family homes have purchased flood insurance,  even though 20 to 25 percent of NFIP\u2019s claims come from outside of SFHAs.", "Purchasing insurance to protect homes against natural catastrophes is  mandatory for some homeowners, but often it is voluntary. For example,  homeowners who do not have mortgages are generally not required to have  property and casualty coverage, and in some areas certain types of hazards  are routinely excluded from homeowners policies. As we have seen, wind  coverage is often excluded in some coastal areas, and the surplus lines  market or a state-managed entity may offer coverage separately. Although  lenders may require homeowners to purchase this supplemental insurance,  those who own their homes outright may choose not to buy it. A similar  situation exists with earthquake coverage in certain areas of the country. In  earthquake-prone areas, earthquake coverage is commonly excluded from  the homeowners insurance contract and is sold separately by insurance  companies or, as in the case of California, by a state-managed program. In  general, lenders do not require earthquake insurance as a condition of  extending a mortgage.", "Consumers will purchase natural catastrophe insurance on the basis of  their perception of risk. Studies have shown that consumers often consider  the likelihood of a future catastrophe to be much lower than insurance  companies\u2019 estimates. According to academic research, some homeowners  may underestimate the risk of loss, have an overly optimistic view of  expected losses, or be unaware that insurance is available. One insurance  expert has concluded that if people believe that the chance of a serious  event occurring is low, they often consider insurance unnecessary and will  not seek out information on its benefits and costs. Reluctance to purchase  insurance protection can be compounded by budget constraints. For some  homeowners with relatively low incomes, disaster insurance is considered  an expense that can be made only after taking care of necessities.", "An insurance expert has noted that insurance trade associations, consumer  advocacy groups, and governments can provide better information to  consumers about risk probabilities, insurer profitability, and prices to  motivate better insurance purchasing behavior. One study of those living  in earthquake zones has identified a variety of reasons for declining to  purchase earthquake insurance. Some consumers are unwilling or  reluctant to pay high premiums to insure against potentially large but rare  disaster losses. Some consumers believe that the deductible for earthquake  insurance\u2014the standard deductible is 15 percent of the value of the  home\u2014is too high, given the premium rates and amount of coverage  provided. A study of flood insurance market penetration rates cites  several reasons why people do not purchase flood insurance. For  property owners in SFHAs, the decision to purchase insurance is affected  primarily by its price. Outside of SFHAs, property owners are not  purchasing flood insurance because they may not be aware of flood risk,  and because flood insurance agents have less interest in promoting flood  insurance and in learning how to write flood policies.

However, in catastrophe-prone areas, the prospect of a total loss of  property is real. If a homeowner suffers a total loss of property as a result  of a natural catastrophe and the replacement cost has not been properly  calculated, the property will not be fully insured. An insurance industry  consultant estimates that in 2006 approximately 58 percent of the  residential housing stock in the United States was undervalued for  insurance purposes by an estimated 21 percent.", "Homeowners insurance coverage can vary by type of policy and from  insurer to insurer, but there are fundamental similarities. The broadest  coverage generally provides that a policyholder will receive full  replacement cost with no deduction for depreciation (up to the policy  limit) if a policyholder maintains coverage limits of 80 percent or more of  the dwelling\u2019s full replacement cost. Otherwise, the homeowner receives  a lesser amount according to the formula in the policy (see sidebar).", "The reasons that replacement costs may not be calculated accurately,  leaving homeowners underinsured, are complex. First, replacement costs  must be periodically updated to account for inflation. Second, beginning in  the early 1980s developers began building more custom homes, and a  significant percentage of homes were remodeled, sometimes extensively.  Historically, the methodologies that the insurance industry used to  calculate replacement costs did not always capture custom features. The  industry has improved its calculation methodologies, but an insurance  industry consultant told us that a large number of policies had not been  properly updated. Furthermore, homeowners whose properties were  remodeled may not have understood the need to tell their insurers about  the remodeling, possibly to avoid rate increases. The problem of  underinsurance can be exacerbated in the wake of a natural catastrophe  when demand for contractors and materials to repair homes is high and the  supply is tight. This phenomenon is known as \u201cdemand surge.\u201d In these  circumstances, the short-term costs of repairing and rebuilding homes can  escalate substantially, and replacement costs become significantly higher.  In addition, over time a community may implement improved building  codes, so that rebuilding may have to conform to stricter standards than  those that were in place when a dwelling was first built.

To  receive CDBG funds, HUD required that each state submit an action  plan describing how the funds would be used, but the agency waived  some program requirements for disaster recovery purposes. For  example, HUD granted a waiver to Mississippi so that a portion of the  CDBG funds could be used to pay reinsurance costs for 2 years for wind  pool insurance maintained by the Mississippi Windpool. Two of the  states receiving the largest allocation from the emergency CDBG  appropriations were Louisiana and Mississippi, both of which opted to  direct the vast majority of their housing allocations to homeowners.

We examined the advantages and disadvantages of these policy options and  evaluated them against four broad public policy goals. These goals are   charging premium rates that fully reflect actual risks,   encouraging private markets to provide natural catastrophe insurance,   encouraging broad participation in natural catastrophe insurance   limiting costs to taxpayers before and after a disaster.", "Our analysis showed that each of the seven options met at least one of the  policy goals but failed to meet others. The first option\u2014a mandatory all- perils homeowners insurance policy\u2014would help create broad  participation and could provide a private sector solution. But this option  could also require subsidies for low-income residents and thus potentially  create substantial costs for the federal government that would have to be  balanced against money saved from reduced disaster relief. A second  option would involve providing federal reinsurance for state catastrophe  funds\u2014a change that could lead to greater private insurance market  participation but that could also displace the private reinsurance market. A  third option, establishing a federal lending facility for state catastrophe  funds, could help such funds with financing needs after a catastrophe.

For example, the policy would cover not only theft and fire but also  wind, floods, and earthquakes. It would also be mandatory for all  homeowners.", "This type of option offers several potential advantages. First, a mandatory  all-perils policy, by definition, would encourage broad participation in  natural catastrophe insurance programs. Moreover, including all American  homeowners in natural catastrophe coverage could help reduce the  number of Americans needing postdisaster payments and possibly limit the  federal government\u2019s exposure. An all-perils policy would also eliminate  existing gaps in coverage and remove the uncertainty many homeowners  face in determining whether certain perils are covered and by whom\u2014an  issue that was spotlighted after Hurricane Katrina, when disputes emerged  between private insurers and homeowners over the extent of the insurers\u2019  obligations to cover certain damages. Finally, because it would be  mandatory and broad-based, an all-perils policy could lessen the problem  of adverse selection that is often identified as the reason that some types of  catastrophes, such as flooding, are considered to be uninsurable. This type  of policy would spread risks geographically and potentially would make the  policy more affordable than other options.", "However, this option is not without its disadvantages. First, it is unclear  how private markets would be encouraged to underwrite all risks. Second,  a mandatory all-perils policy might not be a cost-effective solution for the  federal government, because it could create affordability concerns for low- income residents in certain areas and might require targeted government  subsidies. If they did not sufficiently reduce postevent disaster relief,  these subsidies could increase costs to taxpayers. Third, an all-perils policy  would undoubtedly be more expensive than current homeowner policy  premiums in some regions of the country. As a result, at least during the  transition, it could lead to complaints about higher premium costs from  residents of catastrophe-prone areas. Moreover, homeowners in relatively  low-risk areas could wind up subsidizing the costs of insurance for those  living in high-risk areas. Fourth, enforcement would be extremely  challenging, as we have seen with mandatory flood insurance in  communities in designated floodplains. Finally, this policy option faces  opposition from the private insurance industry, in part because of concerns  about state insurance regulators impeding private insurers\u2019 ability to  charge premiums that reflect the actual risk of loss in catastrophe-prone  areas. Private insurers have also traditionally opposed all-perils policies  because of the difficulty of pricing flood and earthquake coverage. One  insurance company has said that an all-perils policy would cause rates to  skyrocket and could cause many insurers to abandon the homeowners  insurance market.

The first version of this option would  create a federal mechanism that would serve as a backstop for state  catastrophe funds to increase the amount of insurance and reinsurance  available to states, expand the availability of catastrophe coverage, and  possibly improve its affordability. States would create catastrophe funds  and enter into agreements with the federal government\u2014possibly, but not  necessarily, the U.S. Treasury\u2014and pay premiums for the reinsurance that  would be used to support the reinsurance fund. Each state\u2019s payments  would be based on risk and determined using actuarial and catastrophe  modeling, and the states would be responsible for collecting premiums  from insured commercial and residential property owners. The federal  fund would provide payments to state funds for storms of a certain  magnitude up to some predetermined level of payments. If the federal  reinsurance fund was not adequately financed at the time of a catastrophe,  it would issue government-backed bonds.", "A related but different version of this federal reinsurance option would  authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to create an auction process for the  sale of reinsurance contracts to private and state insurers and reinsurers.  The secretary would make available reinsurance contracts covering both  earthquakes and wind events. The auction process would be open to state  and private insurers and reinsurers and would take place in at least six  separate geographic regions, so that risks would be based on local factors  and insurers in less risk-prone areas would not be subsidizing those in  riskier areas. State programs would have to reach a minimum loss level  before they would be eligible for federal funds. This version also  establishes a disaster reinsurance fund within the U.S. Treasury to be  credited with, among other sources of funds, amounts received from the  sale of reinsurance contracts. The Treasury would be authorized to issue  debt if the fund\u2019s resources were insufficient to pay claims\u2014and  reinsurance premiums paid to Treasury would be used to make interest  payments to debt holders\u2014but the fund would not receive federal  appropriations. A national commission on catastrophe risks and insurance  loss costs would advise the secretary.", "Both versions of this option offer advantages and disadvantages. First,  federal reinsurance is advantageous because it has the potential to help  insurance companies by limiting timing risk\u2014the possibility that events  will occur before insurers have collected enough premiums to cover  them\u2014potentially making insurers more willing to underwrite natural  catastrophe insurance policies. Second, primary insurance companies  may be less interested in canceling catastrophe insurance policies in  coastal regions after a disaster if stable sources of reinsurance are available  from state catastrophe funds. This option could also encourage the  provision of catastrophe insurance via private insurance markets by  limiting private insurers\u2019 liability for very large events and thus increasing  their willingness to offer insurance for less catastrophic events. And a  greater supply of natural catastrophe insurance could reduce the cost of  insurance as competition for business intensified. Third, this option may  also be advantageous because, if it were appropriately structured\u2014that is,  if program losses were funded by upfront premium payments\u2014federal  reinsurance should not require the use of taxpayer dollars. Finally, to the  extent that this option increased the availability and affordability of  catastrophe insurance, it would be preferable to postdisaster assistance  and could limit the need for some types of postevent government payouts.", "While federal reinsurance has some appealing options, it is not without  disadvantages. For example, neither version of the reinsurance option is  intended to displace or compete with the private reinsurance market,  because reinsurance contracts would not be sponsored in markets where  private reinsurance markets offered coverage. However, federal  reinsurance could compete with and possibly displace private reinsurance  if the government offered coverage at levels that were well within private  market capacity or set premium rates below what the private sector would  charge for comparable risk. While the stated intent of this option is to  charge a premium that fully reflects the risk assumed by the federal  reinsurance fund, political and consumer pressures could be put on the  federal fund to underprice premiums in terms of risk to keep premiums low  for policyholders in high-risk areas. Charging a reinsurance premium that  was not fully risk-based would expose the federal fund and the government  to potentially significant unfunded contingent insurance risk. As a result,  federal reinsurance could disproportionately benefit those living in high- risk areas. Should the fund experience losses that exceeded the premiums  collected, the difference would have to be paid by the taxpayers, creating a  cross-subsidy that favored those in catastrophe-prone areas. Also, the  existence of federal reinsurance might affect market discipline, leading  private insurers and state catastrophe insurance funds to loosen  underwriting guidelines\u2014that is, to insure properties that would not have  been insurable without the availability of (low-cost) federal reinsurance.  Such a change could be costly for the reinsuring federal facility. As a result,  a federal reinsurance role could inadvertently encourage further  development and population growth in areas with high natural catastrophe  risk. Finally, government natural catastrophe insurance programs are not  purely insurance programs and may have social goals. But if the  government plans to intervene in the catastrophe insurance market, it may  want to use mechanisms that mimic as closely as possible what operating  private markets could have been expected to do. When federal insurance  programs mimic private insurance, and base decisions on risk (as  consistent with social goals), then government losses are more likely to be  contained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Federal Lending Facility Would Eliminate Timing Risk for State Catastrophe Insurance Programs but Would Face the Risk That the Loan Might Not Be Repaid", "paragraphs": ["A federal lending facility would allow the federal government to use its  borrowing power to extend temporary loans to state catastrophe funds.  State catastrophe funds may not have the creditworthiness to borrow at  acceptable interest rates. One proponent of this plan has suggested that the  private insurance market could handle all or nearly all catastrophe  exposure, but possibly not at the moment the catastrophe happened.  Creating a lending facility in the federal government would allow the  government to provide the capital to meet the temporary shortage and  spread the repayment over time without assuming the underwriting risk  held by the insurers. Under this option, state catastrophe funds would be  required to secure private reinsurance and would have the ability to sell  catastrophe bonds to repay the money loaned to them by the federal  government.

The loans would be of short duration, perhaps 2 to 3 years at  maximum, and would provide state catastrophe funds with encouragement  and time to access the private capital market. State catastrophe funds  would be expected to demonstrate to the federal lending facility that the  states were doing all that they could to attract private capital. A proposed  trigger for the federal lending facility would be a megacatastrophe.", "The creation of a federal lending facility would have several advantages.  First, a federal lending facility would shift timing risk, which is significant  in the catastrophe insurance business, from the insurance industry to the  federal government. The federal government, because of its borrowing  power, is uniquely able to deal with timing risk. Second, a federal lending  facility could mean that taxpayers would assume little or possibly no  insurance risk, because the insurers would be responsible for paying all of  the losses from catastrophic events, although not necessarily in the year of  the catastrophe. Finally, through the requirement that the states do all that  they can to attract private capital, the option may lead to insurance  regulatory reforms in areas such as rate regulation that have inhibited the  influx of private capital.", "A federal lending facility would also have a number of disadvantages. First,  it is not clear how this federal lending facility would encourage premiums  that reflected risks, would foster broad citizen participation, or would be a  cost-effective solution. Second, it would expose the facility and ultimately  taxpayers to credit risk if a state did not repay its debt. Third, a federal  lending facility could also require the creation of a new federal entity or  structure to administer the system. Fourth, like the federal reinsurance  option, such a lending facility could have a competitive advantage over the  private reinsurance sector, particularly if the terms were too easy or if  borrowed funds did not have to be repaid.

This option could encourage  some insurers to maintain or expand their catastrophe insurance coverage  in regions with significant or projected catastrophe exposures. This option  is also intended to provide insurers with an incentive to write catastrophe  coverage in hazard-prone areas while improving their own financial  strength. It would require amending the U.S. Tax Code, because current tax  laws and accounting principles discourage U.S. property and casualty  insurers from accumulating long-term assets specifically for payment of  future losses by taxing these assets. Because the size and timing of  disasters that have not taken place is uncertain, assets set aside for  catastrophe losses, together with any interest accrued, are taxed as  corporate income in the year in which they are set aside. Although there is  a federal income tax deduction for losses that have already occurred,  reserves for uncertain future losses are not tax deductible.", "Tax-deferred reserving has its advantages. Tax-deferred reserving could  mean that state regulators would be more willing to approve risk-based  rates, because premiums could now be set aside rather than flow into  profits. Consistent with the intended purpose of this option, tax-deferred  reserving could increase the willingness of insurance companies to  increase capacity without risking insolvency, because the companies would  be less dependent on the uncertain prices available in reinsurance markets.  In this case, the option would encourage a solution by private insurance  markets and more broad-based participation in catastrophe insurance  programs. Finally, this approach could reduce the need for state  catastrophe insurance mechanisms by increasing the willingness of private  insurers to remain or enter certain catastrophe-prone markets, such as  Florida and other Gulf Coast states.", "However, tax-deferred reserving also raises a number of broader issues  that must be considered. Tax-deferred reserving would reduce current  federal tax revenue. However, as with other options, the net cost would  have to be determined by weighing the tax cost against potential savings  from federal postdisaster assistance programs. Deferring taxes on reserves  for insurance companies could also be disadvantageous if this system  created tax benefits that favored one type of activity over another. For  example, to the extent that tax-deferred reserving became prevalent, it  could displace the reinsurance market or other forms of hedging.

A bank or  another designated organization would be the custodian for these  accounts. Under one current option, homeowner contributions would be  limited to (1) $2,000 for individuals with homeowners insurance and  deductibles of not more than $1,000, and (2) the lesser of $15,000 or twice  the insurance deductible for homeowner insurance deductibles of more  than $1,000.

Rather  than increasing participation, it could result in a tax benefit for those who  are already insured.

Historically, catastrophe bonds have been created in  offshore jurisdictions where they are not subject to any income or any  other tax (i.e., in tax havens). This option would facilitate the creation of  onshore transactions, potentially reducing transactions costs and allowing  for increased regulatory oversight. Tax treatment of catastrophe bonds  would be similar to the treatment received by issuers of asset-backed or  mortgage-backed securities that, for example, are generally not subject to  tax on the income from underlying assets, which is passed on to investors.  More favorable tax treatment of catastrophe bonds would increase the  ability of insurance markets to access capital markets by making these  products more attractive to investors. Making catastrophe bonds more  attractive to issuers and investors could, in turn, make insurance and  reinsurance companies more willing to underwrite catastrophe risk and  increase the availability of coverage, because these companies could pass  on more catastrophe risk to investors.", "One disadvantage of this option is that it is not clear how its  implementation would encourage premiums that fully reflect risk or how it  would encourage broad-based participation in catastrophe insurance  markets. It is also not clear how this option would be a cost-effective  solution for the federal government when both predisaster and postdisaster  costs are counted. Some reinsurers have pointed out that favorable tax  treatment of catastrophe bonds could be disadvantageous because it could  create a new class of reinsurer that would operate under regulatory and tax  advantages not afforded U.S. reinsurance companies. Finally, recent  catastrophe bond issuances by the two largest U.S. primary insurance  companies may indicate that catastrophe bonds do not need a different tax  treatment to make them economically viable. However, if market  transparency and the development of uniform terms and conditions do not  take place, only the largest insurers may be able to take advantage of  catastrophe bonds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property-Tax Assessment for Federal Reinsurance May Broaden Participation but May Be Costly for the Federal Government", "paragraphs": ["The final policy option we examined was a state plan, funded by state  property taxes, that would require mandatory all-perils natural catastrophe  insurance coverage on residential property. All primary residential  properties in a state would be required to have catastrophe insurance  coverage. Participating insurers would assume the primary risk on the  property and would have reinsurance from a qualifying reinsurance  company. The state would pay an annual natural catastrophe insurance  premium financed by an annual property tax assessment on all residential  and commercial properties in the state, and homeowners could deduct the  cost from their federal taxes. The insurance coverage would be provided  by private insurance companies selected by a government administrator  who would qualify them as providers of catastrophe insurance. To ensure  that premiums were reasonable, the primary and reinsurance coverage  would require large deductibles that would be paid in layers by the  homeowner, the state, and the federal government. Homeowners would be  responsible for the first 10 percent of the value of the home, with a state  catastrophe fund paying the next layer of the deductible. The state would  provide a fixed-dollar deductible\u2014for example, $100 million\u2014for all  homeowners, with the federal government as the backstop provider, paying  a deductible that was a multiple of the amount that the state put up.", "Proponents of this plan point out that it is market-based, designed to  involve the private sector, and if risk-based premiums are required is not a  \u201cgovernment relief program.\u201d Plan supporters also point out that the option  protects the tax base of a state\u2019s economy as well as the creditworthiness  of a state\u2019s bond rating. One possible advantage of this policy option for the  consumer is that the premiums paid from property taxes are intended to be  tax deductible. Moreover, paying the premium from property taxes could  increase participation at the state level and create a broad-based program  that would limit adverse selection and moral hazard. Finally, maintaining  higher deductibles could result in lower insurance premiums.", "However, this plan also has its disadvantages. Paying the premium from  homeowner property taxes collected by the state would reduce federal tax  revenues, and, if a disaster occurred, the federal government would have to  pay some portion of the deductible. Like the other tax-related options, this  option could reduce federal tax revenue if the new deduction were not  offset by savings from the elimination of preevent premium subsidies or  postevent disaster relief. As a result, it is not clear whether this option may  or may not be the most cost-effective for the federal government. Also,  using property taxes to pay insurance premiums might diminish the  effectiveness of using the price of insurance as a signal of the risk of living  in a particular location. One critic has argued that allowing homeowners to  deduct the premium portion of the property taxes combined with the  federal deductible could result in a double federal subsidy.

NAIC provided written comments that  are reprinted in appendix III. In these comments, NAIC officials said that  our draft report was thorough, and that they were pleased that we outlined  the advantages and disadvantages of several proposals rather than favoring  a single outcome. NAIC officials suggested that we also include in this  report two recently proposed options, including one that includes an  allocation system for determining what portion of hurricane damages  should be attributed to wind and what portion to flooding and the creation  of a federal entity to oversee property insurance rates in the coastal zone.

As these officials pointed out, the allegations in this  report are attributed to others and are not presented as our position. We  recognize the challenges involved in ensuring that consumers are charged  appropriate premiums that reflect their risk of exposure to natural  catastrophes. Given that premium rates requested are based on a variety of  factors that involve a certain amount of judgment\u2014including anticipated  losses on claims and related expenses; the need to build a surplus; and  other factors, including profit\u2014the rate-setting process is open to  interpretation and some amount of negotiation. That is, reasonable but  different assumptions about the probability of future losses can result in  substantial disagreements about rates. However, if state regulators and the  insurance markets consistently have divergent opinions about the cost of  the risk exposures, the implications can be far-reaching. As we discuss in  this report, for state natural catastrophe insurance programs, if premium  rates determined by state insurance regulators consistently result in  financial resources that are inadequate to pay policyholder claims after a  disaster, postfunding mechanisms must be used to pay shortfalls.  Postfunding can result in costs to the private insurance market and may  mean that taxpayers in low-risk areas are subsidizing the costs of those  living in high-risk areas. Similarly, a pattern of regulator-approved rates for  private insurance companies that are consistently below what the market  believes to be the true risk rate may result in the withdrawal of healthy,  diversified insurance companies from the market. However, if premium  rates are set at a level reflecting the market\u2019s perception of the true risk  rate, more competitors are likely to enter.", "Alabama Beach Pool, the CEA, FCIC, FEMA, Florida Citizens, FHCF, the  GUA, Louisiana Citizens, Mississippi Windpool, the North Carolina Beach  Plan, SBA, the South Carolina Windpool, and the Texas Windpool provided  technical comments that we incorporated in this report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of the report until 30 days from the  date of this letter.

We interviewed officials from public  interest groups, insurance companies, reinsurance companies, insurance  brokers, insurance and reinsurance associations, insurance agents and  their associations, state catastrophe insurance plans, state insurance  departments, federal catastrophe insurance agencies, the Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Small Business  Administration (SBA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, rating agencies, a risk  modeling organization, academia, law firms, a hedge fund, a private  research organization, consumer groups, and others. To determine the  mechanisms governments use to supplement or substitute for private  catastrophe insurance markets, we collected oral and documentary  information from public and private officials in various states with high and  low catastrophe risk and in Washington, D.C. We sourced financial data for  government natural catastrophe insurance programs from financial  statements, bond offering documents, and other similar financial  documents.", "To determine the number of uninsured and underinsured Americans and  payments made to such individuals after the 2005 hurricanes, we collected  information from states, examined federal agency data, interviewed federal  officials who prepared these data, sought information from the private  sector, and interviewed state officials responsible for disbursing federal  disaster funds. We focused our analysis on the federal disaster assistance  to homeowners and renters who lacked adequate insurance in the five Gulf  Coast states directly impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.  These five states are Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  Data on the numbers and amounts of money disbursed to the uninsured  and underinsured were incomplete and had a number of limitations. For  instance, because we often could not separate payments to homeowners  versus payments to renters, we generally included the entire amount in our  analysis. Also, we generally excluded administrative and other expenses  that federal disaster assistance programs incur in distributing assistance.  Our analysis was limited to the major federal disaster assistance programs  that we identified as providing relief to homeowners and renters. These  programs are the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA)  Individuals and Households Program (IHP), SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program  (DLP), and HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.  Our identification of relevant federal disaster assistance programs may be  incomplete. Other federal agencies are involved in federal disaster  assistance according to the mission assignment issued and approved by  FEMA, as we reported separately in Disaster Relief: Governmentwide  Framework Needed to Collect and Consolidate Information to Report on  Billions in Federal Funding for the 2005 Gulf Coast Hurricanes, GAO-06- 834 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 6, 2006).", "To determine the amount of federal disaster assistance appropriated by  Congress to FEMA and the amount paid to homeowners and renters who  lacked adequate insurance through FEMA IHP, we obtained and analyzed  data provided by FEMA officials describing the funds obligated for the  subcategories of Housing Assistance, Other Needs Assistance, and  Manufactured Housing in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and  Texas following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. In analyzing these  data, we had to make certain judgments in deciding which specific  subcategories of funds to include in our analysis. In particular, FEMA noted  that the Other Needs Assistance data contained funds for services that  would not be provided by personal property coverage in standard private  homeowners insurance, such as medical and funeral expenses. However,  we included Other Needs Assistance data in our analysis because these are  expenses that may have been covered by other types of insurance, such as  health and life, and, therefore, still provide a reasonable approximation of  insurance coverage. Also, FEMA officials noted that the Manufactured  Housing data included expenses that would not be included in additional  living expenses coverage provided by standard private homeowners  insurance. For example, other expenses included unit purchase,  haul/install, utilities, site lease, maintenance, deactivation, and the  transition out of service. We included these data in our analysis because  they are designed to serve a similar purpose as the additional living  expenses coverage provided by insurance companies. We assessed the  reliability of the data provided by agency officials by interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data systems; obtaining oral responses  from the agency; and reviewing agency reports regarding (1) the agency\u2019s  methods of data collection and quality control reviews, (2) practices and  controls over data entry accuracy, and (3) any limitations of the data. It is  possible that FEMA\u2019s data analysis methodology is different from that  employed by the other agencies we reviewed. Nevertheless, we determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  engagement. Finally, we interviewed officials from FEMA Disaster  Assistance Directorate, which administers IHP, and reviewed the document  entitled Oversight of Gulf Coast Hurricane Recovery, A Semiannual  Report to Congress, October 1, 2006-March 31, 2007, by the President\u2019s  Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the Executive Council on Integrity  and Efficiency.", "To determine the amount of federal disaster assistance appropriated by  Congress to SBA and the amount paid to homeowners and renters who  lacked adequate insurance through SBA DLP, we reviewed the previously  mentioned document entitled Oversight of Gulf Coast Hurricane  Recovery, and interviewed agency officials. We obtained and analyzed data  provided by SBA that included, among other things, the amount of loan  funds approved net of other federal disaster assistance and insurance  proceeds to loan recipients. We multiplied this total by the subsidy rate of  the loans\u201414.64 percent in 2006. That is, for every $100 that SBA lends, the  cost to the federal government is $14.64. The subsidy rate is roughly the  percentage of loan principal that is not repaid as well as the difference  between the market interest rate and the rate charged by SBA. We believe  that subsidy cost is the most accurate representation of the amounts made  available and paid to homeowners and renters because the loans under  DLP must be repaid by recipients at a subsidized interest rate. We assessed  the reliability of the data provided by agency officials by interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data systems and obtaining from  the agency written responses regarding (1) the agency\u2019s methods of data  collection and quality control reviews, (2) practices and controls over data  entry accuracy, and (3) any limitations of the data.

The State Board appoints a nine-member advisory  council to provide the State Board with information and advice with its  administration of the FHCF. The management and day-to-day operations of  the FHCF is the responsibility of the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer  currently manages eight professional staff. Paragon Strategic Solutions,  Inc. is the FHCF administrator as well as the actuarial consultant to the  State Board.", "The FHCF collects premiums from and provides reimbursements to  insurers writing residential property and casualty insurance policies within  the state. As a condition of doing business in Florida, each insurer writing  \u201ccovered policies\u201d is required to contract with the FHCF. \u201cCovered  policies\u201d means any insurance policy covering residential property in the  state that provides wind or hurricane coverage. This includes any such  policy written by Florida Citizens. A limited exemption is available for  insurance companies with less than $10 million in covered exposure (not  premium). The FHCF is obligated, pursuant to reimbursement contracts, to  reimburse participating insurers for a specified percentage of qualifying  losses on the basis of selected coverage (45, 75, or 90 percent) in excess of  loss retention thresholds (or deductibles). Nearly 85 percent of insurers  selected the 90 percent coverage option for fiscal year 2005-2006   (July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006). There were 205 insurance companies  that contracted with the FHCF during that period.", "The aggregate industry deductible is set by law at $4.5 billion to be adjusted  to reflect increased exposure to the FHCF. Currently, the aggregate  deductible is $6.089 billion for the contract year ending May 31, 2007. An  individual insurer\u2019s deductible is based on an insurer\u2019s pro rata share of  reimbursement premium due for a contract year and other factors. An  insurer\u2019s full deductible shall apply to each of the insurer\u2019s largest two  hurricanes. The insurer\u2019s full deductible would then be adjusted to one  third for any other hurricanes occurring during the contract year.", "The insured value of property reinsured by the FHCF in contract year   2007 is estimated to be approximately $2 trillion. The FHCF\u2019s claims-paying  capacity in a contract year is set by law, and legislation passed in early   2007 will increase capacity from $15 to $38.4 billion. Due to actual coverage  selected, the resulting capacity was $27.83 billion. The FHCF\u2019s multiyear  claims-paying capacity is over $50 billion. The cap on capacity represents  the limited liability of the FHCF\u2014it is not obligated by contract if losses in  a given contract year exceed claims-paying capacity.

In early 1993, 39 insurers  stated they intended to either cancel or not renew 844,433 policies in  Florida. The factors influencing these private insurers included  the inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or, when available, the cost  for reinsurance was too high;  new catastrophe risk models indicated that exposure levels were higher  than previously thought, and the exposure levels were disproportionate  to company and industry financial resources;  significant reductions in insurers\u2019 policyholders surplus;  concerns about rate adequacy, especially for coastal counties and  certain risk categories, such as condominiums;  \u201chidden\u201d exposures from potential assessments by various other  insurance mechanisms, for example, residual markets and catastrophe  funds; and  fear that unfavorable catastrophe exposure would hurt ratings from  agencies such as A.M.

Later, the legislature created a Study Commission on Property  Insurance and Reinsurance to look into the viability of the property  insurance industry and the adequacy of reinsurance. Of the 40  recommendations made by the commission, a key recommendation  included the establishment of a state catastrophe fund \u201cto fill the void  between currently available private sector reinsurance and the proposed  federal catastrophic fund program.\u201d Virtually all of the recommendations  from the commission were enacted with minor alterations, including  creation of the FHCF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHCF Premiums Are Significantly Less Than Private Reinsurance Premiums", "paragraphs": ["The cost of FHCF coverage is significantly less than the cost of private  reinsurance (one fourth to one third the cost) due to the FHCF\u2019s tax- exempt status, low administrative costs, and lack of a profit or risk-load.  The tax-exempt status of the FHCF removes a level of potential income  taxation for participating insurers resulting from the annual buildup of  contingent reserves in years when there are few or no hurricanes, and,  thus, allows for the accumulation of funds for the payment of Florida  losses. Another reason FHCF premiums are low is that a significant part of  the coverage provided by the FHCF may be paid by long-term debt issued  by the FHCF after a large hurricane event occurs, as discussed below.", "A company\u2019s annual reimbursement premium is based on an actuarial  formula that considers property location, type of construction, deductible,  and loss mitigation. Premiums have been stable over time due to  mandatory participation but have increased significantly since 2004 when  the FHCF\u2019s capacity was increased. Growth in reported exposure has also  factored into increased premiums. The top 10 insurers in the FHCF  contribute 64 percent of the total reimbursement premiums paid. The  FHCF is expected to collect $736 million in reimbursement premium during  contract year 2006. Beginning in 2006, the FHCF was required to charge a  rapid cash build-up factor equal to 25 percent of premiums, which was  expected to provide $200 million annually. However, the Florida Legislature  repealed this provision in early 2007.", "According to the FHCF, most insurers select the 90 percent coverage  option. Insurers may purchase private market reinsurance to cover their  hurricane losses for amounts below the retention, above their  reimbursement limit, or for the coinsurance amount (10 percent \u2013 along  side) that is the insurer\u2019s responsibility for the layer of coverage provided  by the FHCF.

Emergency  assessments are levied on premiums for all assessable lines of business in  Florida. For 2006, there are 27 assessable lines, and medical malpractice  policies will be added in 2010. In 2004, surplus lines insurers were added to  the emergency assessment base. Excluded lines include accident and  health, workers\u2019 compensation, and federal flood insurance. The  assessment base, which totaled $35 billion in 2005, has grown at a  compound annual growth rate of 14.6 percent since 1970.

In May 2006, a   1 percent emergency assessment was directed.", "The assessments are collected by insurance companies from policyholders  and remitted to the FHCF throughout the year. Policyholders are required  to pay the assessments, and insurers are required to treat the failure to pay  the assessment as a failure to pay premium, which permits an insurer to  cancel the policy. The maximum assessment in a single season is 6 percent  of premium, and the aggregate limit is 10 percent of the premium base.  Emergency assessments had never been assessed or collected prior to the  levy of assessments relating to the issuance of the June 2006 bonds.
