GAO reviewed applicable statutes and agency guidance. GAO also asked a credit scoring firm to simulate the effect on borrowers' credit scores of removing student loan defaults.

(Loan rehabilitation programs described in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) enable financial institutions to remove reported defaults from credit reports after borrowers make a number of consecutive, on-time payments.) Some nonbank private student loan lenders offer rehabilitation programs, but others do not, because they believe the Act does not authorize them to do so. Clarification of this matter by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\u2014which oversees credit reporting and nonbank lenders\u2014could enable more borrowers to participate in these programs or ensure that only eligible entities offer them.", "Private student loan rehabilitation programs are expected to pose minimal additional risks to financial institutions. Private student loans compose a small portion of most banks' portfolios and have consistently low default rates. Banks mitigate credit risks by requiring cosigners for almost all private student loans. Rehabilitation programs are also unlikely to affect financial institutions' ability to make sound lending decisions, in part because the programs leave some derogatory credit information\u2014such as delinquencies leading to the default\u2014in the credit reports.", "Borrowers completing private student loan rehabilitation programs would likely experience minimal improvement in their access to credit. Removing a student loan default from a credit profile would increase the borrower's credit score by only about 8 points, on average, according to a simulation that a credit scoring firm conducted for GAO. The effect of removing the default was greater for borrowers with lower credit scores and smaller for borrowers with higher credit scores (see figure). Reasons that removing a student loan default could have little effect on a credit score include that the delinquencies leading to that default\u2014which also negatively affect credit scores\u2014remain in the credit report and borrowers in default may already have poor credit."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, including that CFPB provide written clarification to nonbank private student loan lenders on their authority to offer private student loan rehabilitation programs.

To facilitate private student loan  borrowers\u2019 access to comparable programs, in 2018 Congress passed  the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act  (the Act), which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to allow  financial institutions to offer rehabilitation programs. The Act does not  require financial institutions to offer a rehabilitation program to their  private student loan borrowers, but financial institutions that are overseen  by one of the federal banking regulators must obtain approval of their  program\u2019s terms and conditions from their regulator before offering a  program.

To assist data furnishers in complying with their responsibilities  under FCRA, the credit reporting industry has adopted a standard  electronic data-reporting format called the Metro 2\u00ae Format.

An account becomes delinquent on the day after the  due date of a payment when the borrower fails to make a full payment.  Private student loan lenders\u2019 policies and terms of loan contracts  generally determine when a private student loan is in default. While  private student loan lenders may differ in their definitions of what  constitutes a default, federal banking regulator policy states that closed- end retail loans (which include private student loans) that become past  due 120 cumulative days from the contractual due date should be  classified as a loss and \u201ccharged off.\u201d Private student loan lenders can  indicate that a loan is in default and they do not anticipate being able to  recover losses on it by reporting to CRAs one of a number of Metro 2\u00ae  Format status codes. Participation in a private student loan rehabilitation  program entitles borrowers who successfully complete the program to  request that the indicator of a student loan default be removed from their  credit report, but the delinquencies leading up to the default would remain  on the credit report.

Credit scores can help predict the likelihood that a  borrower may default on a loan, file an insurance claim, overdraw a bank  account, or not pay a utility bill. FICO and VantageScore are the two firms  that develop credit score models with nationwide coverage. FICO  develops credit score models for distribution by each of the three  nationwide CRAs, whereas VantageScore\u2019s models are developed across  the three CRAs resulting in a single consistent algorithm to assess risk.  FICO and VantageScore each have their own proprietary statistical credit  score models that choose which consumer information to include in  calculations and how to weigh that information. The three nationwide  CRAs also develop credit score models derived from their own data.", "There are different types of credit scores, including generic, industry- specific, and custom. Generic scores are based on a representative  sample of all individuals in a CRA\u2019s records, and the information used to  predict repayment is limited to the information in consumer credit records.  Generic scores are designed to predict the likelihood of a borrower not  paying as agreed in the future on any type of credit obligation. Both FICO  and VantageScore develop generic credit scores. FICO and  VantageScore generic scores generally use a range from 300 to 850, with  higher numbers representing lower credit risk. For example,  VantageScore classifies borrowers in the following categories: subprime  (those with a VantageScore of 300\u2013600), near prime (601\u2013660), prime  (661\u2013780), and super prime (781\u2013850). A prime borrower is someone  who is considered a low-risk borrower and likely to make loan payments  on time and repay the loan in full, whereas a subprime borrower has a  tarnished or limited credit history. FICO and VantageScore generic scores  generally use similar elements in determining a borrower\u2019s credit score,  including a borrower\u2019s payment history, the amounts owed on credit  accounts, the length of credit history and types of credit, and the number  of recently opened credit accounts and credit inquiries.", "FICO has developed industry-specific scores for the mortgage,  automobile finance, and credit card industries. These scores are  designed to predict the likelihood of not paying as agreed in the future on  these specific types of credit. In addition, credit providers sometimes use  custom credit scores instead of, or in addition to, generic credit scores.  Credit providers derive custom scores from credit reports and other  information, such as account history, from the lender\u2019s own portfolio.

However, the removal of defaults from credit reports resulting from loan  rehabilitation programs is unlikely to affect financial institutions\u2019 ability to  make sound lending decisions, according to prudential regulator officials  and representatives from three private student lenders and three other  credit providers with whom we spoke. OCC and FDIC officials and  representatives from two of these private student lenders noted that  because rehabilitation programs leave the delinquencies leading up to the  default on borrowers\u2019 credit reports, lenders would still be able to  adequately assess borrower risk. In addition, representatives from one  automobile lender and one mortgage lender said that over time, the  methods they use to assess creditworthiness would be able to detect  whether rehabilitated private student loans were affecting their ability to  identify risk patterns in credit information and they could adjust the  methods accordingly.", "Representatives from the Federal Reserve provided three additional  reasons why they expected that rehabilitation programs would have little  effect on banks\u2019 and credit unions\u2019 lending decisions. First, under the  statutory requirement for private student loan rehabilitation, removal of a  default from a borrower\u2019s credit report can only occur once per loan. A  single default removal would be unlikely to distort the accuracy of credit  reporting in general. Second, they said that borrowers who have  successfully completed a rehabilitation program by making consecutive  on-time payments have demonstrated a proven repayment record, and  therefore they likely represent a better credit risk. Finally, because  participation in the private student loan rehabilitation program is expected  to be low, its effect on the soundness of financial institutions\u2019 lending  decisions is expected to be minimal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Student Loan Rehabilitation Programs Would Likely Result In Minimal Improvements in Borrowers\u2019 Access to Credit", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effect of Rehabilitation Programs on Most Borrowers\u2019 Access to Credit Would Likely Be Small", "paragraphs": ["The effects of private student loan rehabilitation programs on most  borrowers\u2019 access to credit would likely be minimal. A simulation  conducted by VantageScore found that removing a student loan default  increased a borrower\u2019s credit score by 8 points, on average. An 8 point  rise in a borrower\u2019s credit score within VantageScore\u2019s range of 300 to  850 represents only a very small improvement to that borrower\u2019s  creditworthiness. Therefore, most borrowers who successfully completed  a private student loan rehabilitation program would likely see minimal  improvement in their access to credit, particularly for credit where the  decision-making is based solely on generic credit scores.", "Factors Credit Providers Consider Prior to  Lending  Credit providers assess a borrower\u2019s  creditworthiness based on several factors,  including the following:", "Generic credit scores: Credit providers  can rely solely on generic credit scores,  such as those developed by Fair Isaac  Corporation and VantageScore Solutions,  LLC, to make lending decisions. Credit  providers generally do not provide credit  to borrowers whose scores do not meet a  minimum threshold.  Industry-specific credit scores: Certain  types of credit providers, such as  mortgage lenders, automobile loan  lenders, and credit card issuers, may use  industry-specific credit scores rather than  generic credit scores to make lending  decisions. This is because these scores  may help them better predict lending risks  specific to their industry.  Internal credit reviews: Credit providers  can customize methods unique to their  institution that review different aspects of  borrowers\u2019 credit information, such as  debt-to-income ratios, employment  history, and borrowers\u2019 existing  relationships with the institution. Credit  providers may also develop custom credit  scores that are tailored to their specific  needs and include factors they have  deemed important in predicting risks of  nonpayment. Credit providers incorporate  their own internal data in these scores as  well as information contained in  borrowers\u2019 credit reports.", "The effect of a rehabilitation program on credit scores will likely be  somewhat greater for borrowers with lower credit scores, and smaller for  borrowers with higher credit scores. For example, the VantageScore  simulation suggests that borrowers in the subprime range (with scores of  300\u2013600) could see score increases of 11 points, on average, while  borrowers in the prime (661\u2013780) and super prime (781\u2013850) ranges  could see increases of less than 1 point, on average (see fig. 3). The  effect of removing a default from a credit report varies among borrowers  because a credit score is influenced by other information in a borrower\u2019s  credit report, such as other outstanding derogatory credit markers, the  length of time since the default, and other types of outstanding loans.", "Reasons that removing a student loan default may improve a borrower\u2019s  credit score and access to credit only minimally include the following:", "Delinquencies remain in the credit report. A key reason that  removing a student loan default has a small effect on a credit score,  according to VantageScore officials, is that the delinquencies leading  to that default remain in the credit report for borrowers who  successfully complete rehabilitation programs. Adding a delinquency  in the simulation decreased a credit score by 61 points, on average.  Thus, the simulation suggests that the increase in a credit score from  removing a student loan default is not as substantial as the decrease  from adding the initial delinquency.", "Credit scoring treats student loans differently. Some credit score  models place less emphasis on student loans than on other types of  consumer loans in predicting the risk of nonpayment. One credit  scoring firm and two CRAs we spoke with said that student loans  have a lower weight than other types of consumer loans in their  generic credit scoring algorithms. They explained that there are fewer  student loans than other types of consumer loans in the sample they  use to develop the score, and student debt has proved to be less  important statistically at predicting credit risk in their models. Student  loans also may have less weight in predicting defaults in industry- specific or custom models of scores. A representative of one credit  scoring firm said the algorithm for an industry-specific credit score that  predicts the risk of nonpayment on a credit card may place less  emphasis on a student loan than the algorithm for a generic credit  score that is meant to predict risk more broadly. Further, CRA officials  we spoke with said that because their custom credit scoring models  are specific to clients\u2019 needs, the models may not include student  loans as a predictor of default at all, or they may place greater  emphasis on student loans, depending on the clients\u2019 needs.", "Borrowers in default typically already have poor credit. Borrowers  who complete a rehabilitation program have a high likelihood of  having other derogatory credit items in their credit report, in addition to  the student loan delinquencies that led to the default, according to a  study conducted by a research organization, several CRAs, and one  credit provider with whom we spoke. The VantageScore simulation  also showed that borrowers who had at least one student loan  delinquency or default in their credit profile had an average of five  derogatory credit items in their profile. Because student loan defaults  and student loan delinquencies are both negative credit events that  affect credit providers\u2019 credit assessment methods, the removal of one  student loan default from a borrower\u2019s credit report likely will not make  a large difference in how credit providers evaluate the borrower."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs May Hold Additional Benefits as Well as Disadvantages for Borrowers", "paragraphs": ["Consumer advocates and academic studies cited potential benefits of  rehabilitation programs apart from their effect on credit scores and access  to credit:", "Borrowers defaulting on private student loans issued by nonbank  state lenders could have wage garnishments stopped after  successfully completing a rehabilitation program.", "Rehabilitation would stop debt collection efforts against a private  student loan borrower.", "Participating in a loan modification program for one loan may help  borrowers better meet their other loan obligations, according to  studies we reviewed.

Borrowers who redefault following entry into a rehabilitation  program near the end of the statute of limitations on their debt could  have collection efforts extended on these loans.", "Programs may extend adverse credit reporting. Generally, negative  credit information stays on consumer reports for 7 or 10 years;  therefore, depending on when a borrower enters into a rehabilitation  program, a payment on the loan might prolong the adverse credit  reporting for that account.", "The lack of income-driven repayment programs offered to borrowers  in the private student loan market means that borrowers who  complete rehabilitation programs may have a high likelihood of  redefaulting on their loans.", "Because removing adverse information from credit reports does not  change a borrower\u2019s underlying creditworthiness, improved credit  scores and access to credit may cause borrowers to borrow too much  relative to their ability and willingness to pay. For example, one  study found that for consumers who had filed for bankruptcy, their  FICO scores and credit lines increased within the first year after the  bankruptcy was removed from their credit report.

As we stated in the report, we are  aware of the work of the Consumer Data Industry Association to update  the credit reporting guidelines for private student loans. We maintain that  this work presents a good opportunity for CFPB to participate in these  discussions and to work in conjunction with the industry and other  relevant regulators to help alleviate any contradiction between what  CFPB would determine in isolation from any determination made by  industry. Further, such participation would allow CFPB to weigh in on  legal and policy issues from the start, potentially avoiding any need for  future rulemaking.
