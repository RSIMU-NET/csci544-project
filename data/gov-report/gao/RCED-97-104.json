At that time, the farm credit programs of the former Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), most of the functions of the former Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), and other USDA activities were merged. Consequently, FSA now has federal employees, former ASCS nonfederal employees, and members of county farmer committees (county committees), as well as the family members and business associates of these groups, participating in the farm credit program. Prior to the creation of FSA, ASCS federal and nonfederal employees were not involved in the administration of the farm loan programs and were eligible to participate in USDA\u2019s farm programs. In contrast, FmHA employees were not permitted to receive FmHA farm loans, and their relationships with borrowers had been subject to review to avoid conflicts of interest. FSA has started to phase out the eligibility of all of its employees for farm loans and has been working to identify cases requiring action to avoid conflicts of interest through a nationwide survey of employees and county committee members. FSA\u2019s instructions on addressing conflicts of interest are based on FmHA\u2019s instructions and the definition of conflict of interest in USDA\u2019s regulations.", "Because of concerns about conflicts of interest in FSA\u2019s farm loan program, we reviewed the (1) number of FSA\u2019s federal and nonfederal employees and county committee members who have FSA farm loans; (2) comparative size and repayment history of farm loans to FSA\u2019s federal employees, FSA\u2019s nonfederal employees, county committee members, and other FSA borrowers; (3) number of cases FSA has identified requiring action to avoid conflicts of interest; and (4) actions FSA has taken to address these cases.", "Starting in 1995, FSA directed its state offices to survey their employees and county committee members to identify (1) those with loans and relationships with borrowers and (2) cases in which action was needed to avoid conflicts of interest. However, FSA\u2019s state offices were not required to report to headquarters on the cases they reviewed.

Farm operating loans are authorized for buying feed, seeds, fertilizer, livestock, and farm equipment; paying family living expenses; and refinancing existing debt. Farm ownership loans are authorized for buying and improving farmland; constructing, repairing, and improving farm buildings; and refinancing existing debt. Emergency disaster loans are for farmers whose operations have been substantially damaged by adverse weather or by other natural disasters.", "FSA\u2019s full-time permanent workforce included about 5,940 federal and 10,365 nonfederal employees at the time of our review. FSA\u2019s federal employees consist of headquarters staff, former FmHA county loan specialists, former ASCS state executive directors, state committee members, district directors, and state office employees. FSA\u2019s nonfederal employees consist of former ASCS county executive directors and county office staff. Prior to FSA\u2019s creation, FmHA\u2019s policy precluded the agency\u2019s employees from obtaining farm loans to avoid conflicts of interest. Unlike former FmHA employees, former ASCS employees were not involved in the administration of the farm loan programs and were eligible to receive the benefits of USDA\u2019s farm programs and FmHA\u2019s farm loans.", "FSA uses county committees, consisting of about 8,150 locally elected farmers, to assist in implementing agricultural programs, including the farm loan program. USDA pays county committee members for their services. Among other tasks, county committees review loan applications to determine if the applicants have sufficient farming experience to qualify for an FSA farm loan. In addition, each FSA state office has a committee of farmers who provide advice on farm program operations.", "Within FSA, the operations and offices of the former FmHA and ASCS offices have been consolidated. Former ASCS employees who have FSA farm loans may be physically located at the same office as the FSA employees who approve and service these loans. In addition, FSA anticipates that some former ASCS employees will be assigned to assist in administering farm loans.", "FSA has adopted procedures to avoid conflicts of interest in loan-making and servicing decisions. These rules are similar to those used by the former FmHA. For example, loan-processing, approval, servicing, and review activities can be conducted only by FSA employees who are not immediate family members or relatives of loan applicants and who have not had a business or a close personal association with these applicants.", "To avoid conflicts of interest, FSA is phasing out the eligibility of former ASCS employees for FSA farm loans. In December 1995, FSA announced that its employees, including former ASCS nonfederal employees, would no longer be eligible for direct farm ownership loans. However, it stated that FSA employees would still be eligible for direct emergency loans and guaranteed loans. Those in an employee\u2019s household with existing direct loans may be considered for annual operating loans through September 30, 1998.

Consequently, FSA officials do not have specific information that would explain the sources of these differences. However, an FSA official said that these differences may be influenced by, among other things, (1) a comparison of groups of borrowers that vary in number; (2) the incomes of FSA employees, which would enable them to have larger farm operations than some other borrowers; and (3) the inclusion of several hundred cases in which borrowers have debt of $1 million or more. In addition, according to USDA officials, committee members are likely to have larger farm operations than many other producers, which could lead to differences in loan amounts and debt-relief decisions.", "More specifically, our analysis shows that FSA\u2019s federal employees and county committee members had obtained loans that were somewhat larger, while nonfederal employees\u2019 loans were somewhat smaller than the loans of other FSA borrowers.

FSA identified these cases through its state offices\u2019 (1) surveys of employees and committee members and (2) reviews of individual cases to identify those whose loans and relationships with borrowers required action to avoid conflicts of interest. However, the information we obtained from state offices shows that not all employees and committee members had responded to the state office surveys and that some state offices had not reviewed all cases in which employees reported that they or their relatives had farm loans. Consequently, the number of cases requiring action by FSA\u2019s state offices to avoid conflicts of interest can be expected to increase as these offices complete their case reviews.

For example, only 126 of 8,539 county committee members reported to their FSA state office that they had business relationships with FSA borrowers, and 77 of these cases occurred in just three states, according to responses we received from FSA\u2019s state offices. Committee members in 27 states did not report to their FSA state office any business relationships with other borrowers. In other cases, some members indicated that they were reluctant to reveal this information. In one state we visited, three county committee members, including the county committee chairman, had submitted statements to FSA saying that it was \u201cnone of [FSA\u2019s] business\u201d if they had farm credit loans themselves or had relationships with other borrowers.

Four states\u2014California, Connecticut, Iowa, and Tennessee\u2014based their surveys on the October notice only. This notice instructed FSA\u2019s state offices to (1) survey employees and county committee members to identify those with loans, (2) identify those whose loan files were in the county in which they work, and (3) move those loan files to another county or state for servicing to avoid conflicts of interest. The December notice called for an expanded survey that was to identify loans to employees and committee members, loans to close relatives of employees, loans co-signed by employees, business relationships between borrowers and employees, and the investment or managerial roles of employees or their close relatives in firms doing farm credit business with FSA. However, this expanded survey did not call for county committee members to disclose loans that had been received by their family members and business associates. As a result, some states did not collect this information.", "FSA\u2019s October 1995 notice concerning employees\u2019 and committee members\u2019 loans was consistent with the former FmHA\u2019s policy. FmHA\u2019s policy had stated that while county committee members were not employees, they had a special relationship with the agency and therefore were subject to conflict-of-interest restrictions. These restrictions included avoiding certain situations, such as participating in decisions on loans for themselves, family members, or business associates.", "However, FSA\u2019s March 1996 notice appears inconsistent with its October 1995 position. This notice stated that the loan files of county committee members did not need to be moved from the county in which these members were serving unless there were unusual circumstances or the files had already been moved and the state executive director determined that they should remain in the new location. The notice did not define unusual circumstances or provide other guidance on how to determine when county committee members\u2019 files should be moved. We found that some states had returned these files to the original county office, while others had not.", "In May 1996, FSA issued a notice providing instructions for dealing with conflict-of-interest situations that it had not mentioned previously. This notice stated that county committee members were not to act in an official capacity in any decision or meeting involving an FSA borrower or potential borrower when a business or family relationship was involved. However, this notice also stated that county committee members were not specifically prohibited from leasing real estate to FSA borrowers or loan applicants (as are employees or state committee members), although FSA stated that such leases were to be discouraged. As a result of this inconsistency, the state office officials we interviewed expressed frustration and confusion about the proper actions to take in such circumstances.", "Furthermore, the May 1996 notice emphasized that employees needed to recognize an even broader range of relationships that could be identified as posing conflict-of-interest concerns. This notice stated that employees must examine the employment, activity, and financial interests of their family members because these are considered the same as if done by the employees and are crucial to determining if a conflict of interest exists. These additional relationships had not been specifically mentioned in FSA\u2019s October and December 1995 notices.

FSA state office officials from Arkansas, California, Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Texas said that their efforts to identify and address cases were hampered by the unclear guidance from FSA headquarters. To illustrate, some states, such as Iowa and Wisconsin, decided as a matter of procedure that every case they reviewed in which an employee or committee member reported a relationship with a borrower required action to ensure that conflicts of interest would be avoided. However, other state offices decided action was warranted less often. For example, North Carolina, Kansas, and Missouri officials took action to avoid actual or apparent conflicts for only 42, 12, and 4 percent of the cases, respectively, that state office officials had reviewed as of March 1997.", "In addition, as of March 1997, many state offices had not yet taken action to address all of the cases in which action appeared to be needed to avoid conflicts of interest. For example, according to the FSA director of state agriculture credit in Missouri, his primary concern in deciding whether to take action was to avoid inconveniencing borrowers by moving loan files to distant county offices. Other FSA officials in state and county offices agreed that the convenience of the borrower was one of the important considerations in deciding where loan files should be maintained. On the other hand, FSA officials in Mississippi made arrangements for borrowers to continue to visit the same county offices for day-to-day loan transactions, such as making payments on a loan, while their loan files were moved to other counties for servicing decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Follow-Up by the National and State Offices", "paragraphs": ["While FSA headquarters instructed state offices to address conflicts of interest, it has had a limited role in following up on state offices\u2019 efforts.

While some FSA state offices are developing their own case-tracking systems for monitoring these actions, others have no such systems. Officials in 13 of 50 state offices indicated they had no system for following up on actions taken to address conflict-of-interest cases. Officials in the other 37 state offices indicated that they have some method, generally informal, for tracking such cases.
