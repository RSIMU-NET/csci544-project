Specifically, these centers assist with  and make recommendations on market analysis, commercial item  reviews and determinations, and commercial pricing analysis.  Additionally, the centers provide training and assistance to the DOD  acquisition community on various techniques and tools used to evaluate  commercial items and commercial item pricing.

In  2016 DOD issued a proposed DFARS rule, which, when finalized, is  intended to address many of these provisions by providing guidance to  contracting officers for making price reasonableness determinations and  promoting consistency in making commercial item determinations.
