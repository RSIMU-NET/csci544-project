The department also has begun  documenting the EHRM program risks.", "Beyond the aforementioned planning activities undertaken thus far, the  Executive Director stated that the department intends to complete a full  suite of planning and acquisition management documents to guide the  program, including a life cycle cost estimate and an integrated master  schedule to establish key milestones over the life of the project. To this  end, the Executive Director told us that VA has awarded two program  management contracts to support the development of these plans to  MITRE Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton.", "According to the Executive Director, VA also has begun reviewing the  VistA Evolution Roadmap, which is the key plan that the department has  used to guide VistA Evolution since 2014. This review is expected to  result in an updated plan that is to prioritize any remaining VistA  enhancements needed to support the transition from VistA Evolution to  the new system. According to the Executive Director, the department  intends to complete the development of its plans for EHRM within 90 days  after award of the Cerner contract, which is anticipated to occur in  December 2017.", "Further, beyond the development of plans, VA has begun to staff an  organizational structure for the modernization initiative, with the Under  Secretary of Health and the Assistant Secretary for Information and  Technology (VA\u2019s Chief Information Officer) designated as executive  sponsors. It has also appointed a Chief Technology Officer from OI&T,  and a Chief Medical Officer from VHA, both of whom are to report to the  Executive Director.", "VA\u2019s efforts to develop plans for EHRM and to staff an organization to  manage the program encompass key aspects of project planning that are  important to ensuring effective management of the department\u2019s latest  modernization initiative. However, the department remains early in its  modernization planning efforts, many of which are dependent on the  system acquisition contract award, which has not yet occurred. The  department\u2019s continued dedication to completing and effectively executing  the planning activities that it has identified will be essential to helping  minimize program risks and guide this latest electronic health record  modernization initiative to a successful outcome\u2014one which VA, for  almost two decades, has yet to achieve."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Progress toward Consolidating and Optimizing Data Centers and Addressing Other Key FITARA-Related Area Falls Short of Performance Targets", "paragraphs": ["Beyond managing its system modernization efforts, such as VistA, VA  has to ensure the effective implementation of the IT acquisition  requirements called for in FITARA. Pursuant to FITARA, in August 2016,  the Federal CIO issued a memorandum that announced the Data Center  Optimization Initiative (DCOI). According to OMB, this new initiative  supersedes and builds on the results of FDCCI, and is also intended to  improve the performance of federal data centers in areas such as facility  utilization and power usage.", "Among other things, DCOI requires 24 federal departments and agencies,  including VA, to develop plans and report on strategies (referred to as  DCOI strategic plans) to consolidate inefficient infrastructure, optimize  existing facilities, improve security posture, and achieve costs savings.  Further, the memorandum establishes a set of five data center  optimization metrics and performance targets intended to measure  agency\u2019s progress in the areas of (1) server utilization and automated  monitoring, (2) energy metering, (3) power usage effectiveness, (4) facility  utilization, and (5) virtualization. The guidance also indicates that OMB  is to maintain a public dashboard that will display consolidation-related  costs savings and optimization performance information for the agencies.", "However, in a series of reports that we issued from July 2011 through  August 2017, we noted that, while data center consolidation could  potentially save the federal government billions of dollars, weaknesses  existed in several areas, including agencies\u2019 data center consolidation  plans, data center optimization, and OMB\u2019s tracking and reporting on  related cost savings. Further, we previously reported that VA\u2019s progress  toward closing data centers, and realizing the associated cost savings,  lagged behind that of other covered agencies.", "More recently, VA reported a total inventory of 415 data centers, of which  39 had been closed as of August 2017. While the department  anticipates another 10 data centers will be closed by the end of fiscal year  2018, these closures fall short of the targets set by OMB. Specifically,  even if VA meets all of its planned targets for closure, it will only close  about 9 percent of its tiered data centers and about 18.7 percent of its  non-tiered data centers by the end of fiscal year 2018, which is short of  the respective 25 and 60 percent targets set by OMB. Further, while VA  has reported $23.61 million in data center-related cost savings and  avoidances for 2012 through August 2017, the department does not  expect to realize further savings from the additional 10 data center  closures in the next year.", "In addition, in August 2017 we reported that agencies needed to address  challenges in optimizing their data centers in order to achieve cost  savings. Specifically, we noted that, according to the 24 agencies\u2019 data  center consolidation initiative strategic plans as of April 2017, most  agencies were not planning to meet OMB\u2019s optimization targets by the  end of fiscal year 2018.", "As of February 2017, VA reported meeting one of the five data center  optimization metrics related to power usage effectiveness. Also, the  department\u2019s data center optimization strategic plan indicates that the  department plans to meet three of the five metrics by the end of fiscal  year 2018. Further, while OMB directed agencies to replace manual collection and reporting of metrics with automated tools no later than  fiscal year 2018, VA had only implemented automated tools at 6 percent  of its data centers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s CIO Has Certified Adequate Incremental Development for Its Major IT Investments for Fiscal Year 2017, but Needs to Update Related Policy", "paragraphs": ["OMB has emphasized the need to deliver investments in smaller parts, or  increments, in order to reduce risk, deliver capabilities more quickly, and  facilitate the adoption of emerging technologies. In 2010, it called for  agencies\u2019 major investments to deliver functionality every 12 months and,  since 2012, every 6 months. Subsequently, FITARA codified a  requirement that agency CIOs certify that IT investments are adequately  implementing incremental development, as defined in the capital planning  guidance issued by OMB. Later OMB guidance on the law\u2019s  implementation\u2014issued in June 2015\u2014directed agency CIOs to define  processes and policies for their agencies which ensure that they certify  that IT resources are adequately implementing incremental  development.", "Between May 2014 and November 2017, we reported on agencies\u2019 efforts  to utilize incremental development practices for selected major  investments. In November 2017, we noted that agencies reported that  62 percent of major IT software development investments were certified  by the agency CIO as using adequate incremental development in fiscal  year 2017, as required by FITARA. VA\u2019s CIO certified the use of  adequate incremental development for all 10 of its major IT investments.

Effective management of software licenses can help organizations avoid  purchasing too many licenses that result in unused software. In addition,  effective management can help avoid purchasing too few licenses, which  results in noncompliance with license terms and causes the imposition of  additional fees. Federal agencies are responsible for managing their IT  investment portfolios, including the risks from their major information  system initiatives, in order to maximize the value of these investments to  the agency.", "OMB developed a policy that requires agencies to conduct an annual,  agency-wide IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce  commodity IT spending. Such areas of spending could include software  licenses. We previously identified seven elements that a comprehensive  software licensing policy should address:  identify clear roles, responsibilities, and central oversight authority  within the department for managing enterprise software license  agreements and commercial software licenses; establish a comprehensive inventory (at least 80 percent of software  license spending and/or enterprise licenses in the department) by  identifying and collecting information about software license  agreements using automated discovery and inventory tools;  regularly track and maintain software licenses to assist the agency in  implementing decisions throughout the software license management  life cycle; analyze software usage and other data to make cost-effective provide training relevant to software license management; establish goals and objectives of the software license management  consider the software license management life-cycle phases (i.e.,  requisition, reception, deployment and maintenance, retirement, and  disposal phases) to implement effective decision making and  incorporate existing standards, processes, and metrics.", "We previously made recommendations to VA to (1) develop an agency- wide comprehensive policy for the management of software licenses that  includes guidance for using analysis to better inform investment decision  making, (2) employ a centralized software license management approach  that is coordinated and integrated with key personnel, (3) establish a  comprehensive inventory of software licenses using automated tools, (4)  track and maintain a comprehensive inventory of software licenses using  automated tools and metrics, (5) analyze agency-wide software license  data to identify opportunities to reduce costs and better inform investment  decision making, and (6) provide software license management training to  appropriate personnel.", "Consistent with our recommendation, in July 2015, VA issued a  comprehensive software licensing policy that addressed weaknesses we  previously identified. The department also issued a directive that  documents VA\u2019s software license management policy and responsibilities  for central management of agency-wide software licenses, consistent with  our recommendations. By implementing our recommendations, VA should  be better positioned to consistently and cost-effectively manage software  throughout the agency.", "In August 2017, the department also provided documentation showing  that it had generated a comprehensive inventory of software licenses  using automated tools for the majority of agency software license  spending or enterprise-wide licenses. This inventory can serve to reduce  redundant applications and help identify other cost saving opportunities.", "Further, the department implemented a solution to analyze agency-wide  software license data, including usage and costs. This solution should  allow VA to identify cost saving opportunities and inform future investment  decisions. In addition, the department has provided information indicating  that appropriate personnel receive software license management training.", "In conclusion, VA has made extensive use of numerous contractors and  has obligated more than $1 billion for contracts that supported two of four  VistA modernization programs that the department has initiated. VA has  recently begun the fourth modernization program in which it plans to  replace VistA with the same commercially available electronic health  record system that is used by DOD. However, the department\u2019s latest  modernization effort is in the early stages of planning and is dependent  on the system acquisition contract award in December 2017. VA\u2019s  completion and effective execution of plans will be essential to guiding  this latest electronic health record modernization initiative to a successful  outcome.", "Beyond VistA, the department continues to make progress on key  FITARA-related initiatives. Although the department has made progress  in the area of software licensing, additional actions in the areas of data  center consolidation and optimization, as well as incremental system  development can better position VA to effectively manage its IT.
