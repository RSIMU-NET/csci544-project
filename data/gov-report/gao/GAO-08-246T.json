The UN ethics office has taken steps to improve organizational ethics, including implementing a whistleblower protection policy, but GAO identified issues that may limit the impact of the policy. The UN has taken steps to improve oversight, including establishing an Independent Audit Advisory Committee. However, UN funding arrangements continue to constrain the independence of the Secretariat's internal audit office and its ability to audit high-risk areas. The UN has taken steps to improve certain procurement practices, but has not implemented an independent bid protest system or approved a lead agency concept, which could improve procurement services. The UN has taken steps to improve certain management operations of the Secretariat, but has made little or no progress in others. Despite some limited initial actions, the UN's review of mandates has not advanced, due in part to a lack of support by many member states. Finally, the pace of UN management reforms has been slowed by member states' disagreements on reform efforts, lack of comprehensive implementation plans, administrative issues that complicate certain internal processes, and competing UN priorities. GAO's report on oversight and accountability of selected UN organizations notes that, although the six UN internal audit offices GAO reviewed have made progress in implementing international auditing standards, they have not fully implemented key components of the standards. None of these six organizations require their internal oversight staff to disclose their financial interests. However, GAO found that five of the six organizations have made efforts to increase accountability by establishing whistleblower protection policies and one was developing such a policy. GAO also reported that while the six UN evaluation offices GAO reviewed are working toward implementation of UN evaluation standards, they have not fully implemented them. Finally, GAO reported that the governing bodies responsible for oversight of the six organizations lack full access to internal audit reports. GAO's report on Burma notes that Burma's military regime has blocked or significantly impeded UN and other international organizations' efforts to address human rights concerns and to help people living in areas affected by ethnic conflict. The regime frustrated international organizations' efforts to monitor forced labor for years before signing an agreement in early 2007; restricted their efforts to assist populations living in conflict areas; and blocked their efforts to monitor prison conditions and conflict situations. The regime has, to a lesser degree, impeded UN food, development, and health programs. However, several UN and other international organization officials told GAO they are still able to achieve meaningful results in their efforts to mitigate some of Burma's humanitarian, health, and development problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss United Nations (UN) operations  in the context of three key issues: (1) the progress of management reform  efforts at the UN Secretariat since 2006; (2) weaknesses in oversight and  accountability in selected UN organizations; and (3) constraints upon UN  and other international organizations\u2019 activities in Burma. Events over the  past several decades indicate that there is a continuing need to reform and  modernize the UN in areas including management, oversight, and  accountability.

In September 2005, world leaders gathered at the  UN World Summit in New York to discuss a variety of issues of  importance to the UN, including management reforms. The outcome  document from the summit called for the Secretary-General to submit  proposals for implementing management reforms of the Secretariat. In  October 2006, we reported that progress had been slow in five key UN  management reform areas, with numerous reform proposals awaiting  General Assembly review, and that many of the proposed or approved  reforms lacked an implementation plan with time frames and cost  estimates.", "Oversight is a key activity in governance that addresses whether  organizations are carrying out their responsibilities and serves to detect  and deter public corruption. Oversight functions include monitoring,  evaluating, and reporting on the organization\u2019s performance; auditing of  the organization\u2019s financial results and effectiveness of its internal  controls; and holding senior management accountable for results.  Oversight also includes investigation of allegations of fraud.

This  assistance includes programs aimed at mitigating the effects of prison  conditions, forced labor, and conflicts in Burma\u2019s ethnic areas. The UN is  also attempting to provide food to vulnerable populations, promote local  economic development, improve health conditions, and strengthen the  Burmese educational system. In recent years, UN entities have increased  their funding for activities aimed at addressing Burma\u2019s problems. UN  entities informed us that they spent about $218 million in Burma from 2002  through 2005. Nevertheless, Burma\u2019s military regime distanced itself from  the international organizations and began adopting increasingly restrictive  policies after the regime underwent an internal purge in 2004, according to  UN officials. The regime published guidelines in 2006 to restrict the  activities of the international organizations.

The ethics office has made substantial progress in increasing staffing and  in enforcing a whistleblower protection policy. In addition, the UN has  made some progress in developing ethics standards and in enforcing  financial disclosure requirements. However, concerns have been raised  that the success of the whistleblower protection policy is, in part,  dependent on reforms in the UN internal justice system that are not  projected to be completed until 2009. In addition, the policy is potentially  limited by the ethics office\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over UN funds and  programs.  After we issued our November 2007 report, the Secretary- General issued a bulletin calling for system-wide ethics standards for the  Secretariat, programs, and funds.  The bulletin outlined the guidelines and  responsibilities for UN ethics offices of programs and funds and also  stated that, if a program or fund does not have a policy in place for  protection against retaliation, staff members of that program or fund may  request protection from retaliation under the Secretariat\u2019s policy.", "Although the UN has improved its oversight capability, the Office of  Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) has not yet achieved financial and  operational independence. In June 2007, member states created an  Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC) and, since then, the UN  has made some progress in making it operational. The committee\u2019s five  members were elected in November 2007, and the committee is expected  to be operational by January 2008. Since October 2006, some progress has  been made in strengthening OIOS. Although OIOS has improved the  capacity of individual divisions, including internal audit and investigations,  UN funding arrangements continue to constrain its ability to audit high- risk areas, and member states have not yet agreed on whether to grant  OIOS financial and operational independence.", "The UN has taken steps to improve its procurement process, but some  reform issues have not moved forward since October 2006. Activities on  which some progress has been made are the strengthening of procedures  for UN procurement staff and suppliers, developing a comprehensive  training program for procurement staff, and developing a risk management  framework. However, the UN has made little or no progress in establishing  an independent bid protest system and creating a lead agency concept,  whereby specialist UN organizations would handle certain procurements  in order to enhance division of labor, reduce duplication, and reduce  costs. In addition, since our October 2006 report, the reorganization of the  Department of Peacekeeping Operations, along with its related  procurement activities, may affect the UN\u2019s overall procurement reform  efforts, such as establishing lines of accountability and delegation of  authority for the Departments of Management and Peacekeeping  Operations.", "Since our October 2006 report, the UN has improved some of the  management operations of the Secretariat, but many reform proposals  have not moved forward.

Although some progress was made in Phase I of the review, which ended  in December 2006, little or no progress has been made in Phase II because  member states continue to disagree on the nature and scope of the review  and lack the capacity to carry it out. As a result, the prioritization of this  particular UN management reform effort has decreased, according to UN  and State officials.

State also agreed fully with the need to keep  Congress informed of the effectiveness of management reforms, adding  that the department will continue to monitor and inform Congress, as we  recommended. State did not agree with our statement that successful  whistleblower protections are dependent, in part, on the reform of the  UN\u2019s internal justice program.
