GAO has previously reported on the challenges DOD faces in compiling, reviewing, and using the inventory. Since 2011, GAO made 13 recommendations intended to improve DOD's use of the inventory. Of these, DOD has yet to fully address 8 open recommendations.", "Congress included a provision in statute for GAO to report on DOD's required reviews and plans to use the inventory. This report assesses the extent to which DOD components (1) reviewed contracts and activities in the fiscal year 2014 inventory of contracted services, and (2) developed plans to use the inventory for decision making.

More components\u201421 out of 40\u2014addressed all of the required review elements compared to prior years. However, DOD components may continue to underreport the extent to which contractors were providing services that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions, a key review objective to help ensure that DOD has proper oversight in place. For example, GAO's analysis indicates that DOD obligated about $28 billion for contracts in 17 categories\u2014such as professional and management support services\u2014that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and GAO identified as more likely to include closely associated with inherently governmental functions. In comparison, components identified a total of $10.8 billion in obligations or dollars invoiced for contracts that included work identified as closely associated with inherently governmental functions\u2014either within the 17 categories or for any other category of service. Most of these functions were identified by the Army using its long-standing review process.", "The military departments have not yet developed plans to use the inventory to inform workforce mix, strategic workforce planning, and budget decision-making processes, as statutorily required. DOD has made some recent progress on requiring components to identify an accountable official to lead efforts to develop plans and establish processes for using their inventories in decision making, a step GAO recommended in November 2014.

DOD relies on contractors to perform various  functions, such as professional and management support, information  technology support, and weapon system support. Contractor personnel  constitute a key portion of DOD\u2019s total workforce, which also includes  DOD active and reserve forces and DOD civilian employees, and are vital  to helping DOD meet its mission. While there are benefits to using  contractors to perform services for the government, the government can  become overly reliant on contractors in some situations, such as when a  contractor performs functions that put an agency at risk of losing control  over functions that are core to its mission and operations.", "In recent years, Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD\u2019s ability to  manage its acquisitions of contracted services, to make more strategic  decisions about the appropriate workforce mix, and to better align  resource needs through the budget process to achieve that mix. As part  of these efforts, section 2330a of title 10 of the U.S. Code requires DOD  to annually compile, and the military departments and defense agencies  to review, an inventory of services contracted for or on behalf of DOD  during the preceding fiscal year. This inventory is intended, in part, to help  provide better insight into the number of contractor full-time equivalents  (FTE) providing services to the department and the functions they are  performing, and determine whether any of these functions warrant  conversion to DOD civilian performance. Further, this section also  requires DOD to undertake certain actions using these inventories.  Specifically, subsections (e) and (f), respectively, direct the secretaries of  the military departments or heads of the defense agencies to, among  other things  review the inventory to ensure that personal services contracts on the  list are performed under applicable statutes and regulations and  identify contracted functions that DOD should consider for conversion;  and develop a plan, including an enforcement mechanism and approval  process, to use the inventory for strategic workforce planning,  workforce mix, and budgeting decisions.", "Section 951(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2014 included a provision for us to report on DOD\u2019s implementation of  title 10 section 2330a subsections (e) and (f). This report assesses  DOD\u2019s efforts to implement these subsections, specifically (1) subsection  (e) to review contracts and activities in the inventory of contracted  services for the fiscal year 2014 inventory and (2) subsection (f) to  develop plans and processes to use the inventory for strategic workforce  planning, workforce mix, and budget decisions.", "To assess the extent to which DOD components\u2014which include the three  military departments and the defense agencies\u2014complied with the  requirements to review applicable contracts and activities in its inventory  of contracted services pursuant to subsection (e), we focused on DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 inventory and associated review, which was the latest  inventory and review available when we initiated our work. We reviewed  DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2014 inventory submission and review guidance,  issued on December 29, 2014 by the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) and the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)). This  guidance required the military departments and defense agencies to  certify\u2014through submission of a certification letter to the USD(P&R)\u2014that  their review was conducted in accordance with subsection (e). The  guidance also required components to report on six elements, such as  the extent to which contractors were found to be performing inherently  governmental functions and those closely associated with inherently  governmental functions, among other elements. The number of DOD  components submitting annual inventories and the associated review  certification letters has varied since fiscal year 2011 in part because, prior  to its fiscal year 2014 guidance, DOD had not identified a list of  components required to submit and review an inventory. For this report,  we focused on the 40 components that compiled a fiscal year 2014  inventory and submitted an unclassified review certification letter to  USD(P&R) by July 2016. We analyzed these 40 unclassified certification  letters to determine if components addressed all six required elements.  We also interviewed officials at USD(P&R) and USD(AT&L) responsible  for the inventory to assess changes made to the inventory guidance and  the review and certification process. We interviewed officials at each of  the military departments\u2014the Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014responsible for  compiling and reviewing the inventory regarding internal guidance on the  inventory of contracted services. We also reviewed relevant DOD Office  of the Inspector General reports on the inventory of contracted services.  To gauge the extent to which DOD components identified instances in  which contractors may be performing activities closely associated with  inherently governmental functions, we identified total obligations for  contracts in the inventory that were categorized under the 17 product  service codes that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and  GAO identified as likely to include closely associated with inherently  governmental functions. We compared these obligations to total  obligations certified by DOD components as for contractors performing  closely associated with inherently governmental functions in the fiscal  year 2014 certification letters. To assess the reliability of the inventory  submission data, we compared the submission data to the Federal  Procurement Data System \u2013 Next Generation (FPDS-NG) data for fiscal  year 2014, reviewed related documentation, and interviewed DOD  officials knowledgeable about the data. Based on these steps, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objective. We did not independently assess the accuracy or  reliability of the underlying data supporting the components\u2019 inventories of  contracted services and associated reviews.", "To assess the extent to which DOD components have developed plans  and enforcement mechanisms to use the inventory to inform management  decisions pursuant to subsection (f), we used the data we collected for  our November 2014 report on this issue to establish the extent to which  each military department\u2019s strategic workforce planning, manpower mix,  and budgeting guidance and processes required or cited the use of the  inventory of contracted services. We then interviewed officials from each  military department to determine what updates, if any, had been made to  the guidance and processes. We confirmed whether the guidance  identified in our November 2014 report remained current as of July 2016,  and identified any changes made subsequent to that report. We also  interviewed acquisition and manpower officials at each military  department to assess the status of the military department\u2019s plans to  identify an accountable official to lead and coordinate efforts to develop  plans and enforcement mechanisms. We reviewed components\u2019 fiscal  year 2014 inventory submissions to determine the extent to which  components increased their use of the Contractor Manpower Reporting  Application (CMRA) for developing their inventories compared to prior  years.

We recommended that the  department develop a plan of action to facilitate the department\u2019s intent of  collecting manpower data and address other limitations to its current  approach to meeting inventory requirements. The department concurred  with our recommendation but had not addressed it as of August 2016.

In a December  2015 report on civilian and contractor personnel reductions, we found that  limitations in the methodology for contractor FTE estimates in the  inventory may hinder efforts to implement statutorily mandated reporting  on reductions in contractor personnel. Further, in a February 2016  report on DOD efforts to forecast service contract requirements, we found  that existing data on DOD\u2019s future spending for contracted service  requirements was not fully captured by DOD\u2019s programming and budget  processes, an effort the inventory of contracted services is intended to  support.

In November 2014, we  recommended, in part, that DOD revise its guidance to clearly identify the  basis for selecting contracts to review and to provide approaches the  components may use to conduct inventory reviews to ensure that the  nature of how the contract is being performed is adequately considered.  In November 2015, we reported that DOD\u2019s December 2014 guidance for  the fiscal year 2014 inventory did not address our recommendation to  provide such clarification; however, DOD officials noted that a risk-based  approach to select which contracts to review may be appropriate.

DOD officials noted that, to some  degree, these reviews have contributed to delays in choosing the path  forward for its underlying inventory data collection system, staffing the  support office, and formalizing the roles and responsibilities of that office  and its relationship to the military departments and other stakeholders.  These delays may, in turn, hinder the development and implementation of  plans and enforcement mechanisms for using inventory data to inform  workforce and budget decision-making processes.", "As shown in figure 5, DOD has struggled since 2011 to determine the  best way forward for collecting data for the inventories.", "In September 2014, DOD undertook an internal review of strategic  options to identify, develop, and consider all reasonable options, in both  the short and long terms, and propose courses of action for appropriate  enterprise solutions to facilitate data collection for the inventory. However,  DOD\u2019s strategic review of options in 2014 did not lead to a definitive way  forward. In November 2014, we found that DOD\u2019s strategic review of  options raised questions as to whether DOD will continue to implement  ECMRA\u2014a DOD-wide inventory data collection system modeled after the  Army\u2019s CMRA system\u2014or attempt to develop a new system. We  concluded that, until such time as DOD components are able to collect  the required data for their inventories, the utility of the inventory for  making workforce decisions will be hindered. We recommended that,  should a decision be made to use or develop a system other than the  ECMRA system currently being fielded, USD(P&R) should document the  rationale for doing so and ensure that the new approach provides data  that satisfies the statutory requirements for the inventory. In 2015, the  Joint Explanatory Statement to the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2016 mandated that DOD report on the approach the  department is taking to comply with the inventory requirement and  whether it is producing a product that enhances oversight of service  contracting activities. DOD contracted with the RAND National Defense  Research Institute in December 2015 to assess the methods used by  DOD to produce the inventory of contracted services and to recommend  improvements, including alternative methods of collecting, processing,  and reporting data on contracted services. RAND provided preliminary  briefings to DOD in March and May of 2016, and its final report is  expected to be delivered later this year.", "While awaiting the results of its internal review and, subsequently, the  RAND review, DOD delayed fully staffing its support office and defining its  specific roles, authorities, and relationships to the military departments  and other stakeholders, as shown in figure 6.", "In 2014, a USD(P&R) official told us that DOD would defer the use of  additional resources for the support office until such time as there had  been a decision whether to pursue a new approach or continue forward  with implementation of ECMRA. Similarly, in 2016, USD(P&R) officials  told us that they wanted to be more confident of the planned direction for  the inventories before committing to additional hiring.", "Further, more than two years since the support office was funded, DOD  has yet to define the roles and responsibilities of the office. In November  2015, we recommended that USD(P&R) clearly identify these longer term  relationships between the support office, military departments, and other  stakeholders with respect to collection and use of inventory data. DOD  concurred and told us that the release of a memorandum of agreement  between the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve  Affairs and the Director of the Defense Human Resource Activity on short  term roles and responsibilities for the support office would do so, but as of  August 2016, the memorandum of agreement had yet to be formalized.  Additionally, DOD officials indicated that the memorandum of agreement  will not address the roles to be played by the support office, the military  departments, and other stakeholders in exploring the longer term solution  to collecting contractor manpower data and integrating inventory data  within the military departments\u2019 decision-making processes.  Supplemental agreements will be necessary to formalize these  relationships. The absence of clearly identified relationships between the  support office and other stakeholders has hindered efforts to implement  ECMRA and integrate the data into decision-making processes that will  meet user needs and expectations.", "In addition to these uncertainties about finalizing an approach to the  inventory, our review found that DOD components\u2019 reliance on data  captured in their CMRA systems for their inventories has varied. DOD\u2019s  March 2014 guidance for the fiscal year 2013 inventory, as well as  guidance for subsequent inventories, required components to include the  percentage of their total contracts that were reported by contractors in  their CMRA system and the extent to which reported data were used to  support their inventory submission. Contractors are required to report  labor hour data by the end of October for work executed during the period  of performance within the one year period beginning October 1 of the  prior year and ending September 30. DOD components are then  supposed to use this contractor-reported data from CMRA to help  develop their inventories. We found that 22 out of the 40 components,  comprising about 96 percent of total FTEs reported in the DOD inventory,  reported using CMRA data for the fiscal year 2014 inventory submission.  In contrast, only nine components reported using CMRA to do so in the  fiscal year 2013 inventory. Table 2 identifies changes in use of CMRA  data by the military departments from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2015.", "Air Force and Navy both continue to rely heavily on FPDS-NG data to  derive the contractor FTEs for those contracts not entered into CMRA.  Navy officials stated that they do not view all contractor-reported CMRA  data to yet be robust enough to support consistent, reliable use for the  inventory. However, as we have previously reported, the FPDS-NG  system has several limitations that limit its utility for purposes of compiling  a complete and accurate inventory, including not being able to identify and record more than one type of service  purchased for each contracting action entered into the system, not being able to capture any services performed under contracts that  are predominantly for supplies, not being able to identify the requiring activity specifically, not capturing service contracts awarded on behalf of DOD by non- not being able to determine the number of contractor FTEs used to  perform each service.", "Since 2011, we have made 13 recommendations to help improve how  DOD collects, reviews, and uses the data from the inventory of contracted  services (see appendix I for a complete list and the status of DOD\u2019s  actions to address them). We are not making any new recommendations  in this report, but rather we underscore the need to address the 8  recommendations that remain open. In particular, DOD needs to resolve  the long-standing delays and uncertainties regarding implementation of  the ECMRA system\u2014or an alternative to that system\u2014which have  hindered efforts to provide reliable and accurate data. Over five years  ago, we recommended that DOD develop a plan of action with  timeframes and necessary resources to measure DOD\u2019s progress in  implementing a common data system and we offered a similar  recommendation two years ago when it began to explore options for an  appropriate enterprise solution to facilitate data collection. Delays in  making that decision have had a cascading effect on fully staffing its  management support office, as well as defining the roles, responsibilities,  and relationships between this office, the military departments, and other  stakeholders. Continued delays in making a decision increase the risk  that DOD will remain unable to collect and analyze service contract data  and develop associated business processes in a manner that supports  workforce and budget planning. Conversely, choosing a path forward,  providing a rationale for that choice, and developing a plan of action with  implementation timeframes and milestones could help the department  move toward an environment in which it can stop endlessly agonizing on  whether to use ECMRA or an alternative system and focus on what data  to collect and how best to use that data once collected. As we concluded  in January 2011, the real benefit of the inventory will ultimately be  measured by its ability to inform decision making. We further noted that  the absence of a way forward was hindering the achievement of this  objective. More than five years later, those conclusions remain  unchanged."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making new recommendations in this report.
