This report describes (1) key controls designed to prevent medically unfit or impaired commercial drivers from operating commercial vehicles and (2) examples of commercial drivers with potentially disqualifying impairments related to epilepsy, drugs, or alcohol.", "To identify key controls, GAO reviewed FMCSA policies and regulations, and interviewed officials. Cases were identified on the basis of FMCSA roadside-inspection data, DOT\u0092s Commercial Driver License Information System (CDLIS), a national database of all commercial drivers, and SSA disability insurance files. From this analysis, GAO identified commercial drivers who were driving with an epilepsy diagnosis. GAO also randomly selected 100 individuals to determine whether the driver was receiving SSA disability benefits when the state issued or renewed the driver\u0092s CDL. These cases cannot be generalized beyond those presented.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to SSA and DOT. SSA did not have any comments. DOT provided technical comments, which have been addressed in the report, as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), part of the Department of Transportation (DOT), has established a number of key controls designed to prevent commercial driver\u0092s license (CDL) holders from operating commercial vehicles while impaired. First, drivers are required to undergo regular medical exams by a certified medical examiner. Second, employers are responsible for drug testing employees at various points of employment. Third, state and federal roadside-inspection programs are in place to identify impaired drivers and perform other safety checks. If these key controls are operating effectively, they will help identify commercial drivers who are not capable of driving safely. However, GAO\u0092s prior work has found that these controls were vulnerable to abuse or manipulation. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, enacted in July 2012, will require additional measures to ensure that disqualified drivers do not operate commercial vehicles, and could help address some of these vulnerabilities. For example, the law requires DOT to implement a national clearinghouse of commercial-driver controlled-substance and alcohol test results by July 2014. DOT has also taken some actions, and now requires CDL holders to provide a copy of their medical certificates to the State licensing agency.", "Matching CDL holders with Social Security Administration (SSA) disability files produced 204 commercial drivers who drove a commercial vehicle as recently as 2011 despite having epilepsy, a disqualifying medical condition characterized by sudden seizures and unconsciousness. Thirty-one of these drivers were involved in accidents, demonstrating the threat to public safety posed by medically impaired drivers. GAO also identified 23 cases where state licensing agencies issued or renewed CDLs for drivers after they were, according to SSA records, diagnosed with epilepsy or had drug or alcohol dependence noted, which could also disqualify them from driving under DOT regulations.", "However, because DOT did not require state licensing agencies to maintain drivers\u0092 medical certifications at the time of GAO\u0092s review, it is unlikely that states knew of the drivers\u0092 conditions. In fact, they were unable to provide medical certifications for any of the 23 individuals. States are now required to electronically store medical certificates for new and renewing CDL applicants and will be required to electronically maintain this information for all CDL holders by January 2014. Doing so could help prevent ineligible drivers from obtaining or renewing CDLs in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Millions of Americans hold commercial driver\u2019s licenses (CDL), allowing  them to operate tractor trailers, school buses, cargo vans, or other  commercial vehicles on our nation\u2019s roads and highways.

For example, a first conviction of driving under the influence  of alcohol or a controlled substance, regardless of whether it occurs in a  commercial or personal vehicle, results in immediate CDL suspension by  the issuing state for 12 months. A second results in permanent  suspension. Licensing states are required to maintain driver records  showing convictions for disqualifying federal violations and are to  disqualify commercial drivers convicted of those violations while driving a  commercial vehicle.

SSA documentation states that  in January 2009, a physician noted that this individual was unable to  participate in employment or training activities in any capacity due to  paranoid schizophrenia. However, this individual obtained a CDL from  Virginia in June 2010. We did not receive a medical examination form  or certificate for this individual from the state that issued his CDL and  thus were unable to determine whether a medical examiner  considered or was aware of the driver\u2019s condition or whether a  medical examination occurred. In October 2010, he refused to submit  to an alcohol test while operating a commercial motor vehicle. This  refusal led to a DWI conviction and permanent CDL suspension in  February 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Could Not Provide Medical Examination Certificates", "paragraphs": ["Since most state driver\u2019s licensing agencies do not require a medical  examination report to be presented to them, according to DOT, they were  unable to provide these reports or medical certificates that we requested  for 29 of the 30 individuals who had CDLs issued or renewed after  becoming eligible for SSA benefits. We were therefore unable to  determine whether medical examiners considered or were aware of each  driver\u2019s conditions or whether a medical examination occurred for these   individuals. While FMCSA regulations are meant to prevent an individual  with these conditions from receiving or renewing a CDL, states were not  required to obtain and maintain medical certifications or medical  examination reports at the time of our review. According to DOT, only a  few states on their own authority required CDL holders to provide either a  medical examination report or medical certificate. As mentioned earlier,  as of January 30, 2012, FMCSA requires states to electronically store  medical certificates for new and renewing CDL applicants and are  required to electronically post this information for all CDL holders to the  state\u2019s CDLIS driver records. States will also be required to report the  date of the medical certification to the state\u2019s CDLIS driver record. In  addition, the MAP-21 Act requires medical certificate information to be  transmitted to DOT on a monthly basis and mandates that states  establish and maintain the capability to receive an electronic copy of a  medical examiner\u2019s certificate for each CDL holder licensed in that state  who operates or intends to operate in interstate commerce. If these  requirements are properly implemented and followed, they should help to  prevent situations similar to these case studies from recurring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft copy of this report to SSA and DOT.
