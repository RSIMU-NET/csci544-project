Instead of conducting risk assessments, since September 2011, FPS\u0092s inspectors have collected information, such as the location, purpose, agency contacts, and current countermeasures (e.g., perimeter security, access controls, and closed-circuit television systems). This information notwithstanding, FPS has a backlog of federal facilities that have not been assessed for several years. According to FPS\u0092s data, more than 5,000 facilities were to be assessed in fiscal years 2010 through 2012. However, GAO was unable to determine the extent of FPS\u0092s facility security assessment (FSA) backlog because the data were unreliable. Multiple agencies have expended resources to conduct risk assessments, even though the agencies also already pay FPS for this service. FPS received $236 million in basic security fees from agencies to conduct FSAs and other security services in fiscal year 2011. Beyond not having a reliable tool for conducting assessments, FPS continues to lack reliable data, which has hampered the agency\u0092s ability to manage its FSA program.", "FPS has an interim vulnerability assessment tool, referred to as the Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST), which it plans to use to assess federal facilities until it develops a longer-term solution. According to FPS, once implemented, MIST will allow it to resume assessing federal facilities\u0092 vulnerabilities and recommend countermeasures\u0097something FPS has not done consistently for several years. Furthermore, in developing MIST, FPS generally followed GAO\u0092s project management best practices, such as conducting user acceptance testing. However, MIST has some limitations. Most notably, MIST does not estimate the consequences of an undesirable event occurring at a facility. Three of the four risk assessment experts GAO spoke with generally agreed that a tool that does not estimate consequences does not allow an agency to fully assess risks. FPS officials stated that they did not include consequence information in MIST because it was not part of the original design and thus requires more time to validate. MIST also was not designed to compare risks across federal facilities. Thus, FPS has limited assurance that critical risks at federal facilities are being prioritized and mitigated.", "FPS continues to face challenges in overseeing its approximately 12,500 contract guards. FPS developed the Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) to help it oversee its contract guard workforce by (1) verifying that guards are trained and certified, and (2) conducting guard post inspections. However, FPS faced challenges using RAMP, such as verifying guard training and certification information, for either purpose and has recently determined that it would no longer use RAMP. Without a comprehensive system, it is more difficult for FPS to oversee its contract guard workforce. FPS is verifying guard certification and training information by conducting monthly audits of guard contractor training and certification information.

As a result, FPS\u2019s Director decided that the agency would stop  using RAMP to conduct FSAs and instead pursue an interim tool to  replace it. In September 2011, FPS began working with Argonne National  Laboratory to develop a vulnerability assessment tool referred to as the  Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool (MIST). FPS plans to use MIST to  assess the vulnerabilities of federal facilities until the agency develops a  permanent replacement for RAMP.

However, FPS experienced difficulty with RAMP  because the contract guard training and certification information in RAMP  was not reliable.conduct post inspections. For example, FPS inspectors we interviewed  stated they could not use RAMP to conduct post inspections because of  difficulty connecting to RAMP\u2019s servers in remote areas and recorded  post inspections disappearing from RAMP\u2019s record without explanation.  Although we reported some of these challenges in 2011, FPS did not stop  using RAMP for guard oversight until June 2012. Consequently, it is now  more difficult for FPS to verify that guards on post are trained and  certified and that inspectors are conducting guard post inspections as  required.", "Additionally, FPS faced challenges using RAMP to  According to FPS officials, the agency decided to no longer use RAMP for  these and other reasons, including the expiration of the RAMP operations  and maintenance contract in June 2012 and FPS\u2019s decision to migrate  data from RAMP. In the absence of RAMP, in June 2012, FPS decided to  deploy an interim method to enable inspectors to record post inspections.

FPS currently requires its 33  guard contractors to maintain their own files containing guard training and  certification information and began requiring them to submit a monthly  report with this information to FPS\u2019s regions in July 2011. To verify the  guard companies\u2019 reports, FPS conducts monthly audits. As part of its  monthly audit process, FPS regional staff visits the contractor\u2019s office to  select 10 percent of the contractor\u2019s guard files and check them against  the reports guard companies send FPS each month.", "In addition, in October 2011, FPS undertook a month-long audit of every  guard file for its contracts across its 11 regions.

Most notably, FPS has  developed an interim vulnerability assessment tool that once  implemented, may allow it to resume assessing federal facilities, which it  has not done consistently for several years. However, FPS\u2019s lack of  progress in developing a risk assessment tool that meets federal physical  security standards such as NIPP\u2019s risk management framework is  problematic for several reasons. First, FPS spent almost 4 years and $35  million dollars on RAMP and another $875,000 on MIST but still does not  have a risk assessment tool that meets NIPP\u2019s risk management  framework that can calculate risk using threat, vulnerability, and  consequence information. Second, without a risk assessment tool that  can compare risks across its portfolio, FPS cannot provide assurance that  the most critical risks at federal facilities are being prioritized and  mitigated. Third, some federal agencies are expending additional  resources to conduct their own risk assessments in addition to paying  FPS to complete them. Fourth, federal tenant agencies do not have  critical information needed to make risk-based decisions about how to  upgrade the security of their facilities. Identifying ways to resolve these  issues could greatly enhance FPS\u2019s efforts to assess risk at federal  facilities and reduce duplication of effort, among other things.", "We recognize that MIST is an interim tool and is not yet fully  implemented; however, it has limitations that could affect FPS\u2019s ability to  protect federal facilities and provide security services. FPS generally  increased its use of our project management best practices, as we  recommended, and we encourage it to continue to do so in any future  development of a risk assessment tool. However, FPS has not improved  the accuracy and reliability of its FSA and contract guard data as it  agreed to do in response to our previous recommendation. Given that  FPS is still experiencing difficulties managing its FSA data, we reiterate  the importance of this prior recommendation and encourage FPS to take  action to address it.", "Finally, FPS recently decided to not use RAMP to oversee its contract  guards, but still does not have a comprehensive and reliable system to  ensure that its approximately 12,500 contract guards have met training  and certification requirements, and that FPS\u2019s guard post inspections are  occurring in accordance with the agency\u2019s guidelines. That FPS cannot  ensure that its 33 contractors are providing accurate information on its  guards is also problematic. Without a comprehensive and reliable system  for contract guard oversight, FPS is relying primarily on information  provided by guard companies.

These data included the GSA facility  identifier, address, city, state, zip code, FPS region, facility security level,  date of the last FSA, and the date of the next scheduled FSA. However,  we could not determine the extent of FPS\u2019s FSA backlog because FPS\u2019s  data contained a number of missing and incorrect values that made it  unreliable. We also visited 3 of FPS\u2019s 11 regions and interviewed regional  managers, area commanders, and inspectors about how they are  completing FSAs in the absence of RAMP. We selected these 3 regions  based on the number of federal facilities in the region and their facility  security levels, the number of contract guards in the region, and  geographic dispersion. Our work is not generalizable to all FPS regions.  We also interviewed FPS headquarters officials to understand how the  agency is currently conducting FSAs. During our visits to the selected 3  FPS regions, we spoke with officials from the General Services  Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Highway  Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and United  States Citizenship and Immigration Services to obtain their perspectives  on FPS\u2019s assessment efforts. These agencies were selected because  they are members of their facility security committees, which have  responsibility for addressing security issues at their respective facilities  and approving countermeasures recommended by FPS.", "To determine the status of FPS\u2019s efforts to develop an FSA tool, we  reviewed FPS\u2019s documents including: the interagency agreement,  requirements plan, project plan, system test plan, and training plan for  MIST.

We  examined FPS\u2019s requirement and project documents to determine  whether in developing MIST, FPS complied with selected GAO and  industry project-management best practices, such as: conducting  alternative analysis, managing requirements, and conducting user  acceptance testing. These practices were selected because they are  critical in developing information technology systems and we  recommended in 2011 that FPS better manage its requirements and  conduct user acceptance testing in developing future tools. We  interviewed FPS headquarters and regional officials as well as inspectors,  representatives from Argonne National Laboratory who are responsible  for developing MIST, officials from NPPD\u2019s Office of Infrastructure  Protection, and four risk management experts. We selected our four risk  assessment experts from a list of individuals who participated in the  Comptroller General\u2019s 2008 risk management forum.
