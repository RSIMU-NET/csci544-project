GAO selected 9 of 53 ISC member agencies based on their missions and number of facilities. GAO compared each selected agency's risk assessment methodology to ISC's risk assessment standards.

As a result, these six agencies may not have a complete understanding of the risks facing approximately 52,000 federal facilities and may be less able to allocate security resources cost-effectively at the individual facility level or across the agencies' facility portfolios. ISC's The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities ( RMP ) standard requires that agencies' facility risk assessment methodologies must (1) consider all of the undesirable events identified in the RMP as possible risks to federal facilities, and (2) assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to specific undesirable events. Six of the nine agencies' methodologies GAO reviewed do not align with ISC's standards because the methodologies do not (1) consider all of the undesirable events in the RMP or (2) assess threat, consequences, or vulnerability to specific undesirable events. For example, five agencies (DOI, VA, FEMA, FPS, and NRC), do not assess the threat, consequences, or vulnerability to specific undesirable events, as ISC requires. The reasons why varied; for example, VA said that its methodology was in place before ISC issued its standards. Officials from that agency told us they were working to update their methodology.", "ISC has issued a series of physical security standards and guidance to assist member agencies with developing their risk assessment methodologies, but does not know the extent to which its 53 member agencies comply with its standards, including its risk assessment standards, because it does not monitor agencies' compliance. ISC does not monitor compliance or have an approach to do so that incorporates outreach to agencies regarding their compliance status. Officials stated that they would like to monitor agencies' compliance, but limited resources and other priorities, such as developing standards and guidance, have prevented them from doing so. However, ISC has the authority to create a working group from its member agencies to help it perform its duties. In the absence of ISC's monitoring, agencies' risk assessment methodologies may not align with ISC's standards. In addition, although ISC issued risk assessment guidance in August 2013, this guidance is limited. For example, the guidance does not describe how to incorporate threat, consequence, or vulnerability assessments of specific undesirable events into a risk assessment methodology. Not having appropriate guidance is inconsistent with federal internal-control standards designed to promote effectiveness and efficiency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that ISC take action to assess member agencies' compliance and provide additional risk- assessment methodology guidance.

The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  Federal Protective Service (FPS) and about 30 other federal agencies are  responsible for protecting civilian federal facilities and their occupants  from violent threats or acts, in part, by assessing risks to their facilities.  However, our past work has raised questions about agencies\u2019 abilities to  assess risks to federal facilities. Essentially, assessing risk involves  evaluating threats (the intentions and capabilities of adversaries to initiate  undesirable events), consequences (the level, duration, and nature of  losses resulting from undesirable events), and vulnerabilities  (weaknesses in the design or operation of a facility that adversaries can  exploit), and recommending protective measures to mitigate risk. For  example, we reported in 2012 that FPS was not assessing risks to over  9,000 facilities under the custody and control of the General Services  Administration (GSA) in a manner that aligned with federal standards.", "To help federal agencies protect and assess risks to their facilities, the  Interagency Security Committee (ISC)\u2014a DHS-chaired organization  comprised of 53 member agencies\u2014developed a physical security  standard, The Risk Management Process for Federal Facilities (RMP),  with which federal executive branch agencies must comply. Among other  things, the RMP includes standards for agencies\u2019 facility risk assessment  methodologies. According to ISC, risk assessment methodologies that  meet its standards allow federal agencies to determine whether a facility\u2019s  existing protective measures are sufficient to mitigate risk and, if not,  identify the most cost-effective protective measures to reduce risks to an  acceptable level. Given the challenges FPS faces assessing risks to  federal facilities, you asked us to review how it and other federal agencies  are assessing risks to their facilities.", "This report addresses the following questions:", "To what extent do selected ISC member agencies\u2019 facility risk  assessment methodologies align with ISC\u2019s risk assessment  standards?", "How does ISC assist member agencies in developing risk assessment  methodologies and monitor their compliance with these standards?", "In addition, we describe in appendix II several risk assessment  approaches used by foreign governments and private entities that could  inform federal agencies\u2019 risk assessment methodologies.", "To determine the extent to which selected ISC member agencies\u2019 facility  risk assessment methodologies align with ISC\u2019s standards, we selected  nine of the 53 ISC member agencies that are required to comply with ISC  standards. We selected the nine agencies to achieve diversity with  respect to the agencies\u2019 missions, number of facilities, and ISC  membership type (primary or associate member agency). Selected  agencies are: the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Health, Safety, and  Security (DOE), the Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Law  Enforcement and Security (DOI), the Department of Justice\u2019s Justice  Protective Service (DOJ), the Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic  Security (State), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Protective Service  (FPS), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM). We compared each selected agency\u2019s  risk assessment methodology to ISC\u2019s risk assessment standards, which  are outlined in the RMP. These standards generally require agencies to  consider, at a minimum, all the undesirable events in the RMP and  assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to specific undesirable  events. We also interviewed officials about their agencies\u2019 risk  assessment methodologies and reviewed documentation. For more  information about how we determined the extent to which agencies\u2019  methodologies align with ISC\u2019s risk assessment standards, see appendix  I. Our findings from our review of the selected agencies are not  generalizable to all ISC member agencies, but provide insight into and  illustrative examples about agencies\u2019 facility risk assessment  methodologies.

We also interviewed officials  from the nine selected ISC member agencies regarding ISC\u2019s risk  assessment assistance, including its risk assessment guidance contained  in the RMP. In addition, to assess the comprehensiveness of ISC\u2019s risk  assessment guidance, we compared the RMP\u2019s guidance to federal risk  assessment guidance contained in DHS\u2019s National Infrastructure  Protection Plan (NIPP). Like the RMP, the NIPP sets forth a risk  management framework, as well as risk assessment standards and  guidance.

ISC\u2019s mandate is to develop and  evaluate security standards for federal facilities, develop a strategy for  ensuring compliance with these standards, and oversee the  implementation of appropriate protective security measures in federal  facilities, among other things. ISC member agencies develop and draft  ISC policies and standards through participation in sub-committees and  working groups. In addition, all ISC member agencies have an  opportunity to review and comment on ISC draft standards, and the 21  primary member agencies vote to approve final ISC standards.", "From 2008 through 2013, ISC issued a series of standards to assist  federal agencies in developing and implementing physical security  programs at federal facilities, including standards for facility risk  assessment methodologies. In August 2013, ISC combined six existing  ISC standards\u2014including The Design Basis Threat, Facility Security  Level Determinations for Federal Facilities, and Physical Security Criteria  for Federal Facilities\u2014into a single standard, The Risk Management  Process for Federal Facilities (RMP).

The protective  measures included in the RMP are intended to mitigate federal facilities\u2019  vulnerabilities to specific undesirable events that ISC has identified as  generally applicable to all federal facilities. To determine which  undesirable events pose the greatest risk to their facilities and, therefore,  which protective measures should be in place, the RMP requires  agencies to conduct risk assessments for each of their facilities. Based  on the results of a risk assessment, agencies can customize (i.e., add or  eliminate) the protective measures included in the RMP to adequately  reflect the assessed level of risk.", "Because risk assessments play a key role in ISC\u2019s risk management  framework, the RMP includes standards for agencies\u2019 facility risk  assessment methodologies. Specifically, the RMP requires that agencies\u2019  risk assessment methodologies must: (1) consider all of the 31  undesirable events in the RMP, and (2) assess the threat, consequences,  and vulnerability to specific undesirable events. While the sources vary,  agencies might obtain threat information through intelligence analyses,  vulnerability information from facility site visits, and consequence  information from interviews with tenants and facility managers.", "In their basic form, risk assessment methodologies involve assigning  ratings to each of the three component parts of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability,  and consequence\u2014and combining these ratings\u2014such as through  multiplication\u2014to produce an overall estimate of risk for each identified  undesirable event. In our hypothetical risk assessment example shown in  figure 2, each component of risk is assigned a rating between 1 (Very  Low) and 5 (Very High) based on the facility\u2019s conditions; these ratings  are then multiplied to produce an overall estimate of risk for each  undesirable event. This hypothetical assessment identified the \u201cvehicle- borne explosive device\u201d undesirable event as the highest risk to the  facility and \u201ckidnapping\u201d as the lowest risk.

DOJ\u2019s  methodology, which was also adopted by State, documents that all of the  undesirable events in the RMP were considered. It also assesses the  threat, consequences, and vulnerability to each undesirable event.  Specifically, each undesirable event in the RMP\u2014such as vehicle-borne  explosive device\u2014is initially assigned a baseline rating for each  component of risk. These baseline ratings \u2014which range from 1 (lowest)  to 5 (highest)\u2014are based on information and analysis from the RMP. For  example, DOJ uses the facility\u2019s facility security level (FSL) as the  baseline consequence rating for each undesirable event. As a result, if a  facility\u2019s FSL is determined to be a Level 3, then all of the undesirable  events listed in the RMP are initially given a consequence rating of 3. A  DOJ official explained that assessors then adjust the baseline ratings up  or down as necessary to reflect the facility\u2019s actual conditions.

FPS stated that it  intends to eventually incorporate consequence into its risk assessment  methodology and is exploring ways to do so. NRC\u2019s methodology also  does not assess the consequences of specific undesirable events.  According to NRC officials, the agency does not believe it is necessary to  conduct a consequence analysis for each undesirable event. However,  NRC\u2019s vulnerability assessment approach aligns with ISC\u2019s risk  assessment standards. Specifically, for each undesirable event in the  RMP, NRC calculates a percentage-based vulnerability score that  represents the number of protective measures that are currently in place  and applicable to that undesirable event. For example, if 50 protective  measures are applicable to an active-shooter undesirable event and the  facility has 25 of the applicable protective measures in place, it receives a  vulnerability score of 50 percent for an active shooter event. In contrast,  VA\u2019s methodology does not assess vulnerability to specific undesirable  events.

In addition, we describe  several risk assessment approaches used by non-federal entities and  foreign governments that may inform federal agencies\u2019 risk assessment  methodologies.", "To determine the extent to which selected ISC-member agencies\u2019 facility  risk assessment methodologies align with ISC standards, we selected a  non-generalizable sample of nine ISC member agencies (out of 53) and  interviewed officials and obtained documentation about their risk  assessment methodologies. We limited the scope of our review to federal  agencies that are ISC members and required to comply with ISC  standards to ensure that each federal agency in our review is familiar with  and potentially adhering to ISC\u2019s risk assessment standards (see app. III  for a list of ISC member agencies). The nine agencies were chosen to  achieve diversity with respect to their missions, ISC membership type,  and size. More specifically, we sought to achieve a mix of law- enforcement and non-law-enforcement agencies, primary and associate  ISC member agencies, and large, medium, and small agencies. The nine  agencies selected include: Department of Energy, Office of Health,  Safety, and Security; Department of Interior, Office of Law Enforcement  and Security; Department of Justice, Justice Protective Service;  Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security; Department of  Veterans Affairs; Federal Emergency Management Agency; Federal  Protective Service; Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and Office of  Personnel Management.", "For the number of facilities listed in table 1, we asked agencies to report  the number of facilities in their portfolio that meet ISC\u2019s definition of  \u201cfederal facility\u201d and apply to their risk assessment methodology. Seven  agencies provided us with specific numbers.  FPS provided an  approximate number because it said its number of facilities is continually  changing. DOI did not provide a number. Instead, we determined an  approximate number of DOI facilities based on our analysis of data from  the Federal Real Property Profile, a centralized real property database  maintained by GSA that contains data on the federal government\u2019s real  property inventory. We identified the number of buildings DOI reported  and then excluded categories of buildings that we thought likely did not  meet ISC\u2019s definition.  We provided the number to DOI for review.", "In addition, we reviewed and analyzed ISC\u2019s risk assessment standards,  which are outlined in ISC\u2019s Risk Management Process for Federal  Facilities (RMP) standard. According to ISC\u2019s RMP, agencies\u2019 risk  assessment methodologies must:  consider all the undesirable events identified in the RMP as possible  risks to federal facilities; assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to specific produce similar or identical results when applied by various security provide sufficient justification for deviations from the ISC-defined  security baseline.", "We limited the scope of this review to the first two standards above  because agencies\u2019 adherence to these standards could be objectively  verified by reviewing and analyzing agency documentation and  interviewing agency officials; and their adherence to the two additional  standards could not be verified in this manner. Therefore, for the  purposes of this report, risk assessment methodologies that align with  ISC standards are those that consider all the undesirable events identified  in the RMP, and assess the threat, consequences, and vulnerability to  specific undesirable events.", "To determine whether agencies\u2019 methodologies align with the above  stated criteria, we reviewed and analyzed information regarding each  agency\u2019s risk assessment methodology to answer the following four  questions:  1.  Does the methodology consider all of the undesirable events in the  RMP?  2.  Does the methodology assess the threat of specific undesirable  events?  3.  Does the methodology assess the consequences of specific  undesirable events?  4.  Does the methodology assess the vulnerability to specific undesirable  events?", "We answered each of these questions as either a \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d for our  selected agencies. The \u201cNo\u201d answer to question 2, 3, and 4 includes the  following two possibilities: a) the agency\u2019s threat, consequence, or  vulnerability ratings are not tied to specific undesirable events, or b) the  agency does not have a framework or formalized steps within which it  collects and analyzes threat-, consequence-, or vulnerability-related  information. If the answer to each of the four questions was \u201cYes,\u201d then  the agency\u2019s overall risk assessment methodology aligns with ISC\u2019s risk  assessment standards for the purposes of this report. If the answer to one  or more of the four questions was \u201cNo\u201d, then the agency\u2019s methodology  does not to align with ISC\u2019s standards for the purposes of this report.", "To determine how ISC assists member agencies in developing risk  assessment methodologies and monitors their compliance, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed ISC officials about their efforts in these  areas. We also interviewed officials from the nine selected ISC member  agencies regarding ISC\u2019s risk assessment assistance, including its risk  assessment guidance contained in the RMP. In addition, to assess the  comprehensiveness of ISC\u2019s risk assessment guidance, we compared the  RMP\u2019s guidance to federal risk assessment guidance contained in DHS\u2019s  National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). Like the RMP, the NIPP  sets forth a risk management framework, as well as risk assessment  standards and guidance. However, the NIPP\u2019s standards and guidance  are intended to apply broadly to 16 critical infrastructure sectors,  including\u2014but not limited to\u2014government facilities. We also reviewed  GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  because internal controls play a significant role in helping agencies  achieve their mission related responsibilities.", "To identify risk assessment approaches that could inform agencies\u2019 risk  assessment methodologies, we interviewed non-federal entities in four  locations: Washington, D.C.; Boston, Massachusetts; Dallas/Fort Worth,  Texas; and San Francisco, California. We selected these locations  because of their geographic diversity and large population. In each  location, we interviewed officials from a range of non-federal entities that  are potential targets for terrorism because of their symbolism, historical  significance, uniqueness, and/ or prominence. For example, we  interviewed officials from commercial property-management firms,  hospitals, universities, and state and local governments. In addition, we  interviewed officials who are responsible for conducting facility risk  assessments for several foreign government agencies in Canada and the  United Kingdom. These countries were selected based on our review of  previous risk assessment and management reports and discussions with  industry stakeholders about leading risk assessment practices. Because  we selected these non-federal entities and foreign government agencies  as part of a non-probability sample, our findings regarding the examples  of risk assessment approaches are not generalizable.", "Moreover, because ISC is responsible for developing physical security  standards and ensuring compliance with them and the selected agencies  we reviewed are ISC\u2019s members, any recommendations we make will be  to ISC instead of individual federal agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to March 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Examples of Other Organizations\u2019 Approaches to Assessing Vulnerability and Consequence", "paragraphs": ["We identified how foreign governments in Canada, the United Kingdom  (UK), and non-federal entities, such as hospitals, are assessing risk at  their facilities, specifically their approaches for assessing the  consequences of and vulnerability to undesirable events.", "Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s Risk Assessment Approach: Risk  assessment guidance published by a Canadian government agency  includes a basic vulnerability assessment approach. Each undesirable  event is rated qualitatively (High, Medium or Low) on two factors:  1.  How the vulnerability affects the severity of the undesirable event.  2.  How the vulnerability affects the likelihood that a facility will be  compromised.", "A matrix that reflects both factors is used to determine the final  vulnerability rating for each undesirable event. For example, a  vulnerability that has a \u201cHigh\u201d impact on the severity of the undesirable  event and \u201cMedium\u201d impact on the likelihood of compromise has an  overall vulnerability rating of \u201cHigh,\u201d according to the vulnerability  assessment matrix.", "UK Cabinet Office\u2019s Risk Assessment Approach for Local First  Responders: The UK Cabinet Office provides \u201cimpact scoring scales\u201d  to assist local responders in determining the consequences of the  undesirable events applicable to their areas of jurisdiction. As  explained in the agency\u2019s guidance, each undesirable event should be  assigned an impact score between 1 (insignificant) and 5  (catastrophic), depending on its anticipated consequences in the  following areas: health: includes direct impacts (numbers of people affected,  fatalities, injuries, etc.) and indirect impacts that may arise due to  strains on health services;  social impacts: includes availability of government programs and  services, damage to property, disruption of communications and  supply chains (e.g., money, food, water, energy, or fuel); and  public disorder due to anger, fear, and/or lack of trust in the  authorities; economic impacts: encompasses the net economic cost, including  both direct (e.g., loss of goods, buildings, infrastructure) and  indirect (e.g., loss of business, increased demand for public  services) costs; and environmental impacts: encompasses contamination or pollution  of land, water, or air, with harmful biological/chemical/radioactive  matter or oil, flooding, or disruption or destruction of plant or  animal life.", "Another UK government agency rates 14 undesirable events on a  scale of 1 (limited) to 5 (catastrophic) based on the estimated number  of casualties, reputational damage, and disruption to the business of  the agency.", "U.S. Hospitals\u2019 Risk Assessment Approach: Two major hospitals we  spoke with use a risk assessment methodology developed by a non- profit healthcare organization that includes an event-based  consequence assessment approach. Each undesirable event is  assigned a separate rating\u2014from 0 (Not Applicable) to 3 (High)\u2014for  probability and six consequence factors: human impact, property  impact, business impact, preparedness, internal response, and  external response.
