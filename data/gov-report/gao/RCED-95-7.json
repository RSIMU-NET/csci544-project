The refuge system consists primarily of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) and Waterfowl Production Areas and Coordination Areas. The first national wildlife refuge, Florida\u2019s Pelican Island, was established by President Roosevelt in 1903 to protect the dwindling population of wading birds in Florida. As of July 1994, the system included 499 refuges in all 50 states and several U.S. territories and accounted for over 91 million acres. (See fig. 1.)", "The Fish and Wildlife Services\u2019 (FWS) Division of Refuges provides overall direction for the management and operation of the National Wildlife Refuge System. Day-to-day refuge activities are the responsibility of the managers of the individual refuges. Because the refuges have been created under many different authorities, such as the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, and by administrative orders, not all refuges have the same specific purpose or can be managed in the same way.", "The ESA was enacted in 1973 to protect plants and animals whose survival is in jeopardy. The ESA\u2019s goal is to restore listed species so that they can live in self-sustaining populations without the act\u2019s protection. As of April 1994, according to FWS, 888 domestic species have been listed as endangered (in danger of extinction) or threatened (likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future). The ESA directs FWS to emphasize the protection of listed species in its acquisition of refuge lands and in its operation of all refuges. Under the ESA, the protection, recovery, and enhancement of listed species are to receive priority consideration in the management of the refuges.", "FWS\u2019 Division of Endangered Species provides overall guidance in the implementation of the ESA. FWS\u2019 regions are generally responsible for implementing the act. Among other things, the act requires FWS to develop and implement recovery plans for all listed species, unless such a plan would not benefit the species. Recovery plans identify the problems threatening the species and the actions necessary to reverse the decline of a species and ensure its long-term survival. Recovery plans serve as blueprints for private, federal, and state interagency cooperation in taking recovery actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Listed Species Often Occur on Wildlife Refuges", "paragraphs": ["Of all the listed species, 215, or 24 percent, occur on wildlife refuges.(See app. I for the listed species that occur on refuges.)

According to FWS regional refuge officials, 66 refuges\u2014encompassing a total of 26.7 million acres, including 22.6 million acres on two Alaska refuges\u2014provide a significant portion of the habitat for 94 listed species. For example, Ash Meadows NWR in Nevada has 12 listed plants and animals that exist only at the refuge\u2014the largest number of listed native species at one location in the United States. In addition, Antioch Dunes NWR in California contains virtually the entire remaining populations of three listed species\u2014the Lange\u2019s metalmark butterfly, the Antioch Dunes evening-primrose, and the Contra Costa wallflower. (App. II lists the refuges that provide a significant portion of a listed species\u2019 habitat and the specific species that occur at these refuges.)", "Some listed species use the refuges on a temporary basis for migratory, breeding, and wintering habitat. As previously shown in figure 1, the refuges are often located along the primary north-south routes used by migratory birds. Migratory birds use the refuges as temporary rest-stops along their migration routes. The listed wood stork, for example, migrates in the spring from southern Florida to Harris Neck NWR in Georgia to nest in the refuge\u2019s freshwater impoundments. In addition, several refuges provide breeding habitat for listed species. The Blackbeard Island and Wassaw refuges in Georgia and the Merritt Island NWR in Florida, for example, provide beach habitat for the listed loggerhead sea turtle to lay its eggs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wildlife Refuges Contribute to the Recovery of Listed Species", "paragraphs": ["Wildlife refuges and refuge staff contribute to the recovery of listed species in a variety of ways.

FWS has acquired over 310,000 acres to create 55 new refuges specifically for the protection of listed species. FWS\u2019 policy requires that a species recovery plan be prepared before lands are acquired for listed species. For example, the recovery plan for four Hawaiian waterbirds called for FWS to secure and manage a number of ponds and marshes that two or more of the waterbirds are known to use. One specific area described in the recovery plan, Kealia Pond, was subsequently acquired by FWS in 1992. However, overall we could not readily determine whether the acquisitions of lands for the 55 new refuges had been identified as needed acquisitions in species recovery plans. (App. III lists the refuges specifically established for listed species.)", "According to FWS\u2019 data, listed species found on refuges, and specifically on refuges established to protect listed species, appear to have a more favorable recovery status than listed species that do not occur on refuges. Table 1 provides an overview of FWS\u2019 data on the recovery status of listed species. This information was compiled on the basis of the knowledge and judgments of FWS staff and others familiar with the species.", "As the table shows, a greater proportion of the listed species that occur on refuges have a recovery status determined by FWS to be improving or stable than the listed species not found on refuges. According to FWS\u2019 guidance, species whose recovery is improving are those species known to be increasing in number and/ or for which threats to their continued existence are lessening in the wild. Species whose recovery is stable are those known to have stable numbers over the recent past and for which threats have remained relatively constant or diminished in the wild.

According to FWS\u2019 Refuges 2003: Draft Environmental Impact Statement, a total of 356 refuges had habitat management programs under way that directly benefited listed species. Refuge staff at the 15 refuges we visited were carrying out a number of specific actions in support of the protection and recovery of listed species. Such actions generally involved efforts to monitor the status of listed species\u2019 populations at the refuges and carry out projects designed to restore and manage the habitats and the breeding areas of listed species. Examples of specific actions being taken included the following:", "Carrying out prescribed burning of vegetation at the Okefenokee NWR (Georgia). Among other things, such burning helps restore and facilitate the growth of longleaf pine trees\u2014the primary habitat for the listed red-cockaded woodpecker.", "Enclosing nesting areas at the Salinas River NWR (California). The enclosures protect the listed western snowy plover\u2019s nests and chicks from predation by red foxes.", "Undertaking protective actions at the Hakalau Forest NWR (Hawaii).", "Specifically, to protect and assist in the recovery of five listed forest birds, the refuge manager has restricted public use, fenced off the forest to keep out wild pigs and cattle, and created new nesting habitat for the listed birds by protecting indigenous plants and eliminating nonnative/exotic plants.", "Developing artificial nesting structures for wood storks at the Harris Neck NWR (Georgia). According to the refuge biologist, each structure at the refuge was occupied by up to three nests for these birds in both 1993 and 1994.", "Providing economic incentives to protect habitat and provide a food source for the listed bald eagle at Blackwater NWR (Maryland). Specifically, refuge management pays muskrat trappers to kill a rodent (the nutria) that is destroying the refuge wetlands. The carcasses are then left for bald eagles to eat.", "Managing vegetation growth to provide feeding pastures for the listed Columbian white-tailed deer at the Julia Butler Hansen Refuge for Columbian White-tailed Deer (Oregon and Washington).

While the responsibility for developing and implementing the plans rests with FWS\u2019 regional offices, recovery teams often include species experts from federal and state agencies (including the refuges), conservation organizations, and universities. For example, a biologist at the San Francisco Bay NWR is helping develop a revised recovery plan for the salt marsh harvest mouse, the California clapper rail (a species of bird), and other coastal California wetlands species. On the basis of their knowledge of the listed species, refuge staff are also asked to comment on draft recovery plans developed by others. For example, refuge staff at the Moapa Valley NWR in Nevada were asked to review the draft recovery plan for the Moapa dace (a species of fish) developed by a recovery team made up of representatives from a variety of organizations, including the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation; the University of Nevada, Las Vegas; and the Nevada Division of Wildlife.", "Refuge staff at the locations we visited told us they use the recovery plans to guide their activities to protect listed species.

According to refuge managers and staff, their ability to contribute to species recovery efforts are constrained by the level of available funding. Two 1993 Interior reports discussed overall concerns about refuge funding and concluded that refuge funding was inadequate to meet the missions of refuges.", "In its Refuges 2003: Draft Environmental Impact Statement, FWS reported that the refuge system\u2019s current annual funding is less than half the amount needed to fully meet established objectives. From October 1, 1988, through fiscal year 1993, appropriations for the Division of Refuges increased from $117.4 million to $157.5 million per year. If the current level of annual funding continues, according to FWS, funding will be inadequate to address the existing backlog of major refuge maintenance projects or the programs and construction projects necessary for any expanded wildlife or public use activities. In addition, FWS stated that recent increases in refuge funding have not been sufficient to address the rising costs of basic needs, such as utilities, fuel, travel, and training.", "In August 1993, Interior\u2019s Inspector General reported that \u201crefuges were not adequately maintained because Service funding requests for refuge maintenance have not been adequate to meet even the minimal needs of sustaining the refuges.\u201d According to the Inspector General, the maintenance backlog totaled $323 million as of 1992. The Inspector General also reported that \u201cnew refuges have been acquired with increased Service responsibilities, but additional sufficient funding was not obtained to manage the new refuges.\u201d Between 1988 and 1992, according to the Inspector General, $17.2 million was necessary to begin operations at the 43 new refuges acquired during this period. However, only $4.7 million was appropriated for all new and expanded refuges. This appropriation level for refuge funding resulted in a $12.5 million deficit, according to the Inspector General, some of which contributed directly to the maintenance backlog. In response to the Inspector General\u2019s findings, FWS has agreed to develop a plan to reduce refuges\u2019 maintenance backlogs and to report on efforts to ensure consideration of the operations and maintenance costs in all future acquisitions.", "The budget resources are insufficient to undertake all of the efforts necessary to recover listed species, according to refuge managers. In general, refuge operations and maintenance budgets are earmarked for items such as salaries, utilities, and specific maintenance projects. As a consequence, many efforts to recover listed species are not being carried out. At 14 of the 15 locations we visited, refuge managers and staff said funding constraints limited their ability to fully implement recovery actions for listed species and other protection efforts. For example, refuge staff at the Savannah Coastal Refuge Complex in Georgia explained that they have enough resources to conduct only one survey of the bald eagle population per year, rather than the three they feel are necessary to adequately monitor the eagle\u2019s status.
