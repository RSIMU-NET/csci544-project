States pay qualified providers for covered Medicaid services and receive federal matching funds from the Department of Health & Human Services' (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for expenditures authorized in their state Medicaid plans. In addition to these standard Medicaid payments, most states make supplemental payments to certain providers, which are also matched by federal funds. GAO was asked for information about Medicaid supplemental payments. GAO examined (1) what information states report about supplemental payments on Medicaid expenditure reports and (2) in selected states, how much was distributed as supplemental payments, to what types of providers, and for what purposes. GAO analyzed CMS's Medicaid expenditure reports and surveyed five states that make large supplemental payments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS Medicaid expenditure reports show that states made at least $23 billion in supplemental payments in fiscal year 2006, with the federal share of these payments totaling over $13 billion. States made $17.1 billion in payments through Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) programs, which under federal law provide additional reimbursement, up to a cap, to hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income individuals. In addition, states made at least $6.3 billion in non-DSH supplemental payments, including payments through Upper Payment Limit (UPL) programs, under which states make payments to providers up to the upper limit for obtaining federal matching funds. However, information on non-DSH supplemental payments was incomplete. The exact amount and distribution of fiscal year 2006 non-DSH payments to states are unknown because states did not report all their payments to CMS. CMS officials said that they were updating reporting requirements to collect better information on supplemental payments, including finalizing a rule proposed in 2005 responding to federal law that required states to report more detailed information on DSH payments and seeking improved UPL payment information. As of April 2008, specific implementation dates for these actions were not known. CMS's plans did not include a requirement that states report all UPL payments on a facility-specific basis, as GAO recommended in 2004 (See Medicaid: Improved Federal Oversight of State Financing Schemes Is Needed, GAO-04-228). GAO believes this 2004 recommendation remains valid. The five states GAO surveyed--California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Texas--reported making $12.3 billion in Medicaid supplemental payments in federal fiscal year 2006 through programs with broadly stated purposes, with half of these payments made to local government hospitals. Collectively, the five states reported making payments through 48 supplemental payment programs, with each state operating from 3 to 15 different programs that paid hospitals, nursing facilities, or other providers. The five states reported purposes for their programs that often focused on various categories of eligible providers serving individuals on Medicaid, with low incomes, or without insurance. The state Medicaid plan sections establishing the states' supplemental payments did not always clearly identify how the payments would be calculated. CMS officials said that as part of an oversight initiative started in 2003, CMS ensures that state plans demonstrate a link between the distribution of supplemental payments and Medicaid purposes. However, not all state supplemental payment programs have been reviewed under CMS's initiative. In each of the five states, supplemental payments were concentrated on a small proportion of providers: the 5 percent of providers receiving the largest amount of supplemental payments in individual states received from 53 percent to 71 percent of all supplemental payments. Some providers received substantial payments from more than one supplemental payment program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, Medicaid\u2014the federal and state program that finances health  care for certain low-income individuals\u2014has been on GAO\u2019s list of high- risk programs because of concerns about the program\u2019s size, growth,  diversity, and fiscal management. One management challenge stems from  the joint federal-state financing of the $299 billion program. As pressures  on state and federal budgets have increased, states have sought to  maximize the federal funds they receive through their Medicaid programs,  while at the same time the federal government has sought to control  inappropriate Medicaid spending. Under federal Medicaid law, the federal  government reimburses states for its share of allowable expenditures.  States pay qualified health care providers for covered services, then seek  reimbursement for the federal share of the payments. In addition to the  standard payments they make for Medicaid services, most state Medicaid  programs make supplemental payments\u2014payments separate from and in  addition to those made at a state\u2019s standard Medicaid payment rates\u2014to  certain providers. For years, we and others have raised concerns regarding  states\u2019 inappropriate use of supplemental payment arrangements to  leverage billions of dollars in federal Medicaid matching funds without a  commensurate increase in state Medicaid expenditures. These  inappropriate arrangements involved large supplemental payments to  government providers such as state- or county-owned hospitals or nursing  homes. We have made numerous recommendations since 1994 to improve  oversight of these Medicaid payments, including recommending improved  monitoring and reporting of them. A variety of legislative, regulatory, and  federal oversight actions have helped to curb these inappropriate Medicaid  supplemental payment arrangements, including a federal oversight  initiative begun in 2003 that closely reviewed states\u2019 supplemental  payments. There is continued congressional interest in understanding  state supplemental payment programs, including the amount of payments  made and the characteristics of the Medicaid providers receiving the  payments.", "States have established a variety of programs to administer supplemental  payments; for the purpose of this report, we classify these programs into  two types. Under federal law, states are required to make  Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals that treat  large numbers of low-income and Medicaid patients. States\u2019 DSH  programs are subject to annual caps on the amount of DSH payments a  state may make as well as on the DSH payments individual hospitals may  receive. States also make non-DSH supplemental payments. For example,  over the years, many states have used the flexibility under Medicaid\u2019s  Upper Payment Limit (UPL) provisions\u2014which define the upper limit on  payments for which states can receive federal matching funds\u2014to make  supplemental payments. States establish Medicaid provider payment  rates, and in practice, states\u2019 standard Medicaid payments are often less  than the UPL. Because of this gap, states have established programs to  make supplemental payments to certain providers above standard  Medicaid payment rates but within the UPL. Unlike DSH payments, UPL  payments are not specifically required to be established under federal law.  UPL payments interact with DSH payments in that any Medicaid payments  made to a hospital count toward the hospital\u2019s DSH cap, reducing the total  DSH payments the hospital may receive. In recent years, some states have  also been allowed to make supplemental payments under Medicaid  demonstrations authorized under section 1115 of the Social Security Act.  In this report, we use the term non-DSH payments to include both UPL  payments and supplemental payments made under Medicaid  demonstrations.", "The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency of  the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), oversees state  Medicaid programs, including supplemental payment programs, by  approving covered populations, services, and payment methods in each  state\u2019s Medicaid plan. States receive federal reimbursement for Medicaid  expenditures by submitting quarterly expenditure reports. In response to  your request for information about the amount of states\u2019 Medicaid  supplemental payments and the types of providers receiving supplemental  payments, this report addresses the following questions:  1.  What information do CMS Medicaid expenditure reports provide  regarding Medicaid supplemental payments?  2.  In selected states, how much was distributed as Medicaid  supplemental payments, to what types of providers, and for what  purposes?", "To determine what information CMS Medicaid expenditure reports  provide regarding the amount and distribution of Medicaid supplemental  payments, we analyzed Medicaid expenditure data reported to CMS by  states on a standardized form, the CMS-64, for the most recent year  available, fiscal year 2006. We compiled the amount of DSH and non-DSH  payments reported by individual states and analyzed their distribution by  category of service (such as inpatient hospital, mental health facility, or  nursing facility) and provider category (that states report as either state  government, local government, or private), where those data were  available. To understand CMS expenditure reports, Medicaid reporting  requirements, and DSH and non-DSH supplemental payments, we  conducted interviews with CMS officials and reviewed relevant federal  laws, regulations, and guidance. To assess the reliability of states\u2019 CMS-64  submissions, we reviewed the steps CMS takes to ensure the accuracy of  expenditure data submitted by states. We determined that the data were  reliable for use in this report, and include any limitations identified. A  discussion of our methodology and data reliability assessment can be  found in appendix I. Finally, we discussed planned changes to CMS\u2019s  Medicaid supplemental payment reporting requirements with CMS  officials.", "To examine how Medicaid supplemental payments are distributed to  providers and for what purposes, we surveyed a nongeneralizable sample  of five states: California, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, and Texas.  We selected these states on the basis of the significance of their  supplemental payments: specifically, we reviewed DSH payment  information reported to CMS and the most complete information available  on non-DSH supplemental payments, which was reported by states to the  Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research  organization, for fiscal year 2005. Based on these sources, the five states  we selected spent the largest amount on Medicaid supplemental payments  in 2005, with each state making estimated payments of more than   $1.6 billion that year. Two of the five states, California and Massachusetts,  operated Medicaid demonstrations during fiscal year 2006 that changed  certain characteristics of their supplemental payment programs. We  obtained detailed information from each of the five states on the  supplemental payment programs they had in place in fiscal year 2006. The  data we collected included the amount of each payment to a provider, the  name of the provider that received the payment, the provider\u2019s type (such  as hospital, psychiatric hospital, or nursing facility), and the provider\u2019s  ownership category. We analyzed the state-reported data to identify how  DSH and non-DSH supplemental payments were distributed among  different types of programs, across provider ownership categories, and  across provider types. To determine the purpose for payments, we asked  states to provide a description of each supplemental payment program  they operated and reviewed the state Medicaid plan provisions that  described the methods and standards used to calculate payments made  from these programs. To assess the reliability of states\u2019 reported payment  amounts, we compared states\u2019 reported payment information to CMS\u2019s  expenditure reports, and where we found major differences, we reported  them. We determined that the data were reliable for the purposes of this  report. A discussion of our methodology and data reliability assessment  can be found in appendix I. The findings from the five reviewed states  cannot be used to make inferences about supplemental payments in other  states. We conducted our work from October 2007 through May 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid\u2014a federal-state partnership that finances health care for low- income individuals, including children, families, the aged, and the  disabled\u2014provided health coverage for over 60 million individuals in 2007.  Title XIX of the Social Security Act established Medicaid as a joint federal- state program. States operate their Medicaid programs by paying  qualified health care providers for a range of covered services provided to  eligible beneficiaries and then seeking reimbursement for the federal share  of those payments. Within broad federal requirements, each state  administers and operates its Medicaid program in accordance with a state  Medicaid plan, which must be approved by CMS. A state Medicaid plan  details the populations a state\u2019s program serves, the services the program  covers (such as physician services, nursing facility care, and inpatient  hospital care) and the methods for calculating payments to providers. The  state Medicaid plan also describes the supplemental payment programs  administered by the state.", "Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement program, under which the federal  government is obligated to pay its share of expenditures for covered  services provided to eligible individuals under a state\u2019s federally approved  Medicaid plan. A state may collect up to 60 percent of its Medicaid share  from local governments as long as the state government itself contributes  at least 40 percent. Local governments and local government providers  can contribute to the state share of Medicaid payments in certain ways,  for example, through intergovernmental fund transfers.", "DSH payments supplement standard Medicaid payment rates to help offset  certain hospitals\u2019 unreimbursed costs. Under federal Medicaid law, each  state receives an annual DSH allotment. DSH allotments are the maximum  amounts of federal matching funds each state is permitted to claim for  DSH payments. States\u2019 DSH allotments were first established in 1991  based on each state\u2019s historical DSH spending. States are required to  make DSH payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of  low-income and Medicaid patients. Federal Medicaid law caps the amount  of DSH funding a state may pay to an individual hospital each fiscal year:  DSH payments cannot exceed the unreimbursed cost of furnishing  hospital services to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured. In  determining a hospital\u2019s unreimbursed costs, states must offset costs with  all Medicaid payments received by the hospital, including any UPL  payments. In other words, UPL payments count against a hospital\u2019s DSH  cap. A state may establish one or more DSH programs to make DSH  payments, subject to these limits, and each program must be documented  by the state and approved by CMS in the state\u2019s Medicaid plan. As with  other Medicaid program changes, to change or initiate a new DSH  program, a state must submit a state plan amendment to CMS for review  and approval prior to implementation.", "In contrast to DSH payments, states are not required to establish non-DSH  supplemental payments for providers. Federal Medicaid regulations  establish the UPL as an upper limit on federal reimbursement for Medicaid  payments. UPL payments are a product of the gap between standard  Medicaid payment rates and the UPL: in practice, states\u2019 standard  Medicaid payments are often less than the UPL, so states have established  supplemental payment programs to make supplemental payments above  standard Medicaid rates but within the UPL. UPL payments are approved  by CMS in states\u2019 Medicaid plans. For example, a state might establish a  UPL program to provide additional payments to certain nursing facilities  that serve low-income populations to fill the gap between what standard  Medicaid rates pay toward the cost of services and higher payments  permitted through the UPL. Some states, including California and  Massachusetts, have also in recent years been allowed to make  supplemental payments under Medicaid demonstrations.", "To obtain the federal matching funds for Medicaid payments made to  providers, each state files a quarterly expenditure report to CMS. This  expenditure report, known as Form CMS-64, compiles state payments in  over 20 categories of medical services, such as inpatient hospital services,  outpatient hospital services, mental health services, nursing facility  services, and physician services. The CMS-64 expenditure report captures  some information on supplemental payments. For example, states are  required to report their total DSH payments to hospitals and mental health  facilities separately from other Medicaid payments in order to receive  federal reimbursement for them. States are not, however, required to  report disaggregated information on DSH payments made to individual  providers in order to obtain federal matching funds. Instead, states are  required to maintain supporting documentation for DSH programs,  including the amount of DSH payments made to each hospital, and to  make this information available to CMS upon request. UPL payments are  not reported separately from other payments for the purpose of obtaining  federal matching funds. Reporting of supplemental payments under  Medicaid demonstrations can vary by demonstration.", "Much attention has been focused on Medicaid supplemental payments, in  part because of concerns that we and others have raised about  inappropriate Medicaid supplemental payment arrangements between  states and certain providers. From 1994 through 2007, we issued reports  on various arrangements whereby states received federal matching funds  by making large supplemental payments to certain government providers,  such as county-owned nursing facilities, in amounts that greatly exceeded  standard Medicaid rates. The payments were often temporary, since  some states required government providers to return all or most of the  money to the state government. States used the federal matching funds  received for these payments at their own discretion, in some cases to  finance or pay for the state\u2019s share of the Medicaid program. Since the late  1980s, a variety of regulatory or legislative actions have been taken at the  federal level to curb inappropriate Medicaid financing arrangements  involving excessive supplemental payments. (See table 1.)", "In addition to the regulatory and legislative actions referenced in table 1,  CMS has taken additional steps to improve Medicaid\u2019s financial  management and its oversight of states\u2019 supplemental payment programs.  These include making internal organizational changes that centralize the  review of state plan amendments, hiring additional staff to analyze each  state\u2019s Medicaid program, and increasing the scrutiny of states\u2019 Medicaid  supplemental payment programs and the programs\u2019 financing methods. In  August 2003, CMS launched an oversight initiative to review and evaluate  the appropriateness of states\u2019 Medicaid payments as part of its efforts to  strengthen financial oversight and the fiscal integrity of the Medicaid  program. Under the initiative, a state\u2019s submission of a proposal to change  provider payments in its state plan triggers CMS scrutiny of the  appropriateness of any related payment arrangement. Through this  initiative CMS had identified, as of August 2006, 55 supplemental payment  programs in 29 states using financing arrangements in which government  providers did not retain all the supplemental payments made to them and  had taken actions to end these arrangements.", "In May 2007, CMS published a final rule in part to address concerns related  to states\u2019 inappropriate financing arrangements involving supplemental  payments. Among other things, the rule, if implemented, would limit  Medicaid reimbursement to certain providers operated by units of  government to an amount that does not exceed the provider\u2019s costs of  providing Medicaid-covered services. Concerns were raised that the rule  would harm certain providers.

The purposes of the non-DSH programs for hospitals and  other providers, as reported by the five states, included the following:    providing supplemental payments to most of the largest Medicaid hospital  providers in the state;   supplementing Medicaid payments to certain types of hospitals, such as  rural hospitals, pediatric specialty hospitals, and hospitals operated by the  state Department of Mental Health;    ensuring access by Medicaid beneficiaries to high-quality hospital or  reimbursing public health clinics for their cost of providing services to  Medicaid beneficiaries;   providing enhanced Medicaid payments for outpatient hospital trauma and  emergency services to private hospitals meeting certain criteria; reimbursing public dental clinics for their cost of providing services to  Medicaid beneficiaries;   providing partial reimbursement of the debt service incurred on revenue  bonds for the construction, renovation, replacement, or retrofitting of  eligible hospitals; and   encouraging providers to make available to Medicaid recipients the most  advanced forms of medical diagnostic and treatment services available  through university-based medical service systems.", "According to CMS officials, state Medicaid plans should specify the  method by which payment amounts are calculated and how they are  correlated with services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries or, in the case  of DSH programs, to Medicaid beneficiaries or uninsured individuals. In  some cases, we found that the state Medicaid plan sections establishing  the states\u2019 supplemental payments did not clearly identify how the  payments would be calculated. CMS officials said that as part of its  oversight initiative started in August 2003, CMS ensures during its state  plan amendment review process that states demonstrate a link between  the distribution of supplemental payments and Medicaid purposes, which  would include uncompensated care in the case of DSH payments. Such  vetting only occurs, however, as states establish new supplemental  payment programs or make changes to established programs. Thus, not all  state supplemental payment programs have been reviewed under CMS\u2019s  2003 initiative. In the case of the 35 supplemental payment programs  operated by the five states we surveyed that were approved under the  states\u2019 Medicaid plans, 6 programs (17 percent) had not been reviewed  and approved by CMS through the state plan amendment process since the  beginning of the oversight initiative that started in August 2003. State  officials told us that these 6 programs had not been changed since CMS\u2019s  2003 initiative or subject to review under the initiative.

However, sustaining the  $299 billion program will require ensuring that expenditures are  appropriately limited to Medicaid purposes. Supplemental payment  programs have historically been susceptible to abuse, particularly  programs involving large payments to government providers that allowed  states to inappropriately leverage federal Medicaid matching funds.  Legislative, regulatory, and other agency actions have addressed some of  these concerns.", "States made supplemental payments totaling at least $23 billion in fiscal  year 2006, and the federal government spent over $13 billion in matching  funds for these payments. Despite the significance of supplemental  payments, CMS lacks complete information on states\u2019 payments and has  not reviewed all supplemental payment programs under its 2003 initiative.", "To provide effective oversight, federal officials need reliable and complete  information, including information on all programs administered by states  as well as information on the providers that receive payments from these  programs. Complete information about the distribution of Medicaid  supplemental payments, however, is still lacking at the federal level. For  example, complete data on non-DSH payments and data on DSH and non- DSH supplemental payments made to individual providers are not  available from CMS expenditure reports. Congress has long sought better  information on DSH payments, including information on payments to  individual providers, and we have expressed similar concerns over the  lack of information related to non-DSH payments. CMS is planning to take  action in 2008 to finalize a rule proposed in 2005 that would implement  detailed DSH reporting in response to federal statutory requirements and  also plans to make improvements to its expenditure reports to collect data  on some non-DSH payments. These planned actions address many of the  gaps in state reporting of supplemental payments and should be put into  effect as soon as possible. Even when they are implemented, however,  states will not be required to report all of the supplemental payments that  they make to individual providers.", "We believe that a recommendation from our prior work that CMS improve  state reporting of UPL payments, including collecting information on  payments by facility, remains valid. Such an improvement could be  achieved by establishing reporting requirements for non-DSH  supplemental payments, such as collecting payment information on a  facility-specific basis, comparable to those proposed for DSH payments. In  2004, CMS agreed with the recommendation that it improve its UPL  reporting requirements and collect facility-specific payment information,  but as of May 2008, had not implemented it. Furthermore, not all  supplemental payment programs have been subject to CMS review  through the oversight initiative that CMS began in 2003 to assess and  ensure the appropriateness of state supplemental payments.

HHS also identified a means by which it  could implement our 2004 recommendation to request facility-specific  information on UPL payments.", "HHS provided additional comments that it believed were critically  important to the final report. HHS stated that the final rule implementing  DSH payment reporting requirements will only collect facility-specific  supplemental payment information for hospitals that qualify for DSH  payments, and that hospitals that do not receive DSH payments and non- hospital Medicaid providers are not subject to the rule. We note that our  draft report contained this information. Further, because of these and  other data reporting limitations, we determined our 2004 recommendation  that CMS improve its requirements for states for reporting UPL payments,  such as requiring states to report payments on a facility-specific basis, was  still valid. HHS said the volume of information that would be collected  under this recommendation could not feasibly be transmitted through the  Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System, a system states use to submit  Medicaid expenditure data to CMS. We note that we have not specified the  system by which improved UPL information should be collected. HHS also  provided an example of one means it could use to obtain facility-specific  information through its review of states\u2019 Medicaid expenditure reports. In  our view, the billions of dollars paid annually in non-DSH supplemental  payments warrants improved reporting of information on payments  comparable to planned DSH reporting requirements, including reporting of  facility-specific payment information.", "HHS also noted that states are entitled each year to expend their entire  allotment and that therefore, the $17 billion DSH spending referenced in  the draft report will largely remain unchanged after issuance of the final  DSH rule.

We concluded that states\u2019 reported DSH  payments in fiscal year 2006 were sufficiently reliable for use in this report  because CMS reimburses states based on these data and because CMS also  reports these data publicly on its Web site.
