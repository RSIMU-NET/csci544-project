USAID awards of direct assistance grew from over $470 million in fiscal year 2009 to over $1.4 billion in fiscal year 2010. USAID awarded $1.3 billion to the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) in fiscal year 2010, of which the bank has received $265 million as of July 2011. DOD direct assistance to two ministries grew from about $195 million in fiscal year 2009 to about $576 million in fiscal year 2010, including contributions to fund police salaries through the United Nations Development Program-administered (UNDP) Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA). USAID and DOD have taken steps to help ensure the accountability of their bilateral direct assistance to Afghan ministries, but USAID has not required risk assessments in all cases before awarding these funds. For example, USAID did not complete preaward risk assessments in two of the eight cases GAO identified. Although current USAID policy does not require preaward risk assessments in all cases, these two awards were made after the USAID Administrator's July 2010 commitment to Congress that USAID would not proceed with direct assistance to an Afghan public institution before assessing its capabilities. In these two cases, USAID awarded $46 million to institutions whose financial management capacity were later assessed as \"high risk.\" USAID has established various financial and other controls in its bilateral direct assistance agreements, such as requiring separate bank accounts and audits of the funds. USAID has generally complied with these controls, but GAO identified instances in which it did not. For example, in only 3 of 19 cases did USAID document that it had approved one ministry's prefinancing contract documents. DOD personnel in Afghanistan assess the risk of providing funds to two security ministries through quarterly reviews of each ministry's capacity. DOD officials also review records of ministry expenditures to assess whether ministries have used funds as intended. DOD established formal risk assessment procedures in June 2011, following GAO discussions with DOD about initial findings. USAID and DOD generally rely on the World Bank and UNDP to ensure accountability over U.S. direct assistance provided multilaterally through ARTF and LOTFA, but USAID has not consistently complied with its risk assessment policies in awarding funds to ARTF. During GAO's review, DOD established procedures in June 2011 requiring that it assess risks before contributing funds to LOTFA. The World Bank and UNDP use ARTF and LOTFA monitoring agents to help ensure that ministries use contributions as intended. However, security conditions and weaknesses in Afghan ministries pose challenges to their oversight. For example, the ARTF monitoring agent recently resigned due to security concerns. The World Bank is now seeking a new monitoring agent and does not anticipate a gap in monitoring. In addition, weaknesses in the Ministry of Interior's systems for paying wages to police challenge UNDP efforts to ensure that the ministry is using LOTFA funds as intended."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USAID (1) establish and implement policy requiring risk assessments in all cases before awarding bilateral direct assistance funds, (2) take additional steps to help ensure it implements controls for bilateral direct assistance, and (3) ensure adherence to its risk assessment policies for ARTF. In commenting on the first recommendation, USAID stated that its existing policies call for some form of risk assessment for all awards and that it has taken new steps to ensure risk assessment. GAO retained its recommendation because existing USAID policies do not require preaward risk assessments in all cases. USAID concurred with GAO's other recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, the United States has allocated about $56 billion for  programs to reconstruct Afghanistan.

The World Bank  reports that it is seeking a new monitoring agent, has received many  expressions of interest, and does not anticipate a gap in monitoring.    \uf0b7  Previously, security concerns prevented the ARTF monitoring agent  from physically verifying ARTF salary and other recurrent  expenditures outside of Kabul province from March 2009 through  March 2010. The World Bank had required the monitoring agent or  its subcontractor to visit sites in at least 12 provinces to verify  expenditures made during the Afghan fiscal year that began in March  2010.  \uf0b7  The CAO lacks qualified auditors and faces other capacity restraints,  according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction (SIGAR) and USAID. However, it uses international  advisers and contracted auditors, funded by the World Bank, to help  ensure that its audits of ARTF comply with international auditing  standards. The World Bank recently reported that the overall  timeliness of the CAO audits have been improving since 2006.  \uf0b7  The World Bank and donors have expressed concern over the level of  ineligible expenditures submitted by the Afghan government for  reimbursement. While ineligible expenditures are not reimbursed,  the bank considers the level of ineligible expenditures to be an  indicator of weaknesses in the Afghan government\u2019s ability to meet  agreed-upon procurement and financial management standards. The  ARTF monitoring agent has questioned whether Afghan government  civil servants have the experience and knowledge necessary to  perform transactions in a manner eligible for reimbursement and  whether ministries\u2019 internal procedures fully reflect Afghan  government laws and regulations.", "Partly as a result of recommendations from a 2008 independent  evaluation of ARTF by a Norwegian-based firm and discussions with  donors, the World Bank is currently seeking to revise its 2002 grant  agreements with donors to reflect its efforts to strengthen ARTF  governance. According to the World Bank, the recommended changes  include clarifying and strengthening donors\u2019 oversight roles and  responsibilities over ARTF. In response to our inquiries, the World Bank  stated in April 2011 that it is considering incorporating its current standard  provisions, applicable to multidonor trust funds, in the amended grant  agreements with donors. These provisions would allow donor countries  greater access to accounting and financial records and information.  Under the current agreement with all donors, the World Bank provides  donors with periodic reports, such as quarterly status reports, and an  annual management assertion together with an attestation from the  bank\u2019s external auditors on the satisfactory performance of the bank\u2019s  procedures and controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSTC-A Has Recently Established Procedures Requiring That It Assess Risks Associated with Contributions to LOTFA", "paragraphs": ["During our review on June 12, 2011, CSTC-A issued new procedures for  direct assistance that require CSTC-A to conduct precontribution risk  assessments before contributing funds to LOTFA. CSTC-A staff had  previously informed us in February 2011 that CSTC-A had not assessed  the risks of providing funds to LOTFA. Instead, CSTC-A had regularly  assessed the capabilities and weaknesses of MOI. For example, CSTC-A  assessed MOI\u2019s finance and budget section in March 2011 and  determined that while the section\u2019s strengths included a responsiveness  to pay issues, its weaknesses included a lack of well-trained staff and an  unwillingness to change.", "CSTC-A generally relies on UNDP\u2019s financial controls to ensure the  accountability of funds it has contributed to LOTFA. CSTC-A contribution  letters to LOTFA request that UNDP provide CSTC-A with quarterly  reports, which UNDP posts on its Web site. CSTC-A officials informed  us that CSTC-A reconciles its contributions to LOTFA annually.

CSTC-A officials told us they  have not requested LOTFA audits.", "UNDP has established financial controls over the funds it provides to MOI  for ANP expenses. It has stated that it reconciles its contributions with  MOF records of MOI expenses on a quarterly and annual basis. UNDP  recently reported that it deducted $17.6 million from its contribution to  MOI as a result of ineligible expenses identified during its annual  reconciliation for March 2009 through March 2010. UNDP has also hired  a monitoring agent to review and monitor ANP remunerations and  generate independent reports. UNDP staff told us that the LOTFA  monitoring agent has offices in all regional police zones, which cover all  of Afghanistan\u2019s provinces. UNDP has reported that the monitoring agent  operates in all ANP zones and conducts sample verifications of 30  percent of the total number of police.", "Similar to the World Bank\u2019s controls over ARTF, UNDP\u2019s financial  controls over LOTFA face challenges stemming from Afghanistan\u2019s  security environment. SIGAR reported in April 2011 that security issues  had impaired efforts by LOTFA\u2019s monitoring agent to (1) recruit staff in a  high-threat province and (2) travel in 7 of Afghanistan\u2019s 34 provinces for  half of 2010. SIGAR also reported that security concerns had delayed  LOTFA\u2019s reconciliation of 2009 salaries. UNDP officials also told us that  security concerns had restricted UNDP movements in Afghanistan.", "UNDP\u2019s financial controls also face challenges stemming from MOI\u2019s  institutional weaknesses. UNDP has reported that MOI\u2019s \u201cinsufficient  ownership and capacity development\u201d remains one of LOTFA\u2019s risks and  that it has taken steps to mitigate this risk. Some problems that have  been identified with MOI include the following:  In 2009, we reported that MOI did not have an accurate staffing  roster, according to CSTC-A, and that the number of ANP personnel  was unclear. We found that uncooperative ANP commanders were  impeding State and MOI efforts to implement a new ANP identification  card system to positively identify all police for pay purposes,  according to State officials. According to State officials, these  commanders were preventing State and MOI from determining the  status of nearly 30,000 individuals whose names had been submitted  to receive ANP identification cards. We recommended that DOD and  State consider provisioning future U.S. contributions to LOTFA to  reflect the extent to which U.S. agencies had validated the status of  MOI and ANP personnel to help ensure that the United States was not  funding salaries of unverified personnel.", "In 2011, SIGAR reported that MOI\u2019s payroll system provides little  assurance that MOI is paying only working ANP personnel or that  LOTFA funds are reimbursing only eligible ANP costs. MOI is also  unable to pay all police through relatively secure systems. We have  previously reported concerns regarding MOI pay systems. UNDP  and CSTC-A have worked with MOI to develop electronic systems to  reduce opportunities for skimming and corruption. One such system  transfers funds directly into individual bank accounts established by  individual Afghan police. Although progress has been made in  establishing these systems, more than 20 percent of ANP staff are still  paid using manual cash systems that are more vulnerable to abuse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The recent tripling of U.S. direct assistance awards to Afghan government  entities, coupled with the vulnerability of this assistance to waste, fraud,  and abuse in the uncertain Afghan environment, makes it essential that  U.S. agencies assess risks before awarding funds and implement  controls to safeguard those funds. Direct assistance to the Afghan  government involves considerable risk given the extent of corruption, the  weak institutional capacity of the Afghan government to manage finances,  the volatile and high-threat security environment, and that the U.S. funds  may be obligated months or years after they are awarded. Because  conflict in many parts of Afghanistan poses significant challenges to  efforts to ensure that funds are used as intended, the level of risk in  Afghanistan warrants, to the extent feasible, sound internal controls and  oversight over the billions of dollars that the U.S. government has  invested in Afghanistan. Although risk assessment is a key component of  internal controls, current USAID policy does not require preaward risk  assessments of all Afghan government recipients of U.S. direct  assistance funds. To safeguard U.S. direct assistance funds, it is  important that (1) the USAID Administrator follow through on his July  2010 commitment to Congress to assess risks associated with each  Afghan government entity before awarding funds, (2) USAID consistently  implement controls it establishes in bilateral direct assistance  agreements, and (3) USAID consistently adhere to its risk assessment  policies for multilateral trust funds in awarding funds to ARTF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of USAID take the following three  actions:  \uf0b7  Establish and implement policy requiring USAID to complete risk  assessments before awarding bilateral direct assistance funds to  Afghan government entities in all cases.  \uf0b7  Take additional steps to help ensure that USAID consistently  implements controls established in its bilateral direct assistance  agreements with Afghan government entities, such as requiring the  retention of documentation of actions taken.  \uf0b7  Ensure USAID adherence with its policies for assessing risks  associated with multilateral trust funds in awarding funds to ARTF."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to the Administrator of  USAID, and to the Secretaries of Defense, State, and the Treasury.

USAID noted that for  host country contracts, ADS requires an advance assessment of a host  government\u2019s procurement systems (ADS 305). USAID also stated that  for cash transfer agreements, ADS requires an analysis of a host  government\u2019s ability to comply with the agreements. USAID further stated  that its general activity planning guidance contains a recommendation  that USAID offices should consider the capacity of potential partners to  implement planned functions (ADS 201).", "Although USAID policy in ADS includes some form of risk assessment for  the funding mechanisms in use in Afghanistan, it does not require that a  risk assessment be conducted in all cases. Specifically, ADS 305\u2019s  requirement for preaward assessment of host country contracts did not  apply to six of the eight bilateral direct assistance cases we identified,  because these six cases do not involve procurement. Further, according  to the USAID comptroller, these six cases were not cash transfer  agreements. As a result, these six cases fall under USAID\u2019s general  activity planning guidance (ADS 201), which recommends\u2014but does not  require--that USAID offices assess the capacity of potential partners in  advance. As noted in this report, the lack of specific requirement resulted  in USAID making awards in two cases prior to completing a risk  assessment. Therefore, we retained our recommendation that USAID  establish and implement policies requiring preaward risk assessments in  all cases in Afghanistan.", "USAID also commented that it has taken additional steps to ensure that,  going forward, risk assessments are completed in advance for each type  of funding mechanism, in line with the Administrator\u2019s July 2010  statement to Congress. Further, these steps are being undertaken \u201cin  light of\u201d the Department of State\u2019s July 14, 2011, certification to Congress  that the U.S. and Afghan governments have established mechanisms  within each implementing agency to ensure that certain fiscal year 2010  funds will be used as intended. On July 14, 2011, State did make this  certification to Congress. However, the certification applies only to certain  fiscal year 2010 funds, underscoring the need for USAID to establish a  requirement for preaward assessments in Afghanistan in all cases in its  policies and procedures.", "With regard to our recommendation that USAID take additional steps to  help ensure that it consistently implements controls established in its  bilateral direct assistance agreements with Afghan government entities,  USAID agreed to take such steps concerning its host country agreements  with Afghan government entities. In doing so, USAID noted that USAID  policy is to be as sparing in exercising its prior approval rights as sound  management permits.", "With regard to our recommendation that it adhere to its policies for  assessing risks associated with multilateral trust funds in awarding funds  to ARTF, USAID acknowledged that it had not always prepared or  adequately documented its determinations for several ARTF grant  amendments.

We then adopted USAID\u2019s definition of direct assistance  (or \u201con-budget\u201d assistance) as U.S. funds provided through the Afghan  government national budget for use by Afghan ministries or other  government entities. This definition is consistent with guidance and  procedures developed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller) and DOD\u2019s Combined Security Transition Command- Afghanistan (CSTC-A). We focused on fiscal year 2009 and fiscal year  2010 to identify funding developments tied to the President\u2019s 2009  announcement of a new U.S. strategy for Afghanistan and subsequent  pledges concerning direct assistance to the Afghan government.  \uf0b7  To identify the extent to which USAID had increased its direct  assistance, we obtained financial information from USAID\u2019s mission in  Kabul, Afghanistan. This information included USAID quarterly  financial reports and USAID direct assistance agreements with  Afghan government entities and the World Bank (including any  modifications to the agreements). We used this information to identify  the value of the direct assistance USAID awarded in fiscal years 2009  and 2010. For the value of each award, we used what USAID refers to  as the \u201ctotal estimated contribution\u201d that it has committed to provide,  subject to the availability of funds, in signing a direct assistance  agreement. For the date, we used each agreement\u2019s signature date,  in keeping with USAID\u2019s use of the signature date as the effective  date of the funded activity. We used the signature dates to allocate  each award\u2019s value to either fiscal year 2009 or fiscal year 2010. In  using this data in the report, we noted that once it has awarded funds  on a specific date, USAID may obligate and disburse those funds over  multiple years, depending on the terms of the agreement. We  assessed these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  \uf0b7  To identify the extent to which DOD had increased its direct  assistance, we obtained financial information from DOD\u2019s Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). This information included  funds contributed to the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the  Afghan Ministry of Interior (MOI) by CSTC-A and the Defense Security  Cooperation Agency. According to the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense (Comptroller), each DOD contribution to MOD, MOI, and  the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA) was awarded,  obligated, and disbursed in close succession. We allocated each  contribution\u2019s value to the fiscal year in which the contribution was  made. We assessed these data to be sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To assess steps taken by USAID and DOD to help ensure the  accountability of their bilateral direct assistance to Afghan ministries and  other government entities, we reviewed the policies and practices the  agencies use to assess risks associated with direct assistance and to  establish control mechanisms over the use of direct assistance funds.  \uf0b7  Our assessments were based on criteria drawn from GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government, issued pursuant to the  requirements of the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982,  provides the overall framework for establishing and implementing  internal control in the federal government. Minimum internal control  standards for providing reasonable assurance that agency assets will  be safeguarded against fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement  include risk assessment and control activities. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government defines risk assessment and  control activities as key elements of an internal control framework.  Risk assessment includes identifying internal and external risks an  organization faces and their potential effect. Control activities are the  policies and procedures (such as approvals, reconciliations, and  reviews) agencies implement to mitigate identified risks and are  essential for accountability of government resources.  \uf0b7  To evaluate relevant USAID policies and practices against these  criteria, we reviewed information from both headquarters and the  USAID mission in Afghanistan. We reviewed USAID agencywide  policies for awarding bilateral direct assistance funds to host  government entities, as outlined in (1) USAID\u2019s Automated Directives  System (ADS) and (2) interim guidance USAID provided to its  mission on the use of direct assistance. We reviewed bilateral direct  assistance program information from the USAID mission in  Afghanistan, including preaward assessment procedures and reports,  training material, direct assistance agreements, compliance  documentation, approval memorandums, memorandums of  understanding, and mission orders. To identify USAID controls  established over the use of direct assistance funds and determine  whether USAID ensured compliance with its controls, we (1) reviewed  all USAID bilateral direct assistance agreements, (2) identified the  controls USAID established in each agreement, and (3) reviewed  documentation USAID provided to us to demonstrate it had ensured  compliance with its controls. We limited our analysis to controls  triggered per the terms of each agreement before February 15, 2011.  We also reviewed information from the USAID Office of Inspector  General in Afghanistan regarding the mission\u2019s preaward assessment  process. We interviewed USAID officials in Washington, D.C., and in  Kabul, Afghanistan.  \uf0b7  To assess DOD policies and practices, we reviewed information from  the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense (Comptroller) and CSTC- A. This information included the Under Secretary\u2019s February 4, 2011,  Interim Guidance on Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF)  Contributions to the Government of the Islamic Republic of  Afghanistan (GIRoA), CSTC-A\u2019s standard operating procedures for  direct contributions, DOD contribution letters to MOD and MOI, and  DOD assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of these  ministries.
