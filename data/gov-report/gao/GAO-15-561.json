However, most (67 percent) were unable to determine whether those minerals came from the DRC or adjoining countries (Covered Countries), and none could determine whether the minerals financed or benefited armed groups in those countries. Companies that disclosed that conflict minerals in their products came from covered countries (4 percent) indicated that they are or will be taking action to address the risks associated with the use and source of conflict minerals in their supply chains.

Some of the reported actions being  undertaken by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a  USAID implementing partner, are helping to lessen the involvement of the  military and increasing the role of legitimate DRC government  stakeholders in mining areas (see table 1). For example, USAID reported  that IOM has assisted with the planning and demilitarization of mine sites  in eastern DRC through leading a multi-sector stakeholder process of  mine validation to ensure that armed groups and criminal elements of the  Congolese military are not active in eastern DRC mines.", "Official Congolese agencies tasked with regulating the minerals trade  have responsibilities that include collecting production and export figures.  However, as we reported in 2010, U.S. and DRC officials, a foreign  official, and industry representatives told us that their ability to carry out  their duties is reportedly impeded by various factors such as weak  capacity, volatile security, and poor infrastructure, among other things.  USAID reported that it is undertaking a number of actions, through  implementing partners, to enhance civilian regulation and traceability of  the DRC minerals trade.", "Traceability mechanisms may minimize the risk that minerals that  have been exploited by illegal armed groups will enter the supply  chain and may also support companies\u2019 efforts to identify the source of  the conflict minerals across the supply chain around the world. Such  initiatives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining  countries focus on tracing minerals from the mine to the mineral  smelter or refiner by supporting a bagging and tagging program or  some type of traceability scheme.", "For example, USAID reported funding TetraTech, a technical services  company, to (1) build the capacity for responsible minerals trade in the  DRC, (2) strengthen the capacity of key actors in the conflict minerals  supply chain, and (3) advance artisanal and mining rights. In addition,  USAID indicated that it is funding IOM to support DRC infrastructure and  regulatory reform. According to an IOM official we spoke with in the  region, IOM also provides the DRC government with information on which  mines should be suspended from the conflict-free supply chain based on  safety and human rights violations. A USAID official and representatives  of local human rights organizations we met with during our visit to North  Kivu also told us that the implementation of traceability schemes is  contributing to positive outcomes.", "For example, in some cases, according to USAID, local miners earn  double the price for certified conflict-free minerals compared to non- certified illegal minerals, which is more than they would earn from  smuggling. Table 2 shows actions USAID has taken to enhance civilian  regulation of the DRC minerals trade.", "According to USAID, artisanal mining provides survival incomes to  Congolese throughout the country but it is particularly significant in  eastern DRC, where roughly 500,000 people directly depend on artisanal  mining for their income. These miners work under very difficult safety,  health, and security conditions and almost always within an illegal and  illicit environment. Moreover, as we observed during our visits to the  mines in the region, artisanal mining is a physically demanding activity  requiring the use of rudimentary techniques and little or no industrial  capacity (see figs. 8 and 9 for illustrations of artisanal miners at work).", "State and USAID reported several programs (shown in table 3), through  their implementing partners, aimed at protecting artisanal miners and  local communities and providing alternative livelihoods. For example,  State reported that it funded an implementing partner, Heartland Alliance  International (HAI), a service-based human rights organization, for anti- human-trafficking initiatives as well as to promote alternative livelihoods  and improve workers\u2019 rights in the artisanal mining sector. According to  State, these efforts aimed to reduce the vulnerability of men and women  in local communities. State officials reported some illustrative examples of  success in promoting alternative livelihoods. For example, a woman who  used to transport minerals, a physically demanding, low-paying job,  attended one of HAI\u2019s alternative livelihood trainings where she received  a kit to sell fish. Today, she makes a better living from selling fish and is  able to pay her children\u2019s school fees without working in the mining  sector, according to State officials. In addition, USAID has funded Pact,  an implementing partner, to promote community conflict-mitigation and  conflict minerals monitoring structures at local levels. State also  supported Pact to build local capacity for monitoring security and human  rights conditions and mineral traceability, and provide local artisanal  mining communities with resources to monitor, record, and report on  initiatives and human rights abuses. State indicated that its actions  through Pact also support enhancing civilian regulation of the minerals  sector and strengthening regional and international cooperation, other  objectives of the strategy.", "In our July 2012 report, we provided a description of regional and global  initiatives being undertaken by various stakeholders that may facilitate  responsible sourcing of conflict minerals in the DRC region. These  included, among others, efforts by the UN and International Conference  on the Great Lakes Region (ICLGR). Objective 4 of the U.S. conflict  minerals strategy calls for actions to strengthen regional and international  efforts. USAID reported that it is working with TetraTech to achieve this  goal. Specifically, USAID said it is working with TetraTech to build the  capacity of the ICGLR, an intergovernmental organization. According to  USAID, this effort supports the implementation and coordination of  regional countries\u2019 efforts to promote monitoring, certification, and  traceability of mine sites. A TetraTech representative we met with in the  region told us that TetraTech is also organizing workshops for educating  and raising awareness about regional certification in ICGLR countries.", "According to officials we interviewed from the United Nations  Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo (MONUSCO), the ICGLR, and local officials, U.S. diplomacy has  increased awareness and improved coordination about conflict minerals  in the region; a situation described by some of the officials as the most  effective State and USAID actions for conflict minerals in the region.", "State and USAID reported engaging in various efforts to reach out to  industry associations, NGOs, international organizations, and regional  entities to help promote due diligence and responsible trade in conflict  minerals. For example, State and USAID reported that they leveraged  private sector interest to establish the Public-Private Alliance for  Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA) to support supply chain solutions to  conflict minerals challenges in the region. The alliance includes State,  USAID, and representatives from U.S. end-user companies, industry  associations, NGOs, and ICGLR, among others. In addition, State is  engaged with the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) and State and  USAID both participate in the biannual OECD, UN Group of Experts  (UNGOE), ICGLR forums. According to State and USAID officials, these  efforts promote continued engagement with industry officials and civil  society groups and encourage due diligence and strengthening of conflict- free supply chains. At a conference in Kinshasa, DRC, co-hosted by the  OECD, UN Group of Experts, and the ICGLR in November 2014, we  observed State and USAID officials outline their actions, outcomes, and  next steps to conference participants. A USAID official in the region told  us that teams of private sector executives, which State and USAID  officials in the DRC and Rwanda helped to organize and host, have  visited eastern DRC and Rwanda mining sites on several occasions,  reinforcing the executives\u2019 commitment to source minerals responsibly.", "According to the USAID official, these efforts have resulted in a reduction  in predatory taxes, contributions by exporters to social development, and  increased focus on certification and traceability systems. Noting that visits  to the DRC and some locations in Rwanda had been coordinated and led  by State and USAID staff, a State official added that some private  companies had made independent contributions to community projects  and other companies had been active in providing feedback on  certification and traceability mechanisms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State and USAID Face Difficult Conditions in Implementing the U.S. Conflict Minerals Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Although State and USAID officials have provided some examples of  results associated with their actions, the agencies face difficult operating  conditions that complicate efforts to address the connection between  human rights abuses, armed groups, and the mining of conflict minerals.  We have described some of these challenges in our previous reports but,  as we observed during our recent visit to the region, numerous  challenges continue to exist. First, the mining areas in eastern DRC  continue to be plagued by insecurity because of the presence and  activities of illegal armed groups and some corrupt members of the  national military. In 2010, we reported extensively on the presence of  illegal armed groups, such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of  Rwanda or Forces Democratiques de Liberation du Ruwanda (FDLR),  and some members of the Congolese military and the various ways in  which they were involved in the exploitation of the conflict minerals sector  in eastern DRC. In 2013, the Peace and Security Cooperation  Framework signed by 11 regional countries noted that eastern DRC has  continued to suffer from recurring cycles of conflict and persistent  violence. Although U.S. agency and Congolese officials informed us  during our recent field-work in the region that a large number of mines  had become free of armed groups (referred to as green mines),  MONUSCO officials we met with in the DRC also told us that armed  groups and some members of the Congolese military were still active in  other mining areas. Specifically, MONUSCO officials described two  fundamental ways in which armed groups continued to be involved in  conflict minerals activities: directly, by threatening and perpetrating  violence against miners to confiscate minerals from them; and indirectly,  by setting up checkpoints on trade routes to illegally tax miners and  traders. As we noted in our 2010 report, U.S. agency and UN officials and  others believe that the minerals trade in the DRC cannot be effectively  monitored, regulated, or controlled as long as armed groups and some  members of the Congolese national military continue to commit human  rights violations and exploit the local population at will.", "As we reported in 2010, U.S. government officials and others have  indicated that weak governance and lack of state authority in eastern  DRC constitute a significant challenge. As we noted then, according to  U.N. officials, if Congolese military units are withdrawn from mine sites,  civilian DRC officials will need to monitor, regulate, and control the  minerals trade. We also noted that effective oversight of the minerals  sector would not occur if civilian officials in eastern DRC continued to be  under paid or not paid at all, as such conditions easily lead to corruption  and lack of necessary skills to perform their duties. Evidence shows that  this situation has not changed much. U.S. agencies and an implementing  partner, as well as some Congolese officials, told us that there are  insufficiently trained civilians to effectively monitor and take control of the  mining sector. ICGLR officials we met with highlighted the importance of a  regional approach to addressing conflict minerals and indicated that  governments\u2019 capacity for and interest in participating in regional  certification schemes varies substantially, making it difficult to implement  credible, common standards. Corruption continues to be a challenge in  the mining sector. For example, a member of the UN Group of Experts  told us that smuggling remains prolific and that instances of fraud call into  question the integrity of traceability mechanisms. This official stated that  tags used to certify minerals as conflict free are easily obtained and  sometimes sold illegally in the black market. According to USAID, USAID  is working to introduce a pilot traceability system to increase  transparency, accountability, and competition in the legal artisanal mining  sector. According to U.S. government officials and officials from local and  civil society in the region that we met with, lack of state authority bolsters  armed group activity and precludes public trust in the government.", "Poor infrastructure, including poorly maintained or nonexistent roads,  makes it difficult for mining police and other authorities to travel in the  region and monitor mines for illegal armed group activity. In our 2010  report, we reported that the minerals trade cannot be effectively  monitored, regulated, and controlled unless civilian DRC officials,  representatives from international organizations, and others can readily  access mining sites to check on the enforcement of laws and regulations  and to ensure visibility and transparency at the sites. During our recent  visit to the region, poor road conditions made travel to the mines very  challenging (see fig. 10).", "In addition, U.S. agencies cited the overall lack of an investor-friendly  environment, including poor investment climate, arbitrary and excessive  taxation and predatory government monitoring and enforcement, and the  scarcity of basic services, such as water and electricity, as challenges  that make it difficult for mining companies to conduct business, a  fundamental issue that precludes economic development and makes it  more difficult for U.S. agencies and contractors to conduct oversight and  provide services. Also, a mine owner in eastern DRC that we met with  cited a range of challenges to conducting business in the region, including  lack of access to financing, poor security, and inadequate infrastructure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Information Available on Rate of Sexual Violence in Eastern DRC and Adjoining Countries since GAO\u2019s June 2014 Report", "paragraphs": ["Since we last reported, in June 2014, results from three new population- based surveys related to sexual violence in eastern DRC have been  published, one of which provides a basis for comparison with results of an  earlier survey of sexual violence in the DRC.

In addition, we reviewed relevant  documentation, such as reports and technical briefs, from various UN  entities. To determine whether sexual violence data from the last two  Demographic Health Survey (DHS) published reports for the DRC were  comparable, we corresponded with and interviewed officials at ICF  International, a firm providing technical assistance for survey design and  implementation. Because data from the published 2008 and 2014 DHS  for DRC were not comparable, we reported on data that ICF International  generated at our request for the two time periods, which it determined to  be comparable. We also conducted Internet literature searches to identify  new academic articles containing any additional information on sexual  violence since our 2014 report.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2014 to August  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Description of Litigation and Resulting Guidance Related to the \u201cDRC Conflict Undeterminable\u201d Classification", "paragraphs": ["In response to the appeals court\u2019s April 2014 decision, the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC) staff, on April 29, 2014, issued a statement  that it expects companies to file any reports required under Rule 13p-1  subject to any further action that may be taken by either the commission  or a court. The SEC staff\u2019s statement contains guidance to companies,  which provides, among other things, that no company is required to  describe its products as having \u201cnot been found to be \u2018DRC [Democratic  Republic of the Congo] conflict free\u2019,\u201d or as \u201cDRC conflict undeterminable\u201d  in their reports. The guidance also states that, although the rule does not  require any company to describe its products as \u201cDRC conflict free,\u201d a  company may voluntarily elect to describe any of its applicable products  that way in its report if it had obtained an independent private sector audit  as required by the rule. In addition, the guidance states that, pending  further action, an independent private sector audit will not be required  unless a company voluntarily elects to describe a product as DRC conflict  free in its Conflict Minerals Report. On May 2, 2014, SEC issued an order  staying the effective date for compliance with the portions of Rule 13p-1  and Form SD subject to the appeals court\u2019s First Amendment holding  pending the completion of judicial review. On May 5, 2014, the plaintiffs  filed a motion with the appeals court asking the court to stay the entire  rule pending the completion of judicial review, which the commission  opposed, and on May 14, 2014, the appeals court denied the motion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Godwin Agbara (Assistant  Director), Marc Castellano, Tina Cheng, Debbie Chung, Justin Fisher,  Julia Jebo Grant, Emily Gupta, Stephanie Heiken, Jill Lacey, Grace Lui,  and Andrea Riba Miller made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
