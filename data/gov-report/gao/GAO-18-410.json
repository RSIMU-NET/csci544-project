Development, deforestation, and industrialization across  the region have resulted in degradation of water quality from pollution,  such as chemicals, sediment, and sewage. Moreover, the degradation of  water quality has resulted in declining fish populations. In 1985,  congressional committees directed the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) to work with the states to research, monitor, and assess estuaries  including Long Island Sound. Further, in 1987, the National Estuary  Program was established under amendments to the Clean Water Act to,  among other things, identify nationally significant estuaries threatened by  pollution, development, or overuse, and promote comprehensive  management of those estuaries. EPA has designated 28 estuaries of  national significance, including Long Island Sound.", "In 1985, EPA partnered with Connecticut and New York to form the Long  Island Sound Study (the Study) to restore and protect the Sound.

The  Study issued the first Long Island Sound Comprehensive Conservation  and Management Plan in 1994 (1994 plan). In the 1994 plan, it identified  six priority problems and goals for each problem: (1) low dissolved  oxygen, or hypoxia, (2) toxic substances, (3) pathogen contamination, (4)  floatable debris, (5) management and conservation of living resources  and their habitats, and (6) land use and development. The Study issued  a revised plan in 2015 (2015 plan), which is organized around four  themes, each with its own goal: (1) clean water and healthy watersheds,  (2) thriving habitats and wildlife, (3) sustainable and resilient communities,  and (4) sound science and inclusive management.", "You asked us to review federal efforts to restore the Sound.

We reviewed data  that were on the Study\u2019s website in November 2017 because the time  frame coincided with the time frames for our review. These reports, data,  and book included examples of progress but did not assess performance  toward the goals associated with the priority problems in the 1994 plan.  Therefore, we asked Study members for their responses on progress and  the data that supported their responses. To do so, we interviewed  representatives of the 12 Study members who agreed to participate and 5  Study work groups to learn the extent to which they believe progress has  been made toward the goals and to obtain key data that they cited as  evidence for their responses. For some priority problems, Study  members said that they were unable to provide a response about  progress toward the associated goals because they did not have  sufficient knowledge or data, and as a result, the number of respondents  for each problem varied. To examine the goals of the 2015 plan and  factors that may hinder progress according to Study members, we  analyzed the 2015 plan and interviewed Study members to identify the  factors they believe may hinder progress toward achieving the goals of  the 2015 plan.", "To examine how Study members plan to measure and report on progress  toward achieving the 2015 plan, we analyzed sections of the plan that  contained goals associated with the four themes and relevant web pages  that the Study issued in March 2018 and analyzed them again in June  2018, and interviewed Study members to learn how they planned to  report on progress. We also interviewed a nonprobability sample of 19  individuals with expertise on Long Island Sound to obtain their views on  these sections of the plan. The 19 experts we interviewed included  primarily members of academia. We identified these experts through  recommendations from Study members and by reviewing the list of  authors in the book Long Island Sound: Prospects for the Urban Sea. We  did not interview experts who represented a Study member or were  involved with the development of the 2015 plan. We asked the experts to  identify which topics of the plan they could discuss based on their  particular expertise. Because we used a nonprobability sample, the  information obtained from these interviews is not generalizable to other  individuals with Long Island Sound-related expertise but provides  illustrative information.", "To examine what Study members expended on restoration activities in  fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and cost estimates for future activities, we  obtained and analyzed expenditure data from Study members and  analyzed cost estimate information in the 2015 plan. Of the 12 Study  members described above, 7 provided at least some expenditure data to  us, 4 said that they do not fund restoration activities, and 1 did not reply to  our request for expenditure data. We were unable to compare  expenditure data across Study members because they did not track  expenditures in the same way. To assess the reliability of the expenditure  data, we interviewed officials to explain how the data were collected and  obtained information about the completeness and accuracy of the data  and found the expenditure data to be sufficiently reliable for reporting on  expenditures of restoration activities for the period. We also consulted the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s general guidance for estimating  costs, and analyzed EPA\u2019s funding guidance for comprehensive  conservation and management plans. Further, we attended two Study  meetings (on April 12, 2017, by telephone, and May 11, 2017, in person)  to obtain information about how Study members make expenditure  decisions.

The Sound\u2019s coastline is 583 miles and includes more  than 60 bays, with beaches and harbors where people interact most  frequently with the Sound. As shown in figure 1, the Sound is bordered by  Connecticut to the north and New York to the south and west, and its  watershed includes parts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Nearly all of Connecticut\u2019s waters drain into the  Sound, as do waters from the northern portion of Long Island and the  New York City metropolitan area. New York City is the most populous city  in the United States.", "In 1985, congressional committees directed EPA to work with states to  research, monitor, and assess estuaries including the Sound. Around the  same time, Connecticut, New York, and EPA raised concerns about  pollution in the Sound due to the presence of a large population living  near it, as well as 44 wastewater treatment plants and other industries  that discharged into the Sound. In addition, they also raised concerns  about pollution coming from sources that were not easily identified, such  as runoff from land surrounding the Sound.", "To restore the health of the Sound, EPA partnered with the two states in  1985 to form the Long Island Sound Study, a partnership consisting of  federal and state agencies, nonprofit and public organizations, and  individuals dedicated to restoring and protecting the Sound. The Study  has several committees and work groups that help to develop and  implement the comprehensive conservation and management plan for the  Sound. These groups include the Science and Technical Advisory  Committee and the Citizens Advisory Committee, as well as the Water  Quality Monitoring Work Group and the Habitat Restoration and  Stewardship Work Group, which are responsible for facilitating improved  collection, coordination, management, and interpretation of water quality,  and promoting restoration of the Sound through an improved  understanding of current threats.", "In 1987, the National Estuary Program was established under  amendments to the Clean Water Act; the act further required EPA to give  priority consideration to Long Island Sound, among others. According to  EPA, the National Estuary Program is a community-based program  designed to restore and maintain the ecological integrity of estuaries of  national significance. One year after the program was established, EPA  designated the Sound as such an estuary. Under the program, each  estuary of national significance has a management conference that is  required to develop a comprehensive conservation and management plan  to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of  the estuary, including water quality, among other things.", "In 1990, the Long Island Sound Improvement Act required EPA to  establish the Office of the Management Conference of the Long Island  Sound Study, to be directed by an EPA official and to assist the Long  Island Sound Study in carrying out its goals. The act required the Long  Island Sound Study Office, as directed by EPA, to provide administrative  and technical support to the management conference, or the Study. The  act also required the Long Island Sound Study Office to report biennially  on progress made in implementing the comprehensive conservation and  management plan starting no more than 2 years after issuing the final  plan. The Study, assisted by the Office, developed two reports\u2014the  Protection and Progress report and Sound Health report\u2014to show  progress toward the 1994 plan and issued the reports about every 2  years from 2001 through 2013. According to the Study, the purpose of  the Protection and Progress report was to highlight regional efforts to  restore and protect Long Island Sound, and the purpose of the Sound  Health report was to provide a snapshot of the environmental health of  Long Island Sound. In addition, the Study collects, tracks, and publishes  information about environmental indicators on its website periodically, and  has produced reports that summarized work done to carry out the 1994  plan.", "In its 1994 plan, the Study identified six priority problems and created  associated goals (see table 1).", "In the 1994 plan, the Study identified hypoxia as the major water quality  problem in the Sound, defining hypoxia as dissolved oxygen  concentrations of less than 3 milligrams of oxygen per liter of water and  noting that levels less than that are inadequate to support healthy  populations of estuarine organisms. The Study noted that hypoxia caused  significant, adverse ecological effects in the bottom water habitats of the  Sound, such as reducing the abundance and diversity of adult fish and  possibly reducing other species\u2019 resistance to disease.", "According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the  most common cause of hypoxia is nutrient pollution, specifically  discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus. As shown in figure 2, sources of  nutrient pollution include wastewater discharged from wastewater  treatment plant pipes and runoff from agricultural fields, stormwater, and  groundwater.  Excess nutrients can cause algae\u2014which occur naturally  in oceans, lakes, rivers, and other water bodies\u2014to rapidly multiply,  resulting in algal blooms that can discolor the water or accumulate as  thick scums and mats. When the algae die they sink and decompose, and  this decomposition consumes oxygen that is dissolved in water and used  by fish and shellfish to live. Reduced oxygen levels, in turn, can lead to  increased mortality for fish, shellfish, and other aquatic populations, or  can drive some species to relocate to more oxygenated waters. Water in  estuaries is naturally stratified, with less dense fresh warmer water  generally staying on top, and denser salty cool water on the bottom.", "In 2000, Connecticut and New York developed a total maximum daily  load (TMDL) to achieve water quality standards for dissolved oxygen in  Long Island Sound. In the TMDL, the states described efforts to manage  hypoxia and identified nitrogen as the key contributor to hypoxia and  identified the sources and amounts of nitrogen contributed to the Sound.  These include wastewater treatment plants in Connecticut and New York;  combined sewer overflows (CSO); nonpoint source pollution, or runoff  from sources such as residences and farms that includes stormwater and  groundwater; and atmospheric deposition. The TMDL set a 15-year  nitrogen reduction goal for Connecticut and New York, from both point  and nonpoint sources of nitrogen, to be achieved by August 2014. The  TMDL also calls for implementing management actions for nitrogen  entering the Sound from other states where feasible. In the TMDL,  Connecticut and New York identified the need for an adaptive  management approach because it would require nitrogen reduction  beyond the limits of technology current at the time. The states also  agreed to reassess the nitrogen reduction goals and revise the TMDL as  necessary."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Although a Comprehensive Assessment of Progress Has Not Been Conducted, Study Members Believe Moderate Progress Has Been Made Since 1994 The Study Collected a Wide Range of Data and Issued Progress Reports, but Did Not Conduct a Comprehensive Assessment of Progress Toward Achieving the 1994 Plan", "paragraphs": ["Although the Study has collected a wide range of data to measure the  health of Long Island Sound and has issued periodic progress reports  since 2001, these progress reports have not contained a comprehensive  assessment of progress toward the goals of the 1994 plan.

In addition, the Sound Health report included examples of  progress on toxic substances, but the report did not include a comparison  of the reduction of toxics discharged into the Sound against a numerical  goal for the reduction of toxic inputs. As we have previously reported,  having a numerical goal permits expected performance to be compared  with actual results. Part of the challenge for the Study to conduct such  an assessment arises from the fact that only one of the goals in the 1994  plan had numerical goals against which the Study could compare  progress.

According to EPA,  impervious cover\u2014land cover that does not allow water to infiltrate into  the ground\u2014increases the amount of stormwater that runs off into  streams, rivers, and other water bodies. Stormwater runoff can carry  pollutants such as pathogens, toxic substances, and nutrients to storm  drains, rivers, and streams that flow into the Sound. According to the  1994 plan, one way to reduce impervious cover and control stormwater  runoff is through the use of green infrastructure. Green infrastructure  includes practices and structures to manage stormwater that use or mimic  natural processes to slow stormwater runoff, filter pollutants from the  runoff, and facilitate stormwater storage for future use or to replenish  groundwater. An example of a green infrastructure project implemented  around the Sound is a bioswale, a vegetated area adjacent to a road,  designed to collect and filter stormwater, cleaning the water and  improving water quality by allowing it to seep into the soil.

According to  Study members, one way that the Study protected open space was by  identifying locations around the Sound that should be acquired and  protected from development. Specifically, in 2006, the Study designated  33 locations, called Stewardship Areas, to protect habitat and wildlife from  encroaching development. Stewardship Areas are locations within the  Long Island Sound region that have significant ecological, educational,  open space, public access, or recreational value and are protected from  development. Figure 4 shows the locations of the 33 Stewardship Areas  in the Long Island Sound region.", "The goal in the 1994 plan associated with the priority problem \u201chypoxia\u201d  was to increase dissolved oxygen levels in the Sound to eliminate  adverse impacts of hypoxia resulting from human activities. All 11 of the  Study members who provided a response about progress toward this goal  agreed that nitrogen has been reduced in the Sound since the 1994 plan,  while 4 said that they have not observed the expected reduction in  hypoxia. According to the 1994 plan, Study members based their  expectation on a water quality model they used at the time. As evidence  for nitrogen reduction in the Sound, Study members said that both  Connecticut and New York met their 15-year TMDL wasteload allocation  target to reduce nitrogen discharged into the Sound by 58.5 percent. To  achieve their nitrogen targets, the Study reported that the states  upgraded wastewater treatment plants. For example, communities in both states upgraded their plants with biological nutrient removal, a  process in which bacteria break down and remove the reactive nitrogen  found in human waste. According to EPA officials, recovery from hypoxia  in coastal waters will not be rapid or predictable and evidence shows that  dissolved oxygen levels in the Sound are recovering because of nitrogen  reductions.", "According to Study members, hypoxia is a complex phenomenon affected  by a number of factors that help to explain characteristics of hypoxia in  the Sound. For example, three Study members said that an increase in  water temperature can exacerbate hypoxia; warmer water holds less  oxygen than cold water. As a result, in summer months the combination  of temperature and salinity contributes to the isolation of the bottom layer  of water from the usually well-oxygenated surface layer. Two Study  members said that another factor that affects hypoxia is precipitation. For  example, heavy rainfall could increase the amount of stormwater runoff  that carries nutrients, such as nitrogen, into the Sound, which could lead  to an increase in algal blooms and hypoxia. According to the 2012 Sound  Health report, in 2012, Hurricane Sandy\u2019s storm surge overwhelmed  many wastewater treatment plants, and stormwater runoff entered the  Sound. In addition, four Study members said that there may be a lag  between a reduction in nitrogen and a reduction in levels of hypoxia.", "Several Study members said that the water quality model they used in  1994 to predict the relationship between hypoxia and nitrogen may have  incorrectly predicted the effect of reducing nitrogen on hypoxia or could  be improved to better show the relationship between the two. Beginning  in 2005, the Study conducted an evaluation of its water quality model that  identified fundamental weaknesses with how the model captured the  dynamics of hypoxia and mixing of water layers in the Sound.  Subsequently, the Study has funded the development of a new model  that it expects will more accurately reflect the relationship of the various  sources of nitrogen and hypoxia. A Study member said that it was not  possible to predict when the new model would be ready because of the  nature of the work. However, the Study member added that it may be 10  to 20 years before the data show if and how nitrogen reduction efforts  based on the new model reduce hypoxia."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The 2015 Plan Has Four Goals to Improve Water Quality and Ecosystem Functions, but Study Members Identified Various Factors that May Hinder Progress The 2015 Plan Has Four Goals and Associated Themes to Improve Water Quality and Other Ecosystem Functions", "paragraphs": ["The 2015 plan has four goals to improve water quality and restore and  protect ecosystem functions, among others.

To achieve the goals, the Study  developed specific outcomes, objectives, strategies, and action plans but  stated that factors such as insufficient funding and climate change may  hinder restoration efforts. In addition, most Study members stated that  even if the goals of the 2015 plan are met, new and emerging challenges  will require restoration efforts to continue, at a minimum, to monitor the  Sound.", "The 2015 plan has four goals, associated with four themes to improve  water quality and other ecosystem functions in the Sound while creating  sustainable communities and using sound science as a basis for  restoration. According to the 2015 plan, the goals and associated themes  were developed by building upon the progress already made toward the  1994 plan and years of research and monitoring of the Sound. As  previously mentioned, Study members said that the book they published  with many scientists helped to develop the 2015 plan. The book Long  Island Sound: Prospects for the Urban Sea, synthesized the advances in  science made over the past decades in understanding the Sound. Study  members also said that an update of the plan was needed to incorporate  an improved understanding of the Sound and to address new issues that  might affect restoration of the Sound. The four goals and their associated  themes are as follows.", "Clean water and healthy watersheds. The goal associated with this  theme addresses improving water quality through reducing  contaminant and nutrient loads from the land and waters impacting  the Sound. According to the 2015 plan, the condition of the Sound  depends on the quality of the water draining from the land around it  and, although progress has been made, the issues affecting water  quality in the 1994 plan remain. These issues include hypoxia,  pathogens, and development.", "Eelgrass   Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is a rooted  underwater plant with ribbon-like strands that  form beds and meadows in estuaries. These  beds are a haven for crabs, scallops,  numerous species of fish, and other wildlife  because the beds provide for them a habitat,  protection from predators, nursery grounds,  food, and oxygen. Additionally, eelgrass  improves water clarity by filtering pollutants  from runoff and by absorbing nutrients such  as nitrogen and phosphorus. It also protects  shorelines from erosion by absorbing wave  energy. Eelgrass health can be negatively  affected by excessive nutrients, limited  sunlight exposure, and high water  temperatures. For these reasons, the Long  Island Sound Study uses eelgrass growth as  an indicator for good water quality.", "Thriving habitats and abundant wildlife. The goal associated with  this theme addresses restoring and protecting the Sound\u2019s ecological  balance, including fish and shellfish populations and ecologically  significant shorelines and habitats along the Sound, to benefit both  people and the environment. According to the 2015 plan, the 1994  plan identified habitats and living resources to manage and protect  and the Study identified 12 types of coastal habitats for restoration,  including beaches and dunes, cliffs and bluffs, estuarine embayments,  coastal and island forests, freshwater wetlands, coastal grasslands,  intertidal flats, rocky intertidal zones, riverine migratory corridors,  submerged aquatic vegetation such as eelgrass, shellfish reefs, and  tidal wetlands. While progress has been made through acquiring  thousands of acres of land, according to the 2015 plan, habitat  connectivity and riverine migratory corridor reconnection can be  improved.", "Sustainable and resilient communities. The goal associated with  this theme addresses supporting communities to use, appreciate, and  help protect the Sound. According to the 2015 plan, local government  leadership, private sector engagement, community organizations, and  individual stewardship will be needed to restore the Sound. The  theme focuses efforts on communities, which was not a focus of the  1994 plan.", "Sound science and inclusive management. The goal associated  with this theme seeks to ensure the Study is using sound science and  cross-jurisdictional governance that is inclusive, adaptive, innovative,  and accountable throughout its restoration efforts in the Sound.  According to the 2015 plan, the Sound and its watershed covers more  than 16,000 square miles in six states and includes hundreds of local  watersheds. Management of the Sound involves collaboration and  governance among numerous partners and stakeholders who need  thorough understanding of the issues. According to the plan, such  understanding comes from research, monitoring, assessment,  mapping, and modeling programs.", "To achieve the goals associated with the plan\u2019s four themes, the Study  also developed outcomes, objectives, strategies, and implementation  actions and published these in the 2015 plan and supplemental  documents.

(See app. II for a list of all the factors Study members  identified that may hinder progress.)", "Of the 17 Study members we interviewed about factors that may hinder  progress, 14 said that insufficient funding can, for example, hinder their  ability to manage restoration efforts, mitigate the effects of development  and population growth, implement new projects, or effectively conduct  existing projects. One Study member said that development and  population growth can be overcome with mitigation activities, but that  these require funding. Another Study member said that insufficient  funding leads to vacant staff positions and that the Study member\u2019s  organization is strained with small staff numbers. This limits the Study\u2019s  ability to coordinate among the many agencies and programs working on  restoration. Another Study member identified the effects of insufficient  funding on a restoration project. Specifically, a town received a Study  grant for a green infrastructure project near the Sound, but the town  modified the project because the grant was smaller than what the project  needed. The project plan included constructing the building with  permeable parking surfaces and green features, such as rain gardens, to  help improve water quality. According to a town official, the town wanted  to do more green features but because it received a smaller grant, the  number of permeable surfaces and green features the town could build  were limited.", "Nine of the 17 Study members we interviewed said that climate change  can hinder restoration progress. Study members discussed different types  of effects that may be possible, such as affecting water temperature,  weather, and sea level. For example, two Study members said that  warmer waters caused by climate change could increase the Sound\u2019s  susceptibility to hypoxia by increasing the risk of potential harmful algal  blooms and the length of time low-dissolved oxygen remained at hypoxic  levels. Another Study member stated that warmer waters can cause  outbreaks of the naturally occurring bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus,  which accumulates in shellfish and affects the shellfishing industry. In  addition, two Study members said that changes in weather caused by  climate change could cause an increase in stormwater and therefore the  amount of pathogens washed into the Sound; another Study member said  that increased storm activity could destroy marshes. According to the  Study, salt marsh vegetation in tidal wetlands helps protect against  erosion and typically manages to accumulate enough sediment and  organic matter to keep up with naturally-occurring, gradual sea level rise.  However, the Study reported that tidal wetlands in the Sound may not be  able to keep up with the rise in sea level projected to result from climate  change. One Study member said that marshes are already being  affected by increased coastal flooding that may be caused by sea level  rise.", "As we reported in November 2013, changes in the climate\u2014including  warmer temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels,  and more frequent and intense storms\u2014affect water resources in a  number of ways, such as erosion and inundation in coastal areas. In  particular, we reported that a 2011 federal agency review of the potential  impacts of climate change on water resources identified four interrelated  areas of concern for water resource managers. One of the four is  protecting coastal and ocean resources as rising sea levels and changes  in storm frequency, intensity, and duration impact coastal infrastructure.  Also, in September 2014, we reported that ocean acidification\u2014the  increased absorption of carbon dioxide emitted by humans into the  oceans\u2014is resulting in chemical changes in the oceans that may pose  risks for some marine species and ecosystems, as well as for the human  communities that rely upon them for food and commerce.", "Tidal wetlands and salt marshes   Wetlands are areas that are inundated or  saturated by surface or groundwater and that  have a prevalence of vegetation adapted for  life in saturated soil conditions. Tidal wetlands  are specifically linked to estuaries\u2014locations  where sea water mixes with fresh water to  form an environment of varying salinity. Tidal  wetlands are among the most productive  ecosystems in the world, providing food,  shelter, and breeding or nursery grounds for  many species of wildlife. Salt marshes are a  type of tidal wetlands that have been flooded  and drained by salt water brought in by the  tides. Salt marshes help protect the land from  flooding and erosion in stormy weather, and  filter pollutants contained in storm water  runoff. Tidal wetlands are threatened by  changes in the climate causing sea levels to  rise more rapidly, which can cause tidal  wetlands to convert to open water.", "In addition, one expert we interviewed said that gains in restoring  marshes and wetlands already made by the Study may be lost due to  rising sea levels. To address this problem, another expert we interviewed  said that techniques such as spraying material dredged from the Sound,  such as sand and silt, across these areas for the purpose of raising  wetlands or marshes are being tested to keep up with sea level rise. One  expert also said that increased water temperatures around the Sound  may make the water uninhabitable for shellfish. EPA officials said that  while increased water temperatures will affect the relative abundance and  distribution of shellfish in the Sound, it cannot be concluded that the  Sound will become uninhabitable for shellfish because of increased water  temperatures. In addition, as we reported in October 2016, unusually high  water temperatures may enhance the growth of harmful algal blooms that  produce toxins causing neurological and other damage in fish  populations. Warming waters will also increase the Sound\u2019s  susceptibility to hypoxia because the solubility of oxygen decreases as  water temperature increases.", "Five of the 17 Study members we interviewed said that insufficient  scientific understanding and data related issues would hinder progress  toward restoration of the Sound. For example, one Study member  highlighted the need to better understand the relationship between  nutrients and hypoxia. That Study member also said that incomplete data  on nutrients, particularly from nonpoint sources, may hinder progress.  Another Study member said that obtaining data is difficult, in particular for  areas such as embayments and tributaries that are still affected with  nonpoint source pollution.", "Three of the 17 study members we interviewed said that development  and population growth will also hinder the progress of restoration. In  addition, 7 of the 17 Study members said that the Sound cannot be  restored to past conditions, and a key reason why is that development  and increased human population have led to changes in the Sound that  hinder full restoration. For example, one Study member said that  increased population and development can negatively affect water quality  because it resulted in a greater amount of impervious cover such as  highways and roads, which in turn increases the nutrient and sediment  pollution in runoff.", "Microbeads   Microbeads are pieces of manufactured  polyethylene plastic 5 millimeters or less in  size that are added as exfoliants to health  and beauty products, such as some  cleansers and toothpastes. These tiny  particles may pass through some water  filtration systems and end up in the oceans  and the Great Lakes, posing a potential threat  to aquatic life. For example, microbeads can  look like food to fish and other marine  organisms. Once ingested, microbeads can  obstruct an animal\u2019s digestive system. In  addition, microbeads can absorb  contaminants that can be hazardous to  animals that eat the microbeads, and, in turn,  can harm the animals and people that  consume them.", "Three of the 17 Study members we interviewed said that insufficient  public appreciation of the Sound would hinder progress toward  restoration. In this context, two Study members highlighted that much of  the land along the Sound is privately owned, which makes it difficult for  some to travel to the Sound or to appreciate it.", "Nearly all of the Study members who we interviewed said that even if the  goals associated with the four themes of the 2015 plan are achieved,  restoration efforts will need to continue into the future because the Sound  will continue to face new challenges and threats and that the Study will  need to continue monitoring the Sound to understand them. For example,  microbeads are an emerging issue that was not addressed in the 2015  plan. In 2015, after the Study issued the 2015 plan, a Southern  Connecticut State University research team reported that it had found  microbeads in New Haven Harbor, Connecticut. Microbeads are small  pieces of plastic found in common household products that can make  their way into waterbodies and threaten aquatic life. In December 2015,  the federal government enacted the Microbead-Free Water Act of 2015,  which banned the manufacturing, distribution, and offer for sale into  interstate commerce of rinse-off cosmetics that contain intentionally- added plastic microbeads. In addition, in June 2015, Connecticut had  enacted legislation that phased in bans on the manufacturing, import,  sale, or offer for sale of personal care products and over-the-counter  drugs that contain microbeads in that state. New York had proposed  legislation to address the issue of microbeads in early 2015 but did not  enact it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Study Members Have Identified Long-Term Targets and Indicators to Measure Progress, but Have Not Yet Fully Incorporated Leading Practices for Performance Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Study members said that they plan to use 20 long-term targets with  associated indicators to measure progress toward the goals associated  with the four themes of the 2015 plan.

Study members are in the process of collecting data that will be used to  finalize a numerical goal. These Study members said that it may take a  year or more to collect the necessary data.", "Generally, the 19 experts we interviewed agreed that the indicators used  by the Study were valid, accurate, and reliable ways to measure progress  for the 20 long-term targets, but some experts also suggested  improvements. For 12 of the 20 indicators, all of the experts we  interviewed agreed that they were valid, accurate, and reliable. For  example, one expert pointed out that the indicator for the riparian buffer  extent target is the only practical way to measure progress. Another  expert said that the indicator for the coastal habitat extent target is a good  choice because it can show progress that the public can easily  understand. A few experts suggested improvements to make some of  the indicators more useful for measuring progress. For example, one  expert said that the indicator for the target \u201cextent of hypoxia\u201d would be  better if the focus were on the Western Sound, where hypoxia is a greater  problem. The expert also questioned why the Study is concerned with  hypoxia across the entire Sound when some areas are only slightly  hypoxic and not big enough to have a great impact on the overall level of  hypoxia in the Sound. EPA officials responded that the target \u201cextent of  hypoxia\u201d is focused on the Western Sound. They added that it must be  noted that target applies everywhere in the Study because changes in  water quality could occur anywhere in the Sound.", "For the other eight indicators, not all experts we interviewed agreed on  these indicators. For example, for the tidal wetlands indicator\u2014the  acreage of tidal wetlands restored to help restore tidal flow\u2014eight of nine  experts we interviewed said that the indicator was valid, accurate, and  reliable, but one expert said that it was too simplistic. This expert said that  a better indicator would focus on the amount and health of marsh grasses  that are planted to restore the tidal wetlands. This is because marsh  grass health is affected by nitrogen levels and sea level rise, which also  impact tidal wetlands. For the approved shellfish area indicator\u2014the  acreage of approved shellfishing areas\u2014six of eight experts we  interviewed said that the indicator was valid, accurate, and reliable, but  two experts disagreed. One of these experts said that the target is part of  the theme to improve water quality and that shellfishing areas can be  approved for administrative reasons that are not related to water quality  improvement. The other expert added that certain shellfish areas in New  York are closed because budget constraints limit the number of reviews  that can be conducted to reopen shellfishing areas.", "The use of numerical goals to monitor progress toward the 20 long-term  targets is consistent with leading practices for performance management  that we have identified in our previous work. We have found that a key  attribute of successful performance measures is that they have  quantifiable numerical goals or other measurable values that permit  expected performance to be compared with actual results. Additionally,  we have reported that intermediate goals and measures can be used to  show progress or contribution to intended results.", "During the course of our work, we shared with Study members our  concern that only 2 of the 20 long-term targets have intermediate  targets.

The focus of the project is to  reverse forest fragmentation and degradation by removing non-native  plants and planting native trees, shrubs, and herbs.", "In addition to the funds expended by the four Study members above,  officials from three other Study members\u2014the Natural Resources  Conservation Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers\u2014also said that they expended funds for restoration  activities in the region around the Sound but do not isolate expenditures  made specifically for the Sound. For example, officials from these Study  members said that the agencies expended funds for activities in the  region that contributed to restoration but were not intended solely to  restore the Sound. They each provided examples of restoration  expenditures or costs for fiscal years 2012 through 2016: the National  Resource Conservation Service expended $54 million through programs  such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program; the U.S.  Geological Survey expended about $3.8 million on data monitoring and  other activities; and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expended $27  million for 13 projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2015 Plan Estimated that Future Activities May Cost At Least $18.9 Billion, but the Estimates Address Only Some of the Plan\u2019s Long-Term Targets", "paragraphs": ["Study members estimated in the 2015 plan that future restoration  activities would cost at least $18.9 billion over 20 years. Nearly all the  amount was for activities addressing the goal to achieve clean waters and  healthy watersheds. As shown in table 6, Study members estimated that  activities under that goal could cost at least $18.1 billion from 2015  through 2035. The cost estimate included $5.5 billion specifically for work  on wastewater treatment plants in New York, Connecticut, and the upper  watershed states, which may include upgrading the plants with available  technologies for nutrient removal. Study members also estimated that  activities to reduce nitrogen by addressing CSOs and urban stormwater in  Connecticut may cost at least $4.4 billion and $700 million. Finally, the  cost estimate included $12.4 billion to complete ongoing work in New  York and Connecticut to reduce overflows from combined sewer systems  as well as sewer systems that are not combined with stormwater  systems.", "The remainder of the $18.9 billion was for activities related to goals to  achieve thriving habitats and other restoration themes. As shown in table  7, Study members estimated that these other activities could cost $778  million from 2015 through 2035. According to the 2015 plan, activities to  address the goals to achieve thriving habitats and abundant wildlife, such  as by protecting open space, may cost $650 million\u2014$500 million in New  York and $150 million in Connecticut. These activities could include  acquiring properties that the Study has identified as high priority for  conservation to minimize coastal development in the future. Study  members also estimated in the 2015 plan that Connecticut and New York  would spend about $4 million each on education activities. These  activities could include volunteer and outreach efforts for the general  public at the 33 Long Island Sound Stewardship Areas, such as how  human disturbance can affect wildlife.", "Economic guidance generally states that investment decisions should be  informed by a consideration of both benefits and costs of relevant  alternatives. For example, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  has issued guidance on estimating costs and benefits to help federal  agencies efficiently allocate resources through well-informed decision  making about activities. This guidance includes OMB Circular A-94,  which we have previously identified as providing leading practices for  economic analysis. OMB Circular A-94 directs agencies to follow certain  economic guidelines for estimating costs and conducting cost- effectiveness analyses of federal programs or policies to promote efficient  resource allocation through well-informed decision making in certain  circumstances. The guidance applies to federal agencies and programs,  but we have previously found that it provides leading practices for  economic analysis of investment decisions. Under OMB Circular A-94, a  cost estimate is to include a comprehensive assessment of the costs.", "By developing its $18.9 billion estimate, the Long Island Sound Study has  taken steps to assess the potential costs of future restoration activities.  However, the 2015 plan includes 20-year cost estimates for activities  related to 10 of the 20 long-term targets that the Study plans to achieve.  These cost estimates focus primarily on activities to achieve clean waters  and healthy watersheds and thriving habitats and abundant wildlife.  These include restoration activities that address wastewater treatment  plants to help achieve the long-term target nitrogen loading, and  restoration activities to conserve open space to achieve the long-term  target protected open spaces. However, the total does not include the  cost of activities to achieve other long-term targets such as river miles  restored for fish passage, tidal wetlands extent, marine debris, and public  access to beaches and waterways.", "A Study member said that the Study completed 20-year estimates for  proposed restoration activities where feasible and included them in the  2015 plan. The Study member also said that EPA worked with Study  members to develop cost estimates using costs for past restoration  activities. However, the Study member said that the exact course of  action, and therefore costs, for many of the long-term targets were not  defined and were still uncertain. For example, the Study only recently  invested funds to evaluate nitrogen reduction targets to attain water  quality standards, which can be used to determine the scope of work  needed and costs to inform a cost estimate associated with achieving the  nitrogen loading target. OMB Circular A-94 recognizes that estimates of  costs are typically uncertain because of imprecision in underlying data  and assumptions and states that this uncertainty can and should be part  of the analysis and estimate. According to the circular, because such  uncertainty is basic to many analyses, its effects should be analyzed and  reported. One way to handle such uncertainty in a cost estimate is to  perform a sensitivity analysis, which will result in a range of possible cost  estimates. By working with Study members to develop cost estimates that  include analyses of uncertainties for each of the targets in the plan, EPA  and the Study could better estimate the comprehensive costs for Long  Island Sound restoration and could better allocate resources and make  decisions about their financial investments in the Sound.", "In addition to the 20-year cost estimates, the 2015 plan contained four  supplemental documents that described the 139 implementation actions  for carrying out the strategies for the plan\u2019s four themes in greater detail  as well as estimated costs for carrying out those implementation actions  for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. EPA\u2019s funding guidance for  comprehensive conservation and management plans states that agencies  should estimate the range of potential costs of all actions to implement  the plan. For the four 5-year supplemental documents that it developed,  EPA worked with the Study to create four cost ranges: (1) $0 to $25,000;  (2) $25,000 to $150,000; (3) $150,000 to $1 million; and (4) greater than  $1 million. The Study then assigned these ranges to the implementation  actions in the four 5-year implementation plans for each theme. However,  the Study only assigned 75 percent of the 139 implementation actions in  the 2015 plan to these four ranges. Instead of a cost range, the Study  identified the funding needs for more than a third of the remaining 25  percent of the actions as staff time or not applicable. A Study member  said that the Study did not assign a range of costs for staff time and  identified some action costs as not applicable because, for example, the  work required would be intermittent or the associated costs were  accounted for in other implementation actions. According to Circular A-94,  uncertainty, such as staff time, should be included in a cost estimate. In  addition, implementation actions for which costs are accounted for  elsewhere could be assigned to the Study\u2019s first cost range, $0 to  $25,000. According to the Study member, estimates of potential cost  ranges for the implementation actions could be included in future  supplements to the 2015 plan. By working with the Study to estimate the  range of potential costs for all the implementation actions and including  the estimates in future supplements to the 2015 plan, EPA would have  better   assurance that Study members have complete information to  guide resource allocation decisions about activities to achieve the goals  of the 2015 plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["By identifying six priority problems and associated goals in the 1994 plan  and taking actions to achieve these goals, the Study, with EPA as  director, has provided a long-standing focus on improving the water  quality and other ecosystem functions in the Sound and its surrounding  watershed.

EPA stated that working with the Study the agency:  plans to further evaluate, develop, and apply leading practices of  performance reporting as it finalizes its reporting format, estimating  enhancements to the reporting format will be available on the Study\u2019s  website by the end of 2019; will evaluate the range of costs needed to  attain each of the targets and include cost estimates with uncertainty  bounds in future updates of the plan, expecting the enhanced cost  information will be available on the Study\u2019s website by the end of 2019;  and will ensure that the planned update to implementation actions  includes a range of costs for all implementation actions, estimating  actions will be completed in 2020.", "In its written comments, EPA suggested two specific revisions to our  report. First, EPA stated that the Study has established more intermediate  goals than we included in our report. In our report, we said that as of  March 2018, the Study had established intermediate targets for 7 of the  20 long-term ecosystem targets. According to EPA\u2019s comments, applying  the methodology that we used in the report to the 20 ecosystem targets  results in 11 targets having intermediate goals. EPA also stated that the  agency will work with the Study to better communicate these existing  intermediate goals on the web pages reporting ecosystem progress. In  response to this information, we analyzed the Study\u2019s web pages that  were available in June 2018 and agreed that five additional ecosystem  targets had intermediate goals as of that date. We revised the report to  include this information.", "Second, EPA stated that the report\u2019s statement that the 2015 plan  estimates that future implementation activities may cost nearly $21.9  billion is a misleading interpretation of the 2015 plan\u2019s implementation  costs because the plan does not present that figure. EPA stated that table  6 in our report appeared to double count Connecticut\u2019s combined sewer  overflow costs in the 2015 plan by including both the $4.4 billion taken  from text and $3 billion taken from a table in the plan. Although we  presented these data to EPA during our review, the error was not caught  until the draft report was reviewed. EPA stated that the 2015 plan is  admittedly unclear in attributing costs to specific categories and that the  agency will work with the Study to clarify the estimated implementation  costs in future updates. In response to EPA\u2019s comments, we reviewed the  2015 plan and removed the $3 billion cost estimate for Connecticut\u2019s  combined sewer overflow from table 6 and revised the total cost estimate  for future restoration activities to $18.9 billion.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, Administrator of EPA, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of  Commerce, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Interior, and other  interested parties.

Instead, we  noted the limitations the Study associated with the data to better interpret  Study members\u2019 views. For some priority problems, Study members said  that they were unable to provide a response because they did not have  sufficient knowledge or data about progress toward the associated goals.  As a result, the total number of Study members who answered these  questions varied by priority problem and, for each priority problem, we  identified the total who provided a response.
