While sexual harassment is not a defined term in  Title IX, it can constitute sex discrimination under Title IX in some  circumstances if, among other things, the harassment is \u201cso severe,  pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively bars the victim\u2019s  access to an educational opportunity or benefit.\u201d", "Some federal agencies and NASEM define sexual harassment based on  specific behaviors.

According to  the Consultant Report on the University of Texas System Campus  Climate Survey for NASEM, female medical and engineering students  enrolled in the University of Texas System were more likely to experience  sexual harassment by faculty or staff compared with students enrolled in  other majors.", "Title IX enforcement responsibilities. Title IX of the Education  Amendments of 1972 is the primary federal law that addresses sex  discrimination under education programs or activities receiving federal  financial assistance, including federally funded grant programs at  educational institutions, such as universities. Under Title IX, federal  agencies that award grants to educational institutions, including  universities, have enforcement responsibilities to ensure such institutions  do not discriminate based on sex. Enforcement responsibilities fall  under four main areas:  1.  Issuing regulations. Title IX requires that agencies promulgate  regulations to provide guidance on Title IX enforcement to recipients  of federal financial assistance who administer education programs or  activities.  2.  Obtaining assurance from university grantees that they are in  compliance with Title IX. Most of the agencies we reviewed require  grantees to submit an \u201cassurance of compliance\u201d form as part of their  grant application or award to attest compliance with anti-discrimination  laws, including Title IX.  3.  Conducting periodic compliance reviews of funding recipients.", "Grant funding agencies are required to conduct periodic Title IX  compliance reviews of university grantees. A Title IX compliance  review is an agency\u2019s assessment of whether a grantee is complying  with the law. According to DOJ\u2019s Title IX legal manual, federal  agencies have broad discretion in determining which grantees to  review for compliance. Federal agencies may conduct these reviews  on-site at a university (grantee) or via a desk audit. In both types of  review, agency officials, among other things, review documentation  that indicates compliance, such as the universities\u2019 policies and  procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving Title IX  complaints. During on-site reviews, officials interview staff, faculty,  and students about their awareness of Title IX and any issues of  potential sex discrimination that they have encountered.  4.  Investigating written complaints of sex discrimination against  recipients in a timely way. Federal agencies are required to  establish and publish procedures for the prompt processing and  disposition of complaints. An individual alleging discrimination on the  basis of sex by a university can file a discrimination complaint with  multiple entities, including the university or one of the federal agencies  that provides funding to the university, which could include Education  or another funding agency.", "In 2015, we reported on six federal agencies\u2019 grant making to women in  STEM research, including their Title IX compliance activities. We found  that the Departments of Defense, and Health and Human Services were  not conducting required Title IX compliance reviews at universities they  funded and recommended that they periodically do so. In response to  our recommendation, HHS conducted three Title IX compliance reviews  in 2018 and according to officials, the agency initiated additional Title IX  compliance reviews in 2019 and 2020.", "Education and DOJ also have responsibilities for administering Title IX.  Education plays a key role in ensuring compliance with Title IX as it  provides funding to most universities in the United States. DOJ\u2019s Civil  Rights Division is responsible for enforcing federal statutes prohibiting  discrimination of protected classes, including Title IX. Under Executive  Order 12250, DOJ also has the responsibility for playing a leadership role  in coordinating the \u201cconsistent and effective implementation\u201d of several  civil rights laws, including Title IX.", "In 2015, we reported that DOJ had no formal information-sharing process  for federal agencies to exchange best practices on Title IX compliance  activities, and we recommended that it establish such a process. In  response to our recommendation, DOJ reconstituted the Quarterly Title IX  STEM discussion group in February 2016 to facilitate information sharing  across the six major STEM grant-making federal agencies.", "Recipients of federal assistance\u2014in this case, university grantees\u2014also  have Title IX compliance responsibilities. Specifically, universities are  responsible for ensuring Title IX compliance, designating an employee to  coordinate compliance (e.g., a Title IX coordinator), establishing  procedures to promptly and equitably resolve student and employee  complaints of sex discrimination made against the university, and  publishing a notice stating that they do not discriminate on the basis of  sex.

In the compliance report, agencies  can recommend a grantee take action to improve existing compliance  efforts to prevent sex discrimination and may highlight promising  practices by grantees. For example, NASA recommended in a written compliance report that a grantee provide more targeted Title IX training  geared toward STEM students and faculty, noting that such training  should focus on subtle forms of gender bias that pervade STEM  programs as well as on more egregious examples of sexual harassment.  Similarly, HHS made recommendations in three of its compliance reviews  for grantees to notify students and faculty of their right to file a Title IX  complaint with the HHS Office for Civil Rights. University grantees are not  required to implement the agency\u2019s recommendations, but they must take  corrective actions to resolve findings of Title IX noncompliance, according  to DOE, HHS-OCR, NASA, and NSF officials.", "Agencies are required by law to seek voluntary compliance for Title IX  violations. If an agency finds that a grantee has violated Title IX  (noncompliance), it first seeks to establish voluntary compliance through  a resolution agreement\u2014an agreement with the agency and grantee  outlining corrective actions for the grantee. If the agency is unable to  achieve voluntary compliance in a Title IX case, it may initiate  proceedings to suspend or terminate federal funding, or refer the case to  DOJ for possible litigation. According to officials, the five agencies we  reviewed have not suspended or terminated funding to enforce Title IX,  including sexual harassment. Instead, according to agency officials, their  reviews have found that most grantees are in compliance with Title IX  from fiscal year 2015 through 2019, except for one grantee, where the  agency worked with the grantee to achieve voluntary compliance.", "To leverage limited resources, three of the five agencies\u2014DOE, NASA,  and NSF\u2014conducted joint Title IX compliance reviews. These reviews  occur when two agencies providing funding to the same grantee jointly  assess whether the grantee is complying with the law.

Some actions may go beyond meeting Title IX compliance requirements.  NASA identifies promising practices to provide grantees with information  and examples on practices they may wish to consider replicating to help  enhance or supplement their equal opportunity efforts, according to  officials. For example, NASA noted a promising practice in which a  grantee presents campus training sessions on Title IX at which  participants develop bystander behavior skills, discuss consent and  sexual respect, and learn how to encourage and support reporting of  sexual misconduct. In addition, this university grantee facilitates the  workshop using clickers to allow real-time, anonymous audience  response, enabling the facilitators to measure learning progress and see  attitudinal shifts in real time. According to NASA, since the inception of its  Title IX compliance program, the agency has followed a philosophy of  providing meaningful technical assistance to universities, including  identifying and reporting on promising practices of the universities that the  agency reviews. NASA officials told us this approach mitigates the fact  that the agency only has the resources to conduct compliance reviews at  a few of its hundreds of grantees annually.", "NSF takes a similar approach. For example, NSF\u2019s webpage for  promising practices has a link to a university\u2019s complaint resolution flow  chart as an example for others to draw on. According to NSF officials, the  agency values opportunities to learn about practices that have the  potential to make significant and meaningful impacts on grantees\u2019 efforts  to create and maintain research environments that are safe and free from  sexual and gender-based harassment. Moreover, according to officials,  NSF grantees have expressed gratitude to the agency for sharing what  other universities are doing that is working well.", "In contrast, while DOE, HHS, and USDA identified promising practices in  some of their Title IX compliance reviews, they have not clearly publicized  a list of these practices to the broader grantee community.", "DOE has posted reports of Title IX compliance reviews, but no list of  promising practices. As a result, grantees who want to learn from  other universities would need to review individual compliance reports  and search for promising practices. DOE does plan to develop a  publication that identifies promising practices and lessons learned  from its Title IX compliance reviews in fiscal year 2020, according to  officials. The agency did not provide any plans or timeframes because  officials stated that DOE\u2019s Office of Civil Rights is determining the best  approach for this project.", "USDA-NIFA is planning to create mechanisms to publicize best  practices, according to officials, but it has not yet done so.

As a result, USDA did  not provide further details about how and when it will publicize  promising practices.", "In October 2019, HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights (HHS-OCR) updated its  Title IX webpage to include a section dedicated to sexual harassment,  including links to resources, guidance, and effective practices (also  called promising practices) from other agencies, as well as a written  resolution agreement between HHS and a university grantee that  resolved findings of sex-based harassment. While a dedicated  webpage for sexual harassment is a positive step, HHS\u2019s webpage  includes promising practices from other federal agencies\u2014Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission and NSF\u2014but not HHS. HHS- OCR officials told us that promising practices are similar across  federal agencies. However, HHS Title IX compliance reviews cover  grantees that may be different from other federal agencies, such as  medical colleges, and these grantees may face unique challenges in  complying with Title IX.", "For example, according to the 2018 NASEM report, women students,  trainees, and faculty in academic medical centers experience sexual  harassment by patients and patients\u2019 families, in addition to the  harassment they experience from colleagues and those in leadership  positions. HHS-OCR officials told us that the resolution agreement lists  corrective actions that may be considered promising practices. However,  a grantee who wanted to learn about these practices would need to know  that they exist in the agreement and then review the document to find  them. The agency has already identified potential promising practices in  some its completed Title IX reviews. Therefore, publishing a separate  list of these practices and corrective actions from resolution agreements  on its website would require few resources and could benefit grantees.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should use quality information to achieve its objectives and  externally communicate such information to achieve objectives. The  vast majority of grantees are reviewed for Title IX compliance infrequently  by the five agencies and therefore receive little to no information on such  compliance from these agencies. Moreover, while grantees can access  completed Title IX reviews on some agencies\u2019 websites, this endeavor  would still require grantees to review the written reports in detail to  uncover any promising practices.

In 2018, NSF modified its grant terms and conditions to  require university grantees to notify the agency if there is a finding of  sexual harassment against a principal investigator (PI) or co-PI on an  NSF-funded grant, or if administrative action was taken against a PI or  co-PI due to an allegation or complaint of sexual harassment. In 2019,  NSF established written procedures to review these notifications from  university grantees to determine if the university handled the matter  adequately and appropriately, and if further action is needed by NSF.

Instead, agencies rely on  general efforts to evaluate their website or are developing plans for  such an evaluation. As a result, the agencies do not know the extent  to which their various communication mechanisms are working and  whether students, researchers, faculty, and university officials are  getting the information they need from these mechanisms.", "For example, as previously stated, all five agencies use their website  as the main mechanism to communicate information about Title IX  complaint procedures to individuals at universities receiving federal  grants. While agencies have taken steps to add more information to  their websites for individuals at universities receiving federal grants,  we found some of the agencies\u2019 websites difficult to navigate. Even  when key content existed, it was sometimes spread across multiple  sections of the website or buried in supplemental materials, or in one  case, associated with an incorrect destination page. For example,  NSF officials stated that they prefer formal Title IX complaints be filed  via their online complaint portal. However, this tool is not linked to the  tab of the website discussing how to file complaints. Additionally,  HHS-OCR\u2019s newly-developed Title IX and sex-based harassment  websites are not referenced or linked to the information on laws and  regulations enforced by HHS-OCR or the complaints page.

Nor can they be sure these policies and procedures are  reaching the right university officials. For example, Title IX officials  from two universities and one university system said that they had not  received any information from the five agencies on their sexual  harassment prevention policies for grantees. Two Title IX officials  stated that, even if this information is already provided to the  university departments or offices conducting scientific research, it  should also be given to the university\u2019s Title IX office, with one official  noting they are the part of the university responsible for overseeing  compliance with sexual harassment policies and procedures under  Title IX. Title IX university officials also told us that the federal  agencies providing their grants had never provided them with  information on agencies\u2019 policies and procedures for how individuals  at their institutions could file sexual harassment complaints. One Title  IX university official described how they would not know how to tell  someone to proceed if they wanted to file a complaint with the agency  funding their research project.", "Officials from all five agencies acknowledged the value of evaluating  their grantee sexual harassment prevention efforts and noted that  they may be able to conduct such evaluations in the future.

As we reported in June 2019, their  completed or planned actions include modifying current department- level or agency-wide policy statements to include more specific  definitions and examples of sexual harassment and strengthening  requirements for their university grantees to report on findings of  sexual harassment. The 2018 NASEM report also noted that, while  it is clear that the agencies are concerned about sexual harassment in  STEM, it is not yet apparent whether and how actions such as their  new policy statements will translate into meaningful action.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should define objectives clearly to enable the identification  of risks and define risk tolerances; for example, in defining objectives,  management may clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to achieve  it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also state that  federal agencies should establish and operate monitoring activities to  evaluate results, select and periodically evaluate methods of  communication, and define objectives in specific and measurable terms.

In 2017  alone, the media covered over 97 allegations of sexual harassment at  institutions of higher education with some of the most high-profile cases  occurring in the fields of science, engineering and medicine, according to  the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. Federal  agencies, in connection with the billions of dollars in research funding  they provide to universities and other institutions each year, are required  to enforce Title IX\u2014prohibiting sex discrimination, including sexual  harassment\u2014at these universities. As part of their enforcement  responsibilities, all five agencies have conducted the required Title IX  compliance reviews, but three agencies\u2014DOE, HHS-OCR, and USDA\u2014 are missing an opportunity to share promising practices from their Title IX  compliance reviews with the broader grantee community. Given that  these agencies conduct compliance reviews at only a handful of the hundreds of grantees they fund in any given year, the vast majority of  grantees receive little to no information on Title IX compliance reviews  from these agencies.", "Another tool federal agencies can use to address sexual harassment is  the prompt processing and disposition of Title IX complaints from  students and employees. Although all five selected agencies received  Title IX complaints, DOE and USDA have not finalized and published  complaint procedures, as required by DOJ\u2019s regulations. Furthermore,  USDA does not provide clear information about the complaint process on  its website\u2014its primary means of communicating information to  individuals and grantees. As a result, the agency may be missing the  opportunity to better serve individuals seeking relief from sexual  harassment at universities.", "Federal agencies can also review information from individuals seeking to  notify the agency of a concern related to sex discrimination\u2014including  sexual harassment\u2014in an informal manner outside of the Title IX  complaint process. However, only HHS-NIH and NSF communicate the  option to submit concerns, and only HHS-NIH has a written process for  reviewing such concerns. In a single year, these concerns outnumbered  formal Title IX complaints received by all the agencies over 5 years. The  2018 NASEM report, agency officials, and stakeholders we interviewed  noted the importance of informal ways for individuals to report concerns  outside of formal complaint processes, which can protect an individual  from retaliation, alert agencies to possible Title IX violations, and help  agencies select sites for Title IX compliance reviews.", "Two HHS components\u2014NIH and OCR\u2014do not share sexual harassment  complaint information with each other. This poses the risk that HHS-NIH  will be unaware of situations in which HHS-OCR finds non-compliance  with Title IX and may approve a STEM research grant for that university.  It also raises the possibility that NIH will receive concerns about a  university that may warrant a Title IX compliance review, but the Office for  Civil Rights may be unaware of these concerns.", "Establishing clear goals and an overall plan can help agencies assess  progress and manage change, including, in this case, the creation of new  sexual harassment prevention efforts for grantees. Although all five  agencies have established a variety of prevention efforts, they have done  so without a plan, and without methods to evaluate their policies and how  they communicate them. As a result, agencies do not have a way to  measure progress toward preventing sexual harassment at their  university grantees, including how or whether these efforts are helping  university grantees and individuals who have been subject to harassment.", "Finally, interagency coordination can help improve the results of agency  activities. DOJ has not fully adopted two key interagency collaboration  leading practices for its interagency working group. Without doing so, the  agency is missing an opportunity to enhance and sustain collaboration  among agencies as they continue to address the problem of sexual  harassment at universities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are making 17 recommendations, including four to DOE, one to DOJ,  four to HHS, two to NASA, one to NSF, and five to USDA.
