In accordance with MDB guidelines, MDBs are responsible for supervising how the executing agencies administer the procurement process. (See app. I for information about the MDB project development and procurement process.) These guidelines are generally incorporated in the loan agreement between the executing agencies and MDBs and emphasize the need for (1) considering economy and efficiency in project implementation and (2) providing all eligible bidders from MDB member countries with opportunities to compete for contracts. The guidelines also allow for the use of local preferenceswhen comparing bids, to help develop domestic contractors and manufacturing industries in the borrowing country.

Through membership on MDB boards of executive directors, the Treasury is responsible for managing U.S. participation in MDBs and promoting U.S. exports by helping to ensure that MDB procurement guidelines are fair and implemented properly. Commerce has a statutory role in promoting U.S. business interests in MDBs as well. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (1988 Trade Act) requires the Secretary of Commerce to staff a part-time or full-time procurement officer at each MDB and inform U.S. firms about MDB business opportunities. The Jobs Through Exports Act of 1992 increased the staffing requirement by directing the Secretary of Commerce to assign at least one additional full-time procurement officer to each MDB."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify and compare the U.S. market share with that of other industrialized countries that are major competitors for MDB contracts, we analyzed contract award and disbursement data in MDB annual reports and other documents for 1989 to 1994, the most recent time frame for which data were available for MDBs we reviewed. We obtained data from ADB, EBRD, IDB, and the World Bank. Because we do not have audit authority over MDBs, we did not verify the statistics, but we discussed the data with MDB and Treasury officials to ensure that the data were suitable for our analysis. The Treasury recommended that we use publicly available information in the MDBs\u2019 annual reports. Our review focused on the major industrialized competitors of U.S. firms based on their market share of the world\u2019s total merchandise exports as reflected in United Nations (U.N.) trade statistics. U.S. firms\u2019 major industrialized competitors are firms from France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. Data on U.S. and its major competitors\u2019 market share are presented in nominal U.S. dollars because the focus of our analysis was on each country\u2019s market share between 1989 and 1994 and not on the changes in the amount of contract awards or disbursements during this time period.", "To gain a broader perspective on MDB market shares for U.S. firms and their major industrialized competitors, we compared their relative rankings in MDBs to their rankings based on U.N. export data. Comparisons to U.N. data were for exports from 1989 to 1993 to developing countries that were members of the World Bank. We also did this comparison for each of the regional banks. (As of June 1995, general export data for 1994 were not available.) These two data sets may contain different mixtures of goods and services, however, a factor that would affect the extent to which the market shares would correspond. For example, U.N. data for U.S. exports to one country may be largely agricultural, but the goods and services exported to the same country for MDB contracts may be industrial.", "Our analysis of MDB contract award and disbursement data relates only to public sector projects that MDBs financed. We did not include MDB private sector operations because cumulative private sector lending constituted less than 5 percent of public sector loans in most MDBs since inception and complete data on U.S. competitors\u2019 participation in private sector projects were not available.", "To describe any obstacles U.S. firms may face when competing for MDB projects and the services that the U.S. government provides for them, we interviewed officials from the Treasury and Commerce, TDA, the Agency for International Development (AID), the Small Business Administration, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank. We also interviewed officials of U.S. trade associations located in the United States, such as the American Consulting Engineers Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Construction Industry Manufacturers Association, to gain an understanding of U.S. businesses\u2019 needs.

First, MDB procurement data may be based on the address to which payments are made and may not always indicate the origin of the goods. Second, the level of detail in which MDBs report data did not allow us to identify the procurements from subcontractors, subsidiaries of multinational firms, or joint ventures, so the market share for the United States and other countries may be understated or overstated. Third, MDBs publish data differently in their annual reports, which makes comparing the U.S. market share to that of its major competitors across the banks difficult. For example, the World Bank and IDB report their data based on disbursements, while ADB and EBRD report their data based on the contracts awarded. In addition, MDBs operate within the framework of global trade, the nature of which makes it difficult to identify goods from particular countries because they may contain inputs from several countries. Without detailed and uniform data, it is difficult to obtain an exact measure of the U.S. MDB market share. Taking into account these data limitations, the Treasury uses MDB data as an indicator of U.S. performance. Treasury officials told us that using MDB data from annual reports is generally adequate for measuring the U.S. firms\u2019 market share for MDB-financed projects.

At IDB, U.S. firms\u2019 average market share was 20 percent or about $500 million annually, compared to firms located in France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K., which had an annual average share of less than 5 percent each. By contrast, the market share for U.S. firms in ADB averaged about 7 percent or $204 million, placing them behind Japanese firms with about 10 percent. With regard to EBRD, since 1991, when EBRD was established, U.S. firms have received about 11 percent of all public sector contracts awarded, behind German firms (17 percent) and Italian firms (15 percent).", "These market shares are based on the total amount of MDB contract awards and disbursements from 1989 to 1994, which varied considerably by bank. The World Bank had the largest amount of disbursements, with an annual average of $16 billion. Annual averages for ADB and IDB were $3 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. As of March 1994, EBRD cumulative public sector contract awards were $283 million. See appendix III for a table listing dollar amounts of MDB contract awards and disbursements to U.S. firms and firms from the four major industrialized competitors from 1989 to 1994.", "The relative ranking of U.S. firms in each MDB appears similar to their ranking in overall exports to World Bank developing countries.Compared to their major competitors, U.S. firms appeared to be as competitive in the MDB market as they were in traditional world exports. For example, the value of U.S. firms\u2019 share of World Bank disbursements was 1.5 times greater than the value of disbursements for Japanese firms, which ranked second. Similarly, the value of U.S. firms\u2019 overall exports to World Bank developing nations was almost 1.5 times greater than the value of Japanese firms\u2019 exports. (See app. IV for further information on U.S. firms\u2019 rankings.)", "To further explore the U.S. market share of World Bank disbursements, we analyzed the types of goods and services purchased from U.S. firms and their major competitors. Central to this analysis is the classification of goods and services as local or foreign procurements. Goods and services purchased within the borrowing countries where the projects are implemented are classified as \u201clocal procurements,\u201d while those purchased outside of the borrowing countries are classified as \u201cforeign procurements.\u201d Since U.S. and other firms from industrialized countries are included in disbursements for foreign procurements, our analysis of the components of the U.S. share is focused on foreign procurements.", "From 1989 through 1994, U.S. firms averaged $1.35 billion in World Bank disbursements annually. The largest amount was for equipment ($630 million) and other goods ($588 million). The balance was for consulting services and civil works. (See table 1.) Compared to their major competitors at the World Bank from 1989 to 1994, U.S. firms were the largest supplier for foreign disbursements by averaging 17 percent of goods, 13 percent of equipment, and 18 percent of consulting contracts. In comparison, U.S. firms averaged about 3 percent of foreign disbursements for civil works.", "According to a U.S. construction industry association, U.S. construction firms are discouraged from competing for World Bank civil works projects because firms from developing countries may have geographic and labor cost advantages and benefit from MDB domestic preference rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Borrowing Member Countries Received a Large and Increasing Share of MDB Procurement", "paragraphs": ["Firms from borrowing countries have received a large percentage of MDB disbursements. From 1989 to 1994, borrowing countries averaged over half of the contract awards and disbursements in ADB, IDB, and the World Bank. Some MDB and U.S. industry officials attribute this phenomenon to several factors: (1) borrowing countries\u2019 development and increases in manufacturing capability, (2) multinational firms\u2019 operations in borrowing countries, and (3) MDB rules that give preferences to local firms. However, according to a 1991 ADB study, the application of domestic preferences has had a limited impact on the pattern of contract awards. The study stated that at ADB and IDB, preferences have accounted for about 3 percent, and at the World Bank about 11 percent, of the total value of international competitive bidding contracts in which the preferences were specified in the bid documents. An ADB official said that most firms in the borrowing country would have won the contracts anyway because of domestic tax structures and low shipping and labor costs.", "To illustrate the market share for borrower countries, figure 2 shows the average market share of industrialized and borrower countries at the World Bank for 1989-94. These market shares were a combination of foreign disbursements and local disbursements.", "About half of the World Bank\u2019s overall disbursements were to borrower countries in 1989-94, and these disbursements were primarily for local disbursements. Seven of the World Bank\u2019s borrower countries\u2014India, China, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, and Argentina\u2014together received almost one-third of the World Bank\u2019s disbursements from 1989 to 1994. Other developing countries received 19 percent of overall disbursements, of which about three-quarters were for local procurements. As shown in figure 3, the major proportion of disbursements to these countries was for MDB projects within their borders. For example, with an average of 7.8 percent annually of total World Bank disbursements from 1989 to 1994, India was the second largest recipient of World Bank disbursements, slightly behind the United States. Yet, India\u2019s market share largely consisted of local procurements (7.2 percent), versus less than 1 percent (0.6 percent) for foreign procurements.", "A variety of factors may affect U.S. firms\u2019 future share of the MDB market, such as the increases in the market share of developing member countries and recent growth in the MDBs\u2019 social sector lending. Increases in developing countries\u2019 share of the MDB market may reduce the share of the MDB market for U.S. firms and other industrialized countries. While most foreign procurement has come from suppliers in industrialized countries, suppliers from developing countries have increasingly been effective in winning contract awards. In 1989 at the World Bank, the cumulative percentage of foreign procurement for developing countries was 15 percent. In 1994, developing countries had 32 percent of foreign disbursements. If the developing countries\u2019 share continues to increase, the U.S. share of this market may drop. Nevertheless, U.S. government and business officials believe that as these countries develop, they may increase their overall demand for U.S. goods and services.", "Another factor that may affect the U.S. market share is the increased emphasis some MDBs are giving to social sector and environmental projects. According to the Treasury, increased lending in these areas may not adversely affect the U.S. market share because U.S. firms are leaders in these areas. Furthermore, our review of MDB lending documents showed that although MDBs have increased their lending for social sector activities, they have not decreased their lending for some infrastructure projects, such as energy and transportation\u2014areas in which U.S. firms have been competitive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Obstacles to Competing for MDB Contracts Exist, but the U.S. Government Provides Services to Assist Firms", "paragraphs": ["Some U.S. firms face various obstacles when competing for MDB projects, some of which businesses can address through individual marketing strategies.

Although MDBs publish information on MDB projects throughout the project cycle, it may not be specific and timely enough to help firms respond adequately to bids. U.S. business officials told us that when MDB procurement notices are released, it may be too late to start preparing bids. Foreign government and U.S. business officials said that to help overcome this obstacle, some foreign firms use their resources to learn about projects in detail before the requests for proposals or bid documents are issued. But, according to U.S. government and business officials, some U.S. firms, especially small to medium-sized firms, do not have or are unwilling to spend the money and take the risks involved in pursuing MDB projects, partly because the project cycle spans several years and a project could be disapproved for MDB financing or scaled back.", "Another obstacle some businesses face is the cost of marketing their products to the executing agencies. Although the procurement process is designed to be fair, and all businesses are to have the same access to information MDBs publish, Treasury and Commerce officials said it is critical for businesses to market directly to executing agencies in the borrowing countries because these agencies purchase items for MDB-financed projects. Businesses can market their products by establishing some form of local presence, such as having an agent or office in-country, or by frequently visiting the executing agencies in the borrowing countries and MDBs. U.S. and foreign government officials told us that establishing a local presence to market goods and services is expensive, especially for small to medium-sized firms. But, according to some U.S. business officials, without a local presence it is difficult for firms to learn about the market and culture of the borrowing countries and conduct business directly with executing agencies.", "Businesses can address some of these obstacles through their own business strategies. U.S. government and business officials told us that U.S. firms have to decide whether or not to make the MDB market a part of their overall export strategy and pursue MDB opportunities. For example, U.S. firms can develop a local presence in the borrowing countries by establishing joint ventures with local firms. This measure would help U.S. firms receive timely information on projects and market their products and may also enable them to benefit from local preference in MDB competition. U.S. firms could also subcontract with local firms to help establish a local presence and decrease labor costs. For small to medium-sized firms that do not have the resources to pursue MDB contracts alone or as prime contractors, U.S. government officials said they advise these firms to subcontract with large U.S. firms that have experience in the market or to team up with other small firms to bid on projects as ways to participate in the MDB market.", "MDB and U.S. government and business officials further noted that U.S. firms could lose contracts because they did not follow one or more of the bid specifications. One U.S. firm\u2019s bid proposal for a project financed by ADB had about 200 deviations from the specifications; the firm subsequently lost the bid. Another U.S. business official told us that his firm now has a representative in Manila that provides a liaison with ADB officials and executive agencies to help ensure that his firm\u2019s bid proposals comply with the bid specifications.

In carrying out this function, the U.S. Executive Director of each MDB is to help ensure that MDB procurement rules are observed and that U.S. firms are treated fairly, as envisioned by the act. Treasury officials told us that by working to build consensus with other member countries, the Treasury has played an important role in procurement reforms at MDBs. The reforms are designed to improve bank procurement rules and procedures and maintain fairness in the procurement system. For example, the Treasury supported many of the World Bank\u2019s procurement reforms that the Bank initiated as part of its portfolio management review in 1992. As a result of the review, the World Bank has done the following: It has established a procurement advisory committee to review proposals for goods contracts over $25 million and consulting contracts over $10 million. Through this committee, the World Bank is to monitor the consistency with which borrowing countries apply bank procurement guidelines. It issued revised procurement guidelines in January 1995. As part of the revision, the World Bank revised language to clarify and simplify procedures for social sector lending and other small-value contracts. It has increased procurement training for World Bank and borrower staff to improve their procurement skills, institutional expertise, and quality of documentation. It has required borrowers to use standard bidding documents for international competitive bidding. With standardized documents, according to a Treasury official, the procurement process should be more efficient and transparent because it should decrease the amount of time needed to review bid documents and help businesses better understand the bid specifications.", "In 1990, the Treasury reviewed the IDB\u2019s procurement process and made nine recommendations to improve procurement supervision and expand the dissemination of IDB project information. In a prior review, we corroborated Treasury\u2019s findings and concurred with its recommendations. According to Treasury officials, IDB has dealt with most of Treasury\u2019s recommendations. These included increased procurement training for IDB and borrower procurement staff and wider dissemination of information explaining IDB procurement procedures.", "According to the Treasury, IDB has hired a procurement chief and increased procurement training for its field offices and for executing agencies. To expand information dissemination on IDB projects, IDB developed a booklet on its procurement procedures, established monthly briefings to discuss IDB projects in the pipeline, and required borrowers to advertise in international publications.", "At EBRD, the Treasury was involved in developing the original procurement guidelines for EBRD when it was established in 1991 and in revising subsequent procurement guidelines, according to Treasury officials. For example, as a result of Treasury\u2019s efforts, EBRD clarified the requirements for following public sector procurement guidelines to include projects, such as public utilities, that are majority owned or controlled by a national or local government.", "At ADB, a Treasury official said that the Treasury is monitoring the degree to which U.S. firms win contracts relative to their competitors when executing agencies award \u201cinternational shopping\u201d contracts. In 1989, ADB raised the threshold for goods contracts that are eligible for international shopping from $300,000 to $500,000. According to the Treasury official, U.S. firms have not been disadvantaged relative to their major competitors by the increased threshold.", "While Treasury officials said MDBs have made progress in strengthening their procurement operations, the Treasury is continuing to work with MDBs to improve MDB procurement policies and rules and the supervision of the procurement process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Treasury and Commerce Are to Address Complaints That U.S. Firms Raise", "paragraphs": ["The 1988 Trade Act requires the U.S. executive director of each MDB to (1) investigate thoroughly any complaints from U.S. bidders about the awarding of procurement contracts by MDBs and (2) ensure that all contract procedures and rules of the banks are observed. Both the Treasury and Commerce have assisted some firms that have complained about aspects of MDB bidding or bid evaluation processes. U.S. firms may raise complaints that involve alleged unclear or biased specifications, the bid evaluation method, contract award practices, and other issues. Businesses are to raise procurement complaints first with the executing agencies or MDB staff responsible for the project. If the firms are not satisfied with the result, they can then discuss their complaints with the U.S. Executive Directors Office at the particular MDB.", "Neither the Treasury nor Commerce systematically collect data on the number of bid complaints lodged by U.S. firms; therefore, we do not know the number of complaints U.S. firms have made. Treasury officials told us that many complaints are resolved by bringing the issue to the attention of the MDB project staff. We found documentation that showed that the Treasury and Commerce have addressed various procurement disputes, including those that involved prequalification of bidders and questionable trade practices in the context of the invitation for bids. For example, one U.S. firm protested a foreign competitor\u2019s supplementary bid in which the competitor offered a lower-priced bid for substantially upgraded technology. The U.S. firm believed the competitor violated the spirit of ADB-approved bid rules. With the assistance of the ADB\u2019s U.S. Executive Directors Office and the Commerce officer, the U.S. firm was awarded the contract. In another case, a Treasury official stated in congressional testimony that the Treasury has been successful in bringing about the reversal of contract awards, reopening bids, and canceling loans when the borrowers were unwilling to follow procurement procedures.

Because MDB data in the annual reports were aggregated, we did not know the mix of goods that went to each nation and, therefore, could not weight the export data by country and mix of goods.
