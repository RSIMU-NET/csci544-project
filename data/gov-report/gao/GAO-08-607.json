While the benefits of this convergence are enormous, such interconnectivity also poses significant challenges to our nation's ability to respond to major disruptions. Two operations centers--managed by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Communications System and National Cyber Security Division--plan for and monitor disruptions on voice and data networks. In September 2007, a DHS expert task force made three recommendations toward establishing an integrated operations center that the department agreed to adopt. To determine the status of efforts to establish an integrated center, GAO reviewed documentation, interviewed relevant DHS and private sector officials, and reviewed laws and policies to identify DHS's responsibilities in addressing convergence."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has taken the first of three steps toward integrating its centers that are responsible for planning for, monitoring, and responding to disruptions to the communications infrastructure, including voice and data networks, and the security of data and applications that use these networks. Specifically, in November 2007, it moved the operations center for communications infrastructure (NCC Watch) to office space adjacent to the center for data and applications (US-CERT). This close proximity allows the approximately 41 coordination center and 95 readiness team analysts to, among other things, readily collaborate on planned and ongoing activities. In addition, the centers have jointly acquired common software tools to identify and share physical, telecommunications, and cyber information related to performing their missions. For example, the centers use one of the tools to develop a joint \"morning report\" specifying their respective network security issues and problems, which is used by the analysts in coordinating responses to any resulting disruptions. While DHS has completed the first integration step, it has yet to implement the remaining two steps. Specifically, although called for in the task force's recommendations, the department has not organizationally merged the two centers or invited key private sector critical infrastructure officials to participate in the planning, monitoring, and other activities of the proposed joint operations center. A key factor contributing to DHS's lack of progress in implementing the latter two steps is that completing the integration has not been a top DHS priority. Instead, DHS officials stated that their efforts have been focused on other initiatives, most notably the President's recently announced cyber initiative, which is a federal governmentwide effort to manage the risks associated with the Internet's nonsecure external connections. Nevertheless, DHS officials stated that they are in the process of drafting a strategic plan to provide overall direction for the activities of the National Communications System and the National Cyber Security Division. However, the plan is in draft and has been so since mid-2007. In addition, DHS officials could not provide a date for when it would be finalized. Consequently, the department does not have a strategic plan or related guidance that provides overall direction in this area and has not developed specific tasks and milestones for achieving the two remaining integration steps. Until DHS completes the integration of the two centers, it risks being unable to efficiently plan for and respond to disruptions to communications infrastructure and the data and applications that travel on this infrastructure, increasing the probability that communications will be unavailable or limited in times of need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Effective voice and data networks and the information traveling on them  are essential to our ability as a nation to maintain public health and safety  during a catastrophic natural disaster, such as a hurricane, or a man-made  event, such as a terrorist attack.

Federal policies  assign two Department of Homeland Security (DHS) components\u2014the  National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) and the National  Communications System (NCS)\u2014responsibilities for planning for and  facilitating our nation\u2019s response to major disruptions on the  communications infrastructure, including voice and data networks.", "In April 2007, DHS established a task force of subject matter experts to  study, among other things, whether there were opportunities to merge  NCSD and NCS operations. In September 2007, the task force made three  recommendations aimed at integrating aspects of NCSD and NCS  operations, namely those responsible for preparing for and responding to  network disruptions. DHS accepted the recommendations and, in doing  so, adopted a high-level approach for integrating the operations that  included the following steps:    collocating the operations center of the national communications system  that oversees the communications infrastructure, including voice and data  networks\u2014namely, the National Coordination Center Watch (NCC Watch)  with the operations center of the NCSD that oversees the security of data  and applications that use the communications infrastructure\u2014called the  U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT),   developing an integrated operations center by merging NCC-Watch and  inviting private sector critical infrastructure officials to participate in the  planning, monitoring, and other activities of the new operations center.", "In response to your request, our objective was to determine the status of  efforts to integrate NCSD and NCS activities to prepare for and respond to  disruptions on converged voice and data networks. To accomplish this, we  reviewed DHS documentation and interviewed DHS officials. To  determine how these components were addressing convergence issues, we  interviewed private sector stakeholders to obtain their perspectives on  DHS\u2019s efforts to address convergence and reviewed laws and policies to  identify DHS\u2019s responsibilities in addressing convergence. We conducted  our work in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, from September 2007  to June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example,  these networks use technology based on packet switching, which allows  greater resiliency. Packet switching involves breaking a message into  packets, or small chunks of data, and transferring the packets across a  network to a destination where they are recombined. The resiliency of  using a packet-switching network is due to the packet\u2019s ability to be  transmitted over multiple routes, avoiding areas that may be congested or  damaged. Conversely, conventional voice services use traditional  telephone networks, which are based on circuit switching technology.  Instead of breaking a message up into packets, circuit-switching uses a  dedicated channel to transmit the voice communication. Once all of the  channels are occupied, no further connections can be made until a  channel becomes available. Figure 1 shows a comparison between packet  switching and circuit switching.", "Converged networks, however, also pose certain technical challenges. For  example, current national programs to provide priority voice services in an  emergency are based primarily on voice or traditional telephone networks,  which are circuit-switched. Implementing these networks on packet- switched networks is difficult because there is no uniformly accepted  standard for providing priority service on a packet-switched network.  Also, the Internet-based protocols used on packet-switched networks have  vulnerabilities and in certain cases, packet-switched networks may be  unreliable for emergency communications due to delays in transmission  and loss of packets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Policies Provide for Critical Infrastructure Protection for Communications", "paragraphs": ["Federal policies call for the protection of essential public and private  infrastructures, such as the electric power grid, chemical plants, and water  treatment facilities that control the vital functions critical to ensuring our  national economic security and public health and safety.

Federal policies also designate certain federal agencies as lead  points of contact for each key critical infrastructure sector and assign  responsibility for infrastructure protection activities and for coordination  with other relevant federal agencies, state and local governments, and the  private sector. (See app. II for a description of the sectors and the  designated federal agencies.) DHS is the lead federal agency for both the  telecommunications and information technology (IT) sectors.

It notes that the Internet is used by all critical infrastructure  sectors to varying degrees and that it provides information and  communications to meet the needs of businesses, government, and the  other sectors. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan requires lead  federal agencies for the critical infrastructure sectors to work with public  and private sector stakeholders to develop sector-specific plans that  address how the sectors\u2019 stakeholders will improve the security of their  assets, systems, networks, and functions. We recently reported on how  comprehensively these sector-specific plans address the cyber security  aspects of their sectors, including the plans for the IT and  telecommunications sectors.

In February 2002, before the formation of DHS, a White  House advisory group recommended that the federal government develop  such an approach.

The committee recommended that DHS  establish an inclusive and effective incident response capability that  includes functions of the NCC and a broadened membership, including  firms in the IT sector. The committee also stated that most new  communications providers are not members of the NCC, were not easily  accessible during an incident, and had not yet developed close working  relationships with other industry stakeholders and the federal government.", "In June 2006, we recommended that DHS improve its approach to dealing  with disruptions by examining the organizational structure of NCSD and  NCS in light of the convergence of voice and data networks.

To the contrary, there is strong evidence that shows that  DHS\u2019s ability to respond is negatively impacted by the use of separate centers,  rather than a single integrated and merged entity. Specifically, our past work  has shown that overlapping responsibilities for incident response have  adversely affected DHS\u2019s ability to prioritize and coordinate incident response  activities. For example, private-sector firms have reported that in responding  to a critical incident, DHS made time-consuming and duplicative requests for  information without identifying how this information would be beneficial in  helping respond to the event. In addition, the DHS-commissioned expert task  force on the subject recently reported that without an organizationally  integrated center, the department will not have a comprehensive operating  picture of the nation\u2019s cyber and communications infrastructure and thus not  be able to effectively implement activities necessary to prepare, protect,  respond, and recover this infrastructure. Further, our interviews with private- sector cyber and communications infrastructure executives performed as  part of this engagement found that they also favor a merged organization that  includes broad industry participation.
