Key DOD documents are outdated, not integrated, or not comprehensive. Three separate directives, for example, respectively assign overlapping responsibilities related to law enforcement support to three different DOD entities. Because DOD's law enforcement support directive has not been updated or superseded since 1989, it is unclear which entity is responsible for certain coordination activities with law enforcement agencies. By updating, integrating, and ensuring the comprehensiveness of its strategy, policy, and guidance, DOD will be better positioned to enhance and institutionalize its interagency coordination efforts for homeland defense and civil support. DOD makes great effort to communicate with its federal partners through conferences and other forums and multiple documents, but it lacks a single, readily accessible source for its interagency partners to find needed information about its processes. The 2008 National Defense Strategy notes that a unified \"whole-of-government\" approach to national security issues requires that federal partner agencies understand core competencies, roles, and missions, and the National Response Framework highlights the value of using a common concise partner guide for this purpose. DOD's communication approach, however, relies largely on personal relationships that are subject to frequent rotation of both DOD and non-DOD personnel. DOD identified over 30 documents that embody its approach and processes for interagency coordination. A concise and readily accessible partner guide would provide incoming personnel from both DOD and other agencies information that could enhance their mutual understanding and facilitate a unified and institutionalized approach to interagency coordination. DOD has taken some actions to adopt key practices for managing homeland defense and civil support liaison personnel, but it has not fully implemented these practices. Key practices include situational awareness, staffing-needs assessments, position descriptions, training, and performance assessments. For example, while individual DOD entities may know the liaisons they have assigned to their federal partners, no single DOD entity knows the number or locations of all liaisons exchanged with other federal agencies. Also, while DOD policy recognizes the need to conduct personnel performance assessments, such assessments of its liaisons are not focused on coordination competencies, and DOD does not consistently request input from federal partners on the performance of its liaisons or provide feedback to its federal partners about their liaisons' performance. DOD could optimize its use of liaisons if it fully implemented current DOD human capital policies and issued policies and guidance for the remaining key practices identified above."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Numerous events occurring in the United States\u2014ranging from planned  events, such as inaugurations, to unexpected emergencies, such as natural  disasters\u2014require that the Department of Defense (DOD) coordinate,  integrate, and synchronize its homeland security missions with a broad  range of U.S. federal agencies. Examples of such coordination include  those with the Federal Aviation Administration for the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001; with the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration for the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003; with the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for Hurricane Katrina in  2005; with the Department of Transportation for the I-35 bridge collapse in  Minnesota in 2007; and with the U.S. Secret Service for the Presidential  Inauguration in 2009.

DOD protects the homeland through two distinct but  interrelated missions: homeland defense and civil support. Homeland  defense is the protection of U.S. sovereignty, territory, domestic  population, and critical defense infrastructure against external threats, as  directed by the President. As the lead agency for homeland defense, DOD  is responsible for the homeland defense mission, which it conducts  through air, land, maritime, space, and other supporting operations; other  departments and agencies support DOD\u2019s efforts. Civil support is the  overarching term for DOD\u2019s support to U.S. civil authorities for domestic  emergencies, designated law enforcement, and other activities.

In  addition, to specifically determine the extent to which DOD has  articulated to its federal partners the approach of its entities with regard to  interagency coordination, we reviewed more than 30 DOD documents,  including classified documents, that DOD officials said articulated the  department\u2019s homeland defense and civil support missions, its entities\u2019  roles and responsibilities, and its culture and concepts. To determine the  extent to which DOD has adopted and implemented key practices for  managing homeland defense and civil support liaisons, we reviewed  established best practices identified in prior GAO reports on human  capital best practices, DOD interagency coordination conference  proceedings and white papers, as well as joint DHS-DOJ guidelines for  interagency coordination for homeland security, which similarly  recommend the use of such best practices. For all three objectives, we  also met with knowledgeable DOD staff in multiple offices and commands  within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  National Guard Bureau, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency,  NORTHCOM, and PACOM to discuss their roles and responsibilities and  the actions that they are taking to address interagency coordination. We  discussed DOD\u2019s interagency coordination efforts with non-DOD officials  from over a dozen U.S. federal agencies or offices, including four agencies  or offices within DHS, four agencies or offices within DOJ, three agencies  or offices within USDA, two agencies or offices within HHS, the Office of  the Director of National Intelligence, and the El Paso Intelligence Center.  We selected and visited multiple locations where DOD coordinates with its  federal partners on a daily basis, including four FEMA regions,  NORTHCOM headquarters, PACOM headquarters, DHS headquarters,  FEMA headquarters, the National Counter Terrorism Center, and the El  Paso Intelligence Center and met with knowledgeable officials to discuss  their roles and responsibilities and the actions that they are taking to  address interagency coordination. In selecting the specific locations we  visited, we used criteria such as locations of DOD commands that have  key roles and responsibilities in coordinating with federal agencies for  homeland defense and civil support, such as NORTHCOM headquarters.  We used similar criteria when selecting non-DOD sites to visit. For  example, we selected the four FEMA regions that we visited based on  geographic location; region size; number of requests for assistance for the  region between January 1, 2008, and May 31, 2009; types of assistance  requested; and GAO resources required.

The  strategy also does not reflect changes to the national preparedness system  since September 2005\u2014such as the issuance of the National Response  Framework. Additionally, the June 2005 strategy does not incorporate  changes made in the National Defense Strategy when it was reissued in  June 2008, nor does it reflect changes made in the National Homeland  Security Strategy when it was reissued in October 2007. According to  ASD/HD officials, revision of the strategy began in October 2008 but was  postponed due to the change in presidential administrations.

For example, the 2008 National Defense Strategy states  that a unified \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach is possible only when  every government department and agency understands the core  competencies, roles, missions, and capabilities of its partners. DOD\u2019s 2009  Quadrennial Roles and Mission Review Report states that the department  supports a coherent framework that includes commonly understood  strategic concepts, operational principles, relationships between agencies,  and roles and responsibilities that could help delineate how to best  coordinate and synchronize efforts between DOD and other federal  agencies. The National Response Framework recognizes that a concise,  common guide is valuable when addressing challenges to effective  response, such as the relatively high turnover and short tenure among  officials responsible for response at all levels.

DOD also  generally prohibits its concept plans from being shared with its federal  partners, even though DOD entities are supposed to support these federal  agencies within the homeland, and several of these concept plans are  unclassified documents. By not providing a single, readily accessible  partner guide to its federal partners, DOD is in effect expecting them to  research, attempt to obtain access to, and then determine the mission of,  roles and responsibilities of, protocols for, and methods for initiating  relationships with DOD entities. The National Response Framework  recognizes the importance of partner guides, as they provide stakeholder- specific ready references describing key roles and actions for response  partners. In March 2010, FEMA issued a series of partner guides to serve  as ready references of key roles and actions for local, tribal, state, federal,  and private-sector response.", "In addition, some of the DOD documents were written in a manner that  could lead to misunderstandings and unclear expectations between DOD  and its federal partners.

The  estimated time frame for fulfilling a support request, according to Joint  Task Force-North officials, would be at least 180 days, and sometimes  more than a year. However, officials from a law enforcement agency told  us that they would contact Joint Task Force-North if they needed  immediate or near-term DOD assistance, as it was their belief that this  would be part of that command\u2019s mission.

DOD recognizes the  need to have situational awareness of its liaisons. For example, at a  January 2009 interagency coordination conference that the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Policy hosted with DOD and non-DOD  agencies, DOD officials found that the department should increase the  level of awareness of the liaisons it has detailed to non-DOD agencies, as  well as non-DOD liaisons that have been detailed to DOD entities, to  minimize duplication and widen the overall interagency collaborative  effort. Similarly, a DOD instruction requires the department\u2019s Washington  Headquarters Services to track and record approved liaisons.", "We found that DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services and ASD/HD, the  principal DOD representative with interagency partners for homeland  defense and civil support matters, did not have a complete list of all the  liaisons DOD has detailed to its partners, or vice versa. According to  Washington Headquarters Services\u2019 records, there were only 2 DOD  personnel at DHS headquarters for fiscal year 2009\u2014yet an informal  survey of DOD personnel conducted by the ASD/HD representative to DHS  headquarters during the summer of 2009 found more than 110 DOD  personnel, from a variety of DOD entities, working at DHS as liaisons,  subject-matter experts, or in other capacities. Officials at DOD\u2019s  Washington Headquarters Services told us that they did not have complete  awareness of DOD liaisons sent to DOD\u2019s federal partners because this  information had not been provided to Washington Headquarters Services  by the DOD entities exchanging liaisons. Similarly, ASD/HD and DOD\u2019s  Washington Headquarters Services lacked knowledge of the liaisons  whom their federal partners had assigned to different DOD entities,  because DOD lacks policy or guidance that requires such action. As a  result, DOD entities, such as Defense Coordinating Officers and Joint Task  Force-North, may not be fully aware of the liaisons whom they could  leverage for their specific missions. For example, a Defense Coordinating  Officer told us that a point of contact and relationship with a  representative from the Department of Energy would enhance his ability  to meet some of his responsibilities. The Defense Coordinating Officer told  us he was not aware of the Department of Energy liaison assigned at  NORTHCOM headquarters and available for his needs.", "Further, while Washington Headquarters Services and ASD/HD are not  precluded from sharing information with each other, they have not done  so. ASD/HD officials told us they were not utilizing the information  possessed by Washington Headquarters Services regarding DOD liaisons  detailed to other federal agencies because they were not aware of the  instruction directing Washington Headquarters Services to track and  record approved liaisons. Officials from ASD/HD acknowledged that DOD  currently has a gap in its guidance regarding situational awareness of  liaisons exchanged for homeland defense and civil support missions, and  that it plans to issue such guidance by the end of 2010. By enforcing  compliance with DOD\u2019s current instruction on tracking its liaisons and by  issuing additional guidance regarding liaisons exchanged for homeland  defense and civil support matters, DOD will be better positioned to have  complete situational awareness of exchanged liaisons, minimize  duplication of resources, and broaden the overall interagency  collaborative effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Conducted an Overall Staffing-Needs Assessment for the Exchange of Liaison Personnel", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not conducted a departmentwide staffing-needs assessment of  liaisons that the department sends to its federal partners and vice versa to  ensure that the department is leveraging resources appropriately and is  sensitive to its federal partners\u2019 missions and capacities. DOD guidance  recognizes the need to determine resource requirements for the exchange  of liaison personnel, stating that DOD combatant commanders are to  utilize liaison officers, as appropriate, to facilitate coordination with other  federal agencies and ensure sound management of DOD resources. At  the same time, DOD officials at the January 2009 interagency coordination  conference recognized that DOD needs to be sensitive to the capacity of  its federal partners to provide liaisons to a range of DOD entities  requesting such liaisons. We have also previously reported that key  practices for effective and efficient workforce planning and management  include, among others, conducting routine staffing-needs assessments to  identify personnel resource requirements needed to further the agency\u2019s  mission.", "According to NORTHCOM officials, the command has conducted informal  staffing-needs assessments for some of its non-DOD liaisons. Specifically,  DOD initially assessed the command\u2019s need for liaisons from other federal  agencies when the department funded three liaisons to the command upon  its establishment in 2003. Subsequently, NORTHCOM conducted informal  staffing-needs assessments by surveying the command staff to determine  whether they had identified additional liaisons who should be located at  the headquarters to support the command\u2019s mission. As a result of these  informal determinations of staffing needs at NORTHCOM\u2019s headquarters,  the number of federal agencies with representatives located at the  command\u2019s headquarters has increased from 3 in 2003 to 18 in 2009.  NORTHCOM has additional representatives from agencies that are not  located at the command\u2019s headquarters. According to NORTHCOM  officials, these personnel are able to set up temporary offices at the  command\u2019s headquarters for exercises and other events, as needed.  NORTHCOM used a similar informal approach to assign 2 liaisons to DHS  and FEMA headquarters and 3 additional interagency coordination  representatives to the command\u2019s Washington Office. As with  NORTHCOM, PACOM officials stated that PACOM has not conducted a  formal staffing needs assessment for the exchange of liaisons. Rather, the  federal partner liaisons located at PACOM reflect evolving informal  determinations of staffing needs. ASD/HD has also placed liaisons with its  federal partners, including 11 officials at DHS, 1 official at the Homeland  Security Council, and 1 official at the White House.", "However, officials from ASD/HD\u2014the principal DOD entity responsible  for coordinating the determination of requirements for the DOD-wide  exchange of liaisons with federal partners for homeland defense and civil  support\u2014told us that they have not conducted a formal DOD-wide  staffing-needs assessment to determine which DOD entities should  exchange liaisons with which federal partners. As a result, ASD/HD does  not have a way of ensuring that DOD entities, which have been able to  establish their own liaison requirements without a DOD-wide staffing- needs assessment, have not placed too many liaisons at certain agencies  and have not neglected to place an adequate number of liaisons with  DOD\u2019s other federal partners. In addition, NORTHCOM officials told us  that they lack guidance on determining the appropriate number and  selection of agencies from which they should be exchanging liaisons.  Officials from ASD/HD acknowledged that DOD currently has a gap in its  guidance for determining the appropriate number and selection of  agencies and that it plans to issue such guidance in 2010.

DOD policy and guidance also state that both uniformed and civilian  personnel, which include DOD liaisons to federal agencies, should have  position descriptions that identify their duties, qualifications, supervisory  status, and other requirements of the position. For example, in March  2007, DOD\u2019s Joint Forces Command issued guidance for combatant  commanders that provided generic position descriptions, qualifications,  and exchange durations for federal partner liaisons assigned to a Joint  Interagency Coordination Group within a combatant command.  Participants at the January 2009 DOD interagency coordination conference  endorsed the need for liaisons to have defined roles and responsibilities,  and recommended that the department ensure that memoranda of  understanding\u2014one approach to identifying position descriptions\u2014are  developed early in relationships between DOD and federal partner  agencies.

DOD entities  have not fully complied with the policy and guidance requiring them to  develop position descriptions for their liaison personnel.", "We also found that DOD has not consistently issued position descriptions  or guidance to federal agencies sending liaisons to DOD entities. DOD  officials told us that they do not believe it is their responsibility to identify  the roles and responsibilities; requisite knowledge skills, and abilities; and  duration of exchange of non-DOD personnel. Instead, they said, that  responsibility belongs to the non-DOD liaisons\u2019 agencies. We note,  however, that while that responsibility might belong with the other  agencies, DOD exposes itself to potentially conflicting expectations and  negative relationships with liaisons or their agencies by not consistently  identifying the DOD entity\u2019s expectations to its federal partners before the  liaisons are selected. For example, we were told about two separate  instances in which expectation differences between NORTHCOM and non- DOD liaisons limited the command\u2019s ability to fully utilize the non-DOD  liaisons as the command had initially intended. NORTHCOM officials told  us that they have learned from both of these instances and are developing  a standard memorandum of understanding that identifies the roles and  responsibilities; requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities; and duration of  exchange for each non-DOD liaison assigned to the command, and that it  will be signed by the command and the liaison\u2019s home agency. DOD  entities have not consistently developed position descriptions for their  non-DOD liaisons, either through memoranda of understanding or other  means, because they lack policy that requires them to take such action.", "Officials from ASD/HD acknowledged that DOD currently has gaps in its  guidance with regard to defining the roles and responsibilities; requisite  knowledge, skills, and abilities; and duration of exchange for liaison  positions, as well as for the use of memoranda of understanding to define  such positions.

We have previously reported that key practices for  effective and efficient workforce planning and management include,  among other practices, training personnel to ensure that they possess the  critical skills and competencies needed for mission success. DOD policy  and guidance also recognize the importance of specialized training, calling  for the use of liaisons specifically trained for their liaison duties. For  example, DOD\u2019s 2009 Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report  stated that training is a critical element in achieving the department\u2019s  vision of an institutionalized, whole-of-government approach to addressing  national security challenges. DOD\u2019s Joint Forces Command 2007 focus  paper on interagency coordination best practices stated that DOD and  non-DOD liaisons should receive training that enhances that coordination,  such as training that would allow the liaisons to develop a more thorough  understanding of their federal partners. Further, participants at the  January 2009 interagency coordination conference stated that interagency  coordination would be improved by having combatant commands devote  additional resources to the training of exchanged liaisons, in part because  liaison personnel from other federal agencies can have difficulty in  adjusting to a military culture and working in the DOD joint environment.", "Officials from ASD/HD, NORTHCOM, and PACOM told us that exchanged  liaisons receive a variety of training through a range of forums. For  example, liaison personnel may receive informal training by attending  activities such as planning conferences, coordination working group  meetings, and training opportunities offered prior to exercises. Joint  Forces Command\u2019s focus paper on interagency coordination best  practices states that getting people together has value because it supports  the learning process. DOD also offers some more structured training that,  according to DOD and DHS officials, enhances interagency coordination  duties. For example, all staff assigned to NORTHCOM headquarters,  including non-DOD liaisons, attend a weeklong set of indoctrination  training sessions where new staff learn about the command\u2019s mission to  support civil authorities and about some of the federal agencies that have  representatives at the command. PACOM officials stated that the  command also has indoctrination in-briefs for all new personnel, including  non-DOD liaisons. However, PACOM officials acknowledged that non- DOD liaisons located off-site may be missing this training and this is an  area where the command could improve. At both locations, non-DOD  officials who represent their agencies but are not co-located at the  command told us that they did not receive the indoctrination training that  co-located liaisons received.", "NORTHCOM, through its Army component command, offers a civil  support training course that consists of three phases: an online course that  takes about 8 hours to complete, a residential course that lasts 1 week,  and ongoing training through e-mails that provide updates and reminders  about information provided in the other two phases. While the residential  course is offered to both DOD and non-DOD personnel, it has not been  widely attended by liaisons from the full range of DOD\u2019s federal partners.  Specifically, 2,902 DOD personnel and 109 non-DOD federal personnel  attended the residential training from April 2006 through June 2009. Of  the non-DOD personnel attendees, 101 came from FEMA, 5 from HHS, and  1 each from the Transportation Security Administration, Department of  Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency.

For example, its January 2009 Quadrennial Roles and  Mission Review Report concluded that lingering challenges for  interagency personnel may be partially attributable to a lack of knowledge  about other federal agencies. Tailored and specialized training for liaison  personnel to develop this knowledge is valuable and necessary, because  each federal agency has its own organizational culture, goals, priorities,  requirements, practices, and processes.

According to officials  from ASD/HD and NORTHCOM, DOD liaisons sent to other federal  agencies are not necessarily assessed on their performance specific to  their role as liaisons for interagency coordination for homeland defense  and civil support missions. For example, a DOD uniformed officer serving  as a liaison could be assessed according to the position description for an  officer of that individual\u2019s rank, but not necessarily as a liaison. Thus, the  assessment is not specifically designed to assess the officer\u2019s performance  as a liaison engaged in interagency coordination.

DOD\u2019s  assessments of its interagency coordination efforts for homeland defense  and civil support have not specifically focused on the performance of  individual liaison personnel in part because, according to DOD officials,  they lack guidance on how to include interagency coordination  competencies and achievements in the current performance management  policy.", "We also found that DOD did not consistently request input from its federal  partners on the performance of its liaisons, nor did it provide input for the  performance assessments of non-DOD liaisons working at DOD entities.

In selecting the nongeneralizable sample of non-DOD agencies,  we also considered whether the agencies were identified as a lead support  agency under the National Response Framework with whom DOD would  need to coordinate during a Stafford Act-declared event. Since Defense  Coordinating Officers and their support elements are located at each of  the 10 Federal Emergency Management Agency regions, we decided to  select a nongeneralizable sample of Defense Coordinating Officers and  their support elements to visit during our review. In selecting the specific  regions we would visit, we used criteria such as geographic location;  region size; number of requests for assistance for the region between  January 1, 2008, and May 31, 2009; types of assistance requested; and GAO  resources required. For the selection process, we identified the  combination of regions that would meet every criterion so as to get a  representative sample.

These reports identify, among others, key  principles for effective strategic workforce planning and management as  well as actions that agencies can take to enhance interagency coordination  for national security. We also reviewed DOD interagency coordination  conference proceedings and white papers, as well as joint Department of  Homeland Security-Department of Justice guidelines for interagency  coordination for homeland security, which similarly recommend the use of  such best practices. To determine the extent to which DOD has adopted  these practices, we reviewed DOD strategy, policy, doctrine, and guidance,  as well as liaison position descriptions and training materials. For  example, we reviewed DOD policy concerning its personnel management  system and the detail of DOD personnel to duty outside of the department,  as well as combatant command guidance for interagency coordination. We  also interviewed officials from a range of DOD entities and DOD\u2019s federal  partner agencies who send and/or receive interagency coordination  liaisons, or have a role in the management of such liaisons. Specifically,  DOD entities with liaison management responsibilities with whom we  interviewed included ASD/HD, the DOD\u2019s Joint Directorate of Manpower  and Personnel, DOD Administration and Management\u2019s Washington  Headquarters Services, as well as combatant command officials  responsible for interagency coordination activities at NORTHCOM and  PACOM.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 to March 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
