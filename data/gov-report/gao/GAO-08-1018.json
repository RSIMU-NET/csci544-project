As discussed in prior FFMIA reports, GAO remains concerned that the criteria for assessing substantial compliance with FFMIA are not well defined or consistently implemented across agencies. In addition, the majority of participants at a Comptroller General's forum on improving federal financial management systems said there is little agreement on the definition of \"substantial compliance.\" To address GAO's prior recommendation, OMB is in the process of revising its guidance, and GAO has reemphasized its concerns with the need for an appropriate definition of substantial compliance that focuses on financial management systems' capabilities beyond financial statement preparation. Agencies' efforts to implement new systems far too often result in systems that do not meet cost, schedule, and performance goals. Recent modernization efforts by some agencies have been hampered by not following disciplined processes. To help avoid implementation problems, OMB continues to make progress on its financial management line of business initiative, which promotes business-driven, common solutions for agencies to enhance federal financial management, but additional efforts are needed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Reliable, useful, and timely financial data are needed to efficiently and  effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the federal government  and ultimately provide accountability to taxpayers and the Congress. The  value of reliable financial information for prudent and forward-thinking  decision making cannot be overstated, especially given our nation\u2019s  current fiscal environment. As we have reported for a number of years,  the federal government faces large and growing structural deficits  primarily because of known demographic trends and rising health care  costs. These long-term challenges have profound implications for our  future economic growth, standard of living, and national security.  Significant resources will be needed to address many of these areas, and  difficult choices and trade-offs are unavoidable. It is within this scenario  that the implications of ongoing weaknesses in agencies\u2019 ability to produce  reliable and timely financial information become clear. Accurate data on  which to base crucial program and resource decisions are critical to  meeting the challenges our nation faces in the 21st century.", "To address these long-standing weaknesses, the Congress mandated  financial management systems reform within the federal government by  enacting the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996  (FFMIA). FFMIA requires the departments and agencies covered by the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 to implement and maintain  financial management systems, that comply substantially with (1) federal  financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable federal  accounting standards, and (3) the U.S. Government Standard General  Ledger (SGL) at the transaction level. FFMIA builds on the foundation laid  by the CFO Act, which has the goal of modern financial management  systems that enable the systematic measurement of performance; the  development of cost information; and the integration of program, budget,  and financial information for management reporting. FFMIA also requires  auditors to state in their audit reports whether the agencies\u2019 financial  management systems comply with the act\u2019s requirements.

We analyzed  and compiled data from these reports; conducted interviews of agency  officials, IG officials, and agency auditors; and obtained selected  documentation. To assess data reliability for the purposes of this report,  we performed procedures to assure ourselves of the independence and  qualifications of the auditors for the 24 CFO Act agencies.

This series of legislation started with the  Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), which the  Congress passed to strengthen internal controls and accounting systems  throughout the federal government, among other purposes. Issued  pursuant to FMFIA, the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government provides the standards that are  directed at helping agency managers implement effective internal control,  an integral part of improving financial management systems. Internal  control plays a major role in managing an organization and comprises the  plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions, goals, and  objectives. In summary, internal control helps government program  managers achieve desired results through effective management of public  resources.", "Effective internal control also helps in managing change to cope with  shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities. As programs  change and agencies strive to enhance operational processes and  implement new technological developments, management must  continually assess and evaluate its internal control to ensure that the  control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.  While agencies had achieved some early success in identifying and  correcting material internal control and accounting system weaknesses,  their efforts to implement FMFIA had not produced the results intended  by the Congress and sufficiently improved general and financial  management in the federal government.", "Therefore, beginning in the 1990s, the Congress passed additional  management reform legislation to achieve these management  improvements in the federal government. This legislation includes the     (1) CFO Act of 1990, (2) Government Performance and Results Act of  1993, (3) Government Management Reform Act of 1994, (4) FFMIA,      (5) Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, (6) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of  2002, (7) Improper Payments Information Act of 2002, (8) Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), and                    (9) Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act of  2004. The combination of reforms ushered in by these laws, if  successfully implemented, provides a solid foundation to improve the  accountability of government programs and operations as well as to  routinely produce valuable cost and operating performance information.

The FAM guidance on FFMIA assessments  recognizes that while financial statement audits offer some assurance on  FFMIA compliance, auditors should design and implement additional  testing to satisfy FFMIA criteria. Testing for compliance with FFMIA is  efficiently accomplished, for the most part, as part of the work done in  understanding agency systems in the internal control phase of the audit,  and the FAM provides specific guidance on what additional testing should  be performed, such as tests of information system controls and  nonsampling control tests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Continued Emphasis Needed on Federal Financial Management and FFMIA Compliance", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of financial management systems goes beyond providing the  data necessary to comply with various financial reporting requirements to  focus on routinely producing reliable, useful, and timely financial  information that federal managers can use for day-to-day decision-making  purposes. Recognizing that decision makers can benefit from a better  understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with federal  financial management systems, the Comptroller General convened a  forum on improving federal financial management systems in December  2007. According to several participants, producing accurate financial  statements should be viewed as a by-product of effective business  processes and financial management systems. We have consistently  provided this perspective for a number of years in our prior reports. As in  prior years, the auditors\u2019 fiscal year 2007 FFMIA assessments for the 24  CFO Act agencies illustrate that many agencies still do not have effective  financial management systems, including processes, procedures, and  controls in place that can produce reliable, useful, and timely financial  information with which to make informed decisions on an ongoing basis.  The primary goal of FFMIA is for agencies to improve financial  management systems so that financial information from these systems can  be used to help manage agency programs more effectively and enhance  the ability to prepare auditable financial statements. Auditors reported a  change in their FFMIA assessment for five agencies\u2019 systems that they  determined are no longer in substantial noncompliance for fiscal year  2007. The auditors noted these agencies took corrective action in the areas  of compliance with federal accounting standards and federal financial  management systems requirements.

The forum brought together knowledgeable and  recognized financial management leaders from the federal government,  including the CFO, Chief Information Officer, and IG communities, and  selected other officials with extensive experience in financial management  from both the public and private sectors. One of the themes from the  forum was that federal financial management leaders should refocus their  efforts on comprehending and meeting program managers\u2019 financial  information requirements and not simply on meeting financial reporting  compliance requirements. Despite agencies\u2019 emphasis on meeting financial  reporting compliance requirements, about two thirds of forum participants  (21 of 33 respondents) agreed that financial management systems are not  able to provide or provide little information that is reliable, useful, and  timely to assist managers in their day-to-day decision-making, which is the  ultimate goal of FFMIA. Figure 1 shows 19 of the 24 CFO Act agencies  received an unqualified opinion on their financial statements in fiscal year  2007. However, for 8 of these 19 agencies, auditors reported that systems  did not substantially comply with one or more of the three FFMIA  requirements and that significant problems exist, as discussed later.", "According to auditors, some of these 8 agencies have been able to obtain  unqualified audit opinions through extensive labor-intensive efforts, which  include using ad hoc procedures, expending significant resources, and  making billions of dollars in adjustments to derive financial statements.  This is usually the case when agencies have inadequate systems that are  not integrated and routinely reconciled. These time-consuming procedures  must be combined with sustained efforts to improve agencies\u2019 underlying  financial management systems and controls. Forum participants said that  producing accurate financial statements should be viewed as a byproduct  of effective business processes and financial management systems. We  have expressed a similar viewpoint in the past. If agencies continue year  after year to rely on costly and time-intensive manual efforts to achieve or  maintain unqualified opinions, the Congress and others may be misled as  to the true status of agencies\u2019 financial management systems capabilities.", "While work performed in auditing financial statements would naturally  offer some perspective regarding FFMIA compliance, the work necessary  to assess substantial compliance of systems with the FFMIA requirements  has a complementary but broader focus than that performed for purposes  of rendering an opinion on the financial statements. In performing  financial statement audits, auditors generally focus on the capability of the  financial management systems to process and summarize financial  information that flows into the financial statements. For purposes of  FFMIA, financial management systems include systems, processes,  procedures, and controls that produce the information management uses  day to day, not just systems that produce annual financial statements.  Thus, according to the FAM, to report on system compliance with FFMIA,  the auditor should understand the design of and test, as needed, the  financial management systems (including the financial portion of any  mixed systems) used for managing financial operations, supporting  financial planning, management reporting, budgeting activities, and  systems accumulating and reporting cost information. Several forum  participants expressed concern that because of the efforts devoted to  preparing financial reports and meeting financial reporting compliance  requirements, finance organizations have not focused sufficient attention  on understanding and meeting the financial management needs of their  own program managers. FFMIA was designed to lead to system  improvements that would result in agency managers routinely having  access to reliable, useful, and timely financial-related information to  measure performance and increase accountability throughout the year. If  significant adjustments are made at year end for financial statement  reporting purposes, then management has more than likely been operating  with inaccurate data throughout the year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFMIA Assessments Disclose Continued Noncompliance and System Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["According to auditors, the majority of federal agencies\u2019 financial  management systems are still not in substantial compliance with FFMIA  requirements. As shown in figure 2, auditors reported that 13 of the 24  CFO Act agencies\u2019 systems did not substantially comply with one or more  of the three FFMIA requirements for fiscal year 2007. This compares with  17 agencies whose systems were reported as not substantially compliant  with FFMIA requirements for fiscal year 2006. Based on our review of the  fiscal year 2007 audit reports for the 13 agencies reported to have systems  not in substantial compliance with one or more of FFMIA\u2019s three  requirements, noncompliance with federal financial management systems  requirements was the most frequently auditor-cited deficiency of the three  FFMIA requirements.", "Auditors for six CFO Act agencies reported a change in the FFMIA  assessment for fiscal year 2007. The auditor for one agency, EPA, changed  its FFMIA assessment from no instances of substantial noncompliance in  fiscal year 2006, to not being in substantial compliance with FFMIA  requirements for fiscal year 2007 because of problems related to security  over certain information systems. The auditors for five agencies reported  agencies\u2019 financial management systems were no longer in substantial  noncompliance. As discussed later, auditors for these five agencies noted  that the agencies took corrective action in the areas of federal accounting  standards and federal financial management systems requirements.  However, as we have previously reported, we are still concerned that  criteria for substantial compliance are not well defined or consistently  implemented across the 24 CFO Act agencies. In light of the significant  deficiencies and problems that auditors are still reporting, it appears that  agencies and auditors may be interpreting OMB\u2019s January 4, 2001, FFMIA  guidance to mean that if an agency has no material weaknesses, it is in  substantial compliance with the three FFMIA requirements. Further, we  caution that the number of agencies reported as noncompliant may be  even greater because all but one auditor provided negative assurance. As  we have previously reported, when auditors express negative assurance,  the auditors are not saying that they determined the systems to be  substantially compliant, but that the work performed did not identify  instances of noncompliance. Therefore, the auditors may not have  identified all instances of noncompliance with FFMIA requirements and  included all problems in their reports.", "Based on our review of the fiscal year 2007 audit reports for the 13  agencies reported to have systems not in substantial compliance with one  or more of FFMIA\u2019s three requirements, noncompliance with federal  financial management systems requirements was the deficiency auditors  most frequently cited of the three FFMIA requirements. To better  understand the underlying issues regarding agencies\u2019 noncompliance with  federal financial management systems requirements, we divided this  requirement into four problem areas including nonintegrated systems,  inadequate reconciliation procedures, lack of accurate and timely  recording, and weak security over information systems. These four  problem areas related to federal financial management systems  requirements, plus the two areas related to noncompliance with the SGL  and lack of adherence to federal accounting standards result in six  problem areas. Figure 3 shows the number of agencies with problems  reported in each of the six areas for fiscal year 2007.", "The weaknesses reported by the auditors ranged from serious, pervasive  systems problems to less serious problems that may affect only one aspect  of an agency\u2019s accounting operation. While at some agencies, the problems  were so serious that they affected the auditor\u2019s opinion on the agency\u2019s  financial statements, at other agencies, the auditors cited problems that  represented significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal  control, but were determined not to be material to the financial statements  taken as a whole.", "Table 1 illustrates the potential effect these six types of problems can have  on an agency\u2019s financial management. For example, the auditor for the  Department of the Treasury reported that IRS personnel rely on resource- intensive compensating procedures to prepare its financial statements in a  timely manner because of serious internal control and financial  management systems deficiencies. These challenges affect IRS\u2019s ability to  fulfill its responsibilities as the nation\u2019s tax collector because its managers  lack accurate, useful, and timely financial information and sound controls  with which to make fully informed decisions day-to-day and to ensure  ongoing accountability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Improvements Reported in FFMIA Compliance, Concerns Remain with FFMIA Guidance", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2007, auditors for five agencies no longer reported a lack of  substantial compliance with FFMIA requirements.

The implementation guidance  provides indicators of substantial compliance, such as whether an  agency\u2019s \u201caudit disclosed no material weaknesses in internal control that  affect the agency\u2019s ability to prepare financial statements and related  disclosures.\u201d However, this indicator only addresses the federal  accounting standards requirement of FFMIA, not the federal financial  management systems or the SGL requirement.", "We are concerned that auditors are interpreting OMB\u2019s FFMIA  implementation guidance to mean that if an agency has no material  weaknesses in controls over the area of financial reporting, it is compliant  with FFMIA. For example, the auditor for Justice told us that the reduction  of certain material weaknesses to significant deficiencies was a factor for  the change in its FFMIA assessment of substantial compliance. Based  primarily on the information contained in the agencies\u2019 performance and  accountability reports, the following summarizes how auditors determined  that five agencies were no longer substantially noncompliant in fiscal year  2007.", "Department of Energy\u2014The Department of Energy\u2019s auditor  reported one material weakness related to FFMIA noncompliance in  the area of federal accounting standards at the end of fiscal year 2006.  For 2006, the auditor reported that the department did not properly  account for obligations and undelivered orders, which affected the  accuracy, validity, and completeness of these account balances. During  fiscal year 2007, the department reported it took corrective actions  including, but not limited to, improving several reports and related  reconciliation processes. Because of these efforts, the auditor reported  that the corrective actions related to the material weakness on  obligations and undelivered orders were fully implemented and  considered the finding closed in fiscal year 2007. In fiscal year 2007,  Energy had a significant deficiency related to network vulnerabilities  and weaknesses in access and other security controls in the  department\u2019s unclassified computer information systems. The auditor  concluded that its tests disclosed no instances in which the  department\u2019s financial management systems did not substantially  comply with the three FFMIA requirements for fiscal year 2007.", "Department of the Interior\u2014At the end of fiscal year 2006, the  Department of the Interior\u2019s auditor reported FFMIA-related findings in  the area of federal accounting standards, that resulted in the  department not being in substantial compliance with FFMIA  requirements. The findings included a material weakness related to  controls over Indian Trust Funds and a reportable condition on the  improper disclosure of the condition of museum collections. According  to management, Interior implemented corrective actions during fiscal  year 2007, including closing 9,400 probate cases and deploying the  Trust Asset and Accounting Management System. As a result, the  auditor reduced the Indian Trust Fund finding to a significant  deficiency and closed the museum collection finding entirely in fiscal  year 2007. While the department invested a significant amount of  resources to improve its controls over Indian Trust Funds, the auditor  noted that Interior needs to continue its efforts to resolve historical  differences and to improve procedures and internal controls for  entering and maintaining Trust Fund information. In addition, a repeat  significant deficiency was reported by the auditor on general and  application controls over financial management systems. The auditor  stated that the previously mentioned findings were not significant  enough to warrant concluding that the department was substantially  noncompliant with FFMIA requirements for fiscal year 2007.", "Department of Justice\u2014Justice\u2019s auditor reported FFMIA-related  findings in the area of federal financial management systems  requirements that resulted in the department not being in substantial  compliance with FFMIA requirements at the end of fiscal year 2006.  One of these findings was a repeat material weakness related to the  department\u2019s financial management systems\u2019 general and application  controls. According to the auditor, during fiscal year 2007, three out of  the four components that had long-standing material weaknesses in  this area\u2014United States Marshals Service, Office of Justice Programs,  and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014made  enough improvements to internal controls over their information  system environment to reduce the finding from a material weakness to  a significant deficiency. Some of the reported corrective actions  included increasing security awareness and training, and implementing  stronger password setting policy. In its commentary and summary of  Justice\u2019s annual financial statement for fiscal year 2007, the Justice IG  made the following comment about Justice\u2019s financial system  environment: \u201cInadequate, outdated, and in some cases non-integrated  financial management systems do not provide certain automated  financial transaction processing activities that are necessary to support  management\u2019s need for timely and accurate financial information  throughout the year.\u201d", "In the IG\u2019s 2007 list of top management and performance challenges  facing Justice, the IG also reported that \u201cthe Department\u2019s efforts over  the past few years to implement the Unified Financial Management  System (UFMS) to replace the seven major accounting systems  currently used throughout the Department have been subject to fits and  starts. Three years after the Department selected a vendor for the  unified system it has made little progress in deploying the UFMS. The  Department notes that problems with funding, staff turnover, and other  competing priorities have caused the delays in implementing the  UFMS. Until that time, Department-wide accounting information will  have to continue to be produced manually, a costly process that  undermines the Department\u2019s ability to prepare financial statements  that are timely and in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. Furthermore, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and  United States Marshals Service will not be able to achieve compliance  with the FFMIA requirement to record all activity at the United States  Standard General Ledger transaction level until the UFMS has been  fully implemented.\u201d We also noted that all nine of Justice\u2019s components  still had at least one significant deficiency or material weakness related  to general and application controls, and five out of the nine  components had findings related to a second significant deficiency on  improving internal controls to ensure that transactions are properly  recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the preparation of  financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. Justice\u2019s auditor concluded that its tests disclosed no  instances in which the department\u2019s financial management systems did  not substantially comply with the three requirements of FFMIA for  fiscal year 2007.", "Department of Labor\u2014Labor\u2019s auditor reported FFMIA-related  reportable conditions in the area of federal financial management  systems requirements, which resulted in the department not being in  substantial compliance with FFMIA requirements at the end of fiscal  year 2006. These reportable conditions related to lack of strong  application controls over access to and protection of financial  information, lack of strong logical security controls to secure Labor\u2019s  networks and information, and weaknesses noted in the change control  process for a benefits system. In addition, Labor\u2019s fiscal year 2006  FISMA report identified a significant deficiency related to a mixed  system. According to management, Labor pursued an aggressive  remediation process during fiscal year 2007 by revising computer  security guidance and performing access controls testing and  evaluation for all major information systems. Labor\u2019s auditors noted  improvements in the areas of general computer controls related to a  Labor benefits system, controls over the mixed system cited in the  fiscal year 2006 FISMA report, and updated policies and procedures.", "For fiscal year 2007, auditors for Labor reported 2 prior year reportable  conditions as one significant deficiency related to the lack of adequate  controls over access to key financial and support systems. Specifically,  the auditor noted issues that were present in multiple financial systems  across the department such as inactive accounts were not disabled or  deleted in a timely manner; generic accounts existed on systems; and  access to sensitive files, directories, or software was not restricted.  According to the auditor, each access control issue mentioned  presented a reasonably possible chance to adversely affect Labor\u2019s  ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, or report financial data.  The auditor also reported that these access control weaknesses could  lead to users with inappropriate access to financial systems; inefficient  processes, lack of completeness, accuracy, or integrity of financial  data; and/or the lack of detection of unusual activity within financial  systems.", "As a result of the access control weaknesses identified, the IG reported  an access control significant deficiency in conjunction with its testing  of compliance with FISMA for fiscal year 2007. However, the IG\u2019s fiscal  year 2007 FISMA report did not communicate significant deficiencies  for specific systems; instead, it reported significant deficiencies by  control type, grouping all impacted systems together in each  deficiency. Labor\u2019s auditors stated, as a result, they could not  determine the severity of deficiencies for any individual financial or  mixed system. Labor\u2019s auditor concluded that the department  complied, in all material respects, with the requirements of FFMIA as  of September 30, 2007.", "Small Business Administration (SBA)\u2014At the end of fiscal year  2006, auditors reported that SBA was not substantially compliant with  FFMIA requirements in the area of federal financial management  systems requirements. The related finding involving weak information  technology security controls was characterized as a reportable  condition. During fiscal year 2007, the auditor noted improvements in  formalizing policies and procedures over granting users emergency  access, documenting reviews of remote users, and formalizing  continuity of operations plans. Despite the identified improvements,  the auditors continued to report issues in the areas of security access  controls, software program changes, and end-user computing and  reported the condition as a significant deficiency. For fiscal year 2007,  the auditor reported no instances in which the department\u2019s financial  management systems did not substantially comply with the three  requirements of FFMIA.", "We have previously reported that auditors have expressed a need for  clarification on the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with FFMIA.  Further, when asked to what extent agreement exists on the definition of  substantial compliance with FFMIA, 20 of 35 participants at the December  2007 Comptroller General forum stated that agreement exists to little or no  extent while the other 15 of 35 believed agreement exists to a moderate  extent. We initially recommended that OMB clarify its guidance on the  meaning of substantial compliance in our report covering FFMIA fiscal  year 2000 results and have reiterated this recommendation thereafter with  OMB action starting this year. In prior years, OMB has responded that it  has been focusing on various initiatives, and it agreed to consider  clarifying the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in future policy and  guidance updates. Last year OMB stated that in its update to Circular No.  A-127, Financial Management Systems, its goal would be to simplify  FFMIA compliance requirements as well as to better balance the FFMIA  objectives of generating audited financial statements and providing  meaningful information for decision makers. Accordingly, OMB agreed to  take this recommendation under advisement and is currently revising its  guidance. As we have previously reported, without a consistent  agreement and application of a common definition of substantial  compliance, the status of agency financial management systems\u2019  compliance remains uncertain.", "Although OMB\u2019s January 4, 2001, FFMIA implementation guidance  includes examples of compliance indicators, we found in the past that  several agency auditors used the indicators as a checklist for determining  an agency\u2019s systems compliance. In our view, a checklist approach is  inappropriate for assessing the substantial compliance of agency systems,  including processes, procedures, and controls with FFMIA. This approach  also does not meet the expectations of the Congress in requiring the  auditor to insist on rigorous adherence to the accounting standards in  reporting whether the agency\u2019s financial management systems  substantially comply with the three requirements of FFMIA. Congress also  expected that the audit community would discharge this compliance  function consistent with established practices of the profession and the  exercise of sound professional judgment. A comprehensive approach that  considers key systems\u2019 functionalities, such as tests of information system  controls and nonsampling control tests, is essential for auditors to obtain  assurance that the agencies\u2019 systems provide reliable, useful, and timely  information for decision makers on an ongoing basis throughout the year  and not just for preparing year-end financial statements.", "OMB\u2019s guidance lays out the key factors that auditors should consider  when assessing whether an agency\u2019s systems are substantially compliant.  OMB\u2019s guidance calls for auditors to use their professional judgment when  considering factors such as providing reliable and timely information for  managing current operations; accounting for assets so they can be  properly protected from loss, misappropriation, or destruction; and  whether a system\u2019s performance prevents an agency from meeting specific  FFMIA requirements. Nonetheless, because auditors have focused their  consideration of FFMIA substantial compliance on issues related to the  financial statement audit, it is important that the meaning of substantial  compliance be clarified and refocused to include other aspects in addition  to financial statement audit results. While we agree that the use of  professional judgment is critical, we continue to believe that a consensus  is needed on what constitutes substantial compliance.", "In regard to our previous recommendation that OMB explore further  clarification of the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance,\u201d OMB is in the  process of revising OMB Circular No. A-127 and its FFMIA implementation  guidance. In May 2008, OMB issued a draft Circular No. A-127 for CFO  Council review and comment. In our comments on the draft Circular No.  A-127, we reemphasized our concerns with, among other things, the need  for an appropriate definition of substantial compliance that focuses on  financial management systems\u2019 capabilities beyond financial statement  preparation.

While  the development of a financial management system can never be risk free,  effective implementation of best practices in systems development and  implementation efforts (commonly referred to as disciplined processes)  can reduce those risks to acceptable levels. Nevertheless, agency efforts  far too often result in systems that do not meet their cost, schedule, and  performance goals. While agencies anticipate that the new systems will  provide reliable, useful, and timely data to support managerial decision  making, our work and that of others has shown that has often not been the  case. For example, modernization efforts at DOD, HHS, and DHS have  been hampered by agencies not following disciplined processes.", "As we reported in July 2007, the Army\u2019s approach for investing about  $5 billion over the next several years in its General Fund Enterprise  Business System, Global Combat Support System-Army Field/Tactical,  and Logistics Modernization Program did not include alignment with  the Army enterprise architecture or use of a portfolio-based business  system investment review process. Moreover, we reported that the  Army\u2019s lack of a concept of operations has contributed to its failure to  take full advantage of business process reengineering opportunities  that are available when using an enterprise resource planning solution.  Further, the Army did not have reliable processes\u2014such as an  independent verification and validation function, or analyses, such as  economic analyses\u2014to support its management of these programs. We  concluded that until the Army adopts a business system investment  management approach that provides for reviewing groups of systems  and making enterprise decisions on how these groups will collectively  interoperate to provide a desired capability, it runs the risk of investing  significant resources in business systems that do not provide the  desired functionality and efficiency.", "As we previously reported in September 2004, HHS did not follow key  disciplined processes necessary to reduce the risks associated with  implementing the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) to  acceptable levels. We identified problems in such key areas as  requirements management, including developing a concept of  operations, data conversion, and risk management. Three years later, in  fiscal year 2007, HHS\u2019s auditors reported that serious financial system  issues continue as a result of conversion problems. For example, over  800 entries, exceeding $170 billion, had to be manually recorded into  the UFMS system; more than $1 billion in transactions were  inappropriately posted; and a cumbersome, manual process is used to  compile its financial statements. Sustained efforts will be necessary to  overcome these continuing serious weaknesses.", "In June 2007, we reported that DHS lacked a financial management  strategy that included a formal strategic financial management plan to  implement or migrate to an integrated system. In addition, DHS\u2019s  concept of operations did not contain an adequate description of the  legacy systems and a clear articulation of the vision that should guide  the department\u2019s improvement efforts, and key requirements developed  for the project were unclear and incomplete. Since then, DHS has  developed a strategy to consolidate the department\u2019s financial systems  down to two platforms\u2014SAP and Oracle. However, according to a  recent DHS IG report, DHS did not perform a complete analysis of all  potential systems and service providers as part of its process to select a  financial systems solution. As a result of a bid protest, in a March 17,  2008, ruling, the United States Court of Federal Claims held that DHS\u2019s  sole source procurement for financial systems application software had  violated a provision in the Competition in Contracting Act requiring full  and open competition using competitive procedures and required DHS  to conduct a competitive procurement.

In a  January 2008 memo summarizing FMLOB efforts and priorities, OMB  recognized the risk associated with implementing business processes  that are not standardized across government as well as the need to  develop additional guidance and other tools. Specifically, the memo  states that once business standards have been completed, incorporated  into core financial system requirements, and tested during the FSIO  software qualification and certification process, shared service  providers will only be permitted to utilize the certified products as  configured. To date, two standard business processes have been  issued, and OMB expects three additional standard business processes  to be finalized in December 2008. Recognizing the need to further  develop FMLOB guidance and tools, OMB identified priorities for the  remainder of 2008 and 2009, which include identifying and developing  additional business standards (e.g., interface data elements), expanding  migration planning guidance, finalizing and developing cost and  performance measurements related to FMLOB business standards,  incorporating these standards into core financial systems requirements  and software, and updating related testing methodology and scenarios.", "Establishing a clear migration path. To ensure that agencies  migrate to a shared service provider in accordance with OMB\u2019s stated  approach rather than attempt to develop and implement their own  stove-piped business systems, we previously recommended that OMB  establish a clear migration path or timetable for future migrations.  OMB estimates for when migrations will be completed are evolving and  no firm timeframes have been set. OMB\u2019s general guidance is that  agencies should migrate to a shared service provider when it is cost  effective to do so and they have maximized the return on investment in  the current system. Although OMB previously established a goal of  migrating the majority of agencies toward the use of shared service  providers by 2011, more recent information indicates that agency  migrations will take longer than OMB expected. For example,  participants attending the forum appeared uncertain regarding the  ability of their respective organizations to reach this goal by 2011.  OMB\u2019s more recent estimate indicates that many migrations are  scheduled through fiscal year 2015 and that some agency migrations  have not yet been scheduled. Agency migrations to a shared service  provider are an important aspect to achieving FMLOB goals. Even  without a clear migration path, some agencies may readily migrate to a  shared service provider to minimize the tremendous undertaking of  implementing or significantly upgrading a financial system. However,  other agencies may continue efforts to implement stand-alone systems  that place additional resources at risk because of potential financial  system implementation failures.", "Further, other concerns that exist within the federal financial management  community include the availability of sufficient resources, the viability of  the initiative on a governmentwide basis, and the potential loss of control  of critical financial functions. For example, none of the forum participants  believed the resources available to implement the initiative are fully  adequate. Some participants also indicated that some financial leaders  may be reluctant to transition their agencies\u2019 financial management  activities on a wholesale basis because of their fear of losing control of  critical functions and lack of trust in a shared service providers\u2019 ability to  effectively meet their needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Shifting financial management leaders\u2019 focus from meeting financial  reporting compliance requirements to comprehending and meeting  program managers\u2019 financial information requirements is key to more  meaningful, value-added financial management.

If properly developed,  implemented, and managed, financial management systems can provide  essential financial data in support of day-to-day managerial decision  making\u2014the ultimate goal of FFMIA. To accomplish this goal, CFO Act  agencies must continue to strive toward routinely producing not only  annual financial statements that can pass the scrutiny of a financial audit,  but also other meaningful financial and performance data.
