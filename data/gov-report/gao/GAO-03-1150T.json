In addition, TSA has initiated several programs and research and  development efforts that focus on the use of technology and information  to advance security. For example, the agency is developing the  Transportation Workers Identification Card program to provide a  nationwide standard credential for airport workers that is issued after a  background check has been completed and biometric indicators have been  incorporated so that each worker can be positively matched to his or her  credential. TSA is also developing the next-generation Computer Assisted  Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II), which would use national  security and commercial databases to assess the risk posed by passengers  and identify some passengers for additional screening before they board  their flights. These uses of technology and information\u2014particularly  CAPPS II\u2014have raised some concerns about privacy rights that will need  to be addressed as these programs move toward implementation.", "Although TSA has focused much effort and funding on ensuring that  bombs and other threat items are not carried onto planes by passengers or  in their luggage, vulnerabilities remain in areas such as air cargo security,  general aviation security, and airport perimeter security. For example, air  cargo is vulnerable because very little of the estimated 12.5 million tons  transported each year on all-cargo and passenger planes is physically  screened for explosives. As a result, a potential security risk is the  introduction of explosive and incendiary devices in cargo placed aboard  aircraft. We have recommended in prior work that TSA use a risk  management approach to prioritize actions and funding as it works with  industry to determine the next steps in strengthening air cargo security,  and industry stakeholders have suggested the application of such an  approach to general aviation security.", "TSA faces longer-term management and organizational challenges to  sustaining enhanced aviation security that include (1) developing and  implementing a comprehensive risk management approach, (2) paying for  increased aviation security needs and controlling costs, (3) establishing  effective coordination among the many public and private entities involved  in aviation security, (4) strategically managing its workforce and ensuring  appropriate staffing levels, and (5) building a results-oriented culture as it  shifts its aviation security and other functions to the Department of  Homeland Security.

These included weaknesses in screening passengers and baggage,  controlling access to secure areas at airports, and protecting air traffic  control computer systems and facilities. To address these and other  weaknesses, ATSA created the Transportation Security Administration  and established security requirements for the new agency with mandated  deadlines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Civil Aviation Was Vulnerable before September 11, 2001", "paragraphs": ["Before September 2001, screeners, who were then hired by the airlines,  often failed to detect threat objects located on passengers or in their carry- on luggage. Principal causes of screeners\u2019 performance problems were  rapid turnover and insufficient training. As we previously reported,  turnover rates exceeded 100 percent a year at most large airports, leaving  few skilled and experienced screeners, primarily because of low wages,  limited benefits, and repetitive, monotonous work.", "In addition, before September 2001, controls for limiting access to secure  areas of airports, including aircraft, did not always work as intended. As  we reported in May 2000, our special agents used fictitious law  enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas, bypass  security checkpoints at two airports, and walk unescorted to aircraft  departure gates. The agents, who had been issued tickets and boarding  passes, could have carried weapons, explosives, or other dangerous  objects onto aircraft. DOT\u2019s Inspector General also documented numerous  problems with airport access controls, and in one series of tests, nearly 7  out of every 10 attempts by the Inspector General\u2019s staff to gain access to  secure areas were successful. Upon entering the secure areas, the  Inspector General\u2019s staff boarded aircraft 117 times. The Inspector General  further reported that the majority of the aircraft boardings would not have  occurred if employees had taken the prescribed steps, such as making sure  doors closed behind them.", "Our reviews also found that the security of the air traffic control computer  systems and of the facilities that house them had not been ensured. The  vulnerabilities we identified, such as not ensuring that contractors who  had access to the air traffic control computer systems had undergone  background checks, made the air traffic control system susceptible to  intrusion and malicious attacks. The air traffic control computer systems  provide information to air traffic controllers and aircraft flight crews to  help ensure the safe and expeditious movement of aircraft. Failure to  protect these systems and their facilities could cause a nationwide  disruption of air traffic or even collisions and loss of life.", "Over the years, we made numerous recommendations to the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA), which, until ATSA\u2019s enactment, was  responsible for aviation security. These recommendations were designed  to improve screeners\u2019 performance, strengthen airport access controls,  and better protect air traffic control computer systems and facilities. As of  September 2001, FAA had implemented some of these recommendations  and was addressing others, but its progress was often slow.

The act also shifted security-screening  responsibilities from the airlines to TSA and established a series of  requirements to strengthen aviation security, many of them with mandated  implementation deadlines. For example, the act required the deployment  of federal screeners at 429 commercial airports across the nation by  November 19, 2002, and the use of explosives detection technology at  these airports to screen every piece of checked baggage for explosives not  later than December 31, 2002. However, the Homeland Security Act  subsequently allowed TSA to grant waivers of up to 1 year to airports that  would not be able to meet the December deadline.", "Some aviation security responsibilities remained with FAA. For example,  FAA is responsible for the security of its air traffic control and other  computer systems and of its air traffic control facilities.

In  January 2002, TSA had 13 employees\u20141 year later, the agency had about  65,000 employees. TSA reported that it met over 30 deadlines during 2002  to improve aviation security. (See app. I for the status of mandates in  ATSA.) For example, according to TSA, it    met the November 2002 deadline to deploy federal passenger screeners at  airports across the nation by hiring, training, and deploying over 40,000  individuals to screen passengers at 429 commercial airports (see fig. 2);   hired and deployed more than 20,000 individuals to screen all checked    has been using explosives detection systems or explosives trace detection  equipment to screen about 90 percent of all checked baggage as of  December 31, 2002;   has been using alternative means such as canine teams, hand searches,  and passenger-bag matching to screen the remaining checked baggage; confiscated more than 4.8 million prohibited items (including firearms,  knives, and incendiary or flammable objects) from passengers; and   has made substantial progress in expanding the Federal Air Marshal  Service.", "In addition, according to FAA, U.S. and foreign airlines met the April 2003  deadline to harden cockpit doors on aircraft flying in the United States.", "Not unexpectedly, TSA experienced some difficulties in meeting these  deadlines and achieving these goals. For example, operational and  management control problems, cited later in this testimony, emerged with  the rapid expansion of the Federal Air Marshal Service, and TSA\u2019s  deployment of some explosives detection systems was delayed. As a  result, TSA had to grant waivers of up to a year (until Dec. 31, 2003) to a  few airports, authorizing them to use alternative means to screen all  checked baggage. Recently, airport representatives with whom we spoke  expressed concern that not all of these airports would meet the new  December 2003 deadline established in their waivers because, according  to the airport representatives, there has not been enough time to produce,  install, and integrate all of the systems required to meet the deadline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Is Making Greater Use of Technology and Information to Enhance Aviation Security", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen control over access to secure areas of airports and other  transportation facilities, TSA is pursuing initiatives that make greater use  of technology and information. For example, the agency is investigating  the establishment of a Transportation Workers Identification Card (TWIC)  program. TWIC is intended to establish a uniform, nationwide standard for  the secure identification of 12 million workers who require unescorted  physical or cyber access to secure areas at airports and other  transportation facilities. Specifically, TWIC will combine standard  background checks and biometrics so that a worker can be positively  matched to his or her credential. Once the program is fully operational, the  TWIC card will be the standard credential for airport workers and will be  accepted by all modes of transportation. According to TSA, developing a  uniform, nationwide standard for identification will minimize redundant  credentialing and background checks. Currently, each airport is required,  as part of its security program, to issue credentials to workers who need  access to secure, nonpublic areas, such as baggage loading areas. Airport  representatives have told us that they think a number of operational issues  need to be resolved for the TWIC card to be feasible. For example, the  TWIC card would have to be compatible with the many types of card  readers used at airports around the country, or new card readers would  have to be installed. At large airports, this could entail replacing hundreds  of card readers, and airport representatives have expressed concerns  about how this effort would be funded. In April 2003, TSA awarded a  contract to test and evaluate various technologies at three pilot sites.", "In addition, TSA has continued to develop the next-generation Computer  Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II)\u2014an automated  passenger screening system that takes personal information, such as a  passenger\u2019s name, date of birth, home address, and home telephone  number, to confirm the passenger\u2019s identity and assess a risk level. The  identifying information will be run against national security information  and commercial databases, and a \u201crisk\u201d score will be assigned to the  passenger. The risk score will determine any further screening that the  passenger will undergo before boarding. TSA expects to implement  CAPPS II throughout the United States by the fall of 2004. However, TSA\u2019s  plans have raised concerns about travelers\u2019 privacy rights. It has been  suggested, for example, that TSA is violating privacy laws by not  explaining how the risk assessment data will be scored and used and how  a TSA decision can be appealed. These concerns about the system will  need to be addressed as it moves toward implementation. In ongoing  work, we are examining CAPPS II, including how it will function, what  safeguards will be put in place to protect the traveling public\u2019s privacy,  and how the system will affect the traveling public in terms of costs,  delays, and risks.", "Additionally, TSA has begun to develop initiatives that could enable it to  use its passenger screening resources more efficiently. For example, TSA  has requested funding for fiscal year 2004 to begin developing a registered  traveler program that would prescreen low-risk travelers. Under a  registered traveler program, those who voluntarily apply to participate in  the program and successfully pass background checks would receive a  unique identifier or card that would enable them to be screened more  quickly and would promote greater focus on those passengers who require  more extensive screening at airport security checkpoints. In prior work,  we identified key policy and implementation issues that would need to be  resolved before a registered traveler program could be implemented. Such  issues include the (1) criteria that should be established to determine  eligibility to apply for the program, (2) kinds of background checks that  should be used to certify applicants\u2019 eligibility to enroll in the program and  the entity who should perform these checks, (3) security-screening  procedures that registered travelers should undergo and the differences  between these procedures and those for unregistered travelers, and (4)  concerns that the traveling public or others may have about equity,  privacy, and liability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Is Strengthening Air Traffic Control Security", "paragraphs": ["Since September 2001, FAA has continued to strengthen the security of the  nation\u2019s air traffic control computer systems and facilities in response to  39 recommendations we made between May 1998 and December 2000.

This office has also managed  FAA\u2019s incident response center and implemented a certification and  accreditation process to ensure that vulnerabilities in current and future  air traffic control systems are identified and weaknesses addressed.  Nevertheless, the office faces continued challenges in increasing its  intrusion detection capabilities, obtaining accreditation for systems that  are already operational, and managing information systems security  throughout the agency. In addition, according to senior security officials,  FAA has completed assessments of the physical security of its staffed  facilities, but it has not yet accredited all of these air traffic control  facilities as secure in compliance with its own policy. Finally, FAA has  worked aggressively over the past 2 years to complete background  investigations of numerous contractor employees.

For information on legislative proposals that would address these  potential vulnerabilities and other aviation security issues, see appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Air Cargo Security", "paragraphs": ["As we and DOT\u2019s Inspector General have reported, vulnerabilities exist in  securing the cargo carried aboard commercial passenger and all-cargo  aircraft. TSA has reported that an estimated 12.5 million tons of cargo are  transported each year\u20149.7 million tons on all-cargo planes and 2.8 million  tons on passenger planes. Some potential security risks associated with air  cargo include the introduction of undetected explosive and incendiary  devices in cargo placed aboard aircraft; the shipment of undeclared or  undetected hazardous materials aboard aircraft; and aircraft hijackings  and sabotage by individuals with access to cargo aircraft. To address  some of the risks associated with air cargo, ATSA requires that all cargo  carried aboard commercial passenger aircraft be screened and that TSA  have a system in place as soon as practicable to screen, inspect, or  otherwise ensure the security of cargo on all-cargo aircraft. In August  2003, the Congressional Research Service reported that less than 5 percent  of cargo placed on passenger airplanes is physically screened. TSA\u2019s  primary approach to ensuring air cargo security and safety and to  complying with the cargo-screening requirement in the act is the \u201cknown  shipper\u201d program\u2014which allows shippers that have established business  histories with air carriers or freight forwarders to ship cargo on planes.  However, we and DOT\u2019s Inspector General have identified weaknesses in  the known shipper program and in TSA\u2019s procedures for approving freight  forwarders.", "Since September 2001, TSA has taken a number of actions to enhance  cargo security, such as implementing a database of known shippers in  October 2002. The database is the first phase in developing a cargo- profiling system similar to the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening  System. However, in December 2002, we reported that additional  operational and technological measures, such as checking the identity of  individuals making cargo deliveries, have the potential to improve air  cargo security in the near term. We further reported that TSA lacks a  comprehensive plan with long-term goals and performance targets for  cargo security, time frames for completing security improvements, and  risk-based criteria for prioritizing actions to achieve those goals.  Accordingly, we recommended that TSA develop a comprehensive plan for  air cargo security that incorporates a risk management approach, includes  a list of security priorities, and sets deadlines for completing actions. TSA  agreed with this recommendation and expects to develop such a plan by  the fall of 2003. It will be important that this plan include a timetable for  implementation and that TSA expeditiously reduce the vulnerabilities in  this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Aviation Security", "paragraphs": ["Since September 2001, TSA has taken limited action to improve general  aviation security, leaving it far more open and potentially vulnerable than  commercial aviation. General aviation is vulnerable because general  aviation pilots are not screened before takeoff and the contents of general  aviation planes are not screened at any point. General aviation includes  more than 200,000 privately owned airplanes, which are located in every  state at more than 19,000 airports. Over 550 of these airports also provide  commercial service. In the last 5 years, about 70 aircraft have been stolen  from general aviation airports, indicating a potential weakness that could  be exploited by terrorists. Moreover, it was reported that the September 11  hijackers researched the use of crop dusters to spread biological or  chemical agents. General aviation\u2019s vulnerability was revealed in January  2002, when a Florida teenage flight student crashed a single-engine Cessna  airplane into a Tampa skyscraper.", "FAA has since issued a notice with voluntary guidance for flight schools  and businesses that provide services for aircraft and pilots at general  aviation airports. The suggestions include using different keys to gain  access to an aircraft and start the ignition, not giving students access to  aircraft keys, ensuring positive identification of flight students, and  training employees and pilots to report suspicious activities. However,  because the guidance is voluntary, it is unknown how many general  aviation airports have implemented these measures.", "We reported in June 2003 that TSA was working with industry  stakeholders as part of TSA\u2019s Aviation Security Advisory Council to close  potential security gaps in general aviation. According to our recent  discussions with industry representatives, however, the stakeholders have  not been able to reach a consensus on the actions needed to improve  security in general aviation. General aviation industry representatives,  such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and General Aviation  Manufacturers Association, have opposed any restrictions on operating  general aviation aircraft and believe that small planes do not pose a  significant risk to the country. Nonetheless, some industry representatives  indicated that the application of a risk management approach would be  helpful in determining the next steps in improving general aviation  security. (We discuss risk management in more detail later in this  testimony.) To identify these next steps, TSA chartered a working group  on general aviation within the existing Aviation Security Advisory  Committee, and this working group is scheduled to report to the full  committee in the fall of 2003.

In addition,  terrorists could launch an attack using a shoulder-fired missile from the  perimeter of an airport, as well as from locations just outside the  perimeter. For example, in separate incidents in the late 1970s, guerrillas  with shoulder-fired missiles shot down two Air Rhodesia planes.

A number of technologies could be used to secure  and monitor airport perimeters, including barriers, motion sensors, and  closed-circuit television. Airport representatives have cautioned that as  security enhancements are made to airport perimeters, it will be important  for TSA to coordinate with FAA and the airport operators to ensure that  any enhancements do not pose safety risks for aircraft.

Although TSA  initially focused on increasing aviation security, it has more recently begun  to address security in the other transportation modes. However, the size  and diversity of the national transportation system make it difficult to  adequately secure, and TSA and the Congress are faced with demands for  additional federal funding for transportation security that far exceed the  additional amounts made available. We have advocated the use of a risk  management approach to guide federal programs and responses to better  prepare for and withstand terrorist threats, and we have recommended  that TSA use this approach to strengthen security in aviation as well as in  other transportation modes. A risk management approach is a systematic  process to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and the criticality (or relative  importance) of assets to better support key decisions linking resources  with prioritized efforts for results. Comprehensive risk-based assessments  support effective planning and resource allocation. Figure 5 describes this  approach.", "TSA agreed with our recommendation and has adopted a risk management  approach in attempting to enhance security across all transportation  modes. TSA\u2019s Office of Threat Assessment and Risk Management is  developing two assessment tools that will help assess criticality, threats,  and vulnerabilities. The first tool, which assesses criticality, will arrive at a  criticality score for a facility or transportation asset by incorporating  factors such as the number of fatalities that could occur during an attack  and the economic and sociopolitical importance of the facility or asset.  This score will enable TSA, in conjunction with transportation  stakeholders, to rank facilities and assets within each mode and thus focus  resources on those that are deemed most important. TSA is working with  another Department of Homeland Security office\u2014the Information  Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate\u2014to ensure that the  criticality tool will be consistent with the Department\u2019s overall approach  for managing critical infrastructure.", "The second tool\u2014the Transportation Risk Assessment and Vulnerability  Evaluation tool (TRAVEL)\u2014will assess threats and analyze vulnerabilities  for all transportation modes. The tool produces a relative risk score for  potential attacks against a transportation asset or facility. In addition,  TRAVEL will include a cost-benefit component that compares the cost of  implementing a given countermeasure with the reduction in relative risk  due to that countermeasure. We reported in June 2003 that TSA plans to  use this tool to gather comparable threat and vulnerability information  across all transportation modes. It is important for TSA to complete the  development of the two tools and use them to prepare action plans for  specific modes, such as aviation, and for transportation security generally."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding", "paragraphs": ["Two key funding and accountability challenges will be (1) paying for  increased aviation security and (2) ensuring that these costs are  controlled. The costs associated with the equipment and personnel needed  to screen passengers and their baggage alone are huge. The administration  requested $4.2 billion for aviation security for fiscal year 2004, which  included about $1.8 billion for passenger screening and $944 million for  baggage screening. ATSA created a passenger security fee to pay for the  costs of aviation security, but the fee has not generated enough money to  do so. DOT\u2019s Inspector General reported that the security fees are  estimated to generate only about $1.7 billion in fiscal year 2004.", "A major funding issue is paying for the purchase and installation of the  remaining explosives detection systems for the airports that received  waivers, as well as for the reinstallation of the systems that were placed in  airport lobbies last year and now need to be integrated into airport  baggage-handling systems. Integrating the equipment with the baggage- handling systems is expected to be costly because it will require major  facility modifications. For example, modifications needed to integrate the  equipment at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport are estimated to cost  $146 million. Estimates for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport are  $193 million. DOT\u2019s Inspector General has reported that the cost of  integrating the equipment nationwide could be as high as $3 billion.", "A key question is how to pay for these installation costs. Funds from FAA\u2019s  AIP grants and passenger facility charges are eligible sources for funding  this work. In fiscal year 2002, AIP grant funds totaling $561 million were  used for terminal modifications to enhance security. However, using these  funds for security reduced the funding available for other airport  development projects, such as projects to bring airports up to federal  design standards and reconstruction projects. In February 2003, we  identified letters of intent as a funding option that has been successfully  used to leverage private sources of funding. TSA has since signed letters  of intent with three airports\u2014Boston Logan, Dallas-Fort Worth, and  Seattle-Tacoma International Airports. Under the agreements, TSA will pay  75 percent of the cost of integrating the explosives detection equipment  into the baggage-handling systems. The payments will stretch out over 3 to  4 years. Airport representatives said that about 30 more airports have  requested similar agreements. The slow pace of TSA\u2019s approval process  has raised concerns about delays in reinstalling and integrating explosives  detection equipment with baggage-handling systems\u2014delays that will  require more labor-intensive and less efficient baggage screening by other  approved means.", "To provide financial assistance to airports for security-related capital  investments, such as the installation of explosives detection equipment,  proposed aviation reauthorization legislation would establish an aviation  security capital fund that would authorize $2 billion over the next 4 years.  The funding would be made available to airports in letters of intent, and  large- and medium-hub airports would be expected to provide a match of  10 percent of a project\u2019s costs. A 5 percent match would be required for all  other airports. This legislation would provide a dedicated source of  funding for security-related capital investments and could minimize the  need to use AIP funds for security.", "An additional funding issue is how to ensure continued investment in  transportation research and development. For fiscal year 2003, TSA was  appropriated about $110 million for research and development, of which  $75 million was designated for the next-generation explosives detection  systems. However, TSA has proposed to reprogram $61.2 million of these  funds to be used for other purposes, leaving about $12.7 million to be  spent on research and development this year. This proposed  reprogramming could limit TSA\u2019s ability to sustain and strengthen aviation  security by continuing to invest in research and development for more  effective equipment to screen passengers, their carry-on and checked  baggage, and cargo. In ongoing work, we are examining the nature and  scope of research and development work by TSA and the Department of  Homeland Security, including their strategy for accelerating the  development of transportation security technologies.", "By reprogramming funds and making acknowledged use of certain funds  for purposes other than those intended, TSA has raised congressional  concerns about accountability. According to TSA, it has proposed to  reprogram a total of $849.3 million during fiscal year 2003, including the  $61.2 million that would be cut from research and development and $104  million that would be taken from the federal air marshal program and used  for unintended purposes. Because of these congressional concerns, we  were asked to investigate TSA\u2019s process for reprogramming funds for the  air marshal program and to assess the implications of the proposed  funding reductions in areas such as the numbers of hours flown and flights  taken. We have ongoing work to address these issues. To ensure  appropriate oversight and accountability, it is important that TSA maintain  clear and transparent communication with the Congress and industry  stakeholders about the use of its funds.", "In July 2002, we reported that long-term attention to cost and  accountability controls for acquisition and related business processes will  be critical for TSA, both to ensure its success and to maintain its integrity  and accountability. According to DOT\u2019s Inspector General, although TSA  has made progress in addressing certain cost-related issues, it has not  established an infrastructure that provides effective controls to monitor  contractors\u2019 costs and performance. For example, in February 2003, the  Inspector General reported that TSA\u2019s $1 billion hiring effort cost more  than most people expected and that TSA\u2019s contract with NCS Pearson to  recruit, assess, and hire the screener workforce contained no safeguards  to prevent cost increases. The Inspector General found that TSA provided  limited oversight for the management of the contract expenses and, in one  case, between $6 million and $9 million of the $18 million paid to a  subcontractor appeared to be a result of wasteful and abusive spending  practices. As the Inspector General recommended, TSA has since hired  the Defense Contract Audit Agency to audit its major contracts. To ensure  control over TSA contracts, the Inspector General has further  recommended that the Congress set aside a specific amount of TSA\u2019s  contracting budget for overseeing contractors\u2019 performance with respect  to cost, schedule, and quality."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Sustaining the aviation security advancements of the past 2 years also  depends on TSA\u2019s ability to form effective partnerships with federal, state,  and local agencies and with the aviation community. Effective, well- coordinated partnerships at the local level require identifying roles and  responsibilities; developing effective, collaborative relationships with local  and regional airports and emergency management and law enforcement  agencies; agreeing on performance-based standards that describe desired  outcomes; and sharing intelligence information. The lynchpin in TSA\u2019s  efforts to coordinate with airports and local law enforcement and  emergency response agencies is, according to the agency, the 158 federal  security directors and staff that TSA has deployed nationwide. The  security directors\u2019 responsibilities include ensuring that standardized  security procedures are implemented at the nation\u2019s airports; working  with state and local law enforcement personnel, when appropriate, to  ensure airport and passenger security; and communicating threat  information to airport operators and others. Airport representatives,  however, have indicated that the relationships between federal security  directors and airport operators are still evolving and that better  communication is needed at some airports.", "Key to improving the coordination between TSA and local partners is  establishing clearly defined roles. In some cases, concerns have arisen  about conflicts between the roles of TSA, as the manager of security  functions at airports, and of airport officials, as the managers of other  airport operations. Industry representatives viewed such conflicts as  leading to confusion in areas such as communicating with local entities.  According to airport representatives, for example, TSA has developed  guidance or rules for airports without involving them, and time-consuming  changes have then had to be made to accommodate operational factors.  The representatives maintain that it would be more efficient and effective  to consider such operational factors earlier in the process. Ultimately,  inadequate coordination and unclear roles result in inefficient uses of  limited resources.", "TSA also has to ensure that the terrorist and threat information gathered  and maintained by law enforcement and other agencies\u2014including the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization  Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Department of State\u2014is  quickly and efficiently communicated among federal agencies and to state  and local authorities, as needed. Disseminating such information is  important to allow those who are involved in protecting the nation\u2019s  aviation system to address potential threats rather than simply react to  known threats.", "In aviation security, timely information sharing among agencies has been  hampered by the agencies\u2019 reluctance to share sensitive information and  by outdated, incompatible computer systems. As we found in reviewing 12  watch lists maintained by nine federal agencies, information was being  shared among some of them but not among others. Moreover, even when  sharing was occurring, costly and overly complex measures had to be  taken to facilitate it. To promote better integration and sharing of  terrorist and criminal watch lists, we have recommended that the  Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the other  departments and agencies that have and use watch lists, lead an effort to  consolidate and standardize the federal government\u2019s watch list structures  and policies.", "In addition, as we found earlier this year, representatives of numerous  state and local governments and transportation industry associations  indicated that the general threat warnings received by government  agencies are not helpful. Rather, they said, transportation operators,  including airport operators, want more specific intelligence information so  that they can understand the true nature of a potential threat and  implement appropriate security measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Human Capital Management", "paragraphs": ["As it organizes itself to protect the nation\u2019s transportation system, TSA  faces the challenge of strategically managing its workforce of more than  60,000 people, most of whom are deployed at airports or on aircraft to  detect weapons and explosives and to prevent them from being taken  aboard and used on aircraft. Additionally, over the next several years, TSA  faces the challenge of \u201cright-sizing\u201d this workforce as efficiency is  improved with new security-enhancing technologies, processes, and  procedures. For example, as explosives detection systems are integrated  with baggage-handling systems, the use of more labor-intensive screening  methods, such as trace detection techniques and manual searches of  baggage, can be reduced. Other planned security enhancements, such as  CAPPS II and the registered traveler program, also have the potential to  make screening more efficient.", "To assist agencies in managing their human capital more strategically, we  have developed a model that identifies cornerstones and related critical  success factors that agencies should apply and steps they can take. Our  model is designed to help agency leaders effectively lead and manage their  people and integrate human capital considerations into daily decision- making and the program results they seek to achieve.", "In January 2003, we reported that TSA was addressing some critical  human capital success factors by hiring personnel, using a wide range of  tools available for hiring, and beginning to link individual performance to  organizational goals. However, concerns remain about the size and  training of that workforce, the adequacy of the initial background checks  for screeners, and TSA\u2019s progress in setting up a performance  management system. As noted earlier in this testimony, TSA now plans to  reduce its screener workforce by 6,000 by September 30, 2003, and it has  proposed cutting the workforce by an additional 3,000 in fiscal year 2004.  This planned reduction has raised concerns about passenger delays at  airports and has led TSA to begin hiring part-time screeners to make more  flexible and efficient use of its workforce. In addition, TSA used an  abbreviated background check process to hire and deploy enough  screeners to meet ATSA\u2019s screening deadlines in 2002. After obtaining  additional background information, TSA terminated the employment of  some of these screeners. TSA reported 1,208 terminations as of May 31,  2003, that it ascribed to a variety of reasons, including criminal offenses  and failures to pass alcohol and drug tests. Furthermore, the national  media have reported allegations of operational and management control  problems that emerged with the expansion of the Federal Air Marshal  Service, including inadequate background checks and training, uneven  scheduling, and inadequate policies and procedures. In ongoing work, we  are examining the effectiveness of TSA\u2019s efforts to train, equip, and  supervise passenger screeners, and we are assessing the effects of  expansion on the Federal Air Marshal Service. In addition, we reported in  January 2003 that TSA had taken the initial steps in establishing a  performance management system linked to organizational goals.

These  practices are particularly important for the Department of Homeland  Security, whose implementation and transformation we have designated  as high risk.", "The Congress required TSA to adopt a results-oriented strategic planning  and reporting framework and, specifically, to provide an action plan with  goals and milestones to outline how acceptable levels of performance for  aviation security would be achieved. In prior work, we reported that TSA  has taken the first steps in performance planning and reporting by defining  its mission, vision, and values and that this practice would continue to be  important when TSA moved into the Department of Homeland Security.  Therefore, we recommended that TSA take the next steps to implement  results-oriented practices. These steps included establishing performance  goals and measures for all modes of transportation as part of a strategic  planning process that involves stakeholders, defining more clearly the  roles and responsibilities of its various offices in collaborating and  communicating with stakeholders; and formalizing the roles and  responsibilities of governmental entities for transportation security.

The vast number of guns, knives, and  other potential threat items that screeners have confiscated suggests that  security is working, but it also suggests that improved public awareness of  prohibited items could help focus resources where they are most needed  and reduce delays and inconvenience to the public. Faced with vast and  competing demands for security resources, TSA should continue its efforts  to identify technologies, such as CAPPS II, that will leverage its resources  and potentially improve its capabilities.
