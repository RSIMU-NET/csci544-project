The NDAA 2010 also required VA and DOD to submit a report of their evaluation of the demonstration and their recommendation as to whether it should continue operating as a fully integrated facility after 5 years. In July 2016, VA and DOD submitted a report to Congress recommending that the FHCC continue operating as an integrated facility.", "The NDAA 2015 included a provision for GAO to assess VA and DOD's evaluation to Congress. In this report, GAO assesses VA and DOD's approach for evaluating the FHCC and making the determination to continue operating it as an integrated facility. To do this, GAO reviewed the report to Congress and relevant supporting documents, and interviewed officials about the evaluation. In analyzing the evaluation, GAO used as criteria its prior work on planning practices, evaluating physical infrastructure, and management consolidation initiatives, as well as the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) capital programming guide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense's (DOD) evaluation to determine whether the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC) should continue operating as an integrated facility or revert to a \u201cjoint venture\u201d included conducting both separate and joint reviews. As an integrated facility, the FHCC has a unified governance structure, workforce, and budget. As a joint venture, the departments would continue sharing medical facility space, but would manage their operations with separate governance structures, workforces, and budgets. VA and DOD's joint review team concluded that converting the FHCC to a joint venture was not advisable or achievable because the Navy hospital had been demolished and money to replace it was used to expand the VA facility. In addition, returning the civilian employees from VA's to DOD's personnel system would require complex negotiations that could result in job reclassifications and salary changes. As a result, officials recommended continuing the FHCC as an integrated facility with the implementation of specific recommended improvements with the caveat that no similar integration efforts be undertaken until they \u201cget it right\u201d at the FHCC.", "In the report to Congress, VA and DOD outlined 17 recommended improvements for the FHCC but did not include time frames for implementing them. As GAO has previously reported, leading practices for planning call for results-oriented organizations to develop plans that provide tools to assure accountability, such as time frames and interim milestones that could be used to monitor progress, hold staff accountable for achieving desired results, and make mid-course corrections, if needed. Although officials routinely track each improvement through twice monthly meetings, and use a spreadsheet to monitor status and next steps, they have not specified time frames and interim milestones. Without this information, officials cannot ensure that they will implement the recommended improvements in a timely and efficient manner.", "The letter that accompanied the report to Congress stated that the FHCC's costs were \u201cvery high\u201d and not in keeping with the initial goal of delivering more cost-effective health care. VA and DOD officials told GAO that this statement was based on their contractor's evaluation of the facility, which found that the FHCC was not more cost-effective than a joint venture. Officials told GAO that their contractor's analyses used cost data that ended in fiscal year 2014, and since that time, the FHCC has made improvements they believe would positively impact cost savings. However, officials said that they did not have sufficient time for the contractor to update the analysis after receiving the contractor's report in September 2015, and that one additional year of data would not likely have changed their conclusions or recommendations. According to OMB's capital programming guide, at many key decision points, a cost-effectiveness analysis of operations would be useful to help make decisions. Without an updated cost-effectiveness analysis for the FHCC, officials will not have a baseline from which to measure and track the FHCC's future efficiency, including the effect of the recommended improvements, once implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretaries of VA and DOD collaborate to establish time frames and interim milestones for tracking the implementation of the jointly recommended improvements and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for the FHCC.

As authorized by the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA 2010), VA and Navy facilities in North Chicago  were integrated into a first-of-its-kind facility known as the Captain James  A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC). The 5-year demonstration  was intended to create a national model for the joint delivery of health  care that would be more accessible and less expensive than operating  two federal medical centers serving VA and DOD beneficiaries in the  same area. It was also expected to inform decision makers about  whether this model of care would be effective if replicated at other VA and  DOD locations.", "The Secretaries of VA, DOD, and the Navy signed an Executive  Agreement, effective October 1, 2010, which defined the departments\u2019  roles in operating and overseeing the FHCC and outlined requirements in  specific \u201cintegration areas,\u201d such as governance, workforce management,  and facility operations, including information technology (IT).  According  to the agreement, the FHCC was intended to meet the health care  missions of both departments\u2014including DOD\u2019s operational readiness  mission\u2014by integrating services previously provided by the former North  Chicago VA Medical Center and the Naval Health Clinic Great Lakes into  a single facility. The agreement also specified that the FHCC was  designed to improve the access, quality, and cost-effectiveness of care,  while providing FHCC leadership with the ability to adopt the most  efficient of the clinical and administrative processes used by VA and  DOD.", "The NDAA 2010, as amended by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2012,  included a provision for us to assess and report on the departments\u2019  progress in implementing the Executive Agreement and the effects of the  Executive Agreement on the provision of care and operation of the facility  at specified times.  We issued reports in response to this provision in  2011, 2012, and 2016.  Overall, we found that although the departments  had made progress in implementing areas of the Executive Agreement,  difficulties with the integration still remained in areas such as IT and  workforce planning. As a result, we made a number of recommendations  to the departments. (See appendix I for an outline of the status of those  recommendations.)", "The NDAA 2010 also required the departments to submit a report to the  appropriate committees of Congress no later than 180 days after 5 years  of executing the Executive Agreement (or by March 2016), to include a  comprehensive evaluation of the demonstration and a recommendation  as to whether the FHCC should continue as a fully integrated facility. To  address this requirement, VA and DOD submitted a report of their  evaluation to Congress in July 2016. In the letter that accompanied the  report to Congress, the departments recommended maintaining the  FHCC as an integrated facility with periodic reviews and the  implementation of specific recommended improvements. The  departments also stated that they would not recommend any similar  demonstration projects until they \u201cget it right\u201d at the FHCC.", "The Carl Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (NDAA 2015) included a provision  for us to assess the departments\u2019 evaluation for Congress on the FHCC.

We interviewed VA, DOD, and FHCC officials to  obtain information on their methodologies, including how they selected  and assessed specific areas of the FHCC and how they identified the  recommended improvements. We also spoke with these officials about  the implementation of the recommended improvements that were outlined  in the report to Congress and reviewed documents related to these  efforts. Finally, we assessed the extent to which VA and DOD\u2019s  methodology aligned with our identified best practices for planning, the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) capital programming guide,  and our previous work on evaluating physical infrastructure and  management consolidation initiatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2015 to January  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The FHCC director, a VA executive, is  accountable to VA for the fulfillment of the FHCC mission, while the  deputy director, a Navy Captain who rotates approximately every 2 years,  is accountable to the Navy and, ultimately, DOD.", "Also in accordance with the Executive Agreement, staff from the Naval  Health Clinic Great Lakes and the North Chicago VA Medical Center  merged to create a single, joint workforce. This included the transfer of  DOD civilian staff employed by the Department of the Navy to VA\u2019s  personnel system.  As of November 2016, the FHCC's workforce included  approximately 3482 civilian, active duty, and contract staff. Civilians  comprised 69 percent (about 2396) of the facility's overall workforce,  while 26 percent (about 907) were active duty servicemembers, and 5  percent (about 179) were contract staff.", "The NDAA 2010 established the Joint DOD-VA Medical Facility  Demonstration Fund (Joint Fund) as the funding mechanism for the  FHCC, with VA and DOD both making transfers to the Joint Fund from  their respective appropriations. As authorized in the NDAA 2010, the  Executive Agreement requires a financial reconciliation process that  permits VA and DOD to identify their contributions to the Joint Fund each  year.

VA established 9 subject matter teams that  began their reviews in August 2015, and DOD established 11 subject  matter teams that began their reviews in June 2015. Officials told us that  the issues selected for review by the subject matter teams were based on  the functional areas of the FHCC, the Executive Agreement, and  requirements in the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2009 (NDAA 2009) that provided guidelines for  establishing the demonstration. According to officials, each team  reviewed the following documents:  the FHCC evaluation conducted by VA and DOD\u2019s contractor,   the FHCC IT evaluation conducted by the Veterans Health  Administration Product Effectiveness group, and other relevant reports, including reviews by GAO and the Institute  of Medicine, as well as the mission and purpose of the facility.", "Based on their assessments, each team was asked to recommend  whether the FHCC should continue as an integrated facility or revert to a  joint venture. While the majority of VA\u2019s teams recommended that the  FHCC should continue operating as an integrated facility, the DOD/Navy  teams did not have an overall consensus. (See table 2.) According to a  Navy official, the teams\u2019 recommendations were prioritized based on  DOD\u2019s determination of the importance of their particular area.  Specifically, recommendations of the governance and budget teams were  given a higher priority than the other subject matter teams. As a result,  their recommendations to continue operating the FHCC as an integrated  facility had more weight in DOD\u2019s final determination.", "VA and DOD officials met jointly in October 2015 to determine the future  of the FHCC. They reviewed the work of the subject matter teams,  including the teams\u2019 recommendations related to whether the FHCC  should continue operating as an integrated facility as well as specific  improvements the teams recommended implementing if the FHCC  continued to operate as an integrated facility.

Time frames and interim milestones could be  used to monitor progress, hold staff accountable for achieving desired  results, and make mid-course corrections, if needed. DOD officials  acknowledged that although a majority of the recommended  improvements do not have this information, the timing for implementing  some improvements is outside their control, such as approval and funding  for IT enhancements. (See recommended improvement 14 in table 3.)   Additionally, according to these officials, the recommendation to conduct  an extensive review and revision of the FHCC Executive Agreement and  associated executive decision memoranda to reduce redundancies will be  a monumental undertaking, and until this review is under way, officials will  not know how much time will be needed to complete these efforts. (See  recommended improvement 2 in table 3.) Furthermore, DOD officials  informed us that two of the recommended improvements do have time  frames, although this is not reflected in the tracking spreadsheet.  Specifically, DOD officials stated that the joint staffing study has a  completion goal of February 2017, and the proposal for future funding for  the FHCC is due to be presented at the April 2017 Advisory Board  meeting.
