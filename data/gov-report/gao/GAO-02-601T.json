These matters have caused a number of  accounting profession oversight, auditor independence, corporate  governance, and other related issues that are now receiving extensive  national attention. The failures of Enron and certain other public  companies have resulted in substantial losses to employees, shareholders,  and other investors. Certain significant financial statement earnings  restatements and the proliferation of pro forma earnings assertions have  raised questions about the soundness of the current financial reporting,  independent auditing, and corporate governance functions relating to  public companies. These events have also raised a range of questions  regarding how such dramatic and unexpected events can happen under our  current system and the role and capacities of various key players under  that system.", "To assist the Congress in framing needed reforms, on February 25, 2002, we  convened a forum on corporate governance, transparency, and  accountability to discuss a variety of systemic issues. These entailed  regulatory oversight, auditing, accounting/financial reporting, and  corporate governance matters. Forum participants included prominent  individuals from federal and state government, the private sector,  standards setting and oversight bodies, and a variety of other interested  parties. As expected, the forum participants expressed a range of views on  these broad topics, which do not necessarily represent our views. However,  there was general agreement by the participants that there are no simple  solutions, or a single \u201csilver bullet,\u201d to resolve the perceived problems that  exist. In fact, there was general agreement that while some actions were  clearly called for in the wake of Enron and other recent events, care should  be taken to ensure that government does not overreact in a manner that  could have unintended adverse consequences. This requires a careful  balancing of interests with a focus on what is in the best overall interest of  the investing public. On March 5, 2002, I issued highlights of the forum  meeting, which I would like to enter into the record. Also, on March 5,  2002, I testified before the Senate Banking Committee to further elaborate  on these issues.", "As you requested, my comments today will primarily focus on oversight of  the accounting profession and related auditor independence and corporate  governance issues raised by Enron\u2019s failure. I would also like to take this  opportunity to provide our perspectives about the related issue of financial  reporting. It should be recognized that these overarching areas are  interrelated keystones to protecting the public\u2019s interest. Failure in any of  these areas can place a strain on the entire system. Any potential actions  should be guided by the fundamental principles of having the right  incentives for the key parties to do the right thing, adequate transparency  to provide reasonable assurance that the right thing will be done, and full  accountability if the right thing is not done. These three fundamental  principles represent a system of controls that should operate in  conjunction with a policy of placing special attention on areas of greatest  risk.", "The issues raised by Enron\u2019s failure are multi-faceted, involving many  different problems and players with various roles and responsibilities. In  that respect, needed changes to the government\u2019s role should vary  depending on the specific nature and magnitude of the problem.  Specifically, the government\u2019s role can range from direct intervention to  encouraging certain non-governmental and private-sector entities to take  certain steps designed to enhance trust and better protect the public  interest. For example, the issues surrounding the accounting profession\u2019s  current self-regulatory system for auditors involves many players in a  fragmented system that is not well coordinated, involves certain conflicts  of interest, lacks effective communication, and has a discipline system that  is largely perceived as being ineffective. In this case, direct government  intervention to statutorily create a new independent federal government  body to regulate the accounting profession is needed. On the other hand,  the issues concerning corporate governance may be best addressed  through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) encouraging the  stock exchanges to enhance public companies\u2019 listing requirements and  promote \u201cbest practices\u201d in connection with the boards, key committees,  and officers of public companies. If such an approach is not successful in  achieving the expected corporate behavior, the government can then take  further action.", "In considering changes to the current system that gave rise to Enron and  other areas of concern, it will be important that the Congress consider a  holistic approach to addressing the range of interrelated issues. It is  important to realize that effectively protecting the public interest is a multi- dimensional challenge involving a variety of players and issues. For  example, it involves company management, boards and board committees,  the accounting profession standard setters, analysts, regulatory oversight  agencies, investors, and various other parties. In addition, in the audit area  it involves a redefinition of who the client is, various audit scope and  responsibility issues, the number of firms, the quality of the firms\u2019 quality  assurance systems, and the quality of the firm\u2019s personnel. It is also  important that any responsible governmental bodies, such as the SEC, have  adequate resources to fulfill its responsibilities in these areas, which I will  briefly address later."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulation and Oversight of the Accounting Profession", "paragraphs": ["The current model for regulation and oversight of the accounting  profession involves federal and state regulators and a complex system of  self-regulation by the accounting profession.

Basically, the current model includes:  licensing members of the accounting profession to practice within the  jurisdiction of a state, as well as issuing rules and regulations governing  member conduct, which is done by the various state boards of  accountancy;  setting accounting and auditing standards, which is done by the  Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Auditing  Standards Board (ASB), respectively, through acceptance of the  standards by the SEC;  setting auditor independence rules, which within their various areas of  responsibility, have been issued by the American Institute of Certified  Public Accountants (AICPA), the SEC, and GAO; and  oversight and discipline, which is done through a variety of self- regulatory and public regulatory systems (e.g., the AICPA, the SEC, and  various state boards of accountancy).", "Enron\u2019s failure and a variety of other recent events has brought a direct  focus on how well the current systems of regulation and oversight of the  accounting profession are working in achieving their ultimate objective  that the opinions of independent auditors on the fair presentation of  financial statements can be relied upon by investors, creditors, and the  various other users of financial reports.", "The issues currently being raised about the effectiveness of the accounting  profession\u2019s self-regulatory system are not unique to the collapse of Enron.

A  continuing message is that the current self-regulatory system is  fragmented, is not well coordinated, and has a disciplinary function that is  not timely, nor does it contain effective sanctions, all of which create a  public image of ineffectiveness. In addressing these issues, proposals  should consider whether overall the system creates the right incentives,  transparency, and accountability, and operates proactively to protect the  public interest. Also, the links within the self-regulatory system and with  the SEC and the various state boards of accountancy (the public regulatory  systems) should be considered as these systems are interrelated, and  weaknesses in one component can put strain on the other components of  the overall system.", "I would now like to address some of the more specific areas of the  accounting profession\u2019s self-regulatory system that should be considered in  forming and evaluating proposals to reshape or overhaul the current  system."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting Profession\u2019s Current Self-Regulatory System", "paragraphs": ["The accounting profession\u2019s current self-regulatory system for public  company audits is heavily reliant on the AICPA through a system that is  largely composed of volunteers from the accounting profession.

AICPA staff support the volunteers in conducting their  responsibilities.

The public\u2019s confidence in the reliability of issuers\u2019 financial  statements, which relies in large part on the role of independent auditors,  serves to encourage investment in securities issued by public companies.  This sense of confidence depends on reasonable investors perceiving  auditors as independent expert professionals who have neither mutual, nor  conflicts of, interests in connection with the entities they are auditing.  Accordingly, investors and other users expect auditors to bring to the  financial reporting process integrity, independence, objectivity, and  technical competence, and to prevent the issuance of misleading financial  statements.", "Enron\u2019s failure and certain other recent events have raised questions  concerning whether auditors are living up to the expectations of the  investing public; however, similar questions have been raised over a  number of years due to significant restatements of financial statements and  certain unexpected and costly business failures, such as the savings and  loan crisis. Issues debated over the years continue to focus on auditor  independence concerns and the auditor\u2019s role and responsibilities. Public  accounting firms providing nonaudit services to their audit client is one of  the issues that has again surfaced by Enron\u2019s failure and the large amount  of annual fees collected by Enron\u2019s independent auditor for nonaudit  services.", "Auditors have the capability of performing a range of valuable services for  their clients, and providing certain nonaudit services can ultimately be  beneficial to investors and other interested parties. However, in some  circumstances, it is not appropriate for auditors to perform both audit and  certain nonaudit services for the same client. In these circumstances, the  auditor, the client, or both will have to make a choice as to which of these  services the auditor will provide. These concepts, which I strongly believe  are in the public\u2019s interest, are reflected in the revisions to auditor  independence requirements for government audits, which GAO recently  issued as part of Government Auditing Standards. The new independence  standard has gone through an extensive deliberative process over several  years, including extensive public comments and input from my Advisory  Council on Government Auditing Standards. The standard, among other  things, toughens the rules associated with providing nonaudit services and  includes a principle-based approach to addressing this issue, supplemented  with certain safeguards. The two overarching principles in the standard for  nonaudit services are that:  auditors should not perform management functions or make   auditors should not audit their own work or provide nonaudit services  in situations where the amounts or services involved are significant or  material to the subject matter of the audit.", "Both of the above principles should be applied using a substance over form  doctrine. Under the revised standard, auditors are allowed to perform  certain nonaudit services provided the services do not violate the above  principles; however, in most circumstances certain additional safeguards  would have to be met. For example, (1) personnel who perform allowable  nonaudit services would be precluded from performing any related audit  work, (2) the auditor\u2019s work could not be reduced beyond the level that  would be appropriate if the nonaudit work were performed by another  unrelated party, and (3) certain documentation and quality assurance  requirements must be met. The new standard includes an express  prohibition regarding auditors providing certain bookkeeping or record  keeping services and limits payroll processing and certain other services,  all of which are presently permitted under current independence rules of  the AICPA. However, our new standard allows the auditor to provide  routine advice and technical assistance on an ongoing basis and without  being subject to the additional safeguards.", "The focus of these changes to the government auditing standards is to  better serve the public interest and to maintain a high degree of integrity,  objectivity, and independence for audits of government entities and entities  that receive federal funding. However, these standards apply only to audits  of federal entities and those organizations receiving federal funds, and not  to audits of public companies. In the transmittal letter issuing the new  independence standard, we expressed our hope that the AICPA would raise  its independence standards to those contained in this new standard in  order to eliminate any inconsistency between this standard and their  current standards. The AICPA\u2019s recent statement before another  congressional committee that the AICPA will not oppose prohibitions on auditors providing certain nonaudit services seems to be a step in the right  direction.", "The independence of public accountants is crucial to the credibility of  financial reporting and, in turn, the capital formation process. Auditor  independence standards require that the audit organization and the auditor  be independent both in fact and in appearance. These standards place  responsibility on the auditor and the audit organization to maintain  independence so that opinions, conclusions, judgments, and  recommendations will be impartial and will be viewed as being impartial by  knowledgeable third parties. Because independence standards are  fundamental to the independent audit function, as part of its mission, the  new independent and statutorily created government body, which I  previously discussed, should be responsible for setting independence  standards for audits of public companies, as well as the authority to  discipline members of the accounting profession that violate such  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Corporate Goverance", "paragraphs": ["First, I want to underscore that serving on the board of directors of a public  company is an important and difficult responsibility.

These pressures  and related executive compensation arrangements unfortunately often  translate to a focus on short-term business results. This can create perverse  incentives, such as attempts to manage earnings to report favorable short- term financial results, and/or failing to provide adequate transparency in  financial reporting that disguises risks, uncertainties, and/or commitments  of the reporting entity.", "On balance though, the difficulty of serving on a public company\u2019s board of  directors is not a valid reason for not doing the job right, which means  being knowledgeable of the company\u2019s business, asking the right questions,  and doing the right thing to protect not only shareholders, but also the  public\u2019s interest.

More recently, we have noted that the current  reporting model is not well suited to identify and report on key value and  risk elements inherent in our 21st Century knowledge-based economy. The  SEC is the primary federal agency currently involved in accounting and  auditing requirements for publicly traded companies but has traditionally  relied on the private sector for setting standards for financial reporting and  independent audits, retaining a largely oversight role. Accordingly, the SEC  has accepted rules set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board  (FASB)\u2014generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\u2014as the  primary standard for preparation of financial statements in the private  sector.", "We found that despite the continuing efforts of FASB and the SEC to  enhance financial reporting, changes in the business environment, such as  the growth in information technology, new types of relationships between  companies, and the increasing use of complex business transactions and  financial instruments, constantly threaten the relevance of financial  statements and pose a formidable challenge for standard setters. A basic  limitation of the model is that financial statements present the business  entity\u2019s financial position and results of its operations largely on the basis  of historical costs, which do not fully meet the broad range of user needs  for financial information. Enron\u2019s failure and the inquiries that have  followed have raised many of the same issues about the adequacy of the  current financial reporting model, such as the need for additional  transparency, clarity, more timely information, and risk-oriented financial  reporting.", "Among other actions to address the Enron-specific accounting issues, the  SEC has requested that the FASB address the specific accounting rules  related to Enron\u2019s special purpose entities and related party disclosures. In  addition, the SEC Chief Accountant has also raised concerns that the  current standard-setting process is too cumbersome and slow and that  much of the FASB\u2019s guidance is rule-based and too complex. He believes  that (1) a principle-based standards will yield a less complex financial  reporting paradigm that is more responsive to emerging issues, (2) the  FASB needs to be more responsive to accounting standards problems  identified by the SEC, and (3) the SEC needs to give the FASB freedom to  address the problems, but the SEC needs to monitor projects on an ongoing  basis and, if they are languishing, determine why.", "We generally agree with the SEC Chief Accountant\u2019s assessment. We also  believe that the issues surrounding the financial reporting model can be  effectively addressed by the SEC, in conjunction with the FASB, without  statutorily changing the standard-setting process. However, we do believe  that a more active and ongoing interaction between the SEC and the FASB  is needed to facilitate a mutual understanding of priorities for standard- setting, realistic goals for achieving expectations, and timely actions to  address issues that arise when expectations are not likely to be met. In that  regard, the SEC could be directed to:  reach agreement with the FASB on its standard-setting agenda,  approach to resolving accounting issues, and timing for completion of  projects;  monitor the FASB\u2019s progress on projects, including taking appropriate  actions to resolve issues when projects are not meeting expectations;  and  report annually to the Congress on the FASB\u2019s progress in setting  standards, along with any recommendations, and the FASB\u2019s response  to the SEC\u2019s recommendations.", "The Congress may wish to have GAO evaluate and report to it one year  after enactment of legislation and periodically thereafter on the SEC\u2019s  performance in working with the FASB to improve the timeliness and  effectiveness of the accounting standard-setting process.

One of the responsibilities of the  FASB\u2019s parent organization, the Financial Accounting Foundation, is to  raise funds for the FASB and its standard-setting process to supplement the  funding that comes from the FASB\u2019s sale of publications. Some have  questioned whether this is the best arrangement to ensure the  independence of the standard-setting process. This issue has been raised  by the appropriateness of certain accounting standards related to  consolidations, that the FASB has been working on for some time,  applicable to Enron\u2019s restatement of its financial statements as reported to  the SEC by Enron in its November 8, 2001, Form 8-K filing. However, the  issue has previously been raised when the FASB has addressed other  controversial accounting issues, such as accounting for stock options.  Therefore, the Congress may wish to task the SEC with studying this issue  and identifying alternative sources of funding to supplement the FASB\u2019s  sale of publications, including the possibility of imposing fees on  registrants and/or firms, and to report to the Congress on its findings and  actions taken to address the funding issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The SEC\u2019s Ability to Fulfill Its Mission", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, securities markets have experienced unprecedented  growth and change. Moreover, technology has fundamentally changed the  way markets operate and how investors access markets. These changes  have made the markets more complex. In addition, the markets have  become more international, and legislative changes have resulted in a  regulatory framework that requires increased coordination among financial  regulators and requires that the SEC regulate a greater range of products.  Moreover, as I have discussed, the collapse of Enron and other corporate  failures have stimulated an intense debate on the need for broad-based  reform in such areas as oversight of the accounting profession, accounting  standards, corporate governance, and analysts conflicts of interest issues,  all of which could have significant repercussions on the SEC\u2019s role and  oversight challenges. At the same time, the SEC has been faced with an  ever-increasing workload and ongoing human capital challenges, most  notably high staff turnover and numerous staff vacancies.", "Our recent report discusses these issues and the need for the SEC to  improve its strategic planning to more effectively manage its operations  and limited resources, and also shows that the growth of SEC resources  has not kept pace with the growth in the SEC\u2019s workload (such as filings,  complaints, inquiries, investigations, examinations, and inspections). We  believe that the SEC should be provided with the necessary resources to  effectively discharge its current and any increased responsibilities the  Congress may give it. And finally, we believe that the SEC should be  directed to report annually to the Congress on (1) its strategic plan for  carrying out its mission, (2) the adequacy of its resources and how it is  effectively managing resources through a risk-oriented approach and  prioritization of risks, including effective use of information technology,  and (3) any unmet needs including required funding and human resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Closing Comments", "paragraphs": ["The United States has the largest and most respected capital markets in the  world. Our capital markets have long enjoyed a reputation of integrity that  promotes investor confidence. This is critical to our economy and the  economies of other nations given the globalization of commerce. However,  this long-standing reputation is now being challenged by some parties. The  effectiveness of systems relating to independent audits, financial reporting,  and corporate governance, which represent key underpinnings of capital  markets and are critical to protecting the public\u2019s interest, has been called  into question by the failure of Enron and certain other events and practices.  Although the human elements can override any system of controls, it is  clear that there are a range of actions that are critical to the effective  functioning of the system underlying capital markets that require attention  by a range of key players. In addition, a strong enforcement function with  appropriate civil and criminal sanctions is also needed to ensure effective  accountability when key players fail to properly perform their duties and  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
