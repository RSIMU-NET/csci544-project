However, GAO found that some whistleblowers provided information about FBAR noncompliance to IRS. In a sample of 132 whistleblower claims closed between January 2012 and July 2017, GAO found that IRS assessed FBAR penalties in 28 cases. It is unknown whether the whistleblower's information led IRS to take action in all of these cases. These penalties totaled approximately $10.7 million. Had they been included in whistleblower awards, total awards could have increased up to $3.2 million. Over 97 percent of the FBAR penalties collected from these 28 claims came from 10 cases with willful FBAR noncompliance, for which higher penalties apply.", "IRS forwards whistleblower allegations of FBAR noncompliance to its operating divisions for further examination. However, IRS Form 11369, a key form used for making award determinations, does not require examiners to include information about the usefulness of a whistleblower's information FBAR and other non-tax issues. After Congress enacted the statutory change, IRS suspended award determinations for 1 week, but resumed the program before updating the form or its instructions, or issuing internal guidance on new information required on the Form. As of June 28, 2018, IRS had not begun updating the Form 11369 or its instructions. The lack of clear instructions on the form for examiners to include information on FBAR and other non-tax enforcement collections may result in relevant information being excluded from whistleblower award decisions.", "IRS maintains FBAR penalty data in a standalone database. It uses these data for internal and external reporting and to make management decisions. Because of the change in statute, IRS will need these data for determining whistleblower awards. GAO found that IRS does not have sufficient quality controls to ensure the reliability of FBAR penalty data. For example, IRS staff enter data into the database manually but there are no secondary checks to make sure the data entered are accurate. Without additional controls for data reliability, IRS risks making decisions, including award determinations, with incomplete or inaccurate data.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report issued in August 2018.

This  information can help reduce the tax gap\u2014the difference between the  amount of taxes owed by taxpayers and the amount voluntarily paid on  time. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 included an expansion  of IRS\u2019s whistleblower program by establishing the IRS Whistleblower  Office and requiring IRS to pay qualifying whistleblowers between 15 and  30 percent of the proceeds IRS collects as a result of the whistleblower\u2019s  information.", "The Bank Secrecy Act and its implementing regulations require certain  individuals with offshore bank accounts to file an annual Report of  Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).

Individuals who fail to disclose these accounts and pay appropriate taxes  on them contribute to the tax gap. If IRS identifies these unreported  accounts and income, it can assess taxes, interest, and penalties. For  each FBAR violation, the penalty for willful violations can be as high as  the larger of $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) or half of the value of the  unreported account at the time of the violation.

We reviewed  agency documents, electronically tested data for missing data and  outliers, and interviewed IRS officials about these databases. These two  databases are the only sources of data within IRS for whistleblower  claims information and FBAR enforcement actions and outcomes. We  used data from E-TRAK to identify whistleblower claims that were likely to  involve allegations of FBAR noncompliance. We compared data from E- TRAK and the FBAR Database to identify individuals that were named by  a whistleblower and also subject to FBAR enforcement actions and any  related enforcement actions taken by IRS.

In 1996, Congress  increased the scope of the program to also provide awards for detecting  underpayments of tax. It also changed the source of awards to money  IRS collects as a result of information whistleblowers provide rather than  appropriated funds. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 created  a mandatory whistleblower award program which made fundamental  changes to IRS\u2019s existing informant awards program. The 2006 act also  established the IRS Whistleblower Office. The Whistleblower Office  processes claims that allege a tax noncompliance of more than $2 million  as potential 7623(b) claims. If these claims meet the requirements for an  award, the whistleblower receives a mandatory award of between 15 and  30 percent of collected proceeds, with the exact percentage determined  by IRS\u2019s Whistleblower Office based on the extent of the whistleblower\u2019s  contributions. Claims not meeting the criteria for a 7623(b) claim are  referred to as 7623(a) claims and are subject to procedural steps similar  to those of 7623(b) claims. However, 7623(a) claims are neither eligible  for appeals to the U.S. Tax Court nor subject to mandatory award  payments.", "For claims processed as 7623(b) claims, the whistleblower claims  process involves multiple steps, starting with a whistleblower\u2019s initial  application and ending with a rejection, a denial, or an award payment.  The process begins when a whistleblower submits a signed Form 211,  Application for Award for Original Information, to the Whistleblower Office.  The Initial Claim Evaluation unit, which is part of the Small Business/Self- Employed operating division, performs an administrative review of the  incoming applications. The Initial Claim Evaluation unit examines the  submission for completeness and logs it into E-TRAK. They may reject  claims because the tax noncompliance allegation is unclear, no taxpayer  is identified, or the whistleblower is ineligible for an award. Claims that  are not rejected are sent to classification to determine which operating  division should review the claim. Claims are then generally sent to  subject matter experts in the various operating divisions\u2014usually the  Small Business/Self-Employed or Large Business & International  division\u2014where they are reviewed to determine whether the claims merit  further consideration by the operating division, should be referred to  Criminal Investigation for investigation, or should be sent back to the  Whistleblower Office as denied. Claims can be denied if there is limited  audit potential or if there is limited time left on the statute of limitations,  among other reasons. Claims that are not denied are generally added to  the operating division\u2019s inventory for potential examination. If a claim is  selected for examination, the examiner completes and returns to the  Whistleblower Office a Form 11369, Confidential Evaluation Report on  Claim for Award, at the conclusion of the examination. The Whistleblower  Office uses the information on this form when making an award  determination.

IRS received comments on the proposed rule  contending that excluding money collected under Title 18 and Title 31 eliminates a whistleblower\u2019s incentive to provide information on violations  under these titles and would reduce the number of whistleblowers willing  to provide information to IRS. IRS stated in its final rule that section 7623  only authorizes awards for amounts collected under Title 26.

OVDP enables taxpayers with tax noncompliance from  undisclosed offshore accounts to avoid prosecution and resolve their past  noncompliance by paying limited civil penalties. As one of a number of  required actions for OVDP, IRS assesses taxpayers accepted into the  program a miscellaneous Title 26 offshore penalty in lieu of all other  penalties for undisclosed foreign accounts, including FBAR penalties.  According to IRS officials, because the OVDP penalty is a Title 26  penalty, these collections were included in collected proceeds for the  purposes of whistleblower award calculations even before the new  definition of proceeds took effect on February 9, 2018. The case files we  reviewed included some examples of whistleblowers receiving an award  based in part on the miscellaneous Title 26 OVDP penalty in addition to  tax, interest, and other penalties.

The examiner can use their  discretion to issue a warning letter if they  determine that the taxpayer would improve  their FBAR reporting compliance in the future.  A taxpayer\u2019s failure to file an FBAR after  receiving a warning letter supports a  determination of a willful FBAR violation.", "The new definition of proceeds establishes a policy of including FBAR  penalties in whistleblower awards regardless of whether the identified  taxpayer enters OVDP or is assessed an FBAR penalty as a result of an  FBAR exam. It also creates consistency with the treatment of penalties  assessed under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).  FATCA, enacted in 2010 under Title 26, assesses penalties for failure to  report foreign financial accounts and assets.

If the subject matter expert forwards a  whistleblower claim for possible audit and an examination takes place,  the examiners will establish an audit file for the tax examination. If  evidence of FBAR noncompliance is found, a separate audit file is to be  created. Most often, both files are maintained and updated by the same  examiners. According to IRS officials and procedures laid out in the IRM,  the outcome of the examination is based on the quality of the evidence  and is not influenced by the presence of a whistleblower or the source of  the information.", "Information on FBAR noncompliance developed by examiners may or  may not be provided to the Whistleblower Office. At the conclusion of the  examination process, the examiner provides the Whistleblower Office with  a Form 11369, Confidential Evaluation Report on Claim for Award. On  this form, examiners are required to answer a series of detailed questions  about the whistleblower\u2019s contribution to the investigation, such as  whether the whistleblower identified specific issues or provided analysis  that saved IRS time and resources. According to the IRM, the purpose of  the Form 11369 is to inform the Whistleblower Office of the  whistleblower\u2019s contribution, if any, to an examination, investigation, or  other action.", "According to the instructions on the Form 11369 as well as the IRM, the  Whistleblower Office bases its award determinations in large part on the  form and information provided to supplement it.

In addition, there are no instructions on or  accompanying the form to require examiners to provide documentation  relating to FBAR noncompliance.", "Prior to the legislative change in February 2018 to include FBAR  penalties in awards, the Whistleblower Office retained in its files any  FBAR-related information provided by the operating division but did not  use it for the award determination process. According to Whistleblower  Office officials, any information about FBAR noncompliance in its claim  files was there incidentally and not collected or retained for any specific  tracking purposes. These officials told us, and we found in our review,  that some claim files had information about FBAR violations or penalties  because the operating division examiner chose to include it in the Form  11369 narrative or in supplemental information, even though the  examiner was not required to do so. Because providing FBAR information  with the Form 11369 was discretionary prior to the legislative change in  February 2018, Whistleblower Office officials told us that if FBAR  information existed in the files at the time of the interview, it may not be  complete.", "While having complete information about FBAR exams on the Form  11369 was not needed when IRS did not consider FBAR noncompliance  as part of award determinations, now that it is defined as such by statute,  the Whistleblower Office will need such information on FBAR  noncompliance on Form 11369 to properly determine whistleblower  awards in accordance with the new legal requirements. As of June 28,  2018, the Whistleblower Office had not updated Form 11369 or its  accompanying instructions. Whistleblower Office officials told us they  were reviewing and commenting on draft guidance from the Office of  Chief Counsel on how to implement the new provision but had not yet  updated the Form 11369 or its instructions.

The day  the new statutory definition became law, IRS placed a hold on  whistleblower award determinations while the Whistleblower Office  developed new procedures. On February 15, 2018, IRS lifted the hold,  instructing Whistleblower Office analysts to check with their managers  prior to making award determinations on any claims that may include non- Title 26 proceeds. However, the Whistleblower Office did not issue any  additional specific guidance to Whistleblower Office staff on how to review  claims for any non-Title 26 issues until April 19, 2018.

This memo stated that those working on whistleblower claims need to  provide the Whistleblower Office with details of how whistleblower  information was used in any actions taken regardless of whether they  were Title 26 issues or not. The Whistleblower Office emailed a  communication similar to the memo to other IRS employees working on  whistleblower claims on April 18, 2018. The initial memo did not provide  specific instructions as to how to provide such information, such as  specifying to use Form 11369, but the email said additional guidance and  training would be forthcoming. According to Whistleblower Office officials,  the timing of the internal communication about the change in  whistleblower award basis was because the Whistleblower Office was  waiting on draft guidance from the IRS Office of Chief Counsel. The  Whistleblower Office received this draft guidance on April 19, 2018.", "In late April and early May, the Whistleblower Office posted information  about these changes in internal IRS media, including IRS-wide web  pages and pages for individual IRS operating divisions.

Therefore, there is currently  no mechanism for any data to automatically feed into or from the FBAR  Database to cross-check with taxpayer information in other databases.  When examiners open an FBAR exam, the IRM directs them to report  exam and exam-outcome information to the FBAR team. Examiners fax,  mail, or e-mail FBAR examination and penalty assessment information to  the FBAR team which then transcribes the data into the FBAR Database  manually. Within IRS, only the FBAR team has access to the database.

For example, there is no secondary check by  another individual to ensure data were entered correctly and completely.  The FBAR Database procedures also lack sufficient validity checks to  ensure that the data entered are accurate. There are some basic data  entry checks in the database, such as limiting input to alphanumeric  entries and a warning if a date is more than a year from the current date.  However, these checks serve only as a reminder for the employees  entering the data to verify its accuracy; these checks do not prevent  erroneous data from being entered and retained. Without additional  controls for accuracy and validity, IRS risks relying upon inaccurate  information for some of its reporting and decision making.", "According to IRS officials, not all fields in the FBAR Database are  mandatory.

IRS officials also told us that  they are aware there are some data missing in the database, such as  incomplete records for some taxpayers, but they could not quantify how  often this occurs. They also told us that such missing data can contribute  to inaccurate reports of FBAR total assessments.

We also met with IRS officials and discussed the ongoing  development of plans for improvement of the database.", "For our fourth objective, we interviewed a nonprobability sample of  attorneys who have represented multiple whistleblowers who have  submitted claims to the IRS Whistleblower Office under section 7623(b).  The views expressed in these interviews represented only those of the  attorneys who participated and are not generalizable to all whistleblower  attorneys or law firms. These attorneys have a financial interest in IRS\u2019s  treatment of whistleblower claims; however, interviewing these attorneys  allowed us to gather broad viewpoints on how whistleblower award  exclusions may affect their professional decisions and the decision of  their clients and prospective clients. We began with whistleblower  attorneys whom we previously spoke with for our 2011 and 2015 reports  on the IRS Whistleblower Office and requested from those attorneys  names of other attorneys currently active in the IRS whistleblower  community who have represented clients who submitted allegations that  included FBAR noncompliance. We individually interviewed 11 attorneys  from nine firms, asking the same questions of each to obtain their  perspectives on the effect the exclusion of FBAR penalties and criminal  fines has on the nature and volume of whistleblower complaints and on  the cases they bring forward. We also attended a regularly scheduled  meeting of attorneys representing whistleblowers, including some we had  spoken with and several others. Following the enactment of statutory  provisions defining collected proceeds for the purpose of whistleblower  awards to include FBAR penalties and other non-Title 26 collections, we  contacted the 11 attorneys we had previously interviewed for their views  on the effect of the new legislation, and we received written responses  from 8 of them.", "For balance, we also analyzed data on FBAR penalty and tax  assessments for a sample of taxpayers who were assessed an FBAR  penalty in calendar years 2010 through 2015. For all taxpayers in our  sample, we identified those where a whistleblower was involved in  providing IRS information about the taxpayer and those where there was  no whistleblower presence. We analyzed whether there was a statistically  significant difference in proportion of FBAR penalty assessments  compared to tax and FBAR penalty assessments based on whether a  whistleblower was involved or not using a nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann- Whitney test. This analysis did not control for other factors that could  affect the results, such as the taxpayer being willfully noncompliant with  FBAR reporting requirements, the total tax assessment of the taxpayer, or  the total income of the taxpayer. In addition, we interviewed IRS  Whistleblower Office officials and operating division officials to discuss  the relative complexity of claims involving and not involving FBAR and  how the exam teams use whistleblower information related to FBAR  noncompliance.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from March 2017 to August 2018 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  subsequently worked with IRS from August 2018 to September 2018 to  prepare this public version of the original sensitive report for public  release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Tara Carter (Assistant Director),  Danielle N.

Congress began to require IRS to pay whistleblowers for this information in February 2018. However, we found that IRS\u2019s data on these penalties may not be reliable. We recommended that they improve it."]}
