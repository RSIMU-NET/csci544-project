NATO wants new  members to be democracies, have harmonious relations with neighboring  countries, modernize and restructure their defense capabilities, protect  civil liberties and human and minority rights, and have an open market  economy. The admission of new members requires ratification by two- thirds of the United States Senate. The last time NATO considered adding  new members, Congress was concerned that the President did not provide  sufficient information in a time frame that facilitated congressional  deliberations on the countries invited to join NATO. As a result, the Senate  mandated that the President provide Congress with information on  countries seeking to join the alliance\u2014before NATO made any decision on  enlarging its membership. In particular, the President was required to  assess how countries would further the principles of the North Atlantic  Treaty, contribute to North Atlantic security, and affect U.S. national  security interests. He also was required to evaluate countries\u2019 eligibility for  membership and estimate the military requirements and costs associated  with a country\u2019s membership for both NATO and U.S. budgets.", "The Senate mandated that we review and assess the President\u2019s report.

We  also conducted in-depth data gathering in three aspirant countries\u2014 Bulgaria, Latvia, and Slovenia\u2014that included meetings with several  government agencies and a variety of private-sector, nongovernmental, and  research organizations. See appendix I for a detailed description of the  scope and methodology.", "The President submitted his report to Congress on August 26, 2002. In  presenting the results of our assessment, we have not discussed the  specific conclusions or information in the President\u2019s report because that  report is classified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The North Atlantic Treaty was signed on April 4, 1949, by 12 European and  North American countries to provide collective defense against the  emerging threat that the Soviet Union posed to the democracies of Western  Europe. Since its inception, the alliance\u2019s key objective has been to achieve  a lasting peace in the North Atlantic area that is based on the common  values of democracy, the rule of law, and individual liberty. Article 10 of the  treaty permits accession of additional European states if they are in a  position to further the treaty\u2019s principles and contribute to North Atlantic  security. While members must unanimously agree to any new country\u2019s  accession, the treaty contains no explicit criteria that a country must meet  to join the alliance. NATO\u2019s invitations to countries to join the alliance are  political decisions based on the unanimous agreement of members.", "Since its inception, NATO has enlarged its membership four times as  changing political and strategic circumstances have warranted. The first  three occasions were linked to confrontation with the Communist bloc,  particularly the Soviet Union, and were taken to meet pressing strategic  and security needs. Turkey and Greece joined NATO in 1952 for strategic  reasons, permitting NATO to shore up its southern flank to forestall  Communist military action in Europe at the height of the Korean War. West  Germany joined the alliance in 1955 after agreeing to maintain extensive  NATO forces on its territory and to place its national army within NATO\u2019s  integrated command structure. With Spain\u2019s membership in 1982, NATO  gained better access to Spain\u2019s air and naval bases, while the newly  democratized nation improved its chances of joining the European  Economic Community.", "A significantly different strategic environment marked the fourth, and  latest, enlargement, when NATO\u2019s goal was to extend stability eastward  into the political vacuum resulting from the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. In  1994, NATO committed to enlarging its membership to include the newly  democratic states of the former Communist bloc. As a result, Poland,  Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined the alliance in 1999, and several  more east and central European countries are seeking membership.", "At the 1999 summit meeting in Washington, D.C., NATO promulgated,  among other things, the Membership Action Plan, to provide guidance and  counseling to other NATO aspirants to facilitate their preparations for  possible membership. The plan sets forth defense, budgetary, information  security, legal, political, and economic goals for countries to work toward  to enhance their readiness for membership. Essentially, NATO wants  countries that are seeking to join the alliance to (1) be democracies that are  based on the rule of law; (2) have harmonious relations with neighboring  countries and settle international disputes peacefully; (3) provide and  protect civil liberties, human rights, and minority rights; and (4) have an  open market economy. In addition, NATO wants countries to modernize  and restructure their defense capabilities to be interoperable with NATO  and, hence, to be able to contribute to NATO operations. To reach that goal,  NATO would like countries to spend at least the equivalent of 2 percent of  their gross domestic product on defense development. Countries also need  to implement NATO requirements for handling and securing NATO  classified information and to be free from legal barriers that would prevent  a country from deploying forces abroad or hosting foreign troops on their  territory. Each country participating in the Membership Action Plan  develops an annual plan of actions that it will pursue to achieve those  goals. NATO reviews the plans and progress implementing them and  provides annual feedback to each country. Representatives of NATO\u2019s  newest members, as well as representatives of the countries currently  seeking NATO membership, generally agree that the program has provided  crucial guidance and is a major success in assisting countries\u2019 preparations.", "As of September 2002, there were nine countries participating in the  Membership Action Plan\u2014Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and  Slovenia\u2014and at least one additional country, Croatia, was poised to begin  participation in the fall of 2002. The nine countries have undergone three  annual planning cycles and will submit their fourth annual plan to NATO in  the fall of 2002. At its summit meeting in November 2002 in Prague, NATO  will decide which of these countries should be invited to join the alliance in  the next round of enlargement.

The five requirements were to assess (1) how countries would further the  principles of the North Atlantic Treaty and contribute to North Atlantic  security, (2) how countries would affect U.S. national security interests, (3)  countries\u2019 eligibility for membership, (4) the impact on NATO\u2019s costs and  members\u2019 shares of those costs, and (5) the impact on U.S. defense and  other budgets. No major events appear to have been excluded. The  information provided in the report was generally accurate and current and  generally consistent with the data we collected independently from a broad  array of U.S. government, NATO, and foreign government sources as well  as research and other nongovernment organizations. The report\u2019s cutoff  date for the timeliness of the information was July 15, 2002, and the time  frames for events, particularly recent ones, were usually identified. No  recent events have occurred to alter the general information provided in  the report.", "First, to assess how countries would further the principles of the North  Atlantic Treaty and contribute to North Atlantic security, the President\u2019s  report discussed countries\u2019 achievements in this area. For example, in  discussing countries\u2019 potential impacts on North Atlantic security, the  report described countries\u2019 contributions to regional peace\u2014in particular,  the ways in which countries address controversial issues with neighboring  countries and their contributions to NATO operations. Second, to address  the implications of countries\u2019 membership for U.S. security, the President\u2019s  report provided a detailed discussion of the contributions that countries  have made and continue to make to NATO operations in Europe\u2019s Balkan  region\u2014such as operations in Bosnia and Kosovo\u2014and their cooperation  and assistance in the war on terrorism. To meet the two cost requirements,  the report provided estimates of the potential impact of countries\u2019  membership on both NATO costs and U.S. budgets. Finally, the bulk of the  report addressed country eligibility by discussing their accomplishments in  achieving the goals of NATO\u2019s Membership Action Plan. As discussed in the  next section, the report provided information about each country\u2019s  eligibility in relation to several of those issues, but there was limited  discussion of the implementation of democratic principles and reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Provided Limited Discussion of Some Eligibility Issues", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s report presented a detailed discussion of the defense,  budgetary, information security, legal, and economic issues surrounding  each country\u2019s eligibility for membership. The information was accurate  and current. Discussion of defense issues, in particular, was extensive,  describing for each of the nine countries its achievements in terms of five  capability areas: (1) deployability and mobility; (2) sustainability and  logistics; (3) consultations, command, and control; (4) effective  engagement; and (5) survivability of forces and infrastructure. The report\u2019s  discussion of budgetary issues focused on each of the nine countries\u2019  commitments to defense spending as a percentage of its gross domestic  product, and the defense budget planning systems that each country has  implemented. Discussion of information security and legal issues focused  on the extent to which each country had met or achieved NATO  requirements. For information security, the report assessed the extent to  which each of the nine countries had implemented NATO requirements for  personnel screening and the handling and storage of classified documents.  Regarding legal issues, the report assessed whether a country\u2019s  constitution and/or laws provided any barriers to the deployment of the  country\u2019s troops abroad, or the hosting of foreign troops in-country, in  support of NATO operations. In the economic area, the report discussed  the status of each country\u2019s economy.", "Although the information provided in the report regarding the  implementation of democratic principles and reforms was accurate and  current, the discussion was limited. The report did not fully delineate the  challenges facing the nine countries seeking membership or what they have  been doing to address those challenges. The political goals addressed in  NATO\u2019s Membership Action Plan cover a broad spectrum, ranging from the  implementation of democratic institutions, free and fair elections, the rule  of law, judicial independence, and civil liberties to peaceful relations with  bordering countries, peaceful settlement of international disputes, and  protection of human rights and minority rights. However, the report\u2019s  discussion of the challenges facing the nine countries in such areas as civil  liberties, judicial independence, human rights, and minority rights\u2014as well  as government efforts to address those challenges\u2014was either limited or  absent.", "The nine countries seeking membership in NATO have been transitioning  over the past decade from state-controlled communist systems to  democracies and market-based economies. The political goals of the  Membership Action Plan represent some of the key values of the alliance.  Further, these countries have been pursuing the goals set forth in NATO\u2019s  Membership Action Plan by enacting new legislation, amending existing  laws, and developing new programs to address many of these goals,  especially within the past 2 years. Because of these considerations, we  have provided additional information on countries\u2019 implementation of  democratic principles and reforms in appendix II to help Congress in its  deliberations on NATO enlargement. We also provide the results of several  independent analyses of countries\u2019 progress toward implementing  democracy and open economies in appendixes III and IV, which we believe  will be useful in assessing countries\u2019 eligibility for NATO membership."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "As a Preliminary Assessment, Cost Estimates Were Reasonable", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s report responded to the requirements for estimates of  potential impacts of new members on both NATO and U.S. costs. The  methodology in the President\u2019s report for estimating potential cost impacts,  while preliminary, was reasonable. Changes in some factors in the  methodology for estimating the impact on NATO\u2019s shared costs could  change the resulting estimates. We have not included the actual cost  estimates in this report because those figures are classified in the  President\u2019s report.", "The report\u2019s methodology for estimating the impact on NATO\u2019s shared  costs, in particular, was a reasonable approach for a preliminary estimate.  The report based its assessment on a 1997 NATO methodology to  determine the impact of adding three new members\u2014Poland, Hungary, and  the Czech Republic\u2014on NATO\u2019s commonly funded budgets. In prior work,  we determined that approach was reasonable for the 1997 analysis.", "In applying that methodology to the current analysis, the report used the  same determination of NATO\u2019s military requirements applied to the 1997  analysis. Those military requirements fall into four categories: (1)  command and control, which reflects an extension of NATO\u2019s  communications links to the new members; (2) air defense, which reflects  the integration of new members into NATO\u2019s air defense systems; (3)  reinforcement reception facilities, which reflect upgrades to infrastructure,  particularly airfields, to receive NATO forces; and (4) training and  exercises. According to a U.S. Department of Defense official, NATO will  not determine specific military requirements for the 2002 round of  enlargement until it offers invitations to individual countries. Without  specific information on future NATO military requirements, it was  reasonable to base a cost estimate on NATO\u2019s previous assumptions  regarding its military requirements. Estimates were provided for each  country in each of those categories of military requirements. In applying  the 1997 methodology, the report also used the 1997 NATO cost estimates  for the types of projects needed to meet those military requirements.", "According to the U.S. Department of Defense analysts who performed the  analysis, the report updated the 1997 NATO methodology by assessing what  the current list of countries seeking NATO membership might need in  terms of NATO military funding for projects to meet NATO military  requirements. Assessments of what military upgrades each of these  countries would need were based on NATO and U.S. Department of  Defense reports and analyses that had determined that seven of the nine  countries had already met some of the requirements for air defense  capabilities. The report then adjusted the costs applied in the 1997 analysis  to reflect U.S. dollars in 2002. We found these adjustments to be generally  reasonable for a preliminary estimate. Once NATO has decided which  countries to invite into the alliance, however, NATO plans to analyze the  cost impacts on the basis of detailed country-specific assessments of each  country\u2019s current infrastructure conditions and the upgrades needed to  meet NATO military requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The President\u2019s report responded to the Senate\u2019s requirements.
