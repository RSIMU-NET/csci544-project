Even so, problems with current management information systems make it impossible to determine the extent to which allegations of taxpayer abuse and other taxpayer complaints have been reported, or the extent to which actions have been taken to address the complaints and prevent recurrence of systemic problems. That is because, as we reported to you in 1996, information systems currently maintained by IRS, Treasury OIG, and the Department of Justice do not capture the necessary management information.

While each system has data elements that could reflect how some taxpayers have been treated, the data elements vary and in certain cases may relate to the same allegation and same IRS employee.

This is not a new issue. During the debate preceding the passage of the 1988 amendments to the Inspectors General Act that established the Treasury OIG and left IRS Inspection intact, as well as on several other occasions since, concerns have been raised about the desirability of having a separate IRS Inspection Service.", "Historically, we have supported a strong statutory Treasury OIG, believing that such an office could provide independent oversight of the Department, including IRS. That is, reviews of IRS addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury, rather than the IRS Commissioner, should improve executive branch oversight of tax administration in general and provide greater assurance that taxpayers are treated properly, fairly, and courteously. We have also noted that under the statute, Treasury OIG is authorized to enhance the protection of taxpayer rights by conducting periodic independent reviews of IRS dealings with taxpayers and IRS procedures affecting taxpayers.", "We have also recognized that, to meet his managerial responsibilities, the IRS Commissioner needs an internal capability to review the effectiveness of IRS programs. IRS Inspection has provided Commissioners with investigative and audit capabilities to evaluate IRS programs since 1952. IRS Inspection currently has roughly 1,200 authorized staff in its budget who are split about equally between its two divisions, Internal Security and Internal Audit.", "The Treasury OIG, on the other hand, has fewer than 300 authorized staff to provide oversight of IRS Inspection activities as well as to carry out similar investigations and audits for Treasury and its 10 other very diverse bureaus.

No matter where IRS Inspection is placed organizationally, certain mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that it is held accountable and can achieve its mission without undue pressures or influence.
