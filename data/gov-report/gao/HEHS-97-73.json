From fiscal year 1984 to 1995, the foster care population rose from an estimated 276,000 children to 494,000. In 1995, states received more than $2.8 billion in federal assistance for approximately half of these 494,000 children in foster care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2001, federal costs will rise to $4.8 billion with caseloads of federally assisted foster care children increasing by almost 26 percent. Longer stays in foster care have contributed to these rising costs. Many of these children are among the nation\u2019s most at risk for future problems, having suffered the effects of both physical and emotional abuse, and poverty.", "The continued growth in the foster care caseload and its associated costs, as well as the likely adverse effects of long stays in foster care on children, increase the importance of quickly finding permanent placements for children. These placements can range from reuniting children with their parents, to finding adoptive homes and, in increasing numbers, to placing foster children with relatives. Yet navigating the child welfare system in pursuit of permanent homes for these children can be a daunting task. State child welfare agencies\u2014working with many players that include the courts and public and private service providers\u2014guide a child through temporary or shelter placements, multiple court hearings, and, as often happens, more than one foster family placement. This circuitous and burdensome route to a permanent placement can often take years, cost thousands of dollars for each child, and have serious emotional consequences for the children.", "The federal government plays an important role in financing foster care and establishes minimum procedural requirements for the placement process. The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980  (P.L. 96-272) requires that states conduct a permanency hearing within 18 months after a child enters foster care to determine the future status of the child. If a final decision is not made, then additional hearings must be held at least every 12 months. During this time, to be eligible for federal foster care funds, states are required to facilitate the reunification of parent and child or, if those efforts fail, begin the process of terminating parental rights or finding a long-term foster care placement.", "Because of your concerns about the length of the permanency planning process and your interest in improving foster care, you asked us for information about state efforts to hasten the process and ultimately reduce the time a child spends in foster care. More specifically, you asked us to determine (1) what statutory and policy changes states have made to limit the time allowed to determine permanent placements for foster children, (2) what changes states or localities have made in their operations in an attempt to achieve more timely permanent placements and what the impact of those changes has been, and (3) what factors officials believe helped them meet the challenges of achieving more timely permanent placements.", "In conducting this work, we collected and summarized state statutory and policy changes that limited the time allowed for permanent placement hearings. We also interviewed officials and collected program information from six states\u2014Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee\u2014on initiatives that had been implemented between 1987 and 1992 and were expected to achieve more timely permanent placements for foster children. A complete discussion of our scope and methodology appears in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["State child welfare systems consist of a complicated network of policies and programs designed to protect children. Today, these systems must respond to growing numbers of children from families with serious and multiple problems. Many of these families also need intensive and long-term interventions to address these problems. With growing caseloads over the past decade, the systems\u2019 ability to keep pace with the needs of troubled children and their families has been greatly taxed. In addition, the continued growth in caseloads expected over the next few years will give child welfare agencies little relief.", "When parents or guardians are unable to care for their children, state child welfare agencies face the difficult task of providing temporary placements for children while simultaneously working with a wide array of public and private service providers, as well as the courts, to determine the best long-term placement option. The permanency planning process is guided by federal statute and typically occurs in stages requiring considerable time. Finding an appropriate placement solution is extremely difficult because it often involves numerous steps and many different players.", "In each case, states must make reasonable efforts to prevent the placement of a child in foster care. If the child must be removed from the home, states are required under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act to take appropriate steps to make the child\u2019s safe return home possible. Once removed, if reunification with the parents cannot be accomplished quickly, a child will be placed in temporary foster care while state child welfare agencies and community service providers continue to work with the parents in hope of reunification. To be eligible for federal funding, the state must demonstrate to the appropriate court that it has made reasonable efforts to prevent out-of-home placement and to reunify the family. Federal law further requires that placement be as close as possible to the parent\u2019s home in the most family-like setting possible.", "To guide the permanency planning process by which a state is to find permanent placements for foster care children, the act also requires that the state develop a case plan for each child within 60 days of the time the state agency begins providing services to the child. This plan must describe services to be provided to aid the family and must outline actions that will be expected of various agencies and family members to make reunification possible. States are then required to hold reviews every 6 months before a court or administrative panel to evaluate progress made toward reaching a permanency goal. If progress toward reunification cannot be made, state agencies often face the arduous task of either preparing a case for the termination of parental rights or finding a long-term foster care placement. The federal requirement of conducting a permanency hearing within 18 months serves to ensure that child welfare agencies focus on determining a permanent placement, including return to the family or adoption, in a timely manner rather than continuing a child in foster care.", "For abused and neglected children, living with their parents may be unsafe. Yet foster care is not an optimal situation, especially not as a permanent solution. State child welfare agencies and the courts are confronted with the dilemma of whether to reunite families as quickly as possible or keep the children in foster care with the expectation of future reunification. They must also determine at what point to abandon hope of reunification, terminate the parents\u2019 rights, and initiate a search for an adoptive home or other permanent placement for the child. If children are reunited with their families too quickly, they may return to foster care because the home environment may still be unstable. On the other hand, when children remain in foster care too long, it is difficult to reestablish emotional ties with their families. Furthermore, the chances for adoption can be reduced because the child is older than the most desirable adoption age or has developed behavioral problems.", "Determining an appropriate placement option for children quickly is of twofold importance. First, finding permanent placements for children removed from their families is critical to ensure their overall well-being. Children without permanent homes and stable caregivers may be more likely to develop emotional, intellectual, and behavioral problems. A second reason for placing children more quickly is the financial costs of children remaining in foster care. The federal share of the average monthly maintenance payment for title IV-E was $574 in 1996. While some options for permanent placements, such as providing long-term support to a relative to care for a child, may not realize cost savings, other options, such as adoption, will reduce foster care costs. Title IV-E payments, between fiscal years 1984 and 1996, increased from $435.7 million to an estimated $3.1 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory and Policy Changes Require States to Hold First Permanency Hearing Sooner", "paragraphs": ["The prolonged stays of children in foster care have prompted states to enact laws or policies to shorten to less than the federally allowed 18 months the time between entry into foster care and the first permanency hearing at which permanent placement is considered. As shown in figure 1, 23 states have enacted such laws, with a majority of these requiring the hearing to be held within 12 months. In two states, the shorter time frame applies only to younger children. Colorado requires the permanency hearing be held within 6 months for children under 6, and Washington requires the hearing to be held within 12 months for children 10 years old or younger. An additional three states, while not enacting such statutes, have policies requiring permanency hearings earlier than 18 months. For a description of the 26 state statutes, policies, and time requirements, see appendix II. The remaining 24 states and the District of Columbia have statutes consistent with the federal requirement of 18 months.", "The state laws, like federal law, do not require that a final decision be made at the first hearing. Ohio and Minnesota, however, do require that a permanency decision be determined after a limited extension period. Ohio, for example, requires a permanency hearing to be held within 12 months, with a maximum of two 6-month extensions. At the end of that time, a permanent placement decision must be made. According to officials in Ohio\u2019s Office of Child Care and Family Services, this requirement was included in an effort to expedite the permanency planning process and reduce the time children spend in foster care. However, state officials also believed that this requirement may have had the unintended result of increasing the number of children placed in long-term foster care because other placement options could not be developed. State data, in part, confirmed this observation. While long-term foster care placements for children supported with state-only funds dropped from 1,301 in 1990 to 779 in 1995, long-term placements for children supported with federal funds rose from 1,657 to 2,057 for the same period. The reasons for the difference between these two groups are unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Make Changes in Permanency Planning Process With Some Positive Results for Foster Care Children", "paragraphs": ["Although the states we reviewed did not systematically evaluate the impact of their initiatives, they implemented a variety of operational and procedural changes to expedite and improve the permanency process. Other efforts made changes to the operation of the courts and the use of resources available to them for making permanency decisions. These states reported that these actions have improved the lives of some children by (1) reuniting them with their families more quickly, (2) expediting the termination of parental rights when reunification efforts were determined to be unfeasible\u2014thus making it possible for child welfare agencies to begin looking for an adoptive home sooner\u2014or (3) reducing the number of different foster care placements in which they lived.

For example, Arizona\u2019s Housing Assistance Program focused on families where children had been removed and placed in state custody and the major barrier to reunification was inadequate housing for the family. In 1989, the state enacted a bill authorizing the use of state foster care funds to provide special housing assistance. According to state reports summarizing the program and statistics provided by Arizona Department of Economic Security officials, between 1991 and 1995, 939 children were reunited with their families as a result of this program, representing almost 12 percent of those children reunified during this period. This program saved the state over $1 million in foster care-related costs between 1991 and 1995.", "Also, Tennessee\u2019s Wraparound Funding Program allowed caseworkers to use state funds to provide services that removed economic barriers to reunification. These services were not typically associated with traditional reunification services and prior to this program were not allowable foster care expenditures. Examples include home or car repairs, utilities or rent payments, and respite care. According to a report summarizing the program, during one 6-month period in 1995, the program provided services to 1,279 children. A state Department of Children\u2019s Services official estimated that had these children remained in care as long as the average child in foster care, the state would have incurred an additional $700,000 in state and federal foster care maintenance payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Streamline Termination Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Regarding other changes, Arizona and Kentucky placed special emphasis on expediting the process by which parental rights could be terminated. Arizona\u2019s Severance Project focused on cases where termination of parental rights was likely or reunification services were not warranted and for which a backlog of cases had developed. In April 1986, the state enacted a bill providing funds for hiring severance specialists and legal staff to work on termination cases. The following year, in 1987, the state implemented the Arizona State Adoption Project. This project focused on identifying additional adoptive homes, including recruiting adoptive parents for specific children and contracting for adoptive home recruitment activities. State officials reported that the Adoption Project resulted in a 54-percent increase in the number of new homes added to the state registry in late 1987 and 1988. In addition, they noted that the Severance Project contributed to a more than 32-percent reduction in the average length of stay between entry into care and the filing of the termination petition for fiscal years 1991 through 1995.", "To reduce a backlog of pending cases, Kentucky\u2019s Termination of Parental Rights Project focused on reducing the time required to terminate parental rights once this permanency goal was established. This effort included retraining caseworkers, lawyers, and judges on the consequences of long stays in foster care and streamlining and improving the steps caseworkers must follow when collecting and documenting the information required for the termination procedures. A report on this effort indicated that between 1989 and 1991, the state decreased the average time to terminate parental rights by slightly over 1 year. In addition, between 1988 and 1990, the average length of stay for children in foster care decreased from 2.8 years to 2 years, and the number of different foster care placements for each child decreased from four to three.

The goal was to obtain permanency for the child by either (1) strengthening the family and reducing the risks in the home so that the child can be reunified with his or her family; or (2) verifying that the family cannot protect the child, meet the child\u2019s needs, or reduce the risks to the child in a timely manner and that termination of parental rights should be pursued. By working on the two plans simultaneously, caseworkers reduced the time required to prepare the necessary paperwork to terminate parental rights if reunification efforts failed.", "Under a concurrent planning approach, caseworkers emphasize to the parents that if they do not adhere to the requirements set forth in their case plan, parental rights can be terminated. Since this program was initiated in 1991, state officials report that 70 percent of the children in the program obtained permanency, primarily through reunification, within 12 months of placement in foster care. Without this program the children would have stayed in foster care longer than 12 months.

The state reported that between 1994 and 1996, the review panels recommended that 5,855 children be placed for adoption, 10,845 children be reunified with their families, and 3,048 children remain in foster care.", "In Hamilton County, Ohio, juvenile court officials focused attention on the court\u2019s involvement in achieving permanency more quickly by developing new procedures to expedite case processing. In 1985, they revised court procedures by (1) designating lawyers specially trained in foster care issues as magistrates to hear cases, (2) assigning one magistrate to each case for the life of that case to achieve continuity and consistent rulings, and (3) agreeing at the end of every hearing\u2014while all participants are present\u2014to the date for the next hearing. According to court officials, the county saved thousands of dollars because it could operate three magistrates\u2019 courtrooms for the cost of one judge\u2019s courtroom. Also, a report on court activities indicated that because of these changes, between 1986 and 1990, the number of children placed in four or more different foster care placements decreased by 11 percent and the percentage of children leaving temporary and long-term foster care in 2 years or less increased from 37 percent to 75 percent.", "Even where improvements have been made, there can still be problems that are beyond the control of officials.

Second, the state had settled a suit brought by the Kansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union citing unacceptable increases in the number of children in foster care and lengthy stays in care. The goal of privatization is to allow children in out-of-home placements to experience a minimal number of placements or to achieve permanency in their lives in the shortest time possible.", "Kansas contracted with private social services agencies for family preservation services, foster and residential care, and adoption services.

Some experts believe that current child welfare practices often discourage caseworkers from finding permanent placements other than with the biological parents. Officials in the states we reviewed recognized that addressing these challenges required concerted time and effort, coordination, and resources. These officials identified several critical, often interrelated, factors required to meet these challenges. These included (1) long-term involvement of officials in leadership positions; (2) involvement of key stakeholders in developing consensus and obtaining buy-in concerning the nature of the problem and the solution; and (3) the availability of resources to plan, implement, and sustain the project.

In addition, we discussed permanency planning and permanent placement decisions with experts in the field, including child welfare officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In the course of our discussions with state officials and experts, we identified specific state and local initiatives that were attempting to permanently place foster care children in a more timely manner.", "We selected six states that had implemented initiatives that addressed making more timely permanent placements for children in foster care. The states were Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. Each state selected had at least one initiative that was implemented between 1989 and 1992, ensuring that we would be able to obtain historical information about the planning and implementation of those initiatives and that the initiatives had been in place long enough to have some impact. We included states that had initiatives that addressed different aspects of the permanency process. We also included states with statutory requirements for holding the first permanency hearing that were stricter than the federal requirement as well as states with requirements that were consistent with the federal requirement.", "We conducted site visits in four of the six states\u2014Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee\u2014and obtained information from Arizona and Ohio through telephone interviews. We interviewed state and county foster care and adoption officials and juvenile court officials and collected information on the initiatives, including descriptions of program goals and objectives and factors that facilitated change, reports on program results, and other statistical information on the foster care population. We did not verify program data from these states.", "We did our work between January 1996 and January 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States That Require a Permanency Hearing Earlier Than the Federal Requirement of 18 Months, as of December 31, 1996", "paragraphs": ["Ariz.
