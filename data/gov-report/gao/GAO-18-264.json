Accordingly, GAO reviewed agencies' data center closures to date and plans for further closures; evaluated agencies' progress in achieving consolidation savings and described their plans for future savings; and assessed agencies' progress against OMB's data center optimization targets. To do so, GAO assessed the 24 DCOI agencies' data center inventories as of August 2017; reviewed their reported cost savings documentation; evaluated their data center optimization strategic plans; and assessed 22 agencies' progress against OMB's established optimization targets.

This total is approximately $1.12 billion less than OMB's DCOI savings goal of $2.7 billion (see figure).

For example, in 2007, the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that the electricity  costs to operate federal servers and data centers across the government  were about $450 million annually. According to the Department of Energy  (Energy), a typical data center has 100 to 200 times the energy use  intensity of a commercial building. In 2009, OMB reported that server  utilization rates as low as 5 percent across the federal government\u2019s  estimated 150,000 servers were a factor driving the need to establish a  coordinated, government-wide effort to improve the efficiency,  performance, and environmental footprint of federal data center  activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB and the Federal CIO Established FDCCI", "paragraphs": ["Concerned about the size of the federal data center inventory and the  potential to improve the efficiency, performance, and the environmental  footprint of federal data center activities, OMB\u2019s Federal CIO established  FDCCI in February 2010.

In  October 2010, OMB also clarified the definition of a data center and noted  that, for the purposes of FDCCI, a data center was to be defined as any  room used for the purpose of processing or storing data that is larger than  500 square feet and meets stringent availability requirements. Under this  definition, OMB reported that agencies had identified 2,094 data centers  as of July 2010.", "However, in 2011, the Federal CIO expanded the definition to include a  facility of any size and OMB published its revised definition in March  2012. Based on the revised definition, OMB estimated that there were a  total of 3,133 federal data centers in December 2011. In addition, its goal  was to consolidate approximately 40 percent, or 1,253 of these data  centers, for a savings of approximately $3 billion by the end of 2015.

This reduction in planned savings was the result of eight agencies  reporting less in planned cost savings and avoidances in their DCOI  strategic plans compared to the savings amounts previously reported to  us in November 2015.

However, the officials also said that the agency  is exploring ways to replace the server closets using cloud services.", "Several agencies that viewed their goals as unattainable indicated that  they were seeking revised closure goals. Specifically, officials from  Interior\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer stated that a number of  the department\u2019s non-tiered data centers were either mission critical or  not cost effective to close. Thus, the officials said Interior was working  with OMB to establish a revised closure goal. Similarly, Transportation\u2019s  Director for IT Compliance stated that the department was working with  OMB to establish a revised closure goal. The department reported having  186 tiered data centers in Federal Aviation Administration control towers  that it believes should be excluded from its count of data centers when  OMB sets the department\u2019s goal for closures.", "Further, our analysis determined that it may not always be realistic for an  agency to meet OMB\u2019s targets. For example, NSF, which does not have  any tiered data centers, reported that it plans to close one (50 percent) of  its two non-tiered data centers. However, the only way to meet OMB\u2019s 60  percent threshold would be for the agency to close both of its non-tiered  centers, which may not be an option, depending on the services provided  by that one remaining center.", "Although OMB\u2019s stated time frame for closing data centers currently  remains as the end of fiscal year 2018, the recent extension of FITARA\u2019s  data center consolidation and optimization provisions through fiscal year  2020 provides agencies additional time to work toward meeting OMB\u2019s  closure targets. However, in some cases, these efforts may require  significant restructuring of an agency\u2019s business operations, or, as  reported by several agencies, a revision of OMB\u2019s goals in consideration  of the agencies\u2019 specific needs.", "Given that agencies had been working toward OMB\u2019s DCOI goals for  approximately one year as of August 2017, and because the extension of  FITARA\u2019s data center provisions pushes the sunset for these efforts out  through fiscal year 2020, we are not making any related  recommendations to those agencies that have not met the closure goals  at this time.

This guidance stated that  agency strategic plans were also to include year-by-year calculations of  target and actual agency-wide spending and cost savings on data centers  from fiscal years 2016 through 2018.
