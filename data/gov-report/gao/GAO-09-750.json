The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations directed GAO to assess and report on the impact of BRAC-related growth on transportation systems and on the responses of federal, state, and local governments. Accordingly, GAO determined the (1) expected impact on transportation in communities affected by BRAC decisions, and (2) federal, state, and local response to the expected impacts. To perform its work, GAO obtained information from the 18 communities with expected substantial BRAC growth; visited 8 of these communities; interviewed federal civilian and military officials and state and local officials; and reviewed DOD data, transportation plans, and environmental studies.

In addition to BRAC, other defense initiatives will result in growth in communities and also add to transportation needs. BRAC growth will result in increased traffic in communities ranging from very large metropolitan areas to small communities, creating or worsening congested roads at specific locations. Traffic impacts can also affect larger relocation decisions, and were important in DOD's decision to acquire an additional site for Fort Belvoir, Virginia, an acquisition that DOD estimates will cost $1.2 billion. According to a DOD Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) survey, 17 of 18 BRAC growth communities identified transportation as one of their top challenges. Near-term transportation projects to address these challenges could cost about $2.0 billion, of which about $1.1 billion is related to projects in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. BRAC-related transportation infrastructure costs are subject to a number of uncertainties. For example, not all potential projects are included in the estimate, military staffing levels at some growth installations are in flux and the location decisions of military and civilian personnel have not yet been made, and pre-existing, non-military community growth makes a direct link between transportation projects to military growth difficult. The federal government has provided limited direct assistance to help communities address BRAC transportation impacts, and state and local governments have adopted strategies to expedite projects within the time frame allowed by BRAC. For example, DOD's Defense Access Roads Program has certified transportation projects for funding at three affected communities. Also, OEA has provided planning grants and funded traffic studies and local planning positions. While federal highway and transit programs can be used for many BRAC-related transportation needs, dedicated funds are not available. Instead, BRAC-related transportation projects must compete with other proposed transportation projects. Communities had identified funding for about $500 million of the estimated $2.0 billion needed to address their near term project needs. Some state and local governments have adopted strategies to expedite highway projects, such as prioritizing short-term high-impact projects, because the time frames for completing BRAC personnel moves are much shorter than the time frames for such projects. While legislation mandates that BRAC growth be completed by 2011, major highway and transit projects usually take 9 to 19 years. To complete some critical projects before BRAC growth occurs, state and local officials are reprioritizing planned projects and implementing those that can be completed quickly. For example, Maryland prioritized certain lower-cost intersection projects that will improve traffic flow. In Texas, officials used an innovative financing approach to generate funding quickly for a major highway project at Fort Bliss."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As part of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, the  Department of Defense (DOD) plans to relocate over 123,000 DOD military  and civilian personnel, thereby increasing the staffing at numerous bases  nationwide.

Second, the Army\u2019s force modularity effort will  restructure the Army from a division-based force to a more readily  deployable modular, brigade-based force. Some of these brigade units will  relocate to other existing bases. A third initiative, Grow the Force, is not a  reorganization but will increase the permanent strength of the military to  enhance overall U.S. forces. This initiative will add about 74,000 soldiers  and about 27,000 marines. Finally, troop drawdowns from Iraq could  increase personnel numbers at some BRAC-affected bases. These other  military initiatives will also be implemented over a longer time frame than  BRAC decisions, which are scheduled to be completed in 2011.", "Though not a major force initiative, DOD\u2019s enhanced use lease (EUL)  activities will also affect growth and development in military communities.  EULs allow the military to lease its land to private developers to build  offices and other facilities that generate operating income for the military.  In some cases, the growth from EUL activities may exceed the BRAC- related growth. For example, the EUL at Fort Meade, which is planned to  include up to 2 million square feet of office space, could house up to  10,000 new workers by 2013. This EUL activity will generate more new  jobs in the Fort Meade area than the 6,600 additional military and civilian  DOD personnel attributable to BRAC.", "Because all these initiatives are taking place at the same time, the forces  driving growth at military bases and the surrounding communities are  more complex than they would be if they were the result of BRAC  decisions alone.

At two bases, Fort Bliss and Fort Belvoir,  DOD has estimated that the on-base populations alone will more than  double. In addition, defense-related contractors who follow and settle near  the relocated commands will compound the growth and traffic near some  bases, and the impact of these contractor relocations is not reflected in the  military growth figures.

It is also located across from the National Institutes  of Health, where over 18,000 personnel are employed. According to  Maryland transportation planners, the additional traffic resulting from the  BRAC action will lead to further deterioration of traffic conditions in the  area. Specifically, without intersection improvements, the number of  intersections with failing conditions is projected to increase from three to  five. In addition, traffic conditions may deteriorate at 10 other  intersections, but not to the point of failure. Traffic analyses done for DOD  as part of an environmental impact statement (EIS) reviewed 27 major  intersections in the vicinity and estimated that with no improvements, the  increases in traffic would result in failing or deteriorating service levels at  15 of those intersections during peak periods, compared with current  conditions.

Local planners anticipate additional BRAC-related  congestion on a number of other nearby Interstate, federal, and local  highways (I-395, I-495, U.S. Route 1, and the Fairfax County Parkway). The  physical layout of Fort Belvoir also complicates commuter access, in that  the base is situated on two major land parcels\u2014the main post and the  Engineer Proving Ground\u2014separated by a busy highway (see fig. 2).
