One  difference between the agricultural credit needs of tribal members and  other producers is that tribal members may have a greater unmet need  for long-term loans, which are typically secured by real estate, because of  difficulties in using tribal lands as collateral, as discussed later in this  report.", "Credit needs vary based on the type of operation or borrower.", "Type of operation. Some tribal stakeholders we interviewed told us  that members of their tribes were more likely to participate in ranching  than farming, partly because farming has higher start-up costs. For  example, one tribal agricultural expert told us a rancher can start with  a few head of cattle and grow the herd over time, but a beginning  farmer may need to purchase equipment. Additionally, several tribal  stakeholders told us that land on their reservations was more suitable  for ranching than farming.", "Type of borrower. Some tribes have agricultural businesses, which  have credit needs different from those of individual tribal members,  according to experts and BIA officials we interviewed. For example,  they may be greater or more complex. According to an expert and a  tribal stakeholder, established agricultural businesses likely would be  able to receive credit from commercial lenders because they have  more resources to pledge as collateral or stronger credit histories.  Additionally, if a tribe has other profitable businesses, it likely will have  less difficulty obtaining credit or financing agriculture with those other  resources than those without such resources.", "According to tribal stakeholders, experts, and BIA officials we interviewed,  tribal members who obtain agricultural credit likely receive it from USDA\u2019s  Farm Service Agency, other USDA programs, or Native CDFIs. Some  tribal members receive agricultural credit from local private lenders, but  they are typically larger, more established borrowers. One expert told us  that tribal members who are smaller or beginning agricultural producers  and cannot access commercial banks instead may borrow money from  family members.

A 2014 survey of 41 Native CDFIs\u2014 credit unions, community banks, and loan funds\u2014found more than 40  percent provided credit and training to farmers and ranchers. In total,  these CDFIs made almost $6 million in agricultural loans annually.  However, Native CDFIs are limited in how much agricultural credit they  can provide. In the 2014 survey, 56 percent of the Native CDFIs that  made agricultural loans reported not having enough capital for such  loans, with a total unmet need of at least $3 million in the previous year.  One Native CDFI we interviewed said its agricultural loans averaged  about $100,000 per borrower, and another said its operating loans were  about $50,000\u2013$75,000 and its intermediate-term loans about $100,000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders See Potential for Growth of Agricultural Activity on Tribal Lands That Could Require Access to Credit", "paragraphs": ["Selected literature we reviewed and interviews with some tribal  stakeholders found that tribes have a growing interest in agriculture,  motivated by concerns over tribal members\u2019 access to food, health, and  employment opportunities.", "Food access.

Additionally, the  agricultural products grown on tribal lands typically do not feed tribal  members and instead are sold into the general agriculture commodity  system.", "Furthermore, these reports and experts we interviewed noted that the  growth of agriculture on tribal lands could require access to credit. For  example, one tribal agriculture expert told us some tribes are interested in  transitioning to \u201cvalue-added\u201d agriculture, which aims to help the  community that produces raw agricultural materials capture the value of  the products as they progress through the food supply chain (for example,  by processing crops they grow or transitioning to more profitable  products, such as organic). Value-added agriculture initiatives might  require building facilities or acquiring more expensive inputs, and tribes  likely would need financing to support these initiatives.

As a result, there is limited  commercial lending on tribal lands."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Land Tenure Issues May Present Hurdles to Obtaining Agricultural Credit", "paragraphs": ["Ten tribal stakeholders and experts we interviewed cited difficulties in  using tribal lands as collateral as a barrier to obtaining credit because of  federal laws or other constraints.", "Tribal trust and restricted fee lands. Federal law generally prohibits  lenders from obtaining an ownership interest in tribal trust and  restricted fee lands. As a result, tribes are not able to use their 46  million acres of tribal trust or restricted fee lands as collateral for a  loan. However, tribes can lease such lands to other parties, including  a tribal business or tribal member who wishes to use the land for  agricultural purposes (lessees). These lessees can then pledge their  \u201cleasehold interest\u201d in the lands as collateral for a loan, but may face  challenges in doing so. For example, in general, leases of tribal trust  and restricted fee lands must be approved by BIA and comply with its  leasing regulations, which stipulate that agricultural leases generally  have a maximum term of 10 years. While BIA generally allows  leased tribal trust and restricted fee lands to be subject to a leasehold  mortgage, three tribal stakeholders and experts we interviewed said  that BIA\u2019s maximum term for agricultural leases often was insufficient  for obtaining an agricultural loan.", "Individual trust and restricted fee lands. Unlike tribal trust and  restricted fee lands, the owners of individual trust and restricted fee  lands can use these lands as collateral for a loan with permission of  the Secretary of the Interior. However, many tracts of individual trust  and restricted fee lands are allotments with fractionated ownership.  According to nine tribal stakeholders and experts we interviewed,  fractionated land is a barrier to agricultural activity and obtaining  credit. Fractionated land occurs when an allottee dies without a will  and ownership is divided among all the heirs, but the land is not  physically divided. Thus, multiple owners (in some cases thousands)  can have an ownership interest in the land and may have different  ideas about how the land should be used. Interior estimated that out  of the 92,000 fractionated tracts (representing more than 10 million  acres), more than half generated no income in 2006\u20132011. For  agricultural leases and leasehold mortgages on fractionated lands,  BIA regulations require consent from owners of a majority interest in  such lands. However, according to Interior, some allotments have  thousands of co-owners, some of whose whereabouts are unknown,  which could make it difficult to obtain their permission for an  agricultural lease or a leasehold mortgage.", "Additionally, as a result of allotment, many Indian reservations contain  different land ownership types, creating a \u201ccheckerboard\u201d pattern of lands  that can make the establishment and financing of large-scale agricultural  projects difficult. For example, in addition to tribal and individual trust and  restricted fee lands, reservations also may include lands that passed out  of trust during the allotment period and were bought by non-Indians.  Thus, multiple tracts within a large-scale agricultural project may need to  be leased and financed separately because they have different owners  and may be subject to different laws. This can also make legal jurisdiction  unclear, which is a concern for private lenders financing projects on such  lands, as discussed below.", "Experts and tribal stakeholders we interviewed reported that the barriers  to collateralizing various types of tribal lands make it difficult for tribes and  tribal members to access different types of agricultural loans. Most long- term loans\u2014typically used for larger projects\u2014generally need to be  secured by real estate, which make these inaccessible to tribes and tribal  members who do not have land that can be encumbered. For example,  an Indian agricultural producer who operates on trust land and wants to  build an agricultural facility for a value-added operation may not be able  to obtain a long-term loan unless he or she has other unrestricted land to  pledge as collateral. In addition, according to the former Executive  Director of the Intertribal Agriculture Council, when most agricultural  producers face economic distress, they can pledge land as security and  receive an extended period of time (20\u201340 years) to pay off the debt.  Tribal members may not have that option, making it difficult to obtain  credit in an emergency (such as adverse weather). In addition, according  to a tribal agriculture expert and three tribal stakeholders, tribal trust land  is not counted as an asset on balance sheets, which may affect an  agricultural lender\u2019s assessment of a borrower\u2019s creditworthiness for  various types of loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administrative Process Delays May Deter Lenders and Borrowers", "paragraphs": ["Processes at Interior\u2014particularly at BIA\u2014can increase the amount of  time it takes to obtain a loan, which can discourage both lenders and  borrowers, according to tribal stakeholders and experts. Most of the tribal  stakeholders and experts we interviewed told us that tribal members often  encounter delays when seeking necessary documentation from BIA. For  example, for loans involving trust or restricted fee lands, BIA needs to  provide a title status report to the lender that identifies the type of land  ownership and current owners. Two tribal stakeholders told us that BIA  takes months to produce a certified title status report. By that time, the  growing season could be over. A representative from a Native CDFI  serving a tribe in the Great Plains said it can take years to receive these  reports. BIA reported that in fiscal year 2017, it certified 95 percent of land  titles within 48 hours. However, BIA\u2019s performance on this measure has  varied considerably over the last several years, and BIA officials told us  that it can take significantly longer to process title status reports for  complicated cases.", "Tribal members also can encounter administrative challenges at other  points in the process. One Native CDFI representative told us she found  out that BIA did not record a leasehold mortgage when the CDFI  attempted to foreclose on the loan, which almost prevented the CDFI  from recovering the loan collateral. In other cases, Interior\u2019s Appraisal and  Valuation Services Office might need to conduct an appraisal, such as for  an agricultural lease.

Seven  of the 11 FCS associations we contacted told us that they had legal  concerns of this nature, and six of the associations said they had  experienced the issues themselves. These concerns primarily arise from  the following issues:", "Tribal sovereign immunity. Tribes are distinct, independent political  communities with certain inherent powers of self-government and, as  a result of this sovereignty, have immunity from lawsuits. A lender  cannot sue to enforce the terms of a loan agreement with a tribe  unless the tribe waives its sovereign immunity in connection with the  agreement. Private lenders therefore might be hesitant to make a loan  because they would not be able to sue the tribe if any disputes arose.  We previously reported that tribes may waive sovereign immunity in  agreements or contracts on a case-by-case basis and some tribes  have formed separate companies to conduct business that are not  immune from lawsuits. However, tribal government officials may  decide that waiving the tribe\u2019s sovereign immunity for purposes of  enforcing the loan agreement is not in the tribe\u2019s best interest.  Additionally, tribal sovereign immunity would not bar lenders from  seeking to foreclose on loans made to individual tribal members.", "Legal jurisdiction. Loans made to Indian tribes or their members and  secured by tribal lands or collateral located on tribal lands may be  subject to tribal laws, rather than state laws. In addition, it is  sometimes unclear whether federal, state, or tribal courts would have  jurisdiction in the event of a default or foreclosure. If tribal laws govern  but do not adequately provide for the lender\u2019s foreclosure, or if there is  not a legal forum to hear the foreclosure lawsuit, lenders may be  unable to recover the loan collateral. To address these types of  concerns, some tribes have adopted secured transaction codes  modeled after the Uniform Commercial Code, which can help to  assure lenders of their ability to recover collateral in the event of  default.", "Unfamiliarity with tribal laws. Laws and court systems vary among  the nation\u2019s 573 tribes, making it more difficult and costly for lenders  to learn tribal laws.

She noted that when people do not have a bank account, it can be  challenging for them to see themselves as potential borrowers.", "Similarly, our analysis found that the land tenure issues, administrative  process delays, lenders\u2019 legal concerns, and loan readiness issues can  make agricultural loans involving tribal lands more time-consuming and  costly to underwrite. For example, one FCS association told us that loans  involving tribal lands require specialized legal analysis, which may be an  additional expense that it would not incur for otherwise comparable loans.  These same issues can increase a lender\u2019s exposure to the risks inherent  in agricultural lending because they can affect the borrower\u2019s ability to  repay the loan, the adequacy of the collateral to secure the loan, and the  lender\u2019s ability to recover the collateral in the event of a default.

For example, applicants for  agricultural loans must be determined to be eligible borrowers, which  means they must own agricultural land or be engaged in the production of  agricultural products, including aquatic products.", "Also, long-term real estate loans (which have terms of up to 40 years)  made by FCS institutions must be secured by a first-position lien on  interests in real estate, thus enabling FCS to obtain ownership or control  of the land in the event of default. FCA has determined that this  statutory requirement can be satisfied, for example, with leasehold  interests in real estate\u2014such as that held by a tribal member leasing  reservation land from a tribe\u2014provided that the lease grants the borrower  significant rights to the land, and the loan is made on a safe and sound  basis. As noted earlier, BIA regulations often limit agricultural leases of  tribal lands to a term of up to 10 years. In such cases, FCS associations  similarly may limit the term of the related loan (to less than 10 years).  According to FCA, when loans are for shorter terms than the leases, the  FCS association\u2019s first lien is preserved, as required by law, and the loan  is prudent from a safety and soundness perspective.", "FCA has not issued written guidance indicating whether interests in other  types of tribal lands\u2014such as individual trust or restricted fee lands\u2014also  satisfy the requirement for a first-position lien on interests in real estate.  However, FCA has the authority to determine what types of interests in  real estate will satisfy this requirement. Also, according to FCA, there is  no statutory requirement that short- and intermediate-term loans be  secured with interests in real estate; such loans instead can be secured  by other collateral, such as equipment, crops, livestock, and business  revenues.", "In addition to making direct loans to agricultural producers, FCS has  authority to lend to non-FCS institutions, such as commercial banks and  credit unions, which in turn make agricultural loans to FCS-eligible  borrowers. These other financing institutions are known as OFIs.", "According to FCA, the OFI lending authority allows FCS banks to fulfill  their mission as a government-sponsored enterprise by enhancing the  liquidity of OFIs, thereby lowering the cost of agricultural credit. As noted  earlier, FCS is required to establish programs to serve young, beginning,  and small farmers and ranchers, but it is not statutorily mandated to focus  on providing financial opportunities to any other group of eligible  agricultural producers.", "Notwithstanding the authorities described above, FCS must comply with  other applicable laws and requirements. For example, FCS institutions  are subject to safety and soundness oversight by FCA, including with  respect to loan underwriting. FCS institutions also must comply with  applicable federal, state, and tribal laws governing any tribal lands or  property thereon used as loan collateral. FCS associations may obtain  Farm Service Agency guarantees on loans to borrowers who otherwise  may not meet FCS underwriting requirements.

We made the following observations based on the  associations\u2019 responses:", "Limited data on lending amounts. Representatives of 10 of the 11  FCS associations we queried stated that they either do not collect or  do not maintain data on lending to specific racial populations, thus  making it difficult to provide more detailed information on lending to  Indian tribes and their members. However, four representatives  provided estimates of their recent lending to this population on tribal  lands. One association cited more than $25 million in total loans  outstanding to a small number of tribes and tribal entities. Another  association reported making about $5.5 million in new loans to tribes  or their members on tribal lands in the last 2 years. A third reported a  $3 million revolving line of credit to a family farm, and the fourth said it  had made approximately $150,000 in five separate loans to two tribal  members.", "Loan purposes. Seven associations reported on the type of credit  they extended to Indian tribes and their members on tribal lands. In  general, they made short-term operating loans and short- and  intermediate-term loans for the purchase or refinance of items such as  machinery and equipment, livestock, vehicles, or buildings and  improvements. Two associations also reported making long-term real  estate loans. The other association that reported lending to tribes or  their members did not report on the types of loans it made.", "Type of collateral. Representatives of the eight associations that  reported lending to tribes or their members all indicated that the  associations secured loans with personal property, such as crops,  livestock, or equipment. In addition, the associations that reported  making real estate loans said they secured the loans with fee-simple  land.", "Representatives of three FCS associations said they had not loaned to  Indian tribes in the past 2 years. One association had not received any  credit applications from tribal members, and another could not say if it  had served tribal members because of a lack of racial data on  borrowers. The third association had not provided loans to tribal  members in the past 2 years, but the representative stated that it provided  several letters of credit to guarantee the payments of BIA leases on tribal  land.", "Although the FCS associations we contacted stated they have the  resources to lend to tribes and their members on tribal lands, a few key  factors affect their lending decisions. Representatives of all 11 FCS  associations stated their associations had adequate financial capacity  and resources to make potentially more complicated or time-consuming  loans, such as those involving tribal lands. In general, they stated that the  factors they consider in deciding whether to loan to Indian tribes or their  members on tribal lands are the same as for any comparable loan\u2014for  example, creditworthiness, loan purpose, and the ability to secure a lien  on collateral. However, as described earlier, some FCS association  representatives described challenges related to tribal law, jurisdiction,  tribal sovereign immunity, and recovery of collateral as complicating the  lending process to Indian tribes and their members on tribal lands.  Although three of the 11 FCS associations we queried reported making  loans to tribes that had waived their sovereign immunity for those  contracts, most loans the associations reported were to individual tribal  members and secured by personal property or fee-simple land.", "According to two tribal stakeholders we interviewed, Indian tribes or tribal  members who received loans from FCS or other commercial lenders may  have larger agricultural operations, a longer credit history, and property  that can be more easily used as collateral.

One association representative  described the group as sharing examples of lending success or reasons  for missed opportunities; local, regional or national sponsorship  opportunities; local or regional agricultural education events; and relevant  legal proceedings, such as the Keepseagle settlement.", "At the institution level, FCS associations must prepare annual marketing  plans describing, among other things, how they will be responsive to the  credit needs of all eligible and creditworthy agricultural producers in their  respective territories, with a focus on diversity and inclusion. The  marketing plan must detail strategies and actions to market their products  and services to potential borrowers who may not have been considered  previously for reasons other than eligibility or creditworthiness. However,  FCS associations are not required to achieve specific outcomes or  quantifiable results.", "Our nongeneralizable review of the marketing plans of the 11 selected  FCS associations with tribal lands in their territories and our analysis of  their written responses to our queries for additional information found that  outreach to tribes and their members focused on educational and  charitable initiatives and direct marketing about agricultural lending, or did  not directly target tribal populations.", "Seven of the 11 associations discussed actual or planned outreach to  Indian tribes or their members in their marketing plans or written  responses.", "Four of those seven associations cited financial support of specific  agricultural education activities for tribes and their members. Two  associations reported making charitable donations that benefited  tribal members.", "Four of the seven associations reported direct marketing to  potential tribal borrowers. However, in one case, the marketing  was a one-time conversation with a tribe regarding financing for a  new facility. The other three associations reported that they called  potential Indian borrowers, sought referrals from existing tribal  member customers, or conducted meetings with tribal government  officials.", "In general, the four remaining associations, in their marketing plans  and written responses, addressed outreach to minority producers  through broader methods, such as participation in ethnic group  organizations or through inclusion in the association\u2019s overall outreach  and marketing efforts. In addition, five of the 11 associations  discussed outreach to minority producers in conjunction with their  statutorily-mandated outreach to young, beginning, and small farmers.  According to FCA officials, FCA\u2019s guidance on providing credit to  young, beginning, and small farmers, as well as to local food  producers, would be broadly applicable to socially disadvantaged or  minority populations that fall within the program definitions.", "Most of the tribal stakeholders with whom we spoke either were not  familiar with FCS or did not know of the tribe or any of its members  receiving FCS loans. One Native CDFI representative noted that although  he was not familiar with any members of his tribe receiving FCS loans, he  thought other nearby tribes or their members had worked with FCS.", "FCA also encouraged FCS associations to develop underwriting  procedures to facilitate lending on Indian reservations. FCA identified  one FCS association that developed such procedures, and another one of  the associations we queried noted that they had such procedures. The  first association provided an overview of its procedures, which identified  links to information on borrower and collateral eligibility and actions that  require BIA approval, among other topics. According to representatives of  the second association, its procedure manual directs loan officers to treat  tribal members\u2019 applications for loans secured by personal property the  same as any other applications.

Tribal economic development  experts and tribal stakeholders cited the importance of commercial or  government lenders partnering with Native CDFIs and other Indian- owned lenders, which are the most capable of navigating the  challenges related to Indian agricultural credit. According to these  experts and stakeholders, if larger commercial or government lenders  worked with Native CDFIs or other tribal lenders (such as tribal banks  or economic development corporations) to provide funds or conduct  outreach, the tribal organizations could more efficiently reach Indian  tribes and their members. They noted these organizations are familiar  with tribal members and the administrative processes for obtaining  loans on tribal land. Partnership with tribal lenders and other tribal  businesses also could support tribes\u2019 efforts to improve members\u2019  loan readiness, according to literature we reviewed and a tribal  economic development expert and a Native CDFI representative we  interviewed.", "Commercial and government lenders may need to clarify whether  tribal lenders with which they might partner meet their lending  requirements. For example, although FCS banks have authority to  lend to OFIs, which in turn can lend to FCS-eligible borrowers, only  certain types of CDFIs may qualify as OFIs. In addition, this  authority does not extend to long-term funding, and thus cannot be  used to fund agricultural real estate loans made by OFIs. One FCS  bank that commented on a 2004 FCA rule noted the latter statutory  limitation as a major impediment to OFI program expansion.", "Flexibility with collateral requirements. As noted earlier, multiple  stakeholders we interviewed discussed the challenges related to  collateralizing trust land. In addition, FCA officials cited the need for a  statutory change or clarification of the requirement that long-term  loans made by FCS be secured by a first lien on interests in real  estate. They said that by removing or clarifying this requirement,  lenders would have authority to provide larger, longer-term loans to  creditworthy tribes or tribal members who cannot mortgage their tribal  lands.", "Guarantees. Some stakeholders we interviewed mentioned loan  guarantees as an option to improve access to agricultural credit on  tribal lands. For instance, FCA officials and Farm Credit Council  representatives told us they had spoken with leadership of the Native  American Agriculture Fund (created as part of the Keepseagle  settlement) regarding the potential establishment of a loan guarantee  fund, such as a first-loss fund, which would step in to purchase a loan  in default (thus substantially reducing credit risk to the lender). In  addition, three of the 11 FCS associations we queried identified  guarantees as a possible way to increase FCS lending to Indian tribes  and their members on tribal lands.", "FCS associations still face challenges in using guarantees. With  regard to the first-loss loan guarantee fund, FCS associations still  must adhere to the FCS statutory requirement for a first-position lien  on interests in real estate for long-term loans. According to an FCA  official, although the first-loss loan guarantee fund could mitigate  repayment risk, a statutory change or clarification would be necessary  for FCS associations to accept guarantees in lieu of real estate for  long-term loans. And as noted earlier, FCS loans are statutorily  ineligible for BIA\u2019s loan guarantee program. Two FCS associations  noted that removal of this restriction could increase FCS lending on  tribal lands. Finally, FCA officials stated that challenges FCS  associations face in making loans involving tribal lands also can  extend to Farm Service Agency guarantees on those loans. In other  words, to obtain such guarantees, FCS associations must navigate  issues around land tenure, legal jurisdiction, and tribal laws.", "Tribal options. In addition, stakeholders discussed the following tribal  actions that could increase credit access for tribes and their members:", "Representatives of two FCS associations noted that waivers of  sovereign immunity (limited to specific contracts) by tribes may  increase lending involving tribal lands, as it helps to enable  lenders to enforce the terms of loans made to tribes. According to  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, some banks have  negotiated limited waivers of sovereign immunity (restricted to a  specific transaction). As noted earlier, tribes may decide that  waiving sovereign immunity is not in their best interest. In addition  to the limited waivers of sovereign immunity, representatives of  three FCS institutions stated that increased adoption of uniform  commercial laws (such as the Uniform Commercial Code) by  tribes could increase lending involving tribal lands.", "One tribal economic development expert told us that tribes that  adopted their own leasing regulations under the HEARTH Act  have seen substantially increased economic development. As  noted earlier, the HEARTH Act provides tribes with greater  flexibility to enter into leases for agriculture or other purposes.  Once a tribe\u2019s leasing regulations have been approved by the  Secretary of the Interior, tribes may negotiate and enter into  agricultural leases with 25-year terms without further approval by  the Secretary. The combination of longer lease terms and the  ability to conduct business outside of the BIA approval process  can expedite the process of obtaining a leasehold mortgage on  tribal trust and restricted fee land.

We reviewed available data from the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau and Department of Agriculture (USDA). For  example, we obtained borrower-reported loan data from USDA\u2019s  Agricultural Resource Management Survey, but for several data fields  related to Indian producers on tribal lands, sample sizes were too small or  the coefficients of variation were too high to produce reliable estimates.

We  also reviewed the marketing plans of a nongeneralizable sample of 11  FCS associations (16 percent of the 69 FCS associations that lend  directly to agricultural producers) whose territories included large tribal  land areas with high levels of agricultural activity, including the tribes we  interviewed (described below). We selected an additional FCS  association but on closer review realized it did not have a significant  amount of tribal land in its territory; we therefore excluded this association  from our analysis. For comparison purposes, we also reviewed three  marketing plans from FCS associations that did not have significant tribal  populations in their territories. In addition to reviewing the marketing  plans, we sent the 11 FCS associations a questionnaire about their  lending and outreach to tribes and their members and any challenges in  making loans involving tribal lands. We also asked these associations  about any suggestions to improve access to agricultural credit on tribal  lands. We received responses from all 11 FCS associations, and followed  up with some associations to clarify information they provided.
