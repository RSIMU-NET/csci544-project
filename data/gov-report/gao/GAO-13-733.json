Federal laws do not prohibit an individual with unpaid federal taxes from holding a security clearance, but tax debt poses a potential vulnerability. GAO was requested to review tax-debt detection during the clearance process. GAO examined (1) the number of individuals with unpaid federal taxes, if any, in the OPM security-clearance database and the magnitude of any federal tax debt, and (2) the extent to which federal agencies have mechanisms to detect unpaid tax debt during the security-clearance-approval process.", "GAO compared OPM's security-clearance information to the IRS's known tax debts. To provide examples, GAO conducted a detailed review of IRS and security adjudication files of 13 individuals selected, in part, on the basis of tax debt amount and type of security clearance. GAO also reviewed relevant laws and regulations and interviewed officials from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Treasury, OPM, and three selected federal agencies that represented more than half of the clearance holders in OPM's database."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 8,400 individuals adjudicated as eligible for a security clearance from April 2006 to December 2011 owed approximately $85 million in unpaid federal taxes, as of June 2012. This represents about 3.4 percent of the civilian executive-branch employees and contractors who were favorably adjudicated during that period. GAO found that about 4,700 of the approximately 8,400 individuals were federal employees while the remainder was largely federal contractors. Additionally, about 4,200 of these individuals had a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pay back their debt. For this review, GAO used clearance data from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Central Verification System (CVS) database. The CVS database does not maintain information on the denial of security clearances on the basis of an individual's nonpayment of federal taxes. Thus, GAO was not able to determine the number of individuals who were denied security clearances for this reason.", "Federal agencies have established mechanisms aimed at identifying unpaid federal tax debt of security-clearance applicants; however, these mechanisms have limitations. To detect federal tax debt for clearance applicants, federal investigators primarily rely on two methods: (1) applicants self-reporting tax debts; and (2) validation techniques, such as the use of credit reports or in-person interviews. Each of these methods has shortcomings in detecting unpaid federal tax debts of clearance applicants. For example, credit reports are the primary method for identifying tax debt that was not self-reported, but these reports only contain information on tax debts for which the IRS filed a lien on the debtor's property. According to GAO's analysis, 5 percent of the 8,400 delinquent taxpayers who were favorably adjudicated as eligible for security clearances had a tax lien filed on them. Additionally, federal agencies generally do not routinely review federal tax compliance of clearance holders. There is no process to detect unpaid federal tax debts accrued after an individual has been favorably adjudicated unless it is self-reported, reported by a security manager due to garnishment of wages, or discovered during a clearance renewal or upgrade. GAO's analysis found that 6,300 individuals (approximately 75 percent) accrued their tax debt after approval of the security clearance.", "Additional mechanisms that provide large-scale, routine detection of federal tax debt could improve federal agencies' ability to detect tax debts owed by security-clearance applicants and current clearance holders, but statutory privacy protections limit access to this information. Federal agencies may obtain information on federal tax debts directly from the IRS if the applicant provides consent. In addition, federal agencies do not have a mechanism, such as one that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) uses, to collect delinquent federal debts. Such information could help federal agencies perform routine, automated checks of security-clearance applicants to determine whether they have unpaid federal debts, without compromising statutory privacy protections. Such a mechanism could also be used to help monitor current clearance holders' tax-debt status. Gaining routine access to this federal debt information, if feasible, would better position federal agencies to identify relevant financial and personal-conduct information to make objective assessments of eligibility for security-clearance applicants and continued eligibility of current clearance holders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that ODNI study the feasibility of federal agencies routinely obtaining federal debt information from Treasury for the purposes of investigating and adjudicating clearance applicants, as well as for monitoring current clearance holders' tax-debt status.

The number of personnel  holding clearances underscores the need for security-clearance  adjudicators to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments of security- clearance applicants as these clearances may allow government  personnel to gain access to classified information that, through  unauthorized disclosure, can in some cases cause exceptionally grave  damage to U.S. national security. Promulgated under the authority of  Executive Order 12968, adjudicative guidelines establish the criteria by  which an individual is evaluated for a security clearance determination.   The guidelines state that assessments should consider available, reliable  information about the person, past and present, favorable and  unfavorable, and carefully weigh a number of variables, including  whether the applicant has shown an inability or unwillingness to satisfy  debts or financial obligations or has failed to file annual required tax  returns. Federal law does not expressly prohibit an individual with unpaid  federal taxes from being granted a security clearance; however, tax debt  does pose a potential vulnerability that must be considered in making a  broader determination of whether an applicant should be granted a  security clearance. Specifically, federal adjudicative guidelines for  determining eligibility for access to classified information state that an  individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in  illegal acts to generate funds, and provide that adjudicating officials weigh  an individual\u2019s debts, such as federal tax debts, as they relate to an  individual\u2019s financial and personal conduct when making the security- clearance determination.", "OPM officials noted that under the new standards issued in December 2012, it is a 5-year  cycle for both types of investigations, with reinvestigations conducted of a random sample of  clearance holders.

For this review, we focused on civilian  employees and contractors in the executive branch. We excluded  Department of Defense (DOD) employees and contractors and known  employees of intelligence agencies from this review. the following questions: (1) How many individuals with unpaid federal  taxes, if any, are in the OPM security-clearance database and what is the  magnitude of any unpaid federal tax debt; and (2) To what extent do  federal agencies have mechanisms to detect unpaid tax debt during the  security-clearance approval process? As part of this work, we are also  providing case-study examples of individuals with security clearances  with unpaid tax debt to highlight whether the tax debt was revealed during  the investigative or adjudicative processes, and, if so, how it was handled  during the adjudication.

We  used this time frame for the OPM Central Verification System (CVS) data  because prior to April 1, 2006, the provision of the date a clearance was  granted was not required and was therefore not consistently available for  analysis. We electronically matched federal tax-debt data from the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Unpaid Assessment database to these  individuals using Social Security numbers (SSN). The OPM CVS  database does not maintain information on the denial of security  clearances on the basis of an individual\u2019s nonpayment of federal taxes.  Thus, we were not able to determine the number of individuals who were  denied security clearances for this reason. We included only those  individuals with legally enforceable tax debts of $100 or more. All  individuals in the IRS tax-debt data had unpaid federal taxes as of June  30, 2012. The June 30, 2012, Unpaid Assessment file was used because  it contained the most-recent unpaid-assessment information at the time  we conducted our analysis. We assessed the reliability of the OPM data  by performing electronic testing on the data and interviewing OPM  officials regarding the quality and accuracy of the data. To assess the  reliability of IRS unpaid-assessments data, we relied on the work we  performed during our annual audit of the IRS\u2019s financial statements and  discussions with the audit team. We also interviewed knowledgeable IRS  officials about any data-reliability issues. We determined that both the  OPM and IRS data were sufficiently reliable to identify the individuals  eligible for clearances with unpaid federal tax debt, provide an  approximate overall amount of tax debt owed by these individuals, and  select our case studies. Our final estimate of tax debt does include some  debt that is covered under an active IRS installment plan or is beyond  normal statutory time limits for debt collection. Our analysis determined  the magnitude of known unpaid federal taxes owed by selected  individuals in the OPM database and cannot be generalized to individuals  that were granted eligibility for security clearances by DOD, the legislative  branch, or the intelligence community.", "To determine to what extent federal agencies have mechanisms to detect  unpaid tax debt during the security-clearance approval process, we held  meetings with knowledgeable officials from OPM, ODNI, the IRS,  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Energy (DOE)  and Department of State (State). We selected DHS, DOE, and State  because these agencies had the highest number of security clearances,  collectively representing over 50 percent of clearances granted in OPM\u2019s  CVS database, and also represented over 50 percent of the tax debt  owed. OPM conducts security-clearance investigations for most federal  agencies. ODNI serves as Security Executive Agent for the federal  government and has authority and responsibility over many aspects of the  security-clearance program. As such, we also reviewed and analyzed  applicable laws, regulations, and ODNI guidance, as well as applicable  policies and procedures for OPM, DHS, DOE, and State regarding the  investigation and adjudication of security clearances. Finally, we  conducted interviews with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the  Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) and the IRS on any initiatives and  challenges in sharing tax debt information. We compared verification  mechanisms with the fraud control framework we developed in our past  work and other fraud-control best practices. We also used Federal  Investigative Standards (see app. I) and the Revised Adjudicative  Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information  (see app. II) to evaluate the current mechanisms used to identify and  evaluate unpaid federal tax debt as part of the security-clearance  process.", "To develop case-study examples, we identified a nonprobability sample of  13 individuals for detailed reviews from the above analyses of security- clearance holders from DHS, DOE, and State who had federal tax debt.  These three agencies were selected because they had the largest  number of individuals who were adjudicated as eligible for a security  clearance from April 1, 2006, to December 31, 2011. We stratified our  data matches using the following characteristics: (1) adjudicating agency;  (2) amounts of unpaid federal taxes in the IRS Unpaid Assessment  database as of June 30, 2012; (3) type of security clearance granted or  approved, clearance date, and dollar amount of unpaid tax debt; and (4)  whether tax debt was recorded prior to or after the security-clearance  grant date. We then randomly selected 12 cases on the basis of these  criteria. Additionally, we randomly selected one individual for whom IRS  records show the taxpayer was assessed a penalty. We requested and  obtained IRS notes, detailed account transcripts, and other records from  the IRS as well as background investigation and adjudicative record files  from DHS, DOE, and State for these 13 individuals. For 11 of the 13  individuals that had accrued debt before the adjudication, we reviewed  the background investigation and adjudicative record files and IRS  paperwork to determine whether the tax debt was revealed during the  investigative or adjudicative processes, and, if so, how it was handled  during the adjudication. For 2 of the 13 individuals that had accrued debt  only after favorable adjudication, we reviewed the adjudicative files to  determine whether the agency was aware of the federal tax debt through  its reinvestigation. These cases were selected to illustrate individuals with  unpaid federal tax debt that had been determined eligible for security  clearances but cannot be generalized beyond the cases presented.

To determine whether an investigation would be  required, the agency requesting a security-clearance investigation is to  first conduct a check of existing personnel-security databases to  determine whether there is an existing security-clearance investigation  underway or whether the individual has already been favorably  adjudicated for a clearance in accordance with current standards. If such  a security clearance does not exist for that individual, a security officer  from an agency is to (1) request an investigation of an individual requiring  a clearance; (2) forward a personnel-security questionnaire (SF-86) to the  individual to complete using OPM\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for  Investigations Processing (e-QIP) system; (3) review the completed  questionnaire; and (4) send the questionnaire and supporting  documentation, such as fingerprints, to OPM or another designated  investigative service provider.", "The investigation phase.

Federal  investigative standards and agencies\u2019 internal guidance are used to  conduct and document the investigation of the applicant (see app. II). The  scope of information gathered during an investigation depends on the  level of clearance needed. For example, federal standards require that  investigators collect information from national agencies, such as the  Federal Bureau of Investigation, for all initial and renewal clearances. For  an investigation for a confidential or secret clearance, investigators gather  much of the information electronically. For an investigation for a top- secret clearance, investigators gather additional information through  more-time-consuming efforts, such as traveling to conduct in-person  interviews to corroborate information about an applicant\u2019s employment  and education.

Adjudicators from an agency use the  information from the investigative report to determine whether an  applicant is eligible for a security clearance. To make clearance-eligibility  decisions, national policy requires adjudicators to consider the information  against the 2005 Revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining  Eligibility for Access to Classified Information. The adjudication process  is a careful weighing of a number of variables, to include disqualifying and  mitigating factors, known as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept. When a  person\u2019s life history shows evidence of unreliability or untrustworthiness,  questions can arise as to whether the person can be relied on and trusted  to exercise the responsibility necessary for working in a secure  environment where protecting national security is paramount. As part of  the adjudication process, the adjudicative guidelines require agencies to  determine whether a prospective individual meets the adjudicative criteria  for determining eligibility, including personal conduct and financial  considerations. If an individual has conditions that raise a security  concern or may be disqualifying, the adjudicator must evaluate whether  there are other factors that mitigate such risks (such as a good-faith effort  to repay a federal tax debt).

In 5 of the cases that we reviewed,  existing federal tax debt was not identified in the original adjudication of  the security clearance but through the subsequent reinvestigation of the  security clearance, meaning the individuals had tax debt unknown to the  federal agency while holding a clearance for some period of time. This  gap represents a risk that could be mitigated by a mechanism to routinely  obtain tax-debt information, as discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Improve Detection of Tax Debt Owed by Security- Clearance Applicants and Clearance Holders", "paragraphs": ["Additional mechanisms that provide large-scale detection of federal tax  debt could improve federal agencies\u2019 ability to detect tax debts owed by  security-clearance applicants and security-clearance holders, but  statutory privacy protections limit access to this information. Specifically,  access to the federal tax information needed to obtain the tax payment  status of applicants is restricted under section 6103 of the Internal  Revenue Code, which generally prohibits disclosure of taxpayer data to  federal agencies and others, including disclosures to help validate an  applicant\u2019s certifications about the nature and extent of his or her tax  debt. During our interviews, ODNI, DHS, DOE, and State officials  expressed interest in establishing additional mechanisms to provide  large-scale detection of unpaid tax debt owed by security-clearance  applicants. ODNI officials stated that they formed a working group in  2012, in collaboration with OPM and other federal agencies, to, among  other things, explore whether an automated process for reviewing federal  tax compliance can be established. However, restrictions to taxpayer  information under section 6103 may present challenges to their efforts.  For example, in 2011 and 2012, State requested the IRS to provide it a  listing of State employees who owed federal taxes. The IRS did not  formally respond in writing to the State letters, according to State officials,  but stated that the IRS could not provide them this list due to section 6103  restrictions. According to IRS officials, based on their analysis of the  applicable tax laws, IRS cannot disclose tax information of federal  employees without taxpayer consent request.", "Federal agencies may obtain information on federal tax debts directly  from the IRS if the applicant provides consent. For example, agencies  can use IRS form 4506-T, Request for Transcript of Tax Return, to obtain  tax transcripts that provide basic taxpayer information, including marital  status, type of return filed, adjusted gross income, taxable income, and  later adjustments, if any, if the individual provides written consent.  However, this form may not be useful in conducting routine checks with  the IRS during the initial investigation and reinvestigation processes for  three reasons. First, the use of the IRS form 4506-T is a manual process  and thus it is not conducive to the large-scale detection of unpaid federal  taxes owed by security-clearance applicants, according to OPM, DHS,  and State officials. Instead, this method is typically performed when a  federal tax debt is disclosed by the applicant or discovered during the  investigation. Second, the IRS form 4506-T generally provides limited  visibility into an applicant\u2019s overall tax debt status because the form  requires the requesting agency to identify the specific tax modules  (generally, time periods) that the agencies are requesting to be disclosed,  and, as such, agencies may not obtain the complete tax debt history of  the individual. Finally, the IRS form 4506-T has a 120-day time limit from  date of the applicant\u2019s signature providing consent to process the form  with the IRS. Officials from State stated that this limited time frame could  hinder their ability to obtain the requested tax information if this form was  provided at the time the security-clearance application was completed. As  highlighted in our past work, it is important that the establishment of any  federal tax-compliance check not delay the timeliness of security- clearance decisions. Specifically, timeliness concerns were one of the  reasons that we designated the security-clearance process as high risk  from 2005 to 2011. As we concluded in July 2012, delays in the  security-clearance process could pose risks to national security, impede  the start of classified work and hiring the best-qualified workers, and  increase the government\u2019s cost of national-security-related contracts.", "The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Offset Program (TOP), or a similar  mechanism, may provide an opportunity for federal agencies to perform  an automated check of both security-clearance applicants and current  clearance holders to determine whether they have unpaid federal debts  that would include tax debts, while not violating IRS section 6103  requirements. TOP is an automated process administered by the Department of the Treasury in which certain federal payments, such as  contractor and federal salary payments, are reduced to collect certain  delinquent tax and nontax debts owed to federal agencies, including the  IRS. Each week, the IRS sends the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  Bureau of the Fiscal Service office (Fiscal Service) an extract of its tax- debt files, which are uploaded into TOP and matched against Fiscal  Service payment data (such as federal contractor payments, federal  salary payments, and Social Security Administration retirement  payments). If there is a match and the IRS has completed all statutory  notifications, any federal payment owed to the debtor is reduced (levied)  to help satisfy the unpaid federal taxes.", "As we concluded in our past work, since TOP comingles information  regarding tax debt and nontax debt, the existence of an employee\u2019s name  in TOP would generally not be considered taxpayer information subject to  section 6103 of the tax code. Thus, TOP could be used to identify  individuals who may owe federal debts, which includes federal taxes,  without compromising privacy protections provided by section 6103. TOP  currently reports a federal debt indicator (comprising both federal tax and  nontax debts) to the System for Award Management (SAM) on whether a  federal contractor or grant recipient has federal debts.", "SAM is a  government-wide database used to track the status of agency  procurements.", "As of September 2012, the IRS had referred approximately $167 billion  (approximately 44 percent) of the $373 billion of the total unpaid tax  assessment inventory in tax debts to TOP; thus, this program is an  important repository of tax-debt data for federal workers and contractors.  The IRS typically sends the tax debts to TOP except in cases where  (1) the IRS has not completed its notification process,(2) tax debtors have filed for bankruptcy protection or other litigation,  (3) tax debtors have agreed to pay their tax debt through monthly  installment payments or have requested to pay less than the full  amount owed through an offer in compromise,  (4) the IRS determined that the tax debtors are in financial hardship,  (5) tax debtors are filing an amended return, or  (6) the IRS determined that specific circumstances (such as a criminal  investigation) exist that warrant special exclusion from FPLP.", "Thus, debts that are typically sent to TOP are those where the taxpayer  has not shown a willingness to resolve his or her tax debts. As such, it is  important that these individuals are identified because it can be an  important factor in determining whether an individual should be eligible for  a security clearance, as inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is a  potentially disqualifying factor according to the adjudicative guidelines.  Our analysis found that 1,600 (approximately 20 percent) of the 8,400  taxpayers that had been granted security clearances during this 5-year  period had tax debts that were referred to TOP.", "A mechanism similar to or using TOP could be useful in identifying  individuals who have not shown a willingness to resolve their tax debts  and who are applying for a security clearance or already have one. This  type of mechanism can be especially advantageous in monitoring  clearance holders to identify circumstances (such as the nonpayment of  federal taxes) that might warrant a reevaluation of an individual\u2019s security- clearance eligibility.individuals (approximately 76 percent) had their tax debt accrued after the  approval for the security clearance.", "As discussed earlier, our analysis found that 6,375  While ODNI officials reported forming a working group with OPM and  other federal agencies to explore an automated process for reviewing  federal tax compliance, ODNI, IRS, and Fiscal Service officials stated that  they have not explored the use of TOP for identifying individuals who owe  federal debts, including tax debts. ODNI officials stated that they would be supportive of processes that automatically checked security-clearance  applicants for federal tax debts. Fiscal Service officials stated that they  did not foresee any potential operational issues with using TOP more  broadly for these purposes. However, IRS and Fiscal Service officials  stated that a legal analysis would need to be performed to determine if  the TOP information could be used for the purpose of performing  background investigations.", "Separate from TOP, agencies may determine that a change in law is  required to access taxpayer information without having to get consent  from the individual. If it is determined that a change in law would be  required, the IRS and federal agencies could consider various factors in  determining whether they should seek legislative action for disclosing  taxpayer information as part of the security-clearance process.  Specifically, as we concluded in December 2011, it is important that  Congress consider both the benefits expected from a disclosure of federal  tax information and the expected costs, including reduced taxpayer  privacy, risk of inappropriate disclosure, and negative effects on tax  compliance and tax-system administration.", "While knowingly making false statements on federal security-clearance  forms is a federal crime and may deter some from lying about their tax  debt, much of our prior work has focused on the inadequacies of using  voluntary, self-reported information without independent verification and  review. detection and monitoring component of our agency\u2019s fraud-prevention  framework and is a fraud-control best practice.

Enhancing federal agencies\u2019 access to  tax-debt information for the purpose of both investigating and adjudicating  security-clearance applicants, as well as ongoing monitoring of current  clearance holders\u2019 tax-debt status, would better position agencies to  make fully informed decisions about eligibility.

For example, the financial consideration guideline states that individuals  could be denied security clearances on the basis of having a history of  not meeting financial obligations. However, this security concern could be  mitigated if one or more of the following factors were present: the  behavior was not recent, resulted from factors largely beyond the  person\u2019s control (such as loss of employment), or was addressed through  counseling.", "Third, the adjudicator should evaluate the relevance of an individual\u2019s  overall conduct by considering the following general factors:  the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable  participation;  the frequency and recency of the conduct;  the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the voluntariness of participation;  the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent  behavioral changes;  the motivation for the conduct;  the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.", "When the personnel-security investigation uncovers no adverse security  conditions, the adjudicator\u2019s task is fairly straightforward because there is  no security condition to consider."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine: (1) how many individuals with unpaid  federal taxes, if any, are in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  security-clearance database and what is the magnitude of any unpaid  federal tax debt? and (2) to what extent do federal agencies have  mechanisms to detect unpaid tax debt during the security-clearance  approval process?", "To determine the magnitude of unpaid federal taxes owed by individuals  approved for a security clearance, we obtained and analyzed OPM data  of individuals eligible for a secret or top-secret security clearance due to a  favorable adjudication, either during an initial investigation or a  reinvestigation, from April 1, 2006, to December 31, 2011. Our review did  not include the review of confidential clearance holders or public-trust  positions. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC) \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cL\u201d clearances are equivalent to the top- secret and secret clearances. Thus, for the purposes of our report, we  considered \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cL\u201d clearances issued by DOE and NRC to be treated  as top-secret and secret clearances, respectively. We identified the OPM  Central Verification System (CVS) database as the appropriate data for  our analysis after meeting with OPM officials and discussing the types of  data available. We used this time frame because prior to April 1, 2006,  the provision of the date a clearance was granted was not required and  was therefore not consistently available for analysis. OPM provided us  with an extract of the OPM database that included information only on  executive-branch, non\u2013Department of Defense (DOD), and non- intelligence-community employees and contractors who were eligible for a  clearance during our time frame. The OPM CVS database does not  maintain information on the denial of security clearances on the basis of  an individual\u2019s nonpayment of federal taxes. Thus, we were not able to  determine the number of individuals who were denied security clearances  for this reason.To determine the extent to which individuals eligible for a  security clearance had unpaid federal taxes, we used the taxpayer  identification number (TIN) as a unique identifier and electronically  matched the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) tax-debt data to the OPM  data of individuals eligible for a security clearance. Specifically, we used  the IRS Unpaid Assessment file as of June 30, 2012, to match against the  OPM CVS data. The IRS Unpaid Assessment file used for our analysis  contains all tax modules that are unpaid as of June 30, 2012. The June  30, 2012, file was used because it contained the most-recent unpaid  assessment information at the time we conducted our analysis. To avoid  overestimating the amount owed and to capture only significant unpaid  federal taxes, we excluded from our analysis tax debts meeting specific  criteria to establish a minimum threshold in the amount of tax debt to be  considered when determining whether a tax debt is significant.", "The criteria we used to exclude tax debts are as follows: (1) unpaid  federal taxes the IRS classified as compliance assessments or memo  accounts for financial reporting, and (2) recipients with total unpaid  federal taxes of $100 or less. Specifically, compliance assessments or  memo accounts were excluded because these taxes have neither been  agreed to by the taxpayers nor affirmed by the court, or these taxes could  be invalid or duplicative of other taxes already reported. We excluded tax  debts of $100 or less because the IRS considers it a de minimis amount.  Additionally, for the purposes of our engagement, we included individuals  from the Business Master File (BMF) and Non-Master File (NMF), who  were an exact Social Security number (SSN)/TIN match, as well as an  exact name match with the OPM CVS data. We only included exact  matches so we would be able to match and use the information from the  OPM CVS database. Additionally, the Spouse Individual Master File (IMF)  was not used in the magnitude analysis. This is because we were unable  to determine which agency each spouse was affiliated with on the basis  of the information available in both the IRS and OPM data. Additionally,  the debt of a spouse may not have any effect on the security-clearance  adjudication determination. As a result, the results reported may be  understated.", "Using these criteria, we identified about 8,400 of these individuals who  had unpaid federal tax debt as of June 30, 2012. Our final estimate of tax  debt does include some debt that is covered under an active IRS  installment plan or beyond normal statutory time limits for debt collection.  Our analysis determined the magnitude of known unpaid federal taxes  owed by individuals in the OPM database and cannot be generalized to  individuals that were granted eligibility for security clearances by DOD,  the legislative branch, or the intelligence community.", "To determine whether existing investigative and adjudication mechanisms  detect unpaid tax debt during the security-clearance process and possible  additional improvements to federal tax-debt detection mechanisms, we  interviewed knowledgeable officials from the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as Security Executive Agent  for the federal government and has authority and responsibility over  security-clearance protocols, and from OPM, which conducts security- clearance investigations for most federal agencies. In addition, we  conducted interviews with officials from the Department of Homeland and  Security (DHS), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of State  (State). DHS, DOE, and State were selected because these agencies had  the highest number of security clearances adjudicated from April 1, 2006,  to December 31, 2011, collectively representing over 50 percent of  clearances granted in OPM\u2019s CVS database, and also represented over  50 percent of the tax debt owed. In addition, we also reviewed and  analyzed applicable laws, regulations, and ODNI guidance, as well as  applicable policies and procedures for OPM, DHS, DOE, and State  regarding the investigation and adjudication of security clearances.  Finally, we conducted interviews with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) and the IRS to obtain their  views on any initiatives and barriers in sharing tax-debt information. We  compared verification mechanisms with the fraud control framework we  developed in our past work and other fraud control best practices.

We stratified our matches using the following characteristics: (1)  adjudicating agency; (2) amounts of unpaid federal taxes in the IRS  Unpaid Assessment database as of June 30, 2012; (3) type of security  clearance granted or approved, clearance date, and dollar amount of  unpaid tax debt; and (4) whether tax debt was recorded prior to or after  the security-clearance grant date. We selected 12 cases from these four  strata. Additionally, we randomly selected one case with indications that  IRS was assessing a trust-fund recovery penalty. Once the nonprobability  sample was selected, we requested all investigative and adjudicative  case-file notes from the adjudicating agency; IRS notes, detailed account  transcripts, and other records from the IRS; and security-clearance files  from DHS, DOE, and State for these 13 individuals. For 2 of the 13  individuals that had accrued debt only after favorable adjudication, we  reviewed the adjudicative files to determine whether the agency was  aware of the federal tax debt through its reinvestigation. The clearance  files and IRS paperwork were systematically reviewed using a structured  data-collection instrument, looking at whether the tax debt was revealed  in the investigative or adjudicative processes, and, if so, how it was  handled in the adjudication. Each case file was independently reviewed  by two analysts. After completion of each case review, the files were  compared to identify discrepancies.
