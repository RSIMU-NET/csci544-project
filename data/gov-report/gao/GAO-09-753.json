Over the past 2 years subsidies to carriers have been increasing, along with EAS program obligations to fund those subsidies. In response, the administration is requesting $175 million for the EAS program in fiscal year 2010, a $50 million increase over recent funding levels. At the same time, the number of carriers providing subsidized air service is declining, from 34 in 1987 to 10 in 2009. More than one-third of the EAS-supported communities temporarily lost service in 2008, when 3 carriers ceased operations. Several factors contribute to the increasing difficulty in providing subsidized air service. The EAS program has statutory requirements for minimum aircraft size and frequency of flights, effectively requiring carriers to provide service that may not be \"right-sized\" for some small markets. Also, the growth of air service especially by low-cost carriers--which today serve most U.S. hub airports---weighed against the relatively high fares and inconvenience of EAS flights, can lead people to bypass EAS flights and drive to hub airports. Moreover, the continued urbanization of the United States may have eroded the potential passenger base in some small and rural EAS communities. While Congress, DOT, GAO, and others have proposed various revisions to the EAS program, Congress has not authorized many changes to program requirements. Proposed Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization legislation would include performance-based incentives, among other changes. GAO and others have suggested increasing flexibility and other changes that could make EAS service more sustainable for smaller communities. Finally, members of an expert panel organized by GAO all believed that small and rural communities would benefit from a multimodal approach to transportation. Generally they believed that other modes of transportation could be more responsive to communities' transportation needs in some cases. Although it is difficult to select options for the EAS program since stakeholders do not always agree on program objectives, certain analytical tools can help policymakers assess the EAS program. Tools include a re-examination framework to revisit the program's objectives, and help evaluate options to make the program more effective. Other analytical tools include an analytical approach GAO developed that, for a sample of small and rural communities, identified their access to different modes of transportation. This approach has the potential for broader application to examinations of communities' access to the national transportation network. Finally, once a change is implemented, performance measures can be used to periodically evaluate program effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, Congress deregulated the airline industry and established the  Essential Air Service (EAS) program to ensure that communities that had  air service at the time of deregulation would continue to receive at least a  minimum level of service. Under the EAS program, if an air carrier cannot  provide air service to eligible communities without incurring a loss, the  Department of Transportation (DOT) awards the air carrier a subsidy to  serve those communities. In 2008, this program helped support  commercial air service to about 150 communities throughout the United  States. The prospects for the EAS program are a matter of concern to  many Members of Congress. In April 2009, 22 Senators submitted a letter  to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget requesting that  the administration\u2019s budget request \u201creflect the priority of the EAS  program to rural America . . .\u201d The administration, in its fiscal year 2010  budget request for DOT notes that the current EAS program is not  efficiently designed, and states its intent to work with Congress to develop  a sustainable program that will fulfill its commitment while enhancing  convenience for travelers and improving cost effectiveness.", "Many factors appear to be contributing to increased operating costs for  EAS carriers and increasing demand from communities, leading to higher  subsidy costs for the EAS program. The administration\u2019s fiscal year 2010  budget request includes increased funding for this upcoming year to help  cover the costs of increased demand for the program. In addition, over the  years Congress has expressed concern that changes in the aviation  industry and rising costs may jeopardize the EAS program\u2019s long-term  viability. Finally, in a 2002 report, we also identified several factors that  were likely in the near term to create pressure to increase potential future  subsidy requirements of the EAS program, and described various options  that could promote the long-term viability of the program.", "Given continuing concerns over the EAS program\u2019s long-term prospects,  you asked us to review the program. This report addresses (1) the  characteristics and current status of the program, (2) the factors affecting  its ability to provide service to communities, (3) options for revising the  EAS program, and (4) tools for assessing the program, options for its  revision, and the program\u2019s performance. To complete this work we  reviewed previous reports and studies of the EAS program, including  previous GAO reports. We also held a panel discussion attended by  experts on community air service including airline officials, program  administrators, economists, other transportation providers, and state and  local officials. These experts discussed the factors affecting the EAS  program and options for providing service to communities across the  country, in addition to responding to our questions about the federal  government\u2019s options for assisting communities with connecting to the  national transportation system. We gathered information on the  experiences of airports served by the EAS program from a national  association of airports, and from seven of their member airports. We  obtained DOT data on the EAS program. Our review focuses on  communities within the continental United States that have received EAS  subsidized service. We focused our review on these communities because  the requirements for communities in Alaska are different than for  communities in other states, and airports outside the contiguous states  and are not representative of the program in the rest of the country. In  identifying tools for assessing the program, options for its revision, and the  program\u2019s performance, we compared the program status to GAO\u2019s re- examination criteria and compared DOT\u2019s performance measures for this  program against the criteria of the Government Performance and Results  Act of 1993 and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Program  Assessment Rating Tool.

Free  to determine which communities they would serve, as well as what fares  they would charge, most major carriers became \u201cnetwork\u201d carriers,  developing \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d networks and providing service from their  hubs to many \u201cspoke\u201d cities they served. Anticipating that airlines would  be free to focus their resources on generally more profitable high-density  markets, Congress became concerned that major carriers would eliminate  their less profitable routes serving smaller communities, causing these  communities to lose air service. In response, Congress established the  Essential Air Service (EAS) program as part of the Airline Deregulation  Act of 1978. The EAS program subsidizes commercial air service for  communities that would otherwise have lost service as a result of  deregulation. The law specifies that if an air carrier cannot continue  service to a community without incurring a loss, DOT shall then use EAS  program funds to award a subsidy to that carrier or another carrier willing  to provide service. Congress initially enacted the program for 10 years, and  later extended it for another 10 years. In 1996, Congress removed the 10- year time limit.", "Under the Airline Deregulation Act, communities that were eligible for air  service on October 24, 1978, are eligible for EAS-subsidized service. There  are EAS-eligible communities in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and American  Samoa. As of November 2008, DOT had agreements with carriers to  provide subsidized service to almost 150 communities\u2014102 in the  continental United States, 43 in Alaska, and 2 in Puerto Rico. Not all  communities that are eligible for EAS service currently receive it; many  currently have unsubsidized air service. Figure 1 shows the communities  that had access to EAS service as of January 1, 2009, or are projected to  ojected to  have service starting later in the year.  have service starting later in the year.", "Communities near airports with EAS service vary in their population. For  example, 58 percent of the communities within 40 miles of an airport with  EAS-subsidized service as of January 1, 2009, had a population of less than  10,000 while 2 percent had a population of over 100,000.", "A multistep process is required for subsidized EAS service to begin at a  community. For a community that is not currently receiving EAS  subsidies, the process starts when the last air carrier providing  unsubsidized service to an EAS-eligible community files a Notice of  Termination, which is a 90-day notice of its intent to suspend, terminate,  or reduce service below the minimum level of service required by law. If  no other air carrier is willing to provide unsubsidized air service to the  community, DOT solicits proposals from carriers that would be willing to  provide service with a subsidy. Carriers requesting a subsidy must  document that they cannot profitably serve the community without a  subsidy by submitting various financial data, such as profit-or-loss  statements, to DOT. DOT then reviews these data along with information  about the aviation industry\u2019s pricing structure, the size of aircraft required,  the amount of service required, and the number of projected passengers  who would use this service. DOT also considers the community\u2019s  preferences for the proposed service. Finally, DOT selects a carrier based  on statutory selection criteria and sets an annual subsidy amount intended  to compensate the carrier for the amount by which its projected operating  costs exceed its expected passenger revenues as well as a profit element  of at least 5 percent of total operating expenses, according to statute.  Once air service is under way, DOT makes monthly subsidy payments to  the carrier based on the number of scheduled flights completed. DOT\u2019s  agreement with the carrier is subject to renewal generally every 2 years, at  which time other air carriers are permitted to submit proposals to serve  that community with or without a subsidy.", "In general, the law currently requires that an EAS carrier provide the  following:    service to a hub airport, defined as an Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA)-designated medium- or large-hub airport; two daily round trips, 6 days a week, with not more than one intermediate  stop to the hub; flights at reasonable times taking into account the needs of passengers  with connecting flights;   service in an aircraft with an effective capacity of at least 15 passengers,  under certain circumstances, unless the affected community agrees in  writing to the use of smaller aircraft;    service in aircraft with at least two engines and using two pilots; and    service with pressurized aircraft under certain circumstances.", "Congress and DOT revised the program\u2019s eligibility requirements during  the late 1980s and early 1990s, in response to insufficient program funding.  For example, in June 1989, Congress prohibited DOT, beginning in fiscal  year 1990, from subsidizing service to or from any essential air service  point in the contiguous 48 states where the subsidy exceeded $300 per  passenger. In December 1989, DOT implemented a regulation that,  among other requirements, would eliminate EAS funding for communities  that had EAS service with a per-passenger subsidy exceeding $200 per  person, or that were located less than 70 highway miles from the nearest  medium- or large-hub airport, if appropriations for the EAS program were  less than the amount needed to maintain EAS service at the communities  being served. The Aviation Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1990  superseded this regulation by prohibiting DOT from declaring any  community ineligible for any reason not specifically set forth in statute.  Finally, in fiscal year 1994, Congress prohibited DOT from subsidizing  service to communities that (1) are less than 70 highway miles from the  nearest medium- or large-hub airport, or (2) require a per-passenger EAS  subsidy in excess of $200. Communities located more than 210 miles  from the nearest medium- or large-hub community airport are exempt  from this $200-per-passenger subsidy limit.", "Over the years, several communities have lost eligibility for EAS service  for various reasons. In some instances\u2014after the requirements went into  effect\u2014-it was because the per-passenger subsidy for their service  exceeded the allowable limit, or because the community was less than 70  miles from a medium- or large-hub airport. Other communities lost EAS  service in the early 1990s as Congress took actions to address program  funding constraints. DOT monitors participating air carriers\u2019 operations to  help ensure their service complies with program requirements. For  example, DOT periodically reviews carriers\u2019 enplanement data for the EAS  routes carriers serve, to determine whether the carriers\u2019 per-passenger  subsidy exceeds the statutory cap of $200. Because DOT\u2019s subsidy  payments to carriers are based on the number of flights completed,  regardless of the number of passengers on board, an EAS route with few  passengers has a higher per-passenger subsidy than it would have with  more passengers. When DOT does find that a carrier\u2019s subsidy per  passenger exceeds $200 for an EAS route, the agency warns the  community of its tentative decision to terminate the route subsidy and  allows the community 20 days to object if the community finds that DOT  has made a mistake in its calculations. Since 1989, 61 communities have  lost EAS service because they became ineligible to receive subsidized  service.", "Twenty-six communities lost service in fiscal year 1990 as a result of  reduced program funding. Six of these communities lost service as  October 1989 because their carrier\u2019s subsidy per passenger exceeded the  $300 limit then in effect, and 20 more lost service as of January 1990  because their carrier\u2019s per-passenger subsidy was over $200.", "Twelve communities lost service in fiscal year 1994, a year when funding  for the EAS program was reduced, because their carrier\u2019s per-passenger  subsidy exceeded $200 or because they were within 70 miles of a medium-  or large-hub airport.", "Twenty-two more communities became ineligible at various times since  fiscal year 1995 because their carrier\u2019s per-passenger subsidy exceeded  $200.", "One community became ineligible to receive subsidized service in 1995  because a nearby small hub was reclassified as a medium hub.", "Also, 11 communities that were not receiving EAS-subsidized service lost  their eligibility for EAS service when the last unsubsidized carrier filed to  suspend service at their airport and DOT determined that the community  was ineligible because it was within 70 miles of a medium- or large-hub  airport."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The EAS Program Is Providing Air Service to More Communities, but Service Is Costing More and the Number of Carriers Providing Service Is Declining", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EAS Program Obligations and Appropriations Have Generally Increased to Support Service to More Communities and Higher Carrier Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["The number of communities served by the EAS program in the continental  United States has risen in recent years\u2014 from 87 communities as of June  1, 2003, to 102 communities as of November 1, 2008. The subsidies that  carriers require to serve those routes have also increased since 2003,  adding to the long-term cost of the EAS program. For example, the  average annual subsidy DOT has awarded for EAS service per community  in the continental United States increased from about $883,000 as of June  2003 to about $1,371,000 as of November 2008. After adjusting this growth  for the effects of inflation, the average EAS subsidy in 2008 was about 35  percent higher than in 2003.", "In addition, significant increases in carrier subsidies per community have  come within the past 2 years.

Specifically, in the first 6 months of 2008, three carriers  serving 37 communities ceased operations. Most of these communities  were without service for several months because replacement carriers  were not able to start up immediately.", "Keeping pace with the rising financial requirement to manage the program,  total appropriations for the EAS program have generally increased in  recent years. Total appropriations have increased from about $102  million in fiscal year 2003 to just over $124 million in fiscal years 2007 and  2008. For fiscal year 2009, appropriations available for the program  include $123 million in fiscal year 2009 appropriations and a supplemental  appropriations act which provides an additional $13.2 million in fiscal year  2009 supplemental funding for the EAS program. This increases EAS\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 appropriations to $136.2 million. The administration has  requested about $175 million for the program in 2010, which would  represent a further increase in program funding.", "EAS program funding comes from multiple sources. Each year, the EAS  program receives $50 million in overflight fees. Recently, Congress also  has annually appropriated additional funds from the Airport and Airway  Trust Fund and has supplemented these EAS program funds in 2005, 2007,  2008, and 2009 with additional appropriations, as shown in figure 3. DOT  had requested additional funding for 2005, 2007, and 2008 to account for  the higher dollar amounts required to reimburse carriers for serving EAS  communities. For example, in fiscal year 2005, DOT transferred $5 million  from the Small Community Air Service Development Program, which  provides grants to enhance small communities\u2019 air service, to help fund the  EAS program\u2019s increased costs.", "Recently, DOT officials have been concerned about whether the EAS  program has sufficient funding to serve both current EAS communities  and additional communities that may be eligible for subsidized service.  The EAS program is appropriated a specific amount each fiscal year.  However, since fiscal year 2005, language has been included in  appropriations legislation stating that if the annual amount provided for  EAS is insufficient to meet the costs of the EAS program in the current  fiscal year, the Secretary of the Department of Transportation is required  to transfer funds to EAS from any other amounts appropriated to or  directly administered by the Office of the Secretary. This would require  DOT to draw upon other funding sources within the Office of the  Secretary to be able to make payments to carriers and enter into new  service agreements. DOT had to do this once, using some Small  Community Air Service Development Program funding for the EAS  program in 2005. In addition, a DOT official noted that the EAS program  faces a significant potential financial liability, in that there are about 40  other EAS-eligible communities in the country with airports currently  served by a single unsubsidized commercial carrier. DOT officials believe  that the agency would encounter a significant financial liability\u2014about $60  million annually\u2014if the airlines serving these single-carrier airports all  filed a Notice of Termination requiring DOT to subsidize continued  service. In fact, three communities that have not previously had EAS  service have come into the program since June 2008, and a fourth is  expected to obtain subsidized service later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Withdrawals from the Program in 2008 Caused Service Interruptions for Many Communities, While Others Still Do Not Have EAS Service Restored", "paragraphs": ["According to a DOT official, the EAS program has recently experienced an  unusually high level of carrier turnover. In 2008 alone, three EAS carriers  serving 37 communities ceased operations in the first 6 months of the year.  According to a DOT official, various factors caused the three carriers to  cease operations, and recent fuel price increases might have accelerated  this situation. DOT was able to obtain a replacement carrier to continue  service, without interruption, for one of the 37 communities. However, 30  of the other 36 communities were temporarily without EAS air service for  up to 10 months, and 6 communities are still without service because the  carrier that DOT selected in 2008 to serve those communities withdrew  before it started service. An official of the carrier stated that it withdrew  because it was unable to finance the refurbishing of aircraft needed to  serve those routes. In late June 2009, DOT awarded agreements to two  carriers to provide EAS service to these 6 communities; dates for the start  of service had not been set.", "A DOT official noted that while the number of communities that  experienced carrier turnover in 2008 was unprecedented, the number of  carriers providing air service to communities under the EAS program has  actually been declining over many years. The number of carriers providing  EAS service has declined from 34 as of February 1987 to 10 in 2009. In  addition, as the number of carriers has declined, the percentage of EAS  routes served by just a few carriers has increased. In February 1987, the  largest number of routes served by any one carrier was 13, and the four  carriers that served the most communities accounted for 33 percent of the  EAS routes. At present, four carriers serve about 85 percent of the routes  in the EAS program, with a single carrier serving nearly half of the EAS  routes. As noted above, one carrier recently withdrew from 6 EAS routes  that it was awarded last year before it even started service. Also, DOT  faces a potential rise in the number of communities requiring subsidized  air service should their single unsubsidized carrier end operations. Should  additional EAS carriers withdraw from the program or be financially  unable to serve additional communities seeking EAS service\u2014the  remaining carriers may not have enough capacity to provide EAS service  to all communities that qualify."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The EAS Program\u2019s Ability to Provide Service Is Affected by the Financial Viability of Service on EAS Routes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Requirements and Other Factors Appear to Contribute to Increasing Costs of EAS Service for Carriers and Higher Program Subsidies from DOT", "paragraphs": ["Many of the expert panelists and other stakeholders we interviewed stated  that some EAS program requirements significantly add to the cost of  providing subsidized air service to communities. For example, members of  our expert panel thought the EAS mandate requiring carriers to use  aircraft with a 15-seat capacity for most communities presented the  biggest challenge to providing and sustaining air service to communities  under the EAS program. The mandate requires carriers to use larger  aircraft than may be needed to adequately serve some communities. In  addition, the 15-seat aircraft that this requirement was based upon are no  longer available. Currently, to satisfy the 15-seat minimum, most EAS  routes are served by 19-seat twin-engine turboprop aircraft. (See fig. 4 for   4 for  an example of a 19-seat twin-engine turboprop aircraft.)  an example of a 19-seat twin-engine turboprop aircraft.)", "According to industry representatives, these 19-seat turboprop aircraft  used on many EAS routes are relatively costly to operate. First, the aircraft  are no longer in production, are in limited supply, and are also relatively  costly to acquire and refurbish to comply with current operating  standards. Second, the \u201cCommuter Safety Rule\u201d which FAA implemented  in 1997, has increased EAS carriers\u2019 costs for operating 19-seat turboprop  aircraft. Through the rule, FAA intended to increase safety by requiring  aircraft in the 10-to-30 passenger range to meet more stringent safety  requirements. The increased safety standards made some aircraft,  including 19-seat turboprop aircraft, more costly to operate, because they  required carriers to improve ground deicing programs, carry additional  safety equipment for passengers, and comply with additional operating  constraints. For example, an industry group, in a petition to DOT for  exemptions from this rule, provided information showing that one EAS  carrier\u2019s training costs increased by almost 600 percent because of the  additional training required for its captains by the revised rule. An EAS  carrier official stated that the carrier\u2019s cost to operate 19-seat aircraft,  calculated as cost per passenger seat mile, is now about twice what it was  in 1994 primarily due to these additional regulatory requirements.  According to industry representatives, the increased operating costs  associated with the required safety upgrades have contributed to some  carriers\u2019 decisions to eliminate their inventory of 19-seat planes. As a  result, there are fewer airlines with the type of equipment suitable to serve  most EAS routes.", "The EAS minimum service requirements may also require a carrier to  provide more service than needed to meet the demands of a community  and can therefore increase the carrier\u2019s operating costs. For example, the  EAS program statutes stipulate a minimum level of service for EAS  subsidized routes\u2014two daily round-trip flights, 6 days per week to a hub  airport. Carriers flying 19-seat aircraft can be effectively locked into  service that may not be right sized\u2014that is, with capacity exceeding  passenger demand\u2014for some smaller markets, and possibly more costly  than necessary to fulfill communities\u2019 service needs. If the need to meet  EAS program requirements results in carriers providing more capacity  than some communities might be able to support, EAS service to those  communities may be too costly for the carrier, leading it to withdraw from  the EAS program.", "Further, the carriers\u2019 2-year agreements with DOT to provide EAS service  can complicate the carriers\u2019 efforts to lease aircraft to serve EAS routes.  For example, some industry officials maintain that the 2-year agreements  that DOT enters into with carriers can be too short because carriers often  must lease aircraft for longer periods, such as 5 years. Therefore, a carrier  entering into a 5-year lease to obtain aircraft to serve EAS routes risks  having to maintain excess aircraft if it loses the routes after 2 years.  However, DOT officials note that under the EAS program\u2019s current funding  structure, longer-term agreements would still be subject to availability of  annual funding, so the agreement would not be guaranteed.", "Finally, spikes in fuel prices may add to EAS carriers\u2019 costs and make it  difficult to continue service. Although fuel prices typically vary over time,  in 2008 fuel began to comprise an increasing portion of airlines\u2019 costs, in  some cases contributing to carriers ceasing operations. For example, one  EAS carrier reported that its fuel costs increased from 28 percent of its  operating costs in 2007 to 35 percent of its operating costs in 2008,  although fuel prices began to decline late that year. We also found that last  year, selected EAS carriers experienced a rapid and dramatic spike in fuel  prices, as the average per-gallon fuel price for selected EAS carriers more  than doubled between January 2007 and July 2008, before declining  through December 2008, as illustrated in figure 5. December 2008 was that  latest month for which fuel price data were available for these carriers.", "Legislation passed in 2003 explicitly provided DOT with the option of  adjusting the subsidy paid to an EAS carrier if the carrier\u2019s expenses  substantially increased. However, according to an industry group that  represents regional airlines and the majority of EAS carriers, DOT officials  are generally not willing to renegotiate EAS agreements to reflect  increased costs because the DOT officials are concerned about retaining  sufficient funds to renegotiate the agreements and provide service for all  the communities that may qualify for service. DOT officials indicated they  are also concerned that establishing a policy of renegotiating subsidies  upward for fuel costs could lead carriers to underestimate fuel costs in  order to be selected as the carrier for a route, only to turn around soon  after selection and ask for fuel rate relief. However, industry officials  explained that if a carrier is unwilling to continue providing service under  an EAS agreement because of operating cost increases, the carrier\u2019s only  recourse is to file a formal Notice of Termination with DOT of its intent to  terminate service. For example, in June 2008, Mesaba Airlines filed such a  notice informing DOT of its intent to terminate service at two communities  in Michigan because of fuel price increases. Mesaba indicated that it  would withdraw the notice if DOT agreed to apply a fuel adjustment to  bring the EAS subsidy rate for the communities in line with current fuel  conditions. DOT denied the request and rebid the routes. DOT eventually  reselected Mesaba Airlines to serve the routes and awarded the airline a 28  percent increase over its previous annual subsidy for the routes. Still,  industry and small airport officials said that filing a termination notice is  an undesirable option for airlines because service interruptions and carrier  turnover can negatively affect communities\u2019 confidence in EAS service,  and result in a further reduction in ridership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Declining Number of Willing Carriers Reduces Competition for EAS Routes", "paragraphs": ["As the pool of carriers willing to provide EAS service declines,  competition for EAS routes has also declined. For example, of the 37  routes that DOT awarded after three EAS carriers in 2008 ceased  operations, 20 were awarded without competition, including 7 that were  awarded to the one viable bidder remaining after the only other bidder  went out of business. However, DOT officials informed us that their  sealed-bid process prevents carriers from knowing whether there are  competing bids from other carriers. They also indicated that they can  reject bids that they believe are too high, and they can negotiate with the  carrier. For instance, the officials cited a recent example of one carrier\u2019s  subsidy request of approximately $2.3 million being negotiated down to  about $1.6 million.

By comparison, the average load factor  for unsubsidized commercial flights nationwide has averaged about 80  percent in recent years. Two factors may contribute to the lack of  passenger traffic on EAS flights. First, the EAS program has always served  areas with limited population, but demographic shifts in the last 30 years  may have reduced the population of some EAS communities, further  limiting the potential passenger base for the local airport. Second, the EAS  program loses potential passengers and fare revenue when low fares or  more convenient air service schedules at nearby larger airports encourage  passengers to bypass EAS service at their local airport in favor of driving  or taking other transportation to the nearby airport."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Continued Urbanization of the United States May Lead to Reduced Passenger Ridership in Some EAS Markets", "paragraphs": ["A significant degree of urbanization occurred throughout the 20th century  as people moved out of rural areas and into cities and suburbs.

As a result, certain areas of the country are less densely  populated than they were 30 years ago when Congress initiated the EAS  program. Accordingly, some EAS communities\u2019 reduction in ridership may  be attributable, in part, to a smaller population base.", "Airports generally attract passengers from the surrounding population.  However, people who live near smaller airports often choose to either  drive to their destination or use larger airports that are farther away than  their local airport. This phenomenon is typically referred to as \u201cleakage.\u201d  Surveys of passengers as well as travel agents in communities served by  small airports suggest that leakage can be widespread. For example, a  travel agent survey in Arizona estimated that the small airports in that  state often suffer significant leakage, in some cases as much as 90  percent. Another study we conducted found that EAS airports often  serve less than 10 percent of the local passenger traffic, and that leakag is a significant factor. Moreover, it appears that some people may be  willing to drive considerable distances\u2014more than 150 miles\u2014to get to a  larger airport. The loss of passengers from an EAS route reduces the  carrier\u2019s fare revenues, while increasing the average per-passenger subsidy for that EAS service. Therefore, significant passenger leakage can lead to  (1) the carrier seeking a larger subsidy from DOT, (2) the community  losing service if the per-passenger subsidy rises above the $200 cap, or (3)  the route becoming so costly for the carrier that it chooses to file a notice  of intent to terminate service.", "Certain key factors appear to underlie the propensity of travelers to  bypass small airports in favor of driving to larger airports.", "Fares for EAS flights are generally high, relative to fares on  comparable unsubsidized flights. We analyzed calendar year 2007 fares  on routes involving EAS airports and compared these fares to the fares for  routes of similar distances involving only non-EAS airports. We found that  fares for EAS routes tend to be considerably higher\u2014on average about 50  percent higher\u2014than fares for similarly distanced non-EAS routes. Our  analysis did not attempt to identify reasons for the difference in fares  between EAS and unsubsidized flights, but likely factors that could include  the number of airlines serving the route, the number of passengers, and  the portion of passengers paying the generally higher business fares on  that route. Whatever the cause, relatively high fares for EAS flights can  make those flights less attractive, compared to the alternative of driving to  another airport. Studies of the use of airports in small communities have  generally found that passengers may drive to nearby larger airports to  obtain lower fares rather than use EAS service.", "The growth of low-cost carriers has created alternatives to EAS  service. Fifteen of 18 experts on our panel cited the expansion of low-cost  carriers as one of the biggest challenges facing EAS providers, and 9 of  these panelists cited low-cost carrier expansion as the most important  challenge to EAS providers. In the past decade, low-cost carriers have  considerably expanded their networks; these carriers\u2019 share of domestic  airline capacity increased from 20 percent in 2000 to 29 percent in 2007. By  2007, low-cost carriers were serving virtually every large and medium-hub  airport in the country as well as half of the small hubs. As low-cost carriers  have extended service to more airports around the country, they provide  more alternatives for community residents who can drive or take other  transportation to other airports to get lower air fares offered by these  carriers. Many industry stakeholders have said, and a previous GAO  study has found, that community residents who reside near an EAS  airport drive to other airports to obtain lower airfares, such as those that  low-cost carriers offer.", "Larger airports tend to offer better service than that available at  EAS airports. Larger airports are generally more attractive to travelers  than small airports served by EAS flights because they offer more frequent  flights and more nonstop destinations. EAS communities receive at least  the required two daily round-trip flights, 6 days per week\u2014although some  communities receive more. Still, most EAS routes connect a community to  a single airport. Such limited service may be too inconvenient to meet the  needs of time-sensitive business travelers. Studies have found that a key  reason passengers avoid small airports is the more frequent flight offerings  at larger airports, which can be more convenient for travelers. So, if  driving to a larger airport is feasible, a traveler from a community may  choose that option to get a nonstop flight to his or her destination, instead  of taking an EAS flight from the local community airport.", "Difficulties in making useful connections at the hub airports EAS  carriers serve also discourage potential EAS passengers. For most  EAS passengers, the hub airport where their EAS flight lands is not the  end of their trip. Typically, EAS passengers need to transfer to a  connecting flight to take them to their final destination. If the EAS flight  takes passengers out of their way and increases their trip time, they may  seek alternative travel options. Even if the EAS flight takes them in the  direction of their final destination, limited EAS flight schedules may  provide poor connection options. A representative of an airport in Iowa  served by EAS-subsidized flights to Kansas City said it is hard to get  business people to use the EAS flights because the flights often don\u2019t  match up well with the timing of connecting flights at Kansas City,  resulting in long waiting times there. These problems promote passenger  leakage away from EAS flights, when potential EAS passengers decide that  traveling directly to larger airports is more practical. The problem is  exacerbated as major carriers cut back their flights at the hub airports that  are EAS destinations. For example, according to an official of one EAS  carrier, connecting seats on flights out of two of their destination airports  have decreased, reducing options for connecting flights, making the  carrier\u2019s EAS service to these airports less practical for passengers. As a  result, the official said the carrier\u2019s revenue on the routes serving these  airports has declined significantly because potential passengers have  decided to use other transportation to travel to a larger airport.", "Problems with EAS service reliability are another deterrent to  using EAS service. Five of the seven representatives of EAS-served small  airports who responded to our questions noted that the reliability of EAS  service was a significant concern. According to one of these airport  representatives, delays, cancellations, and route and schedule changes are  commonplace in most EAS communities. Another airport representative  noted that reliability of air service may be even more important at small  airports than at larger airports, because a cancelled or delayed EAS flight  leaves passengers with no other options.

For communities with low passenger volume, this may be a more  practical option than underutilized scheduled service.

Also, current EAS routes  typically connect a community to just a single destination. On-demand  service could still take community passengers to the hub, but it could also  go to any airport within the range of the service\u2019s aircraft. These features  could make air service more useful to the community, increase demand,  and make the operation more commercially viable. However, current EAS  statutes require scheduled service by carriers and would have to be  revised by Congress to accommodate air-taxi-type services. Additionally,  current commercial air taxi services are relatively expensive. It may be  hard to predict what such a service would cost under EAS, or the level of  subsidy it would require, until it is tried.", "Alternatively, a community that cannot support EAS service within the  subsidy limit might be better served through ground transportation. In  many parts of the country, motorcoach companies and passenger rail  already deliver passengers to large hub airports. For example, according  to an American Bus Association official, motorcoach companies transport  more than 2.5 million passengers annually from Maine, Vermont, and New  Hampshire to Boston\u2019s Logan Airport. The official said that about half of  the communities currently in the EAS program are also served by  motorcoach companies, which in some cases even provide community-to- hub airport service that competes with EAS service.

They noted that a multimodal approach to  providing transportation assistance to small communities would likely  face opposition from communities if they were to lose air service. In  addition, it would create concerns about the potential source of funding  because current DOT funding is largely \u201cstove-piped\u201d through funds that  support\u2014and are financed by\u2014specific transportation modes. For  example, federal funding for airports and aviation primarily comes from  the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is funded by several aviation- related excise taxes. Federal funding for highways is provided through the  Highway Trust Fund which is supported by motor fuel and other vehicle- related taxes. Experts on our panel and others said a multimodal approach  can also result in different transportation modes \u201ccompeting\u201d for funds, as  advocates for the various transportation modes may oppose any change  that is seen as diverting funds dedicated to one transportation mode to  support another.

Reconsidering the design of federal  programs\u2014-such as the EAS program\u2014requires a variety of information,  and methods exist that can help develop such critical data. For example,  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis can be used to evaluate  community access to transportation\u2014both to air service and to other  modes. In general, GIS applications are tools in which varied geographic  information is compiled to enable analyses based on the relationship of  one element, such as communities, to another element, in this case, modes  of transportation. These tools have become critical in the field of  transportation planning and management over the past 30 years. Such  analyses can be used to evaluate transportation options, and help develop  cost-of-service estimates. We analyzed the access that different groups of  communities have to the various transportation modes by mapping those  communities along with the availability of the transportation modes. The  goal was to take a fresh look at community access to transportation  networks in the geographic context that exists today\u2014a less rural society  and potentially different transportation options than existed 30 years ago  when the EAS program was conceived.", "The goal of our analysis is to use information on community  demographics, access to transportation modes, and other relevant factors  to illustrate how these key factors could be considered in developing an  approach to ensuring access to air service or other modes of  transportation.

We selected  communities that had a population of between 10,000 and 500,000 people  and that were at least 90 miles from the nearest medium- or large-hub  airport. It would have been possible to select different sized communities  or those that were either closer or farther from a medium or large hub. For  selected communities, proximity to various types of airports, passenger  rail stations, and entry ramps onto major highways were considered. This  enabled comparisons across the communities as to their relative access to  varied transportation modes. In appendix IV we provide outcomes of the  analyses we performed to illustrate how GIS analysis can be used to re- evaluate small community transportation options.

They acknowledge that this access may have  diminished because of a recent reduction of Greyhound bus terminals and  a portion of an Amtrak line. To get an even better idea of how connected  the country is, DOT is continuing to work on an intermodal passenger  connectivity project that involves cataloging and geographically plotting  all transportation facilities in the United States and indicating what modes  serve these facilities to develop a database of this information.

Further,  the Office of Management and Budget most recently evaluated the EAS  program under its Program Assessment Rating Tool in 2006 and found the  program does not have enough long-term performance measures that  focus on outcomes and meaningfully reflect the purpose of the program.  The EAS program\u2019s current annual performance measures include one  long-term measure that addresses program performance in a specific  way\u2014maintaining continuous air service at 98 percent of eligible  communities.

Changes in the air  service industry, including the growth of air travel alternatives provided by  low-cost carriers, have changed the environment in which the EAS  program operates. However, some legislative EAS program requirements,  and the growing cost to operate aircraft for EAS service, contribute to the  program\u2019s inability to maintain service to EAS communities. Further, rural  population shifts since deregulation, and continuing passenger leakage  away from small airports with EAS service combine to limit passenger  ridership on EAS flights. These factors contribute to the continuing  financial strain on the EAS program which brings its long-term viability  into question.", "A re-examination of the EAS program, assessing options to make the  program more sustainable and effective, and the development of  performance measures to monitor program performance, may be  warranted. Many options to help address the problems and limitations the  current program faces exist. However, making these decisions is difficult;  and Congress has yet to implement any of these options. These decisions  are difficult because no one option may work for all communities. Options  to change the program requirements might be necessary to sustain EAS.  Further, in some locations it might be beneficial to study air taxi and  multi-modal approaches to ensuring small and rural communities are  connected to the national transportation network.", "Finally, if decisions are reached to revise the program design, steps should  be taken to implement and monitor the program.

Our review focused on communities within  the 48 states of the continental United States that have received EAS  subsidized service.

We selected 2003 as our base year because that was the  first full year DOT required carriers to file air traffic activity in a uniform  reporting system. DOT provided the information about EAS communities,  associated subsidies, and carrier enplanements in a series of excel  schedules. The schedules document EAS service only as of a specific dates  and therefore do not represent a continuous picture of service provided  under the EAS program. To assess the reliability of the community and  subsidy information in the schedules, we selected a random sample of the  subsidy award information in the schedules and traced the information  back to the DOT order where DOT officially announced its agreement with  a carrier to serve an EAS route. DOT issues its orders via its docket,  accessible at www.regulations.gov. However, we could not assess the  reliability of the carrier\u2019s enplanement data in the schedules. To do so  would have required a comprehensive review of DOT orders to identify the  carrier serving each route, the destination hub, when the carrier initiated  service on each route, and when the carrier either suspended or  terminated service. Because the schedules do not represent a continuous  picture of service provided under the EAS program, our review of DOT  orders would also be incomplete.

The program  had the particular goal of ensuring that communities that had commercial  airline service in the regulated era retained that service even if the newly  deregulated airlines chose not to provide service to some of those  locations. Given that goal, the communities that were eligible for the  program were essentially those that had had airline service at in 1978.", "Thirty years later much has changed in the industry and in the country.  The country has experienced demographic shifts, automobiles are of  better quality, and the airline industry has continually restructured itself. If  the EAS program\u2014or any program that promotes access to the national  transportation network\u2014is to be re-examined, consideration of these  developments is warranted. The goal of our analysis is to use information  on community demographics, access to transportation modes, and other  relevant factors to provide illustrations of how these key factors could be  considered in developing an approach to ensuring access to air service or  other modes of transportation. Our intent is not to point to any particular  program structure, but rather to illuminate the type of information that can  be brought forth to help policymakers answer those questions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Settlement Patterns and Key Industry Factors Could be Considered in Re-examination of Subsidy Program", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the 20th century, a significant degree of urbanization occurred  as people moved out of rural areas and into cities and their suburbs.  Although much of this migration occurred during the early and middle  parts of the 20th century, the trend has continued. Figure 8 illustrates how  rural areas, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains states, lost  population between 1980 and 2007. This migration left areas of the country  less densely populated than they were 30 years ago when the EAS program  was initiated. To the extent that the provision of unsubsidized commercial  air service is a function of the size of the local market, information on the  shifting settlement patterns might be a useful input into a re-examination  of a transportation access program.", "Along with demographic shifts, the airline industry has changed since  deregulation. Airlines have continually restructured their route networks,  fleet mix, and pricing structures. New airlines with varied business plans  have entered the industry, some airlines have exited the industry  (sometimes through bankruptcy), airlines have formed alliances, and the  manner in which airlines meet in the marketplace and compete has been  dynamic. One of the most significant elements of the industry\u2019s  development has been the entry and growth of low-cost carriers over the  past decade. These carriers developed different route networks than the  so-called \u201clegacy\u201d carriers, used different pricing structures, and generally  charged lower fares. Evidence suggests that, to obtain lower fares,  passengers are often willing to drive to a distant airport where a low-cost  carrier offers service. This availability may thus have created new travel  options for residents of remote communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characterization of Community Access to Transportation Could Be Based on Demographic and Geographic Information", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, our goal was to evaluate current community access to air  and other transportation modes. Here, we define access as the point at  which the traveler begins her journey on an airplane, on an interstate  highway, or on an intercity passenger train. Because travelers from any  given community could be going anywhere in the world, we do not assess  access relative to reaching any particular destination. That could be done,  say with respect to travel to a major medial facility, and could be  appropriate depending on how the transportation needs of a community  are framed. Our intent here is to show, in the most general way, how  geospatial analysis is a useful analytical tool for analyzing EAS or any  other program that aims to provide access to the national transportation  network.", "To allow comparison of communities\u2019 access to transportation modes, we  made a number of informed but ultimately arbitrary assumptions about  what size communities to include and how to define access to commercial  air service in terms of distance to an air embarkation point. An advantage  of geospatial analysis is that these thresholds may be easily varied to  determine the sensitivity of the results to different assumptions. The  analysis we describe illustrates the potential for this approach to  understanding access.", "Specifically, because we know that settlement patterns have shifted since  the inception of the EAS program, we examine communities in a  contemporary setting. In particular, we considered all urbanized areas\u2014 based on the most recent Census information\u2014in the lower 48 states;  there are 3,569 urbanized areas. At deregulation in 1978, Congress was  specific about which communities would be eligible for subsidies to  ensure continuation of scheduled air service\u2014the communities were  those that had or were eligible for scheduled air service under the Civil  Aeronautics Board\u2019s regulatory regime when the industry was deregulated  and airlines were given the ability to choose what routes they would fly. In  today\u2019s setting, the underlying concept of which communities should be  ensured service might translate as a concern about the vulnerability of  communities to loss of commercial air service or an inability of  communities to attract commercial air service.", "So, for our analysis, we asked \u201cWhich communities are most likely to  encounter difficulty attracting, retaining, or expanding air service?\u201d We did  not consider those with fewer than 10,000 people based on the assumption  that it would not be feasible, in terms of the federal budget or airline  operating capacity, to extend service to many relatively small places. The  remaining 1,284 communities, those with populations between 10,000 and  less than 500,000, include 36 percent of all urbanized areas and account for  about 25 percent of the U.S. population.", "Within this group of 1,284 communities, there are those that can be  considered relatively close to an airport of considerable size, defined as a  medium or large hub. While the EAS program uses a 70-mile criterion for  that element of eligibility, we ran an analysis using 90 highway miles. This  increase in distance was motivated by the general improvement of  automobiles over the past 30 years. With this threshold in place the  number of urbanized areas in our base-case analysis dropped to 727.", "Across the 727 communities in the group of interest (with population  between 10,000 and less than 500,000 and more than 90 miles from a  medium or large hub), there is variation in access to scheduled  commercial air service. Some of these communities may be close to small  air hubs or have some less frequent commercial service. Others may not  have an airfield at all. However, because communities in this set are all  distant from the busiest air hubs, their access to air transport is vulnerable  to reductions or elimination of nearby commercial service or is precluded  by their inability to retain or to attract service at all. Relative to other  communities, then, their access to medium- and large-hub airports may be  compromised by their remoteness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Community Access to Transportation Modes Can be Expressed by Means of an Index of Relative Access", "paragraphs": ["While the community group of interest has been defined with respect to  access to air service, we want to describe the range of travel options  available to travelers. So, we consider community access to the interstate  highway system and to passenger rail service as well as airline travel. As  with air service, access is defined in terms of the driving distance, distance  to an on-ramp for interstate access and, for passenger rail, distance to an  Amtrak passenger station or to a bus link to a passenger station. Interstate  access may mean travel by car or by bus, but that distinction is not made  in our analysis because we did not have ready access to bus schedules for  the 727 communities. In addition, we did not make any distinctions  regarding level of service, including time of day or frequency. For  example, if Amtrak stops at a community at 3:00 am, this clearly impacts  access, but we did not consider that limitation. Similarly, service at some  medium hubs may not be considered very extensive in terms of the  number of places one can travel to on a nonstop flight.", "Geospatial analysis allows us to compute distances to access points for  each community, and we can use those distances to measure and compare  communities\u2019 access to one or multiple modes. We constructed a set of  simple indices that allow characterization of each community\u2019s access to  air, rail, and/or train service relative to the other communities. In our  analysis, the denominator is the average distance to the transportation  mode for the 727 communities.", "If a community has an index value of 100 for its access to air  transportation, it means that its distance from a medium- or large-hub  airport, among the communities evaluated, is average. A higher index  value signifies a more remote community than average, and a lower index  value signifies a community is nearer to that mode than average. Figure 9  shows the 727 communities\u2019 access to medium- or large-hub airports as  measured by this index. Communities denoted with triangles are further  from a medium- or large-hub airport than is average for the set of  communities, and communities denoted with circles are closer to such an  airport than is average for the set of communities. We found that the  average distance from a medium- or large-hub airport was 173 miles. Of  these 727 communities, 454 were within 173 miles and 273 were farther  than 173 miles, some as much as 682 miles away. As can be seen,  communities that are more remote than the average of 170 miles from air  transportation are found mainly in the Intermountain West, the Plain  states, the Mississippi Delta, and in Appalachia. Comparing this result with  the map documenting shifts in population shows that these areas are also  the ones that generally experienced population declines between 1980 and  2007.", "Figures 10 and 11 show the same communities\u2019 relative access to highways  and passenger rail, as represented by index values.", "Considering access to the interstate highway system (figure 10), for these  727 communities, the average distance to an on-ramp is 33 miles. Sixty-five  percent are within 33 miles (circles), with the other 35 percent (triangles)  more than 33 miles away, and some as many as 335 miles away. Again,  those farthest away from the interstates, in the Plains especially, are also  areas that have experienced population loss. For access to passenger rail  (figure 11), the patterns are similar to those for access to the interstate.", "To obtain a perspective on communities that are the most remote, for  figure 12 the index is calculated to characterize access across modes.  Equal weight is given to access across modes, but it is clearly possible to  apply different weights to the separate modes\u2019 index values, reflecting  greater emphasis on access to one mode (say, air) versus another. Here  again, 60 percent of the 727 communities have better-than-average access  to the transportation network (via any mode), while 40 percent are  relatively remote. The fact that some communities\u2019 index values are very  large demonstrates the heterogeneity in access across the 727, suggesting  very different degrees of remoteness even among communities that are  distant from medium- or large-hub airports. Because both distance and  population density matter in the provision of transportation services, this  heterogeneity will figure importantly in weighing the costs and benefits of  supporting or subsidizing access to the transportation network.", "Our analysis identified 727 communities within a range of population of  10,000 to less than 500,000 that are alike in that they do not have ready  access to the nation\u2019s busiest medium- and large-air hubs. We then  calculated index values that allowed us to characterize the extent of  remoteness from interstate highways and passenger rail stops. Different  criteria will produce different groupings of communities in terms of how  connected they are to the national transportation system. Supplementing  the information provided by the index values with knowledge about actual  levels of air service (at small hubs or airfields) and about bus and rail  service would provide a frame for considering transportation policy goals.", "One way this analysis can be useful in considering the EAS program  specifically is to ask which of these 727 currently are served by EAS  (defined as being located within 40 miles of an EAS airport). And, which  EAS communities are not included among the 727, that is, how many EAS  communities are in proximity to the nation\u2019s busiest air hubs, or have  fewer than 10,000 residents? Figure 13 shows that about 17 percent (123)  of these communities have EAS service.", "Recognizing the changes in the structure of the airline industry, a  community\u2019s proximity to an airport served by a low-cost carrier might be  another way of characterizing access to the air transport network. In  Figure 14, we identify which of the 727 communities are within 150 driving  miles of such an airport. Here, we find that 92 percent have access to low- cost carrier at airports outside their communities.", "With respect to the EAS program as it exists today, our analysis suggests  that there is heterogeneity across those communities that currently have  EAS service in terms of size and distance to the nation\u2019s busiest airports or  airports served by low-cost carriers. And, it suggests that there are other  communities whose relatively limited access to the air transport network  might warrant consideration of alternatives for connection to the nation\u2019s  transportation network, whether air or road or rail."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Cathy Colwell, Assistant Director;  Amy Abramowitz; Richard Brown; Colin Fallon; David Hooper; Don  Kittler; Hannah Laufe; John Mingus; Susan Offutt; and Bonnie Pignatiello  Leer made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
