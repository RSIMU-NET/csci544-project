To help face these challenges and manage projects with greater efficiency and accountability, NASA recently updated its program and project management policy and is developing an agencywide systems engineering policy.

For example, NASA's policy requires projects to conduct a major decision review before moving from formulation to implementation. Further, before moving from formulation to implementation, projects must validate requirements and develop realistic cost and schedule estimates, human capital plans, a preliminary design, and a technology plan--key elements for matching needs to resources. However, NASA's policies do not require projects to demonstrate technologies at high levels of maturity before program start. By not establishing a minimum threshold for technology maturity, NASA increases the risk that design changes will be required later in development, when such changes are typically more costly to make. In addition, although NASA's policy does require project managers to establish a continuum of technical and management reviews, it does not specify what these reviews should be, nor does it require major decision reviews at other key points in a product's development. Acquiring knowledge at key junctures will become increasingly important as NASA proceeds to implement elements of the Vision. Without a major decision review at key milestones to ensure that the appropriate level of knowledge has been achieved to proceed to the next phase, the risk of cost and schedule overruns, as well as performance shortfalls, increases. NASA centers have varying approaches for implementing the agency's policies and guidance. Some centers have established product development criteria that are similar to the criteria used in a knowledge-based acquisition, while other centers have not. As a result, each center reports a different level and type of knowledge about a project at key decision points. Centers also rely on project managers and systems engineers to employ good project management and systems engineering practices. However, given the loss of experienced project managers and the decline of in-house systems engineering and technical capabilities, that reliance could be problematic. These situations make it difficult for decision makers to evaluate projects on the same basis and make sound investment decisions and tradeoffs based on those evaluations. A standardized, knowledge-based approach would prepare NASA to face competing budgetary priorities and better position the agency to make difficult decisions regarding the investment in and termination of projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) plans to  spend over $100 billion to develop new capabilities and technologies  critical to supporting the initial goals outlined in the President\u2019s   2004 Vision for Space Exploration (see fig. 1 for a conceptual drawing of  NASA\u2019s proposed crew vehicle). The Vision, which NASA has  characterized as bold, includes plans to explore the moon, Mars, and  beyond. Despite many successes, such as landing the Pathfinder and  Exploration Rovers on Mars, NASA has had difficulty carrying out a  number of other missions, such as the X-33, a technology demonstrator for  future reusable launch vehicles, because the agency was overly optimistic  in what could be achieved within available resources. NASA\u2019s failure to  define requirements adequately and quantify the resources needed to meet  those requirements resulted in some projects costing more, taking longer,  and achieving less than originally planned.

We also interviewed  NASA headquarters officials from the Office of the Chief Engineer  responsible for the policy and guidance. In addition, we reviewed NASA  center-specific program and project management policies and systems  engineering policies, as they relate to flight systems and ground support  projects, and interviewed officials responsible for implementing those  policies.

Further, we reported that the sources of these  problems were not new and that NASA failed to consistently apply lessons  previously learned. The failures identified in our 2002 report were in part  the result of the \u201cfaster, better, cheaper\u201d approach to managing its major  acquisitions, which NASA adopted in the 1990s.", "These problems, along with others, highlighted the need for the agency to  reevaluate its approach to cost and schedule estimating, risk assessments,  technology development, project reviews, and systems engineering. In  1998, NASA adopted a new program and project management policy,  which was revised in 2002. The policy provided significant flexibility,  including allowing tailoring and projects to opt out of requirements at the  discretion of the project manager. In March 2005\u2014following a series of  internal and external assessments of NASA that showed that the agency  faced significant problems with project management\u2014NASA again revised  its program and project management policy, which includes policy  requirements for the development of flight systems and ground support  projects. According to NASA officials, further changes to the policy are  anticipated in light of new agency leadership.", "The March 2005 policy document, NASA Procedural Requirement (NPR)  7120.5C, differs from previous versions of the policy in that it delineates  requirements based on four NASA investment areas: Basic and Applied  Research, Advanced Technology Development, Flight Systems and Ground   Support, and Institutional Infrastructure. The policy also reinstitutes a life  cycle phased approach to product development and institutes a project  categorization scheme, based on project cost and priority, which denotes  the oversight authorities and the level of detail that is needed to support  project planning documents. See figure 2 below.", "NASA has also attempted to address some of its cost-estimating  weaknesses by instituting a cost analysis data requirement (CADRe) and  establishing thresholds for the use of earned value management (EVM).  Another major change to the policy is the establishment of the  Independent Technical Authority (ITA). According to the policy, the  purpose of ITA is to establish sound technical requirements and decisions  for safe and reliable system operations separate from the project  management and reporting chain. Finally, agency officials told us that  while the requirements in previous versions of the policy were easy to  tailor, projects now must document compliance with the requirements in a  \u201ccompliance matrix\u201d and must request and have approved any deviations  and/or waivers to requirements.", "Although NPR 7120.5C contains some mandatory requirements with  regard to systems engineering, according to agency officials, NASA has  never had an agencywide systems engineering policy to inform the  development of flight systems and ground support projects. Since 1995, in  the absence of a policy on systems engineering, project managers and  systems engineers have relied on information contained in NASA\u2019s  Systems Engineering Handbook to guide their systems engineering  approach on projects. Project managers and systems engineers, however,  are not required to follow the handbook. Recognizing the need for a more  structured and rigorous approach to systems engineering agencywide,  NASA\u2019s Office of the Chief Engineer is currently leading the effort to  develop a systems engineering policy.

To determine available resources, successful  developers rely on current and valid information from predecessor  projects, new technologies that have demonstrated a high level of  maturity, system engineering data, and experienced people.

Consequently,  projects can enter the implementation phase with immature technologies  and embark on a risky path of having to build technology, design, and  production knowledge concurrently. Our best practices work has shown  that maturing technologies during the preliminary design phase and before  entering product development is a key element of matching needs to  resources and that there is a direct relationship between the maturity of  technologies and the risk of cost and schedule growth. Allowing  technology development to carry over into the product development phase  increases the risk that significant problems will be discovered late in  development. Addressing such problems at this stage may require  extensive retrofitting and redesign as well as retesting, which can  jeopardize performance and result in more time and money to fix. This  approach also makes it more difficult for projects to demonstrate the same  level of design stability in later phases of implementation since technology  and design activities will be done concurrently.", "Technology readiness levels (TRL)\u2014a concept developed by NASA\u2014can  be used to gauge the maturity of individual technologies.

To make this determination and reach  KP2, successful developers use specific, knowledge-based standards and  criteria. (See app. II for more information on the specific knowledge-based  standards and criteria successful developers use to judge readiness to  proceed beyond detailed design activities.)", "Successful developers also demand proof that manufacturing processes  are in control and product reliability goals are attained before committing  to production.

(See fig. 6.) Although NPR 7120.5C requires that projects  document in the project plan a continuum of technical and management  reviews, such as a PDR and CDR, it does not require any specific reviews.  In addition, NASA\u2019s March 2005 policy does not require a NAR-type  decision review to ensure a project has obtained the knowledge needed to  proceed beyond the final design phase into the fabrication, assembly, and  test phase, which serves as both the demonstration and production phase  of the NASA life cycle. According to NASA officials, projects conduct a  CDR at the end of the final design phase to ensure adequate information is  available about product design and producibility before entering the  fabrication, assembly, and test phase. The CDR, however, is a technical  review\u2014not a major decision review like the NAR. Furthermore, the  policy does not establish criteria as to what constitutes successful  completion of a CDR.", "NASA\u2019s policy also does not require a major decision review before  beginning manufacturing. (See fig. 6 above.) Therefore, the transition from  final design to fabrication, assembly, and test often marks a de facto  production decision. According to NASA officials, the agency rarely enters  a formal production phase due to the small quantities of space systems  that they build. However, due to the high cost of failure associated with  NASA projects and the costs and risks involved in repairing a system   in-orbit, a major decision review at production that assesses product  reliability is essential even for these limited production systems. In  addition, although NASA\u2019s production quantities are typically low, in some  instances NASA does produce larger quantities of a system or subsystem,  such as the external tanks for the Space Shuttle. Furthermore, NASA\u2019s  plans indicate that the agency may be increasing production for elements  of their future systems. For example, NASA\u2019s Exploration Systems  Architecture Study indicates that NASA plans to build several new crew  exploration vehicles, with disposable elements, such as the lunar lander,  solid rocket boosters, and space shuttle main engines that will require  higher numbers of production runs.", "Rather than establish specific criteria by which all projects are judged,  NASA\u2019s policy requires that projects manage to baselines and plans  established in key management documents and approved at the project  NAR. The baselines and plans serve as their primary tools for measuring  project progress and as the primary basis for judgment at project reviews.  While the plans may include some information that addresses   knowledge-based criteria for design and production, the instructions for  preparing them leaves the establishment of thresholds and success criteria  to the discretion of the project manager. For example, NASA policy  requires that projects include, as part of the project plan, a Verification  and Validation Sub Plan that describes the project\u2019s approach to verifying  and validating hardware and software as part of the project plan. The  policy, however, includes no instruction as to what constitutes a sufficient  approach to testing. In other words, there are no requirements concerning  the fidelity of test articles or the realism of the test environment. Similarly,  NASA\u2019s policy requires that projects include, as part of the project plan, a  Systems Engineering Sub Plan that describes the project\u2019s approach to  systems engineering and the technical standards that are applicable,  including metrics that verify the processes. The policy, however, does not  identify the types of metrics appropriate to verify the process or establish  any threshold criteria.", "The absence of major decision reviews, along with specific criteria in the  fabrication, assembly, and test phase, could result in concurrent design  and manufacturing activities, a practice our past work has found increases  risk in acquisition programs. Furthermore, lacking a major decision  review to ensure that projects have gained the appropriate levels of  knowledge at KP2 and KP3, NASA decision makers cannot be provided a  high level of certainty that the project will meet cost, schedule, and  performance requirements and have no assurance that the provisions of  the key management documents required by NPR 7120.5C are being  executed after the NAR."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of NASA-Wide Project Management Criteria May Result in Investment Decisions Based on Inconsistent Information", "paragraphs": ["NASA centers have varying approaches to implementing project  management policies and systems engineering guidance for flight systems  and ground support projects.

We are pleased to hear that many knowledge-based practices identified in  our report are currently being practiced agencywide in the management  and development NASA systems. The addition of such practices to NASA\u2019s  policies will only strengthen their use agencywide and ensure that these  practices continue to be utilized by less experienced project managers and  systems engineers as the more experienced workforce retires. The  effectiveness of such practices, however, will be limited if project officials  are not held accountable for demonstrating a high level of knowledge,  consistent with the success criteria that NASA plans to require in its  policies, at key junctures in development. It is critical that project officials  not only have a high level of knowledge about a project at key junctures,  but also that this information is used by decision makers to make  decisions on whether to invest additional resources and allow a project to  proceed through the development life cycle.", "NASA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix III.
