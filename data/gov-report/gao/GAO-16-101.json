GAO found that about 15 percent of the RPAD lease records for fiscal year 2011 and 10 percent of the records for fiscal year 2013 were inaccurate. Most of these errors were in the lease records for the Army (the manager of about 80 percent of the leased assets records in RPAD); however, the Army is aware of these issues and is taking steps to correct future data. GAO also found that RPAD did not include about 5 percent of the Army's lease records for fiscal years 2011 and 2013. GAO conducted a random sample of the fiscal year 2013 RPAD data and found that the data element required to calculate costs was unreliable for 11 of the 84 Army sample records. GAO found that the Army was not following DOD's guidance for reporting costs on leases that have multiple assets associated with them. Furthermore, GAO found that RPAD does not contain a data element for the square footage for leases in which there are multiple tenants occupying space in the same building, as is the case for some Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) leases.", "DOD is implementing a presidential memorandum and a series of Office of Management and Budget memorandums to maintain or reduce owned and leased space, but has projected minimal change to its leasing activities. There have been opportunities in the past to reduce its leased space; however, DOD reoccupied over 1.1 million square feet in leased space previously vacated when it implemented the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment recommendations. In some cases, DOD tenants occupy leased space close to large installations that may have had unused facilities. Potential force structure reductions may offer an opportunity to further reduce DOD's reliance on leased space in the future, if DOD actively identifies suitable underutilized facilities on its installations.", "DOD does not have complete oversight of the security assessments conducted for its leased facilities acquired through the General Services Administration (GSA). Facility security assessments, which are required to be conducted every 3 to 5 years, are conducted by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and the Federal Protective Service (FPS) using established standards. The Pentagon Force Protection Agency had completed the required assessments for the facilities for which it is responsible between August 8, 2013, and January 31, 2014. However, DOD has not requested information on whether FPS, the primary agency for protecting federal facilities, has completed its facility security assessments as required for all DOD-leased locations. GAO analyzed the FPS assessment data for fiscal years 2011 and 2013 and identified several issues: (1) some assessments were not scheduled within required time frames, (2) data on previously recorded assessment dates were overwritten when updated, and (3) dates for completed and next-scheduled assessments were not always recorded. While FPS is not required to inform DOD about assessment schedules, without periodically requesting information on whether facility security assessments have been conducted, DOD does not have the information it needs to ensure that its leased facilities are secure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends four actions to improve DOD's management of its leased facilities.

As discussed in the report, GAO believes that these recommendations remain valid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Overreliance on costly leasing is one of the reasons that federal real  property management remains on our high-risk list. Our work over the  years has shown that owning buildings often costs less than operating  leases, especially where there are long-term needs for space, although  under certain conditions\uf8e7such as fulfilling short-term needs for  administrative office space\uf8e7leasing may be a lower-cost option than  ownership. The General Services Administration (GSA) manages leased  facilities throughout the federal government and plays a significant role in  providing a safe, healthy, and secure environment for employees and  visitors to federal facilities. In September 2013, we reported that for 67 of  89 GSA leases we examined, the government could have saved almost  $1 billion if it had constructed rather than leased space for federal  agencies. The Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with  GSA, has designated responsibility for the security of federal facilities.  The Federal Protective Service, a component of the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s National Protection and Programs Directorate,  protects buildings, grounds, property, and the persons on the property  under the control and custody of GSA.", "In the 2005 defense base closure and realignment (BRAC) process, the  Department of Defense (DOD) proposed to the BRAC Commission 31  recommendations that involved relocating certain DOD activities from  leased space to government-owned space, which the Commission  approved. As part of the justification for some of these  recommendations, the Secretary of Defense noted that their  implementation would reduce DOD\u2019s reliance on leased space. The  Secretary further acknowledged in his justification for these  recommendations that leased space historically has higher overall costs  than government-owned space and generally does not meet antiterrorism  force-protection standards. In March 2015, the Acting Assistant Secretary  of Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment) testified that a 2004  DOD study concluded that DOD had 24 percent aggregate excess  infrastructure capacity and that the 2005 BRAC recommendations  disposed of only 3.4 percent of this excess.", "We have a body of work that has examined the federal government\u2019s  reliance on leased facilities. In addition, we testified before Congress in  May 2014 that assessing security risk at federal leased facilities remains  a challenge. As part of the 2005 leasing-related BRAC  recommendations, DOD planned to vacate about 12 million square feet of  leased space and move DOD tenants into more secure, functionally  enhanced, government-owned facilities. However, as we reported in  March 2013, DOD was unable to provide us with information on how  much of the 12 million square feet it had vacated by the conclusion of  BRAC implementation, because it had not developed a plan or  established a mechanism to monitor those changes over the 6-year  BRAC implementation period that ended on September 15, 2011. To  improve planning for measuring the results of implementing the BRAC  recommendations for a future BRAC, we recommended that DOD identify  appropriate measures of effectiveness and develop a plan to demonstrate  the extent to which the department achieved the results intended from the  implementation of the BRAC. DOD did not concur with our  recommendation, stating that military value, which is based on force  structure and mission needs, should continue to be the key driver for  BRAC and that a business plan process was used to ensure  recommendations were implemented. In our report, we emphasized that  there was nothing in our recommendation that undermined the reliance  on military value in making BRAC recommendations. We also  acknowledged benefits from the business plans that DOD uses. That  said, though, we reiterated that DOD\u2019s business plans are focused on the  implementation of individual BRAC recommendations and not on the  effectiveness of the BRAC process as a whole. In fact, we note that in  March 2012, DOD requested two more BRAC rounds, in part because it  has reported that it still maintains excess facilities capacity at some of its  military installations.", "House Report 113-102, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, included a provision that we  review various aspects of DOD\u2019s management of leased space. This  report addresses the extent to which DOD (1) has accurate and complete  data on the number, size, and costs of its leases; (2) has taken actions to  reduce its reliance on leased space since 2011; and (3) has oversight of  the status of security assessments conducted for its leased facilities  contracted through GSA.", "To determine whether DOD has accurate and complete data on the  number, size, and costs of its leases, we obtained and analyzed selected  data elements from the real property records contained in DOD\u2019s Real  Property Assets Database (RPAD), as well as data from the military  departments\u2019 and Washington Headquarters Services\u2019 (WHS) real  property inventory systems, for fiscal years 2011 and 2013. Specifically,  we analyzed selected data elements in the lease records for fiscal year  2011 (the final year of a 6-year period to implement the BRAC 2005  recommendations) and fiscal year 2013 (the most recent full year of data  available at the time we initiated this review) to determine whether these  data were sufficiently reliable to provide a basis for managing leases and  externally reporting information on leases. We drew a statistical random  sample of fiscal year 2013 data to assess the reliability of DOD\u2019s real  property lease data. The results of our analysis are generalizable across  all lease records for fiscal year 2013, with a 95 percent chance that the  difference between the estimated and the true population percentage is  within 10 percentage points. We also obtained lease data from GSA for  the real property assets it managed on behalf of DOD for fiscal years  2011 and 2013. However, GSA\u2019s real property management system does  not retain historical information; as a result, GSA researched old files and  compiled the information that was available in an attempt to satisfy our  data requests. Due to a lack of historical information for fiscal years 2011  and 2013, there were a number of inconsistencies in the data provided.  For example, lease numbers were not available for fiscal year 2011, and  the lease start and expiration dates were not available for fiscal year  2013. The lack of such data prevented us from conducting a year-to-year  comparison of the GSA data. However, we were able to use the data to  help us determine the process DOD uses to track its leases and to make  some comparisons of the GSA data with data contained in RPAD to  determine, among other things, what type of data is collected for  management purposes and whether duplicate records existed. We  gathered and analyzed documentation, such as DOD directives and  instructions and military-department guidance reflecting DOD\u2019s and the  military departments\u2019 management of real property and how DOD uses  the data in RPAD. We interviewed officials at the Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment), WHS, the  real property offices for each of the three military departments (which  include the four military services), and GSA to obtain information about  the management of their real property management systems. Based on  the results of our analysis, we determined that data from RPAD were  neither accurate nor complete, and therefore were not sufficiently reliable  for our use to determine the number of leases and the size and cost of  DOD\u2019s leased assets for fiscal years 2011 and 2013. Further data issues  are discussed within the findings of our report.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has taken actions to reduce its  reliance on leased space since 2011, we obtained and reviewed the 2005  Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission report and  identified recommendations for realigning and closing some DOD leased  facilities that had to be implemented by September 15, 2011. We also  reviewed DOD\u2019s 2013 Freeze the Footprint reports that were submitted to  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014the most current reports  available when we initiated this review\u2014to identify DOD\u2019s planned  initiatives to reduce its domestic office and warehouse space (including  both leased and owned space). We interviewed officials from the Office  of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations and  Environment) to discuss DOD\u2019s policies and ongoing initiatives involving  DOD\u2019s use of leased space. We also interviewed real property officials  from the Department of the Army and gathered documentation on its  initiatives regarding leased space that would assist them in meeting the  Freeze the Footprint requirements. We focused on the Army because, in  its role as executive agent for joint service programs and some defense  agencies, as well as its own mission needs, it has more leases than the  other military departments and WHS combined. We interviewed and  gathered documentation from officials at WHS to determine whether DOD  was reoccupying leased space previously vacated in the National Capital  Region as a result of the 2005 BRAC recommendations. The National  Capital Region was the primary focus of the 2005 BRAC  recommendations that involved moving DOD activities from leased space  to government-owned space. We obtained DOD reports on the number  and location of its leases and interviewed officials who maintain the  leases. We also reviewed our December 2013, report, which identifies  DOD installations that may have available administrative office space  based on the inactivations of 10 Army Brigade Combat Teams that are  expected to begin in fiscal year 2017. We then analyzed the lease data  elements from DOD\u2019s RPAD system for fiscal year 2013 to see if any  opportunities existed for DOD to reduce its leased space based on the  proximity of leased space to installations that could have additional  unutilized or underutilized buildings in the future as a result of planned  reductions in force structure. As noted earlier, we chose fiscal year 2013  data because those were the most recent data available at the time we  initiated this review.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has oversight of the status of  security assessments conducted for leased facilities contracted through  GSA, we obtained information regarding facility security assessments of  DOD leased space for fiscal years 2011 and 2013, the same fiscal years  for which we were reviewing DOD\u2019s lease records. We obtained data from  the Federal Protective Service to determine when facility security  assessments had been conducted and when the next security  assessments were scheduled. We reviewed and analyzed the Federal  Protective Service\u2019s tracking schedule for the facility security  assessments it performs for DOD\u2019s leased facilities. We also examined  the Federal Protective Service\u2019s facility assessment schedules for 500  leased facilities in fiscal year 2011 and 484 leased facilities in fiscal year  2013. Many of these facilities had multiple leases or occupancy  agreements. We also met with officials from the Federal Protective  Service to discuss inconsistencies and missing data that we found in its  facility security assessment data. Because some of the data were  incomplete and inaccurate, we determined that the Federal Protective  Service\u2019s schedule for conducting and tracking facility security  assessments was not sufficiently reliable to determine whether the facility  security assessments had been completed as required. We also reviewed  our August 2012 report in which we reported that the Federal Protective  Service\u2019s facility security assessments data contained a number of  missing and incorrect values that made the data unreliable to determine  the extent of their backlog of assessments that needed to be completed.  We discuss these data issues further in the findings of our report. We  reviewed DOD directives and instructions and other related  documentation to determine which DOD organization has oversight  responsibility for facility security assessments and physical security, and  the scope of this responsibility. We interviewed officials in the Office of  the Secretary of Defense with facility and security responsibilities, the  military departments, and WHS to obtain general information on the  status of their facilities meeting security requirements. We also met with  officials from the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and the Federal  Protective Service to obtain information on the standards and status of  facilities meeting security requirements. We also reviewed the Pentagon  Force Protection Agency\u2019s tracking schedule for the facility security  assessments it performs for the DOD leased facilities for which it is  responsible to determine whether required assessments had been  completed. We found that the Pentagon Force Protection Agency\u2019s data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Three DOD guidance documents\u2014DOD Directive  4165.06, DOD Instruction 4165.14, and DOD Instruction 4165.70\u2014 assign responsibilities for managing DOD\u2019s real property inventory to a  number of organizations, including the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), and the military departments.  DOD Directive 5110.4 assigns WHS responsibility for managing the DOD  leased facilities within the National Capital Region that are not managed  by the military departments. For real property accountability, DOD  Instruction 4165.70 provides WHS with the same responsibilities as the  military departments.", "DOD Directive 4165.06 assigns overall responsibility for DOD\u2019s real  property, including its leased assets, to the Under Secretary of Defense  (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics) and specific responsibilities to the  three military departments. DOD leases are categorized by four real  property types: (1) land; (2) buildings (roofed and floored facilities  enclosed by exterior walls and consisting of one or more levels that are  suitable for single or multiple functions); (3) linear structures (facilities  whose function requires that they traverse land [e.g., runway, road, rail  line, pipeline, fence, pavement, electrical distribution line] and are  reported by a linear unit of measure); and (4) structures (facilities other  than buildings or linear structures that are constructed on or in the land,  e.g., tower, storage tank, wharf, pier). DOD manages its real property  lease data by collecting and compiling designated asset-level data into  RPAD, which is the single authoritative source for all data on DOD\u2019s real  property inventory. RPAD includes real property records for owned and  leased assets that are directly managed by the military departments and  WHS. DOD Instruction 4165.70 requires the military departments and  WHS to keep accurate records of the real property assets\uf8e7including  leased facilities\uf8e7under their jurisdiction, custody, and control. It also  makes DOD real property administrators accountable for maintaining a  current inventory count and up-to-date information about the cost,  functional use, status, condition, and utilization of each real property unit  in the department\u2019s real property inventory, among other things.", "DOD Instruction 4165.14 requires that the annual real property inventory  submissions from the military departments and WHS comply with  DOD\u2019s Real Property Information Model, which provides the framework  for all real property data and any associated business rules. The model  contains nearly 240 data elements that are to be maintained in RPAD and  the data dictionary for using these elements. Each of the military  departments maintains its own real property inventory system to track  owned and leased assets that it manages. WHS uses a spreadsheet  based on DOD\u2019s Real Property Inventory Requirements to manage DOD  leased facilities in the National Capital Region that are not managed by  the military departments. At the end of each fiscal year, the military  departments and WHS are to transmit data from their real property  inventory systems to DOD for consolidation in RPAD, and the data is to  be certified by the military departments\u2019 and WHS\u2019s real property officers  as being as accurate and complete as possible. DOD has a verification  and validation process to determine whether each data element has an  entry that is in the correct format and complies with established business  rules. However, when data anomalies are discovered with the data  provided by the military departments and WHS, DOD would need to  provide the data back to the submitting organization for review and  correction as necessary.

The data for the leased assets that are  directly managed by the military departments and WHS are reported  annually in DOD\u2019s internal reports, such as its Base Structure Report,  and in its submission to the Federal Real Property Profile. Similarly,  GSA reports its own assets that DOD uses or assets that it acquires  under a lease on DOD\u2019s behalf in its annual submission to the Federal  Real Property Profile. According to RPAD managers, to avoid  duplication of assets in its annual submission to the Federal Real  Property Profile, DOD does not report any assets that are leased from  other federal agencies, including GSA.

These  rules are identified in DOD\u2019s Real Property Inventory Data Element  Dictionary. While we assessed all DOD RPAD lease records for fiscal  year 2011 and fiscal year 2013, the majority of errors were in the Army\u2019s  lease records. For example, we found that for some lease records, the  lease base annual dollar amount (hereafter referred to as \u201cannual rent,\u201d  which is the amount DOD pays annually for the use of a real property  asset, excluding additional costs such as utilities and parking, among  other things) was greater than the lease annual cost amount (hereafter  referred to as \u201cannual rent plus other costs,\u201d which is the annual rent plus  any additional costs defined in the lease, such as utilities and parking,  among other things).

We also found  that cost data were missing from other lease records. Another DOD  business rule states that for every leased asset there must be an annual  rent and an annual rent plus other costs recorded and the amount in each  data element must be greater than or equal to zero; the business rule  does not specify that the annual rent or annual rent plus other costs may  be empty or null.

Rather, only the total square footage of a real property asset (which may  include more than one lease) can be reported in RPAD. The lack of a  data element capturing the square footage for each lease of space in a  single building and the absence of any related guidance results in DOD  not having visibility of the actual square footage associated with each  lease.

As a result, the data from RPAD that identifies  the complete real property record for DOD leased assets (where there is  more than one lease for that asset) overstates the square footage  associated with each lease. For example, for a building that has one  tenant that occupies 27,975 square feet of space and another tenant that  occupies 2,246 square feet, RPAD shows 30,221 square feet for each  lease rather than the space that each tenant occupies.

DOD\u2019s justification to the 2005 BRAC  Commission for some of these recommendations was that leased space  is more costly than government-owned space and the existing leased  facilities did not meet antiterrorism/force protection standards.

In March 2013, we reported that Army officials did not  track leases that the Army had vacated as a result of BRAC because  those leases were typically long term and could not be terminated at the  time BRAC was being implemented. Rather, the Army simply filled such  space with other service functions not included in BRAC.

The total annual rent plus  other costs for these leases was approximately $326 million for about  17.6 million square feet of leased space. According the military  department officials, the process of requesting leased space takes  several steps to ensure that leased space is used efficiently, including  assessing whether DOD-owned or government-owned space is available  within a 50-mile radius of a lease location. For example, Navy officials  told us that the Navy pursues leasing space only when it has determined  that suitable government-owned space does not exist. Additionally, Air  Force and Army officials provided us with informational checklists that are  to be used when acquiring or renewing leases, including surveying the  availability of government-controlled or DOD-owned space within a 50- mile radius of the lease location.

In our  discussions with Army officials, we found that the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineer officials who manage the Army\u2019s rental facilities database had  not been contacted by the installation officials with projected unutilized or  underutilized space due to the inactivation of the Brigade Combat Teams  on their installations. Army officials started their review of these specific  leases only after we provided them the findings of our analysis.  Furthermore, in June 2015, we reported that DOD officials at the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, service, and installation levels said that they do  not conduct outreach to communicate information regarding unutilized  and underutilized space on military installations in part because the  installations primarily focus on supporting missions within DOD.", "Additionally, in our discussion with DOD officials about potential  consolidation opportunities, they stated that there are many other factors  to be considered before an actual decision can be made to move an  activity from leased space onto an installation. For example, in some  cases, the installation\u2019s infrastructure would need to be evaluated to  determine whether it could accommodate additional personnel or whether  the installation\u2019s mission would be affected if space is provided to non- mission-related tenants. DOD officials also stated that the unutilized or  underutilized space on an installation would have to be assessed to  determine whether space is actually usable or in poor condition, rendering  it unusable. In addition, the costs to move out of existing lease space and  reconfigure unutilized or underutilized space to meet new tenants\u2019 needs  must be determined, which in some cases could be a costly expense.", "While we recognize that each of these factors are important when making  a decision to vacate leased space in lieu of DOD-owned space, our  analysis demonstrates that some opportunities to reduce reliance on  leased space may be forthcoming to the extent that force structure  reductions or other indicators of potentially available space occur in the  future.

Federal Protective Service  officials told us that these data were not recorded either because the  assessments had not been completed as scheduled or the information  in the schedule had not been updated by the Federal Protective  Service region responsible for completing the assessments. As a  result, we were unable to determine whether the assessments had  been scheduled or completed within the required time frames or  whether the Federal Protective Service knows the date of the next  scheduled assessment.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  internal controls should generally be designed to assure that ongoing  monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations.

However, it has not provided oversight of these processes to  ensure that they are followed as intended. According to Interagency  Security Committee standards, results of facility security assessments are  briefed by the organization responsible for physical security of the facility  to the Facility Security Committee, which consists of representatives of  the DOD tenants and any other federal tenants in the facility, the security  organization, and the owning or leasing department or agency. During the  Facility Security Committee\u2019s deliberation process for determining the  security level for its facility, the tenants\u2019 organizations may consult with  their headquarters security representatives about the implementation of  the countermeasures recommended to mitigate identified risks or their  headquarters financial offices about the cost for implementing the  countermeasures.", "According to DOD Directive 5143.01, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Intelligence) is responsible for developing physical security policy and  guidance, and overseeing the DOD physical security program, among  other things. However, an Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Intelligence) official stated that there is no single entity within DOD that is  responsible for ensuring that all DOD leased facilities are properly  secured, including that facility assessments are completed in the required  time frames according to the prescribed standards. Furthermore, the  Federal Protective Service is not required to report to levels of DOD  higher than the tenant on whether it has completed required facility  security assessments of DOD\u2019s leased facilities. Moreover, DOD does not  have and has not requested access to Federal Protective Service data on  the scheduling and completion of the assessments. In response to a draft  of this report, the Department of Homeland Security noted in its  comments that officials from the Federal Protective Service stated that  their agency\u2019s database and software has been updated to consolidate all  data into a single system for automated tracking and scheduling of  assessments and queries. According to Federal Protective Service  officials, at the time of our audit, their agency had not yet deployed its  new system\u2014Modified Infrastructure Survey Tool version 2.0\u2014which  includes the functionality needed to address the various issues we found.  However, because DOD offices at levels higher than the tenant do not  periodically request and obtain information from the Federal Protective  Service, DOD is not in a position to know whether security assessments  are scheduled and conducted as required.

Without complete and accurate data on its leases, DOD\u2019s  oversight of its leased assets and the quality of its external reports is  weakened.

DOD\u2019s written comments  are reprinted in appendix II of this report. In its comments, DOD  concurred with our first recommendation that Secretary of the Army  enforce DOD\u2019s Real Property Inventory (RPI) Reporting Guidance to  break out the annual rent plus other costs for each asset on the same  lease to avoid overstating the costs associated with such leases. DOD  also concurred with our fourth recommendation that DOD improve its  ability to ensure that its leased facilities are secure and stated that it  would collaborate with the Federal Protective Service to obtain the listing  of the leased facilities the agency supports, monitor and provide oversight  of the scheduling of the assessments, and review the results of the  assessments. DOD did not concur with our remaining two  recommendations, which are discussed in detail below. DOD also  provided technical comments that have been incorporated, as  appropriate. The Department of Homeland Security provided technical  comments, which have been incorporated, as appropriate; and GSA had  no comments in response to our draft report.", "In its written comments, DOD stated that we did not give the department  full consideration of its efforts regarding leased space and that our draft  leaves a misperception of the department\u2019s commitment to efficient real  property management. DOD also stated that our report mischaracterizes  how DOD used the BRAC process to achieve space reductions and  overstates the extent to which DOD reoccupied leased space vacated  through the 2005 BRAC process. We disagree and believe that our report  neither leaves such a misconception nor presents such a  mischaracterization.", "As our report states, DOD proposed to the BRAC Commission 31  recommendations that involved relocating certain DOD activities from  leased space to government-owned space and justified some of these  recommendations by stating that leased space historically has higher  overall costs than government-owned space and generally does not meet  anti-terrorism force-protection standards. Our report also states that DOD  reoccupied about 1.1 million square feet of leased space previously  vacated through BRAC 2005, which DOD\u2019s letter confirmed. DOD stated  in its comments that prudent management includes consideration of  available leased space to accommodate changing demands and new  missions when adequate DOD-owned space is not available. We  recognize that leasing is appropriate at times. Nevertheless, in its March  2015 testimony before Congress, DOD asserted that it had about 24  percent excess capacity prior to BRAC 2005 and that the department  subsequently disposed of about 3 percent of this excess capacity through  BRAC. In its comments, DOD did not indicate the extent to which the  department reviewed remaining excess capacity, if at all, for use by the  organizations that subsequently reoccupied the 1.1 million square feet of  leased space. DOD also disagrees with our conclusion that reoccupying  space that had been vacated through BRAC in order to achieve cost  savings (i.e., vacating leased space and occupying less costly  government owned space) offsets savings attributed to these BRAC  recommendations. While DOD\u2019s letter referenced new mission and lease  consolidation opportunities as the rationale for reoccupying vacated  space, it did not explain how incurring these new lease costs was not, in  fact, an offset to any savings attributable to BRAC from having  reoccupied space just vacated for the purpose of saving money, among  other things. This is particularly significant because DOD expend  appropriated funds through BRAC to construct or lease facilities to  accommodate the DOD organizations that vacated the leased space, only  to later expend additional appropriated funds to reoccupy some of the  same leased space previously vacated.", "DOD did not concur with our second recommendation that the Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment) modify the  office\u2019s Real Property Information Model to include a new data element to  capture the total square footage assigned to each individual lease when  multiple leases exist for a single building and make a corresponding  change to its guidance to avoid overstating the total square footage  assigned to each lease in RPAD. In its comments, DOD stated that it  agrees that the issue we identified does exist regarding multiple leases  that are assigned the same building (leases managed by WHS in the  National Capital Region) and that the inclusion of an additional data  element may well serve as an indicator to help resolve this issue.  However, DOD believes that the underlying cause for overstating the total  square footage for these records in RPAD is a data aggregation issue  and has chosen an alternative approach to address the issue we raised.  Specifically, DOD stated that the department is in the final stages of  developing a platform that will transmit data into RPAD, and that will  include the capability to capture square footage for multiple leases in a  single building. DOD stated that its new Data Analytics and Integration  Support platform for transmitting RPAD data will serve as the near real  time data warehouse of the DOD real property inventory and will perform  the data collection, verification, and validation of the real property  inventory data submitted by each military department and WHS; and is  expected to be fully deployed by fiscal year 2017. If implemented  effectively, we believe DOD\u2019s planned new approach for transmitting data  into RPAD should meet the intent of our recommendation, which is to  accurately capture the square footage assigned to each lease when  multiple leases exist for a single building, thereby improving the accuracy  and completeness of the data in RPAD. In the meantime, until DOD\u2019s new  interface is fully implemented, DOD will not have reasonable assurance  that the total square footage for multiple leases in a single building is  accurate versus being overstated, as is currently the case.", "DOD also did not concur with our third recommendation that the military  departments look for opportunities to relocate DOD organizations in  leased space onto installations that may have underutilized space. In its  comments, DOD stated that its existing policy requires the effective and  efficient use of DOD real property and that current initiatives undertaken  by each of the military departments and WHS reflect adherence to this  policy. DOD issued its new Real Property Efficiency Plan in October 2015  that highlights the department\u2019s progress in this area. DOD further  stated that\u2014given that each of the military departments and WHS have  implemented initiatives to reduce their dependence on leased space,  especially where existing DOD assets may exist\u2014an additional directive  from the Secretary of Defense is not required. In our report, we note that  DOD guidance directs the Secretaries of the military departments to  maintain a program that monitors the use of real property to ensure that it  is being used to the maximum extent possible consistent with both  peacetime and mobilization requirements. While we understand that DOD  sees no requirement for additional action, we found during the course of  our review that DOD\u2014existing guidance notwithstanding\u2014had not yet  assessed the likely effects of future force reductions on its use of leased  space. Therefore, we believe this recommendation remains valid.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that the Army had  issued new guidance to ensure optimal allocation of the best available  facilities to support Army missions, citing a new execution order published  by the Army during the time of our review. While this order was published  in March 2015, it was not referenced by the Army or DOD until we  received the comments at the end December 2015. Upon reviewing the  order, which the Army provided, at our request, we learned that the Army  intends to execute this order in two phases: Phase One, during which the  Army will accurately document existing facility utilization and update its  real property master plan; and Phase Two, during which Army will  implement the updated plan by consolidating its footprint to the minimum  appropriate space and dispose of, or identify for disposal, unneeded  leases and facilities. According to Army officials we spoke with in January  2016, the Army extended the completion date for Phase One from the  end of June 2015 to the end of August 2015 to allow time to fully account  for some planned changes in Army size and force structure. These  officials also told us that, while they have identified some leases for  elimination, they would not have inventory data for this effort until the end  of 2016. According to the execution order, Phase Two is to be completed  by October 2021 and status reports will be submitted to Army  headquarters annually depicting the progress installations have made in  meeting facility footprint reduction timelines and goals. Although we have  not had the opportunity to review the implementation of the execution  order in detail because Army data has not been available, it does appear  to us that, if the process laid out in the execution order is effectively and  fully implemented, it may meet the intent of our recommendation.  However, until the Army effort is completed\u2014given that the Army holds  the majority of DOD leases\u2014we remain concerned that DOD may be at  risk of missing out on opportunities to reduce its leased space at a DOD- wide level.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Energy, Installations and Environment); the Under Secretary of Defense  (Intelligence); the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the  Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director of Washington  Headquarters Services (WHS); the Administrator, General Services  Administration (GSA); the Director, Office of Management and Budget  (OMB); and the Secretary of Homeland Security.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-4523 or LeporeB@gao.gov.

We assessed the reliability of  DOD\u2019s real property lease data by (1) interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data, (2) performing electronic testing for  obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, (3) reviewing  documentation for the various real property data systems covered in this  review and taking steps to corroborate certain records and data elements  against the source data provided by the military departments and WHS,  and (4) selecting a statistical random sample of the most current data and  analyzing it by comparing records in the sample to the data submitted by  the military departments and WHS.", "We chose to analyze DOD\u2019s leases in fiscal year 2011 because that was  the final year of a 6-year period to implement the 2005 base closure and  realignment (BRAC) recommendations for DOD activities occupying  leased space and the lease records in fiscal year 2013 because those  were the most recent data available at the time we initiated this review.  We also obtained real property data from the General Services  Administration (GSA) for the leased assets it manages on behalf of DOD  for fiscal years 2011 and 2013. However, GSA\u2019s real property  management system does not retain historical information; as a result,  GSA researched old files and compiled the information that was available  in an attempt to satisfy our data requests. Due to a lack of historical  information for fiscal years 2011 and 2013, there were a number of  inconsistencies in the data provided. For example, lease numbers were  not available for fiscal year 2011, and the lease start and expiration dates  were not available for fiscal year 2013. The lack of available data for fiscal  years 2011 and 2013 prevented us from conducting a year-to-year  comparison of the GSA data and from producing any meaningful results  about the number, size, and cost of the leased space DOD occupies  through GSA occupancy agreements. We were able to use the data to  help us determine the process DOD uses to track its leases and to make  some comparisons of the GSA data with data contained in RPAD to  determine, among other things, what type of data are collected for  management purposes and whether duplicate records existed.", "The scope of this review included records for real property that DOD  acquires from private organizations, GSA, and state organizations. While  we obtained data on transactions in which a military service or defense  agency acquired real property from another federal agency, military  service, or defense agency\u2014or from another organization within the  same military service or defense agency\u2014we excluded those records  because they are typically permits, licenses, or use agreements rather  than leases, with minimal costs, if any. We used standard statistical  software to link the grant, asset, site, and disposal tables included in  RPAD so that we could analyze the complete records for each DOD  leased asset to determine whether these data were sufficiently reliable to  report on the number, size, and cost of DOD leased assets. We  performed three types of analyses to determine the accuracy and  completeness of 12 specific data elements in RPAD that are used to  provide identifying information on DOD\u2019s leased assets, as well as the  type, size, date, status, and cost of the leased assets.", "First, we performed electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy  and completeness of the 5,965 lease records for fiscal year 2011 and  the 5,538 leased records for fiscal year 2013. Specifically, we  conducted a series of tests to determine whether each data element  contained data, as required, and whether the data satisfied certain  business rules established by the managers of RPAD, such as the  annual rent amount must be equal to or less than the annual rent plus  other costs amount, and the value of these cost data elements must  be greater than or equal to zero.", "Second, since the Army had the largest number of lease records in  RPAD\u20144,695 (approximately 79 percent) of 5,965 records in fiscal  year 2011 and 4,210 (approximately 76 percent) of the 5,538 records  in fiscal year 2013\u2014we compared the records representing the  Army\u2019s lease assets to the lease records maintained in the Army  Rental Facilities Management Information system to determine  whether the data for each of the data elements submitted by the Army  matched the data in RPAD for those same 2 years.", "Third, based on a universe of 5,566 lease records from RPAD for  fiscal year 2013 (the most current data available when we initiated our  review), we took a random sample of 132 records and compared this  statistical random sample of records to source data to examine the  extent of data accuracy. Specifically, we compared the RPAD data for  the specific data elements identified earlier to the data the military  departments and WHS submitted from their real property databases  to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy,  Installations and Environment), Business Enterprise Integration  Directorate, to determine whether there were any discrepancies,  errors, or omissions in RPAD. The results of our analysis are  generalizable across all lease records for fiscal year 2013, with a 95  percent chance that the difference between the estimated and the true  population percentage is within 10 percentage points.", "We also gathered and analyzed documentation, such as DOD directives  and instructions and military-department regulations reflecting DOD\u2019s and  the military departments\u2019 management of real property and how DOD  uses the data in RPAD. We also interviewed officials from the following  real property management offices and agencies: Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Housing, and  Partnerships); Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy,  Installations and Environment), Business Enterprise Integration  Directorate; WHS (Facilities Services Directorate), Space Portfolio  Management Division; Department of the Army, Chief of Staff for  Installation Management (Operations Directorate), Operations Division;  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Real Estate); Department of the Navy,  Naval Facilities Engineering Command; Department of the Air Force,  Director of Civil Engineers (Installation Operations Branch); and GSA to  obtain information about the management of their real property  management systems.", "Based on the results of our analysis, we determined that data from RPAD  were neither accurate nor complete, and, as such, the data were not  sufficiently reliable for our use to determine the number of leases and the  size and cost of all of DOD\u2019s leased assets for fiscal years 2011 and  2013.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has taken actions to reduce its  reliance on leased space since 2011, we obtained and reviewed the 2005  BRAC Commission report to identify recommendations for realigning and  closing some DOD leased facilities that had to be implemented by  September 15, 2011. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s 2013 Freeze the Footprint  report, submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  identify DOD\u2019s planned initiatives to reduce its domestic office and  warehouse space (including both leased and owned space). We also  interviewed DOD and Army real property officials to discuss their planned  initiatives for leased space in order to meet the Freeze the Footprint  requirements. Specifically, we obtained documentation and interviewed  officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy,  Installations and Environment), Business Enterprise Integration  Directorate; Department of the Army, Chief of Staff for Installation  Management (Operations Directorate), Operations Division; and U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (Real Estate). We focused our work for this  objective on the Army because in its role as executive agent for joint  service programs and some defense agencies, as well as its own mission  needs, it occupies and manages the majority of the leases in DOD\u2019s real  property inventory reporting system. We also gathered documentation  and interviewed officials within the WHS (Facilities Services Directorate),  Space Portfolio Management Division to obtain examples of DOD  reoccupying leased space previously vacated in the National Capital  Region as a result of the 2005 BRAC recommendations. The National  Capital Region was the primary focus of the 2005 BRAC  recommendations that involved moving DOD activities from leased space  to government-owned space. We obtained DOD reports on the number  and location of its leases and interviewed officials who maintain the  related lease data. We also reviewed our December 2013 report that  identifies DOD installations that may have available administrative office  space based on the inactivations of 10 Army Brigade Combat Teams that  are expected to begin in fiscal year 2017. We then analyzed some of the  lease data from RPAD for fiscal year 2013 to determine whether any  opportunities exist for DOD to reduce its leased space in geographic  locations that are in close proximity to the DOD installations that may  have unutilized or underutilized facilities based on these planned force  structure reductions. We chose fiscal year 2013 data because those were  the most recent data available at the time we initiated this review. We did  not use DOD\u2019s current utilization of facilities data because in our  September 2014 report we reported that utilization data continued to be  incomplete and inaccurate although utilization data had improved since  we previously reported on them in 2011.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has oversight of the status of  security assessments of leased facilities obtained through GSA, we  collected information regarding facility security assessments for DOD- leased space for fiscal years 2011 and 2013. We selected these years to  match our review of DOD lease records. We reviewed and analyzed the  Federal Protective Service tracking schedule for the facility security  assessments it performs for DOD\u2019s leased facilities and found the  information contained numerous data issues, such as assessments  scheduled and conducted outside of required time frames and missing  assessment dates. We examined the facility assessment schedules for  500 leased facilities for fiscal year 2011 and 484 leased facilities for fiscal  year 2013. Many of these facilities had multiple leases or occupancy  agreements. The data we reviewed included 1,043 lease numbers or  occupancy agreements for fiscal year 2011 and 1,051 lease numbers or  occupancy agreements for fiscal year 2013. We held several meetings  with Federal Protective Service officials and gathered follow-up  documentation regarding inconsistencies and missing facility security  assessment data. We also reviewed prior GAO reports on this issue. We  reviewed DOD directives and instructions, as well as other related  documentation, such as the Interagency Security Committee standards,  to determine which DOD organization has oversight responsibility for  facility security assessments and physical security, as well as the scope  of this responsibility. We interviewed officials from the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment),  Facility Investment Management; Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Energy, Installations and Environment), Business Enterprise  Integration Directorate; Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Intelligence); U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Real Estate); U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (Operational Protection Division), Directorate of  Contingency Operations; and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency to  determine whether DOD receives information on the status of facility  security assessments.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from WHS (Facilities Services  Directorate), Space Portfolio Management Division; Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Housing and Partnerships);  Department of the Army, Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management (Operations Directorate), Operations Division; Department  of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command; Department of the  Air Force, Director of Civil Engineers (Installation Operations Branch);  Federal Protective Service; and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency to  obtain general information on the status of their facilities meeting security  requirements. We examined the reliability of the facility security  assessments data obtained from the Federal Protective Service by  determining whether (1) facility security levels had been determined for  each facility and (2) facility security assessments had been completed or  planned within the required periods. Because of the incomplete and  inaccurate data, we determined that the Federal Protective Service facility  security assessment tracking data were not sufficiently reliable to  determine whether the facility security assessments had been completed  as required. Additionally, in August 2012, we reported that Federal  Protective Service\u2019s facility security assessments data for fiscal year 2011  contained a number of missing and incorrect values that made the data  unreliable to determine the extent of their backlog of assessments that  needed to be completed. We also reviewed the Pentagon Force  Protection Agency\u2019s tracking schedule for the facility security  assessments it performs for the DOD leased facilities for which it is  responsible to determine whether required assessments had been  completed. We found that the Pentagon Force Protection Agency\u2019s data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to March 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
