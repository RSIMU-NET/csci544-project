Officials cited a proposal by the President to phase out the Capital Investment Grants program as one of the factors influencing this decision. However, in March the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, provided the program with more than $2.6 billion and required FTA to continue to administer the program in accordance with the procedural and substantive requirements specified in statute. Subsequently, FTA officials told GAO that they are reviewing the Act and determining next steps. However FTA officials did not indicate that they intend to address these provisions.

Core Capacity Improvement projects are capital investments designed to increase the capacity of an existing transit system and must meet specific statutory requirements to be eligible for funding through the program. GAO found that prior to recommending a project for funding FTA works with project sponsors to verify that their proposed project includes elements that will increase transit system capacity versus maintaining the current system, that the required amount of local funding is committed to the project, and that sponsors have the technical and financial capacity to complete the project they are proposing, among other statutory requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FTA should initiate a rulemaking regarding the evaluation and rating process for Core Capacity Improvement projects and take steps to address two other statutory provisions.

Projects that  compete for funding through this program are planned and implemented  locally, and include capital investments in heavy and light rail, commuter  rail, streetcars, and ferries as well as bus rapid transit. FTA evaluates and  rates projects seeking funding through this program based on statutory  criteria, recommends to Congress which projects to fund, and awards  funding to projects. Program funding is provided through the annual  appropriations process, and over the last 10 fiscal years FTA has  awarded over $19 billion to cities, states, and other localities across the  country.", "In March 2017, the President\u2019s fiscal year 2018 budget proposed phasing  out the program, stating that future investments in new transit projects  should be funded by the localities that use and benefit from those  projects, and the administration reiterated that intent as part of its fiscal year 2019 budget proposal in February 2018. Consequently, FTA  recommended that Congress limit future funding for the Capital  Investment Grants program. However, in March 2018 the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018, provided the program with more than $2.6  billion, and required FTA to continue to administer the Capital Investment  Grants program in accordance with the program\u2019s procedural and  substantive requirements.", "The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21),  enacted in 2012, included a provision for us to biennially review FTA\u2019s  processes and procedures for evaluating and rating projects seeking  funding through the Capital Investment Grants program. In April 2016,  we issued our most recent report in response to the provision, focusing  on FTA\u2019s efforts in implementing changes that MAP-21 made to the  program\u2019s processes, changes that were aimed at expediting project  delivery. We reported that FTA was taking steps to implement MAP-21,  such as by implementing a provision directing FTA to issue policy  guidance outlining the review and evaluation process for new fixed- guideway projects and Core Capacity Improvement projects (hereafter  Core Capacity projects), and reported that FTA intended to take action to  address other provisions over the next few years. However, we also  reported that the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST  Act), enacted in 2015, contained new provisions for FTA to address.", "FTA\u2019s progress in addressing outstanding statutory provisions as  amended by MAP-21 and the FAST Act, and how FTA\u2019s evaluation and rating process enables it to verify that  statutory requirements are met before recommending a Core Capacity  project for funding.", "In conducting this review, we focused on reviewing FTA\u2019s progress  addressing statutory provisions that were outstanding at the time of our  previous biennial review as well as the evaluation and rating requirements  specified in statute for Core Capacity projects. To address our objectives,  we reviewed the relevant provisions of MAP-21 and the FAST Act. We  also reviewed FTA\u2019s policy guidance; other pertinent agency  documents, such as FTA\u2019s instructions for applying to the program, its  templates for evaluating and rating projects in the program, and its annual  reports to Congress with funding recommendations; and prior GAO  reports. We also reviewed documentation, such as FTA\u2019s assessments,  supporting the two grant agreements it had awarded for Core Capacity  projects at the time we initiated this review. For both objectives, we  compared the requirements specified in statute with FTA\u2019s  implementation of those requirements. In addition, we interviewed FTA  officials, representatives of the American Public Transportation  Association, and representatives of six project sponsors in the Capital  Investment Grants program. The six project sponsors we interviewed  represented seven of the eight Core Capacity projects in the program at  the time we initiated this review. We also visited the sites of those seven  projects, which are located in California, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, and  Texas. During our visits we obtained information about the transportation  challenges that these projects are attempting to address and the  sponsors\u2019 perspectives on FTA\u2019s processes and procedures for  evaluating and rating Core Capacity projects. For a description of the  Core Capacity projects in the program at the time we initiated this review,  see appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2017 to May 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The primary source of federal funding for new fixed-guideway projects or  extensions to existing fixed-guideway systems is FTA\u2019s Capital  Investment Grants program, which is a discretionary and competitive  grant program funded through annual appropriations. The program is  governed by statutory provisions, and funding is provided in the form of  a construction grant agreement, which is subject to congressional  appropriations.", "Projects that compete for funding through the Capital Investment Grants  program are designed and implemented by project sponsors, which are  usually local transit agencies. Prior to 2012, project sponsors typically  applied for funding as either a New Starts or Small Starts project. New  Starts projects are capital investments whose sponsors request $100  million or more in Capital Investment Grants funding or have an  anticipated capital cost of $300 million or more. Small Starts projects are  capital investments whose sponsors request less than $100 million in  Capital Investment Grants funding and have an anticipated capital cost of  less than $300 million.", "In 2012, Congress created a third category of eligible projects called Core  Capacity projects. Unlike New Starts and Small Starts, for which the  amount of funding project sponsors request and the anticipated capital  cost of a project are key factors, Core Capacity projects are not defined  by cost. Instead, Core Capacity projects are \u201ccorridor-based capital  investments\u201d in existing fixed-guideway systems that increase the  capacity of a corridor by not less than 10 percent, in a corridor that is at or  above capacity or is expected to be within 5 years. Examples of Core  Capacity projects include capital investments to expand a transit system\u2019s  platforms and acquire real property, rights of way, or rail cars associated  with corridor improvements increasing capacity.", "To enter the Capital Investment Grants program, project sponsors submit  an application to FTA with information on the proposed project, such as a  description of the transportation problem the project seeks to address,  among other requirements. If accepted into the program, project sponsors  must then follow a multi-step, multi-year development process outlined in  statute during which FTA determines if the project is eligible for funding  through the Capital Investment Grants program. The development  process that project sponsors must follow varies depending on whether  the project is a New Starts or Core Capacity project, or a Small Starts  project. For example, New Starts and Core Capacity projects are required  to complete a two-phase development process. During the first phase,  called Project Development, project sponsors must complete an  environmental review process outlined in the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969 and address other statutory requirements. Project sponsors must also provide FTA with sufficient information for FTA to  evaluate and rate the project, among other FTA requirements. To  complete the second phase, called Engineering, project sponsors must,  among other requirements, develop a firm and reliable cost, scope, and  schedule for their project and obtain all non-Capital Investment Grants  program funding commitments. Small Starts projects complete a  development process that is similar but consists of only one phase, called  Project Development.", "During the development process, FTA is required to evaluate and rate  projects using a number of statutory criteria designed to assess the merit  of a project (i.e., project justification). For example, for Core Capacity  projects, FTA is required to evaluate and rate a project against six criteria:  (1) mobility improvements, (2) environmental benefits, (3) cost- effectiveness, (4) the congestion relief associated with the project, (5) the  economic development effects associated with the project, and (6) the  existing capacity needs of the corridor. FTA is also required to evaluate  and rate the local financial commitment to a project, including evidence of  stable and dependable financing sources, as well as the project sponsor\u2019s  ability to operate the project and continue to operate any related transit  system. FTA\u2019s ratings are \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d evaluations\u2014meaning that  they can change\u2014as a project progresses through the development  process.", "To receive funding, project sponsors must complete the development  process outlined in statute and meet all statutory eligibility requirements.  Projects must also address all FTA requirements, and FTA must  recommend the project for funding to Congress. FTA\u2019s recommendations  are based on its evaluation and rating of the project using the criteria  specified in statute, the availability of Capital Investment Grants program  funds, and the readiness of the project, such as whether the project\u2019s  cost, scope, and schedule are advanced enough to be considered  reliable. As mentioned earlier, the funding that projects receive is subject  to congressional appropriations.", "As we previously reported, both MAP-21 and the FAST Act made  numerous changes to the Capital Investment Grants program. For  example, in addition to establishing Core Capacity projects as a new  category of eligible projects, MAP-21 reduced the number of phases in  the development process that projects in the Capital Investment Grants  program must follow to be eligible for and receive funding. According to  FTA officials, changes the FAST Act made to the program include raising  the dollar threshold for eligibility for New Starts and Small Starts projects  and increasing the number of projects that are eligible for funding by  allowing joint public transportation and intercity-passenger-rail service to  compete for funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Has Not Addressed Three Out of Four Outstanding Statutory Provisions", "paragraphs": ["FTA has not addressed three of four outstanding statutory provisions  concerning the Capital Investment Grants program. As shown in table 1,  three of these provisions stem from MAP-21, which was enacted in 2012,  and the fourth stems from the FAST Act, enacted in 2015.", "When we initiated our review, FTA officials told us FTA did not have  immediate plans to address the outstanding statutory provisions due to  the administration\u2019s stated intent to phase out the Capital Investment  Grants program. As mentioned earlier, in 2017 the President\u2019s Fiscal  Year 2018 budget first proposed phasing out the program, stating that  future investments in new transit projects should be funded by the  localities that use and benefit from those projects. Since then, FTA\u2019s  annual reports to Congress, which contain funding recommendations for  the program, have reflected this direction. For example, FTA\u2019s Fiscal Year  2018 report recommended that Congress only fund those projects that  had already received a grant agreement through the program, and FTA\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2019 report stated that FTA neither requests nor  recommends any funding for projects in the Capital Investment Grants  program beyond those that have already received a grant agreement.  However, as also mentioned earlier, in March 2018 the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018, provided the program with more than $2.6  billion, and also directed FTA to continue to administer the Capital  Investment Grants program in accordance with the program\u2019s procedural  and substantive requirements. Following the enactment of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, FTA officials told us that they are  reviewing the law and determining next steps. However, they did not  indicate that they have any immediate plans to address those provisions.  Moving forward, if FTA does not take steps to address the outstanding  provisions, FTA runs the risk of violating federal law.", "During our review, FTA officials told us that other factors have also  influenced FTA\u2019s decisions. For example, FTA officials noted that since  our last report, issuing regulations regarding the evaluation and rating  process for Core Capacity projects was not identified as one of the  Department\u2019s regulatory priorities and, currently, FTA has no plans to  issue such regulations. However, issuing regulations to address this  provision is important. FTA\u2019s policy guidance notes that aspects of the  development process, such as the steps to get into and through the  development process, were not subject to public outreach and are open  to be discussed in future updates to the Major Capital Projects rule.  While FTA officials emphasized that the agency\u2019s policy guidance is  intended to serve as a guide for running the program until such time that  FTA initiates further rulemaking, FTA\u2019s policy guidance also notes that  further rulemaking is needed to fully implement the changes MAP-21 and  the FAST Act made to the Capital Investment Grants program. Until FTA  initiates this rulemaking, it is unclear when if at all, FTA might address  most of these outstanding provisions.", "With respect to addressing the program of interrelated projects  provisions, FTA officials reiterated their concerns, as we noted in our last  report, that establishing an evaluation and rating process for a program of  interrelated projects is difficult. As an example, FTA officials noted that as  part of the New Starts, Small Starts, and Core Capacity evaluation  process, FTA takes into account factors such as a corridor\u2019s current  ridership estimates and future ridership projections. According to FTA  officials, evaluating and rating projects that encompass multiple corridors  is challenging because it requires that FTA establish new measures and  breakpoints\u2014that is, thresholds for FTA\u2019s ratings. Both FTA officials and  the American Public Transportation Association representatives we spoke  with told us that FTA has sought input from the transit industry in the past  to help address these concerns. However, FTA officials also told us that  addressing their concerns requires additional research and public  outreach on FTA\u2019s part and that undertaking that work has not been a  priority of the Department of Transportation. Representatives from two of  the sponsors we spoke with, as well as representatives of the American  Public Transportation Association, told us that the transit industry is  interested in seeing FTA implement the program of interrelated projects  provisions and that doing so could help transit agencies deliver projects  more efficiently. For example, according to one sponsor, implementing  those provisions could help this sponsor purchase materials in bulk and  reduce costs. Until FTA takes steps to address this provision, the federal  government or project sponsors may be missing opportunities to deliver  transit projects more efficiently.", "In the case of the FAST Act\u2019s provision establishing a pilot program\u2014 called the \u201cExpedited Project Delivery for Capital Investment Grants Pilot  Program,\u201d designed to create a fast-track approval process for projects  that meet specific statutory criteria, such as having a maximum federal  share of 25 percent\u2014FTA published a notice in the Federal Register in  2016 stating that it would publish guidance describing the process project  sponsors should follow to apply for consideration as a pilot project.  However, at the time of our review, FTA had not provided sponsors with  information that describes the process they should follow to apply for  consideration as a pilot project. FTA officials told us that project sponsors  have generally not expressed interest in participating in the program  under the FAST Act, and most of the project sponsors that we spoke  with agreed. Specifically, four of the six Core Capacity project sponsors  told us that some FAST Act requirements, such as a requirement that  projects in the program be supported in part by a public-private  partnership, made participating in the program less attractive. According  to two of the sponsors, private investors do not have an incentive to  invest in public transit projects unless they can profit from their  investment, but the FAST Act limits that opportunity by requiring that  projects participating in the pilot program be operated and maintained by  employees of an existing public transportation provider. Nonetheless, in  February 2018, the President\u2019s infrastructure plan recommended  restructuring this program, with changes, to better achieve the goals of  expediting project delivery. Among the changes recommended are  allowing the pilot program to be available to all projects and not just on a  pilot basis, and increasing the federal share from 25 to 50 percent. Taking  steps to describe the steps project sponsors should follow to apply for  consideration as a pilot project under this program could help FTA better  understand whether further changes are needed.", "The statutory provision FTA has addressed relates to a MAP-21 provision  directing FTA to use an expedited technical-capacity review process for  certain experienced project sponsors. At the time of our 2016 report,  FTA was in the process of finalizing the development of a tool to address  this provision, and since then, FTA has implemented that tool.  Specifically, the tool helps FTA staff determine the level of review  required of project sponsors based on a number of risk factors, such as  the complexity of a proposed project and the sponsor\u2019s experience level.  According to FTA, this tool helps FTA staff develop project-specific  oversight plans that specify the resources FTA should devote when  overseeing a particular project. Projects that FTA determines are at lower  risk have fewer oversight resources allocated to them, and FTA officials  told us that they have been using this tool on all projects in the program  since mid-2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Has a Process to Verify That Requirements Are Met before Recommending a Core Capacity Project for Funding", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of FTA\u2019s policy guidance, instructions for applying to  the Capital Investment Grants program, and interviews with FTA  officials and six Core Capacity project sponsors, we found that FTA has  established a process to verify that proposed Core Capacity projects  meet statutory requirements before recommending projects for funding.  In addition, based on our review of documentation supporting FTA\u2019s  funding recommendations for the two Core Capacity projects with grant  agreements as of June 2017, as well as interviews with FTA officials and  both project sponsors, we found that FTA took steps to verify that the  statutory requirements were met before recommending those two projects  for full funding grant agreements. Representatives of the other four  sponsors we spoke with also confirmed that FTA is taking steps to verify  that their projects meet the statutory requirements. Such requirements  include specific project eligibility and other requirements that projects  must meet during the Project Development and Engineering phases of  the development process.", "Project Eligibility: Under statute, Core Capacity projects must meet  specific eligibility requirements. For example, along the lines previously  noted, statutory provisions require that a Core Capacity project be a  substantial corridor-based capital investment located in a corridor that is  at or over capacity, or projected to be at or over capacity within the next 5  years. These projects must also increase the corridor\u2019s capacity in the  peak hour and direction of travel by not less than 10 percent. To verify  that projects meet these requirements, project sponsors and FTA officials  told us that FTA staff assisted project sponsors in refining their project\u2019s corridor (see fig. 1), and reviewed information provided by the sponsors  on such things as the corridor\u2019s current ridership estimates; the type,  configuration, and capacity of light- and heavy-rail cars; and the number  of seats on commuter rail cars. FTA\u2019s policy guidance outlines the criteria  that FTA uses, criteria that FTA developed after consulting industry  standards and reaching out to the transit industry. FTA officials  emphasized that they apply these criteria consistently across projects  when evaluating whether a project\u2019s corridor is at capacity.", "As another example, under statute, Capital Investment Grant funding for  Core Capacity projects may not be applied to \u201cstate of good repair\u201d  improvements to the transit system. \u201cState of good repair\u201d  improvements include, among other things, the replacement or  rehabilitation of existing rail cars, tracks, or communications equipment  due to normal wear and tear or preventive maintenance. Core Capacity  projects are likely to be intertwined with state of good repair  improvements, however, and FTA staff work with project sponsors to  identify which project costs within the project corridor are eligible to  receive Core Capacity funding and which are related to maintaining a  state of good repair.", "Project Development Phase: As with the project eligibility requirements  discussed above, statutory provisions identify specific requirements that  must be met during the Project Development phase, and we found that  FTA has a process to verify that those requirements are met. For  example, under statute, Core Capacity projects have 2 years after the day  on which they enter into Project Development to complete the activities  required to obtain a project rating by FTA. Completion of the Project  Development phase is marked by the completion of the environmental  review process required under the National Environmental Policy Act of  1969 and FTA\u2019s assignment of a project rating. FTA\u2019s policy guidance  encourages project sponsors to perform whatever work they feel is  necessary prior to requesting entry into Project Development to enable  them to complete this phase within 2 years. According to both FTA  officials and representatives from each of the six Core Capacity project  sponsors, FTA staff work closely with project sponsors to assist them with  preparations to enter Project Development, review their documentation,  and complete this phase on time. Further, each of the six Core Capacity  project sponsors we spoke with told us that FTA follows up with sponsors  to ensure that all statutory and FTA requirements for the Project  Development phase are met. For example, the project sponsors reported  that FTA officials hold a variety of periodic (e.g., weekly, monthly,  quarterly) meetings with project sponsors during which they discuss  various aspects of the sponsor\u2019s progress toward meeting the statutory  requirements.", "Under statute, to assign a project rating, FTA must evaluate and rate  Core Capacity projects against specific project justification criteria and  local financial commitment criteria, as well as ensure that the project has satisfied the project eligibility and other statutory requirements, such as  having been selected as the locally preferred alternative and adopted into  the appropriate regional transportation plans. To obtain the information  needed to make these evaluations, FTA provides project sponsors with  reporting instructions and templates on its website specifying its  documentation requirements. These instructions and templates allow for  the standardized review of the project eligibility requirements previously  discussed, as well as aspects of the project justification and local financial  commitment criteria. Representatives of two of the six Core Capacity  project sponsors described these instructions and templates as helpful,  and said the templates enable them to gauge what their project\u2019s potential  rating might be. Representatives of four sponsors also reported that when  completing the templates they are in frequent contact with FTA officials to  help ensure they are appropriately providing all required information. FTA  officials inform sponsors that the agency reviews completed templates  along with other information to assign project ratings.", "Pursuant to statute, once FTA determines that a Core Capacity project  meets the specified project eligibility requirements, assigns the project a  rating, and determines that the environmental review process has been  completed, among other requirements, the project is ready to enter the  Engineering phase. Before advancing the project to Engineering, FTA  requires project sponsors to provide proof that at least 30 percent of the  non-Capital Investment Grants funding necessary to complete the project  is committed, as well as a variety of other documentation, such as a 20- year financial plan; a detailed cost estimate; a detailed project  management plan and project schedule; a preliminary safety hazard,  threat, and vulnerability analysis; and a draft \u201cbefore and after\u201d study  plan. Once a project sponsor indicates it is ready to advance its project to the Engineering phase, FTA assigns oversight contractors, who take a  prominent role in overseeing the day-to-day management of the project in  order to provide FTA with ongoing reports of the project sponsor\u2019s  financial and technical progress.", "Engineering Phase: Based on our review of documentation for the two  Core Capacity projects that have received a grant agreement, we found  that FTA also has a process to verify that the requirements specified in  statute applicable to the Engineering phase are met before  recommending a Core Capacity project for funding. Pursuant to statute,  during the Engineering phase the project sponsor must continue to show  the financial capability to complete the project and maintain and operate  the future transit system with stable and dependable funding sources.  FTA requires that project sponsors show increasing financial capacity  during the first 3 years in this phase by providing proof of commitments  for at least 50 percent of all non-Capital Investment Grants funding.  Pursuant to statute, project sponsors must also continue to show the  technical capability to complete the project. FTA requires that project  sponsors show increasing technical capacity during this phase by making  sufficient progress advancing the level of project design.", "According to representatives from the two Core Capacity projects that  have received a grant agreement, FTA\u2019s oversight contractors interact  with project sponsors frequently throughout the Engineering phase, and  are responsible for assisting FTA in determining whether sponsors have  the technical and financial capacity to complete their projects. Both FTA  officials and the two project sponsors reported that these oversight  contractors review project documentation throughout the Engineering  phase to verify that the sponsor meets FTA requirements to execute a  grant agreement, and are otherwise acceptable for advancing a project.  In reviewing documentation for the two Core Capacity projects that have  received a grant agreement, we found these oversight contractors  provided FTA with their comprehensive assessments of the project  sponsor\u2019s technical and financial capacity.
