These control deficiencies contribute to material weaknesses in internal control regarding the U.S. government's inability to (1) adequately account for and reconcile intragovernmental activity and balances between federal agencies; (2) ensure that the CFS was consistent with the underlying audited agency financial statements, properly balanced, and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and (3) identify and either resolve or explain material differences that exist between certain components of the budget deficit reported in the Department of the Treasury's records, used to prepare the Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and Unified Budget Deficit and Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and Other Activities, and related amounts reported in federal agencies' financial statements and underlying financial information and records. The control deficiencies GAO identified during its tests of the processes used to prepare the fiscal year 2007 CFS involved the following areas: documenting a key standard operating procedure for preparing the CFS, reporting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, reconciling distributed offsetting receipts, maintaining adequate control over spreadsheets used in preparing the CFS, monitoring internal control over the processes used to prepare the CFS, using interim financial information in the CFS preparation process, and various other control deficiencies that were identified in previous years' audits but remained in fiscal year 2007.

For  the past 11 years, certain material weaknesses in financial reporting and  other limitations on the scope of our work have resulted in conditions that  prevented us from expressing an opinion on the federal government\u2019s  accrual basis consolidated financial statements. We have reported that the  federal government did not have adequate systems, controls, and  procedures for preparing the CFS. On behalf of the federal government,  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), in coordination with the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), prepares the CFS. Many of the  material weaknesses in internal control that have contributed to our  continuing disclaimers of opinion were identified by auditors during their  audits of federal agencies\u2019 financial statements and were reported in detail  with recommendations to the agencies in separate reports.

However, one of Treasury\u2019s SOPs entitled \u201cStandard Operating Procedures  for Preparing the Financial Report of the U.S. Government\u201d is incomplete.  For example, certain steps Treasury performs to prepare the CFS are not  documented in this SOP and, for the key practices that are documented,  the SOP is unclear as to who is responsible for performing the procedures.  In connection with its role as preparer of the CFS, Treasury management  is responsible for developing and documenting detailed policies,  procedures, and practices for preparing the CFS and ensuring that internal  control is built into and is an integral part of the related process. GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for clear  documentation of policies and procedures.

Over the past several years, Treasury  has developed a formal process that has significantly improved its ability  to timely identify GAAP requirements, modify its closing package  requirements to obtain information needed, assess the effect of omitted  disclosures, and document decisions reached and the rationale for such  decisions. However, there continue to be some instances where  disclosures are not presented in conformity with GAAP. A contributing  factor to the continued instances of nonconformity with GAAP is that the  process Treasury developed to compile the CFS does not include  adequately documenting its (1) timely assessment of the relevance,  usefulness, or materiality of information reported by the federal agencies  for use at the governmentwide level, (2) consideration of relevant  accounting standards other than those issued by FASAB, and (3) final  decisions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of federal agencies\u2019  disclosure information in the existing notes to the CFS.", "As part of the process Treasury developed, it created a checklist  containing FASAB requirements for use as a tool to help determine if  disclosures in the CFS are in conformity with GAAP. Due to the way the  checklist was designed, Treasury primarily used it as a planning tool to  ensure that it requested in the closing package the data that Treasury  would need from federal agencies to report in compliance with GAAP.  Although this is a useful and important first step, we found that Treasury\u2019s  checklist was limited by its design and was not used by staff to help ensure  that the published CFS was in conformity with GAAP in all material  respects. As a result, the checklist did not adequately assist Treasury in  ensuring that all GAAP required disclosures were adequately disclosed in  the CFS or documenting why certain disclosures were excluded."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the Fiscal  Assistant Secretary to enhance its checklist or design an alternative and  use it to adequately and timely document Treasury\u2019s (1) assessment of the  relevance, usefulness, or materiality of information reported by the federal  agencies for use at the governmentwide level; (2) consideration of relevant  accounting standards other than those issued by FASAB; and (3) final  decisions regarding the inclusion or exclusion of federal agencies\u2019  disclosure information in the existing notes to the CFS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reconciling Distributed Offsetting Receipts", "paragraphs": ["The federal government reports a unified budget deficit  (budget deficit)  in the Reconciliation of Net Operating Cost and the Unified Budget Deficit  and in the Statement of Changes in Cash Balance from Unified Budget and  Other Activities. The budget deficit is calculated by subtracting actual  budget outlays from actual budget receipts. Budget outlays consist of  federal agencies\u2019 outlay amounts, that is, gross outlays net of offsetting  collections and distributed offsetting receipts at the agency level, and  undistributed offsetting receipts at the governmentwide level. Federal  agencies also report net outlays in their SBRs. Both the net outlays as a  component of the budget deficit reported in the CFS and as reported in the  federal agencies\u2019 SBRs should generally match the budget outlays reported  in the Budget of the United States Government.", "For several years, we have reported material unreconciled differences  between the total net outlays reported in selected federal agencies\u2019 SBRs  and Treasury\u2019s central accounting records used to compute the budget  deficit reported in the CFS. OMB and Treasury have continued to work  with federal agencies to reduce these material unreconciled differences.  However, in fiscal year 2007, billions of dollars of unreconciled differences  still existed in this and other components of the budget deficit. One way  OMB has been working with federal agencies has been to require the  agencies, beginning with the first quarter in fiscal year 2007, to submit to  OMB an analysis and reconciliation, based on certain criteria, of any  material differences between the federal agency\u2019s quarterly unaudited SBR  and the agency\u2019s related quarterly Standard Form (SF) 133 Report on  Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources (SBR to SF 133  reconciliations). Agencies\u2019 SF 133s are submitted to Treasury and serve as  the main source for the CFS budget reporting and reconciliation. Material  unreconciled differences remained at the end of fiscal year 2007 between  the agencies\u2019 SBRs and their related SF 133s. OMB conducted further  analysis on the agencies\u2019 quarterly SBR to SF 133 reconciliations and  determined that many of these differences related to the recording of  distributed offsetting receipts. Although distributed offsetting receipts are  included in the net outlay calculation in federal agencies\u2019 SBRs, as well as  in the computation of the budget deficit in the CFS, they are not included  as part of the SF 133s, and as such are not being identified and addressed  by the agencies in the quarterly reconciliation process.", "OMB is aware that the reporting of distributed offsetting receipts  contributes to many of the material differences in net outlays and is  currently determining how to reconcile distributed offsetting receipts  included in the net outlay calculation of federal agencies\u2019 SBRs and the  amounts included in the computation of the budget deficit in the CFS.  Until the federal government has effective processes and procedures in  place for identifying and resolving material differences between the total  net outlays reported in federal agencies\u2019 SBRs and the records used to  prepare the CFS, the actual extent of such differences and their effect on  the CFS will be unknown."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of OMB direct the Controller of OMB\u2019s  Office of Federal Financial Management, in coordination with Treasury\u2019s  Fiscal Assistant Secretary, to develop formal processes and procedures for  identifying and resolving any material differences in distributed offsetting  receipt amounts included in the net outlay calculation of federal agencies\u2019  SBRs and the amounts included in the computation of the budget deficit in  the CFS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Control over Spreadsheets Used to Prepare the CFS", "paragraphs": ["Treasury developed the Governmentwide Financial Report System (GFRS)  to collect federal agencies\u2019 audited financial statement information to  prepare the CFS. Federal agencies enter their audited financial  information into GFRS, and Treasury exports the data into a database and  then into various spreadsheets in order to compile the CFS. Treasury did  not maintain adequate control over the spreadsheets used to summarize  and array financial data for presentation in the CFS. Specifically,  Treasury\u2019s processes and procedures for management and control of the  spreadsheets were largely undocumented. In addition, Treasury had not  established adequate controls to ensure that certain key spreadsheets  were (1) protected from inadvertent change and (2) documented to  facilitate detection and tracking of changes to key formulas and data.  Further, the column headings within many spreadsheets were either not  labeled or the labels were not aligned with the data contained in the  column. GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  calls for controls to be in place to safeguard financial information and help  reduce the risk of errors, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. In addition,  vendor documentation also provides guidance on maintaining and  protecting spreadsheet integrity. OMB Circular No. A-127 requires that  appropriate internal control be applied to all financial management system  inputs, processing, and output. It also requires that financial management  systems and associated instructions for maintenance and use be clearly  documented in sufficient detail to permit an individual with appropriate  background knowledge to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the  entire operation of the system.
