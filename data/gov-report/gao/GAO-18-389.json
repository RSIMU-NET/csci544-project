Four HHS agencies had small unobligated balances as of the September 30, 2017, obligation deadline; these balances cannot be used to incur new obligations, but may be used to adjust award amounts in future years. Disbursement of the obligated funds was ongoing, with about 21 percent of the Zika supplemental funding (approximately $195.5 million) disbursed as of December 31, 2017. The agencies have until September 30, 2022, to disburse the remainder.", "The 12 awardees GAO interviewed\u2014officials from 10 states and two local entities\u2014funded multiple activities with their Zika supplemental funding, and had varying experiences applying for and managing the funds.", "Awardees told GAO that they used their funding to support such activities as collection of information about individuals affected by the Zika virus (human surveillance), mosquito control activities, laboratory capacity building, public outreach, and health care services. For example, Florida used Zika supplemental funding in its state-run laboratories to purchase materials for testing Zika virus-related specimens.", "A majority of the awardees GAO spoke with reported positive experiences applying for and managing the Zika supplemental funding, including good communication with agency officials and awardees\u2019 familiarity with the mechanisms used to make the awards. However, some awardees noted challenges, such as time frames to use the funding that varied among multiple awards and identifying the activities that could be funded. These challenges added administrative burdens to applying for and managing the Zika supplemental funding while officials were responding to the outbreak, according to the awardees. In October 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new notice of funding opportunity that agency officials said is intended to help minimize the administrative burden on states and certain localities during emergencies\u2014such as preparing applications\u2014by pre-approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to be eligible to rapidly receive future awards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Zika virus outbreak in 2015 affected individuals infected with the virus  in ways that had not been seen with other infectious disease outbreaks.  Zika\u2014a virus primarily transmitted through mosquito bites\u2014can cause  symptoms that include fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), and joint and  muscle pain, though many infected individuals do not have symptoms or  will only experience mild symptoms. However, in this outbreak, the Zika  infection in pregnant women has been linked to adverse pregnancy and  birth outcomes: the virus can be passed to the fetus and cause a birth  defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  CDC officials note that this is the first time in more than 50 years that an  infectious pathogen has been identified as the cause of birth defects. The  virus is also linked to other problems, such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and  other birth defects, as well as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an uncommon  sickness of the nervous system. In the western hemisphere, the first  cases of locally transmitted Zika virus disease were confirmed in Brazil in  May 2015; in the continental United States, the first locally transmitted  cases were confirmed in Florida during June to August 2016.

We also reviewed  documentation of the funding opportunity announcements to obtain  information such as the activities allowed under each type of award. To  determine the reliability of the data provided, we compared the tabulated  award amounts received from CDC and HRSA to the actual notices of  award provided by both agencies, and compared NIH award data to the  amounts reported in NIH\u2019s online database. We also obtained information  from BARDA, CMS, and NIH officials regarding the underlying financial  data systems used to compile the data and the controls in place for  recording and maintaining the data. We reviewed the data from each  agency for data discrepancies and obtained the information necessary to  resolve the discrepancies from relevant agency officials. Furthermore, we  interviewed officials from HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Financial Resources on the accuracy of the data and the steps the office  takes to verify agencies\u2019 obligation and disbursement data. On this basis,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our reporting objectives.", "Additionally, to describe the various factors that can affect the  disbursement of funding after obligation, we interviewed officials  representing selected awardees.

From those 45 states,  we judgmentally selected 10 states\u20145 states with the highest funding  and 5 states with the lowest funding\u2014which included the 2 states that  experienced local Zika virus transmissions (Florida and Texas). Our  selected states with the highest funding were Arizona, California, Florida,  Louisiana, and Texas. Our selected states with the lowest funding were  Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma. To obtain perspectives  of awardees at the local level, we judgmentally selected two local  awardees within 2 of the selected states\u2014Houston, Texas, and Los  Angeles County, California.

CMS awarded funding through  the Zika Health Care Services Program to those states, territories,  tribes, or tribal organizations with active or local transmission of the  Zika virus, as confirmed by CDC. CMS awarded funding to the health  departments in American Samoa, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands in January 2017. In June 2017, CMS awarded funding  to the health department in Texas, the only new state or territory with  local transmission of the Zika virus.

These factors include time to  draw down funding from the federal agencies, allowing for program  implementation and a planning period, and awardees\u2019 internal  administrative processes and unique characteristics, as described below.", "Drawdown procedures. CDC officials said that awardees draw down  federal funding on their individual schedules based upon how they  manage their federal funding. Some awardees draw down on a daily  basis, as needed, while others draw down on a biweekly or monthly  basis. Additionally, drawdowns for personnel costs coincide with payroll  schedules, which could be biweekly or monthly. For example, in the case  of monthly payroll, two awardees told us that the federal funding for a  particular month\u2019s expenses would be drawn down the following month.  Furthermore, selected awardees we spoke with said that they draw down  federal funding after they have incurred an expense, such as when they  receive an invoice. For example, Los Angeles County officials reported  that in order to draw down the funds for the organization that is  responsible for servicing their vector control activities, they have to first  receive an invoice from the organization, which the county pays with its  own funds. Only then can the county draw down the federal funding. This  process usually results in at least a 3-month period between receiving the  invoice and drawing down the federal funding, officials said.", "Program implementation and planning period. According to CMS  officials, the agency awarded funding to health departments in American  Samoa, Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands from the  Zika Health Care Services Program, which was a new collaboration  between CMS and these specific awardees. The officials said that the  steps awardees needed to take to stand-up new programs\u2014such as  budget review and approval processes, selection of key personnel to  administer the grant, grant activities related to contracting, and hiring and  procurement\u2014can delay start-up and implementation of the grant  programs.", "Additionally, CMS gave awardees in the Zika Health Care Services  Program a 3-month planning period after they received their notices of  award to amend their activities. For example, Texas officials reported  that they used the 3-month planning period to work on executing  contracts with the local health departments in three counties bordering  Mexico. Texas officials explained that collaborating with the local health  departments entailed determining the greatest potential benefit of the use  of the funds, because the award itself was not enough to cover all of the  costs of direct health care services associated with the Zika virus.", "Awardees\u2019 processes and characteristics. Local administrative  processes for spending federal supplemental funds can result in varied  disbursement time frames. For example, California received Zika  supplemental funding for an award that required an amendment to an  administrative contract, which state officials said takes about 7 to 8  months for internal state approval. Additionally, certain awardees\u2019  characteristics affect disbursements. For example, Houston officials said  the city was eligible for and was directly awarded a CDC cooperative  agreement, but because it does not conduct vector control activities itself,  the city had to negotiate a contract with the surrounding county to conduct  these activities, adding additional time before it could begin  disbursements.", "Officials also noted that awardees\u2019 personnel hiring issues can affect  disbursement time frames. For example, CMS officials said that some  territories experienced delays in carrying out activities due to provider  shortages, particularly among specialists needed to care for children with  developmental delays and birth defects caused by the Zika virus. CMS  officials noted that island jurisdictions, such as the U.S. territories, can  find hiring more difficult due to a shortage of health care professionals  available within the territory, thus requiring individuals to be recruited from  outside the territory, which adds time to the process and raises costs. In  addition, Florida officials in Miami-Dade County reported that the  necessary staff surge during the Zika response was challenging to fill,  noting that it was particularly difficult to find phlebotomists and nurses,  because they were in high demand.", "Standard vaccine development processes also influenced the rate of  disbursement. Due to the long duration of the vaccine development  process, BARDA officials said, disbursements to certain awardees have  occurred at varying intervals. For example, some contract invoices are  received on a monthly basis, or twice a month if the company is a small  business. The invoices are then reviewed and if deemed acceptable, they  are processed for payment.", "The 2017 hurricane season may have affected certain awardees\u2019 use of  their Zika supplemental funding, which prompted agencies to respond by  approving various types of short-term relief for administrative, financial  management, and audit requirements for awardees affected by the  hurricanes. Three agencies\u2014CDC, CMS, and HRSA\u2014awarded Zika  supplemental funding to areas affected by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and  Maria in 2017: Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  CDC officials told us, for example, that because of the hurricanes they  granted extensions at the request of the awardees for submitting financial  and progress reports, and continuation of activities. Similarly, CMS  offered hurricane-affected awardees of the Zika Health Care Services  Program the option to extend the deadline for deliverables, if necessary.  CMS officials told us that grant activities had been affected by the  hurricanes, and all grantees had communicated the intent to fully resume  activities as soon as they are able to do so. Due to the 3-year project  period for grantees, CMS officials said that the affected entities can still  accomplish programmatic responsibilities, even if there is a temporary  halt in project activities.

(See fig. 2 for examples of the mosquito control activities in Miami-Dade  County.)", "Through CMS\u2019s Zika Health Care Services Program, Florida received  funding for, among other things, two part-time advanced registered nurse  practitioners to provide consultation and technical assistance in family  planning clinics, and assist in the prescribing and management of various  birth control methods. Florida also funded a health educator for Zika  prevention and response duties, which included assisting local health  care organizations in the development of educational programming to  ensure that health care services are provided in accordance with CDC  guidelines. The health educator\u2019s duties also included ensuring that  pregnant women with the Zika virus and infants with congenital Zika  infection are referred to proper care and other available programs and  resources.", "Texas. Texas officials said that the state used a CDC award to rapidly  identify cases and conduct data analysis of Zika-related birth defects, to  enhance surveillance of Zika virus-related birth defects by improving the  Texas Birth Defects Registry database, and to facilitate remote access to  electronic records. Texas also disseminated prevention materials and  interviewed mothers of children with Zika-related birth defects about their  experience in dealing with the health system in order to help identify  developmental outcomes of the children.", "Texas intends to use its CMS Zika Health Care Services Program  funding\u2014awarded on June 30, 2017\u2014to increase clients\u2019 access to  contraceptives; for care management, including counseling on Zika virus  testing for pregnant women and their families; and for counseling to refer  clients for services and support. State officials provided the following  information on some of the activities intended for the program.  1.  Increasing clients\u2019 access to contraceptives: Community health  workers and case management staff will assist clinic providers with  informing women and their partners about contraceptive availability  and about the potential Zika virus risks during pregnancy. They will  also work with the women to determine what messages work best  with their partners regarding contraceptives.  2.  Care management that includes pre- and post-test counseling on Zika  virus testing for pregnant women and their families: Officials said that  this activity is important because the CDC testing algorithm is  complex, the results from various tests can be confusing, and there  can be false positives from the tests. Generally, doctors do not have  the time to go through the complexities of these issues with clients,  such as how to understand the laboratory tests and results.  3.  Counseling to refer clients for services and supports: This can include  counseling about various types of resources to support clients pre- delivery, after delivery, and during the infant\u2019s first year of life.", "Arizona. According to state officials, Zika supplemental funding was used  to create an action plan with counties, and increase the state\u2019s ability to  raise public awareness about the threat of the Zika virus, its transmission  routes, and prevention measures. Officials stated that Arizona\u2019s border  with Mexico makes communicating about Zika more complex, because  individuals frequently cross the border for a variety of reasons including  work, school, and to visit family, and do not necessarily consider  themselves to be travelers. Additionally, the state used funding to  increase the amount of personal protective equipment for the vector  surveillance staff, and set up vector control contracts that could be  accessed if the Zika virus spread locally, and in the event that vector  control could not be handled at the local level. However, this contracting  mechanism was not used, because there was no local transmission of the  Zika virus in Arizona. According to state officials, Arizona plans to ask for  an extension to use the funding in the next mosquito season. The state  health department also sponsored training on mosquito identification.", "Los Angeles County. County officials said that some funding was used  to support personnel involved with Zika surveillance, testing, and case  management. This included the detection of cases\u2014individuals  diagnosed with Zika infection\u2014and also the dissemination of information  to Los Angeles County\u2019s Maternal and Child Health group, which follows  pregnant women through delivery and then transfers the cases to the  county\u2019s Children\u2019s Medical Services group. For example, according to  officials, once a case is identified, information is shared with the relevant  vector control district about the location of the case, and the vector control  district can then conduct inspection and abatement activities to reduce  the risk of a local outbreak. Los Angeles County officials found that this  process takes about one week from finding out about a case to  completion of inspection and abatement. This included 1 day to get  information to the vector control district and 1 to 5 days for completing  inspection and abatement. The funding was also used to provide funds to  the vector control districts to augment Aedes mosquito detection efforts  and support outreach activities, according to county officials.", "Louisiana. Louisiana officials said they used a CDC award, in part, to  provide equipment and mileage reimbursement for nurses, who served as  clinical liaisons between the birth defects surveillance program and  hospitals and physicians statewide, to help enable rapid surveillance  activities.", "Awardees also funded other activities, such as outreach campaigns.

The awardees we spoke with received much of  their supplemental funding from CDC and noted that the process went  well: there was good communication with CDC officials; CDC\u2019s  Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases  cooperative agreement process to apply for Zika supplemental funds was  more streamlined than the regular application process; and awardees  said they were familiar with the mechanisms, which helped them navigate  the process.", "Awardees we spoke to also cited some challenges to applying for and  managing the Zika supplemental funding. These awardees noted that  various time frames among multiple awards and restrictions on authorized  activities under the awards added administrative burdens that officials  had to deal with while responding to the outbreak. Florida officials said  that the state received funding from different federal agencies, from  different cooperative agreement awards, with different deadlines, and  different rules on what the funding could be used for. For example, CDC  distributed Zika supplemental funds to states and certain localities and  territories through five cooperative agreements\u2014some of which had  multiple application rounds. Florida officials said that they had to track  funding separately and identify the activities that could be funded under  each award\u2014administrative requirements that were burdensome during  an emergency response. Figure 4 presents the period of time Florida had  to use the Zika supplemental funding from multiple awards received from  CDC.", "In addition, awardees we spoke with cited challenges with adjusting their  plans when federal funding was more or less than anticipated. For  example, CDC officials said that they provided average award amount  ranges as guidance for awardees as part of the application process for  one of CDC\u2019s cooperative agreements. Los Angeles County officials  said that they applied for an amount that was near the limit, and county  officials said that they had to adjust the activities they planned to fund  when they received less than what they applied for. Iowa officials said  that without knowing exactly how much funding would be available it was  difficult to know what to apply for and made staffing changes difficult.  Iowa officials had to adjust their initial plan when they later received  additional unexpected funding.", "In October 2017, CDC issued a new notice of funding opportunity that,  according to agency officials, was intended to help minimize the  administrative burden on these awardees (e.g., preparing applications  and other paperwork) during significant public health emergencies by pre- approving public health departments in these jurisdictions to rapidly  receive future awards. This new notice of funding opportunity will be  used to establish a list of awardees, with existing emergency  preparedness and response capacity, that would be pre-approved for  funding by CDC when a public health threat occurs, including infectious  disease threats. It requires that awardees have structures and plans in  place to receive funding, as well as plans to respond to a public health  threat. According to CDC officials, awards could potentially be provided  within 2 weeks to pre-approved awardees after supplemental  appropriations are enacted. According to CDC officials, as of February  2018, the agency had approved all 64 applicants for the notice of funding  opportunity. This means that CDC will consider these approved  applicants for future funding if an emergency occurs and funding  becomes available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.
