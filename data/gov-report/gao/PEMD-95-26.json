Funded with federal and state dollars, the program operates as an individual entitlement\u2014that is, everyone who meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to receive benefits. In fiscal year 1993, AFDC benefits supported 5 million families and more than 9.5 million children each month and cost over $25 billion in federal and state funds. The Family Support Act of 1988 created the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) program, which requires the states to enroll an increasing proportion of their adult AFDC recipients (primarily women) in the education, training, and employment-related activities they need to get jobs and avoid long-term welfare dependency. The states are permitted substantial flexibility in designing and implementing their JOBS programs, but they are required to provide participants with the support services deemed necessary, such as child care and transportation. Federal funds to match state JOBS expenditures are capped, but most states have not reached the limit of that cap. However, as we reported last December, the share of AFDC recipients active in JOBS is limited; only about one fourth of those required to participate were served in an average month in fiscal year 1993.", "Rapid growth in the AFDC caseload since 1989 and concern about program costs and beneficiaries\u2019 long-term dependence have led to widespread dissatisfaction with the AFDC program and to several congressional proposals to reform it. Some provisions of current proposals represent continuity with previous legislative efforts to strengthen the employment focus of the program, such as requiring larger proportions of recipients to participate in a work program. Other provisions propose dramatic changes in AFDC\u2019s structure, such as imposing time limits on the receipt of benefits and replacing the individual entitlement to benefits with a block grant for which federal funding would be fixed.", "Concern about welfare dependency has spurred policy initiatives since the 1970s to encourage or assist welfare clients to get jobs. The states have obtained waivers from existing federal statutes and regulations to test a variety of welfare-to-work initiatives. One condition of the waivers is that the states rigorously evaluate the effects of these initiatives. Evaluations conducted under such waivers informed the formulation of the JOBS program; others completed since 1988 can similarly inform the current debate.", "This report presents the results of our evaluation synthesis of nine published high-quality studies, from eight states, of welfare-to-work experiments for adult AFDC recipients. We identified these studies by conducting a systematic search and methodological review of all evaluations published since the Family Support Act of 1988 that focused, at least in part, on moving clients from welfare to work. All nine studies used comparison groups, six of which were formed through random assignment, making it possible to estimate the effects of a program by comparing the outcomes for its participants with those for nonparticipants.", "To meet our first objective, we compared the approaches used in these experiments with provisions of the proposed welfare reforms being debated. Our list of provisions was derived primarily from the pending House welfare reform bill, H.R. 4, but we also included a few provisions from other bills introduced in the 104th Congress. To meet our second objective\u2014to identify approaches that successfully moved AFDC recipients from welfare to work\u2014we compared and contrasted the statistically significant effects of similar and dissimilar programs on participants\u2019 earnings, employment, and welfare receipt. (See appendix I for details on our selection and analysis of these studies.) We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between December 1994 and April 1995. However, we did not independently verify the information in the evaluation reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Findings", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Completed State Experiments Have Tested Only Some of the Proposed Welfare Reforms", "paragraphs": ["The welfare-to-work experiments we reviewed tested many of the provisions in welfare reform proposals (including H.R. 4), such as conducting some form of work program that may provide support services such as child care and requiring adult AFDC recipients to participate in that work program and to cooperate with child support enforcement. (See table 1.) In addition, some states experimented with extending medical and child care benefits to families as they leave welfare for work and with increasing the disregard of earnings while on welfare, both of which are provisions in other current proposals. Of course, the states may not have implemented these features in quite the same form as they appear in the legislative proposals.", "Proposed provisions not in the state experiments we reviewed include limits on the length of welfare receipt, prohibition of additional benefits for additional children born to families on welfare, and requirements that unwed teenage mothers live with a parent or guardian. These are the subject of ongoing or planned experiments and have not yet been evaluated. Prohibiting aid to noncitizens, creating block grants with fixed funding, and ending requirements that the states match federal expenditures have not been options available to the states. Replacing the current AFDC program with a block grant would basically repeal current federal law prescribing state procedures for determining individuals\u2019 eligibility for benefits and benefit levels. This change aims to increase the states\u2019 flexibility in managing their programs of assistance to needy families and would provide the states with a fixed amount of funds each year rather than matching (at federally specified rates) whatever their expenditures had been.", "The states have also tested several program features not explicitly addressed in some of the legislative proposals, such as enhancing employment and training activities and consolidating the AFDC and Food Stamp programs. Some of these experiments were begun before the JOBS program was enacted but tested features it currently requires, such as providing a broad range of employment-related and support services. Under H.R. 4, the states would be permitted but no longer required to provide as broad a range of employment-related services and supports. Indeed, the states might be discouraged from enrolling clients in some types of education and training because these activities would not count toward the bill\u2019s work program participation requirements. The states would face financial sanctions if they failed to meet minimum participation levels. Thus, these state experiments are relevant to the question of whether the more inclusive provisions of current law should be retained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Range of Programs Had Positive Results", "paragraphs": ["All but three of the experiments had a statistically significant positive effect on at least one of the following: participants\u2019 employment, earnings, receipt of welfare, and welfare payment amounts. Four were successful on all four outcomes, three others on only one or two. Effects were positive more often on employment and earnings than AFDC receipt, but a variety of approaches and their combinations had some success.", "Program outcomes were often measured 1, 2, or sometimes 3, and in one up to 5, years after clients had been enrolled. We scored them as \u201cpositive\u201d if a statistically significant effect in the intended direction was recorded at any of these time points. The more complex scores for Florida\u2019s Project Independence (FPI) program are discussed below.", "Table 2 summarizes the major features being tested and does not include features that applied to both the experimental and comparison groups. For example, programs that did not test an employment and training program (the last four rows) offered similar levels and kinds of employment services to both the program and comparison groups, but only the program participants were offered an increase in the earned income disregard.", "Because the programs typically combined several features at once, individually they do not provide clear tests of the effectiveness of single program features. Therefore, we drew our conclusions about the success of program approaches (including clusters of these features) both by comparing the effects of programs that included and did not include the same feature and by comparing the features of the more and less successful programs. However, our sample of 10 studies is not large enough to provide conclusive answers, because, of course, there are many differences between the studies, some of which might have influenced their outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combining a Broad Range of Employment-Related Services and Supports Yielded the Best, Though Modest, Results", "paragraphs": ["The most successful welfare-to-work programs\u2014those with the largest and most consistent effects\u2014offered participants an expanded mix of education, training, and employment services; increased child care assistance; and mandated some form of client participation. Four programs using this same general approach\u2014San Diego\u2019s Saturation Work Initiative Model (SWIM), Massachusetts\u2019 Employment and Training (ET) program, and California\u2019s Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program, both statewide and in Riverside county\u2014were the only ones to record statistically significant effects on all four outcomes.", "These programs provided a mix of employment-related services, of which clients could receive one or more. Education and training included assistance in basic education, preparation for the high-school equivalency examination (or GED), English-language training, and vocational classes. Intensive job search included program staff working with employers to develop job placements, assisting clients with their job search, or starting clients with job searches immediately. In addition, some offered community work experience (CWEP), which involves unpaid work in public or nonprofit agencies aimed at increasing clients\u2019 employability. Their evaluations compared participants\u2019 outcomes to those of AFDC clients who received whatever the standard level of employment services was at the time. Since some of these programs began operating before the JOBS program was enacted, they typically offered either a lower level of service than is currently required or nothing at all.", "Child care assistance was increased to allow participation in employment preparation activities and, during the first year of postwelfare employment, to facilitate the transition off public assistance. Participation mandates included requirements to register for job search and apply for work, participate for a specified number of hours per month, or enroll in a sequence of employment-related activities. However, this does not mean that all clients actually participated; some could be exempted for personal reasons, others for lack of program resources.", "There were, however, some significant differences in the four successful programs. Massachusetts\u2019 ET allowed voluntary client participation and selection of activities after a mandatory work registration, while California\u2019s SWIM enforced a fixed sequence of activities and GAIN allowed a variety of sequences. ET put more emphasis on education and training, while GAIN in Riverside put more emphasis on aggressive job search support. The statewide program emphasized basic education more than the other programs.", "Two other programs in Ohio and Florida that took the same general approach had mixed results, which could in part be explained by funding problems that delayed or cut short the full experiment. Ohio\u2019s economy took a downward turn at the start of the Transitions to Independence\u2014Fair Work (TI) program evaluation period, causing an influx of cases and lengthy backlogs. In fact, a majority of clients did not even receive their employment and training assignments. TI achieved effects on only one of the four outcomes. Florida\u2019s FPI showed positive effects for first-year participants on two outcomes, but an economic downturn combined with a budget freeze led to program reductions in the second year. This provided the opportunity to test the effects of the changes\u2014increases in caseloads and the elimination of child care assistance. However, the contribution of these features is unclear because both the early and later groups of participants achieved mixed results.", "The effects of even the most successful program were modest. The Riverside GAIN program is arguably the most successful of the welfare-to-work programs. It increased the proportion of clients ever employed in 3 years to 67 percent, or 14 percentage points over the comparison group, but this means that 33 percent of clients in the best program were never employed in 3 years. Of those who were employed at the end of 3 years, only 24 percent made more than $5,000 per year. Thus, Riverside GAIN participants averaged a 49-percent increase in earnings over 3 years compared to nonparticipants receiving only traditional AFDC, but this amounted to only $3,113, or about $1,000 per year. The Riverside program lowered average AFDC payments for all participants over 3 years by 15 percent, or $1,983, and reduced the percentage who were receiving AFDC payments after 3 years by 5 percent, compared to the nonparticipants. However, after 3 years only one fourth of its participants had achieved self-sufficiency by being both employed and off welfare.", "That the successful programs only modestly reduced welfare dependency has, no doubt, a variety of causes. Even when participation was mandated, not all recipients were required to enroll in activities, some were exempt for ill health or to care for an infant, and others had to wait for assignments. In addition, some education and training programs had participation and attendance problems that diminished their success. These might reflect problems that clients had that support services like those in these programs could address, or perhaps other interventions are needed. Researchers also point to other barriers to moving welfare recipients into self-supporting employment\u2014in particular, their low skill levels and the low wages and short tenure of low-skill jobs. In 1992, 45 percent of the single mothers receiving AFDC lacked a high school diploma and another 38 percent had no schooling beyond high school. Yet occupations that accept limited schooling pay fairly low wages, have limited fringe benefits (such as health insurance), and are characterized by high job turnover. Thus, relatively short-term training and job search interventions may have a limited effect on recipients whose skill levels are low."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Work Incentives Also Succeeded When Reinforced by Employment Supports", "paragraphs": ["Rather than enhancing work-related services, the New York Child Assistance Program (CAP) took a different approach, providing an incentive to work by increasing the amount of earned income working recipients could keep. The program supported this incentive by lowering barriers to reentering the job market; it provided child care stipends in advance for clients to use during job search and training. New York\u2019s program successfully increased employment and earnings but did not reduce welfare receipt.", "In contrast, two programs that increased work incentives and mandated work program participation without expanding employment-related services or child care assistance have not yet succeeded. Michigan\u2019s \u201cTo Strengthen Michigan Families\u201d (TSMF) program increased the amount of the income disregard and also required participation in some form of work program. AFDC clients were required to enter into \u201ca social contract\u201d in which they had to complete 20 hours a week of broadly defined \u201cuseful\u201d activities of their own choice, such as education or job search. However, no additional child care assistance was provided to assist them in keeping this contract, and there were no significant effects in the first year. During the second year, some small effects were achieved for both earnings and welfare receipt for some subgroups but typically only in the final quarter or month for those with 2 years of data. Evaluation of the effects on the full sample and their stability will have to await future reports.", "Similarly, Alabama\u2019s Avenues to Self-Sufficiency through Employment and Training Services (ASSETS) program increased work incentives and strengthened its work registration and child support cooperation requirements. In addition to raising the amount of the basic earnings disregard, ASSETS raised the limits on savings and other resources that families were allowed to have while remaining eligible for AFDC. However, it also reduced the amount that could be specifically deducted from earnings for child care expenses. The implementation of their planned employment and training component was delayed by 2 years, so available results do not fully reflect it. This program has had no significant effects on welfare receipt or average payment so far, although the evaluation is not yet complete.", "Finally, like New York\u2019s CAP, Washington\u2019s Family Independence Program (FIP) both provided economic incentives to encourage work and increased child care assistance. It also aimed to increase participation in education and training by offering small cash bonuses to the participants. However, FIP\u2019s plans became difficult to implement under budget restrictions, and caseloads increased sharply without a corresponding increase in staff. Several features were implemented minimally, such as improving a client\u2019s contact with a case manager and increasing resources to pay for education and training. In addition, the comparison group began getting very similar services in 1990, about a year and a half into the program, when JOBS was implemented in Washington state. Thus, it is difficult to know how to attribute the significant increase in AFDC receipt and payments experienced by this program\u2019s participants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review of state experiences suggests that the most successful programs offered a broader package of employment-related services than some proposed reform legislation encourages. The programs that successfully increased employment and earnings and reduced welfare receipt offered a broad mix of education, training, and employment-related services and supports like those in the current JOBS program. However, under H.R. 4, welfare recipients enrolled in some education and training activities would not count toward meeting the work program participation levels that are required in order to avoid financial sanctions.", "Some provisions of the proposed reforms\u2014like the time limit on benefit receipt\u2014have not yet been tested and thus we cannot confidently project the future effects of either those individual provisions or the entire package of reforms. For example, imposing a strict limit on the length of time a family can receive benefits might influence participants\u2019 work behavior. This could influence the effectiveness of both types of work programs, those offering either a broad or narrow package of services; we simply do not have similar past experiences to draw upon.", "The modest results of even the most successful programs implies that (1) within the current program structure, even increasing investments in employment and support services will not quickly reduce caseloads or welfare dependency, and (2) additional research is needed to understand the barriers to better program performance and to develop and test more successful approaches. However, it should be recognized that some of these barriers may reside outside the welfare program\u2019s control, including poor school preparation and the limited availability and low wages of low-skill jobs.", "Although federal funds for AFDC benefits have not been capped before, the states have limited the funds available for their work programs. Our review suggest that adequacy of funds can be a critical barrier to the success of efforts to help clients move from welfare to work. Three states in our review were unable to sustain or fully implement their planned level of service because state budget constraints kept them from increasing program capacity to match their growing caseloads. However, by reducing federal prescriptions on the use of these funds, the reform proposals aim to increase the states\u2019 flexibility to manage such resource constraints.", "Many of the program evaluations that we reviewed were conducted under the requirement that waivers of federal regulations be rigorously evaluated. The pending welfare reform legislation would reduce federal regulation in order to foster further state experimentation, but it would, thereby, effectively remove that evaluation requirement and thus possibly reduce the incentive for future evaluations of state experiments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We are not making recommendations in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Response", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) commented on a draft of this report and generally agreed with our conclusions but argued that (1) the differences between the programs studied and those that would be offered under H.R. 4 are so substantial that one must conclude that the proposed reforms have not been tested and (2) the report makes too strong a case for individual factors explaining program success or failure and should instead describe the \u201cpackage\u201d of services that may have led to certain effects.

Finally, we confirmed this list of nine evaluations with program and evaluation officials at HHS. They suggested several studies that we might consider as background but no additional impact evaluations.", "We explicitly excluded programs focused exclusively on AFDC teenagers, who may have very different needs.
