Further, the Air Force noted that the program had not been well publicized within the department.", "Challenges in meeting all the criteria required to use the pilot program : DOD program and contracting officials that GAO contacted stated that it was difficult to identify proposed acquisitions that could meet all the criteria for using the pilot program, which include that the items must be developed at private expense, the initial lot of items be delivered within nine months after contract award, contractors be nontraditional defense contractors, competitive procedures be used, and contracts are $50 million or less.", "The ability to use other flexibilities to obtain needed items: Contracting officials from the military departments with whom GAO spoke identified other existing authorities\u2014such as commercial item acquisition procedures\u2014that they would use to acquire items they identified as potentially covered by the pilot program.", "DOD officials told GAO that they were aware of these issues but had no ongoing efforts to address them. GAO's prior work has identified several sound management practices to effectively implement or assess pilot programs, including developing objectives that link to the goals of the pilot and ensuring the results of the pilot are communicated to stakeholders.

Lastly, DOD's annual reports to Congress have not identified whether there are specific requirements under the pilot program, such as the need to award contracts competitively, that might hinder its use. Determining whether the pilot program provides meaningful value to the department requires that DOD do more than make the authority available for use by its personnel.

To address this gap, Section 866 of  the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2011 established a pilot program that authorized DOD to award  contracts for military purpose nondevelopmental items (MPNDI) to  companies that had not contracted with DOD for at least a year.

To test whether DOD\u2019s  annual reports accurately reflected the use of the pilot program, we  requested that the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force  (Acquisition); Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,  Logistics and Technology; and the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition and Procurement) determine the  extent to which their respective military departments had awarded any  contracts under the pilot program. Based on the actions taken by the  military departments in response to our request, we determined that the  data, as originally provided to the congressional defense committees, of  DOD\u2019s reported use of the authority from fiscal years 2011 to 2013 were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

Certified cost or pricing data, by regulation, is to be provided to  the government by contractors and subcontractors, at certain threshold  contract levels unless an exception applies, to support their proposed  prices and to certify that the data are accurate, complete, and current.  Certified cost or pricing data documentation requirements can be  extensive. Cost Accounting Standards are mandatory for use by  executive agencies and by contractors and subcontractors in estimating,  accumulating, and reporting costs in connection with pricing and  administration of, and settlement of, disputes generally concerning all  negotiated prime contract and subcontract procurements with the  government in excess of the thresholds for submission of certified cost or  pricing data.", "Congress required that DOD provide information on contracts awarded  under the pilot program not later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal  year in which the pilot program is in effect.

Congress and others have taken various steps, including  creation of the MPNDI pilot program, to address these concerns. For  example, in 1996 Congress established a commercial item test program  to provide contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and  flexibility to acquire commercial items. Commercial items and services  are those generally available in the commercial marketplace in contrast  with items developed to meet specific federal government requirements.  Commercial items are generally exempt from the requirement to provide  certified cost or pricing data or comply with cost accounting standards.  Similarly, Congress provided DOD the authority to enter into \u201cother  transactions\u201d to take advantage of technological advances made by the  private sector. Other transactions are generally not subject to federal  laws and regulations governing standard procurement contracts. Further,  in May 2013, the Deputy Secretary of Defense asked the Defense  Business Board to begin studying ways to encourage broader  participation in DOD acquisitions from the private sector for the purpose  of encouraging innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Used the Pilot Program or Addressed Issues that Limit Its Use", "paragraphs": ["DOD reported that it has not awarded any contracts using the authority  provided by the pilot program since it was initiated in 2011.

Our review of input provided by the military departments and defense  agencies to DPAP and our interviews with DOD program and contracting  officials identified a number of factors that may be contributing to the lack  of use of the pilot program, including limited awareness of the program,  challenges in meeting all the criteria needed to use the program, and the  ability to use other flexibilities to obtain needed items.

Under this interim rule, DOD created DFARS subpart  212.71, which generally reiterated the pilot program requirements as  prescribed by Section 866. The subpart provided that a new clause,  DFARS 252.212-7002, be used in all solicitations that would meet the  criteria of the pilot program. The subpart also required that departments  and agencies prepare a consolidated annual report to provide information  about contracts awarded under the pilot program authority and submit it  by October 31 of each year. The interim rule was finalized without change  in January 2012.", "The military departments also provided varying levels of guidance that  generally reiterated the pilot program rules as stated in DFARS. For  example, the Navy Marine Corps Acquisition Regulation Supplement  requires that contracts awarded under the pilot program during the  preceding fiscal year be reported annually to the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for Acquisition and Procurement. Air Force Materiel  Command restated the requirements of the pilot program in their  February 2012 and April 2014 Contracting Bulletins, which are distributed  to contracting personnel across the command, and also issued  corresponding training slides that restated the requirements of the pilot  program. In addition, during the course of our audit, the Army distributed  a policy alert on the proper use of the pilot program by restating the  requirements.", "Over the past three years, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics has reported to Congress that DOD  has not awarded contracts under the authority provided by the pilot  program during each of the prior fiscal years. To prepare its annual  reports, DPAP requests data from each of the military departments,  defense agencies, and other defense offices on all instances of use of the  pilot program during the relevant fiscal year. Each DOD component is  required to provide information for each contract awarded under the pilot  program, including the contractor, item(s) acquired, price, military purpose  served by the item(s) acquired, and steps taken to ensure fair and  reasonable pricing. DPAP also requires the components to report if they  have not used the pilot program during the course of the prior fiscal year.  DOD\u2019s annual reports found, and our discussions with military department  and defense agency officials confirmed, that DOD has not used the  authority from fiscal years 2011 to 2013. As a result, the pilot program  has not resulted in DOD obtaining items that otherwise might not have  been available to it nor assisted in the rapid acquisition and fielding of  capabilities to meet urgent operational needs. The absence of contracts  awarded under the pilot program precludes us from determining how  DOD protected the government\u2019s interests in paying fair and reasonable  prices for the item(s) acquired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Addressed Issues Potentially Limiting the Use of the Pilot Program", "paragraphs": ["Our review of the input provided by the defense components, as well as  our information from interviews with policy, program, and contracting  officials at the 11 components we contacted, identified a number of issues  that may be contributing to the lack of use of the pilot program, including  limited awareness of the pilot program, challenges in meeting all the  criteria required to use the pilot program, and the ability to use other  flexibilities to obtain needed items. DOD is aware of a number of issues  but has no ongoing efforts to address them. The following examples  illustrate these issues.", "Limited awareness of the pilot program: In several instances, DOD  officials from commands and contracting activities that we interviewed  were generally unaware of the pilot program prior to our review, noting  that the program had not been well publicized or could only cite its  inclusion into DFARS. For example, the program officials from the  Army\u2019s Rapid Equipping Force told us that they were notified of the  pilot program on October 1, 2014 as a result of our review. Similarly,  program officials from the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat  Organization were unaware of the pilot program until we had  contacted them for information. Further, the Air Force noted in its  response to the fiscal year 2014 DPAP data call on the pilot program  that the program had not been well publicized within the department  and identified this issue as one of several reasons why the program  had not been used.", "Challenges in meeting all the criteria required to use the pilot  program: Program and contracting officials from commands and  contracting activities we interviewed stated that it was difficult to  identify proposed acquisitions that met all the requirements for using  the pilot program. Officials from 5 of the 11 offices that we spoke with  provided examples or told us that in their experience the items they  acquire generally need to be modified for government use and  therefore may not meet the requirement that the item was developed  exclusively at private expense. For example, officials from the Army  Rapid Equipping Force told us about a 2011 need to identify and field  a sensor package that could measure, collect, and store data on  improvised explosive device blast pressure experienced by soldiers  inside and outside of vehicles. These officials noted that doing so  would enable the Army to advance research and treatment on mild  traumatic brain injuries. The Army determined that no existing  nondevelopmental items suitably measured such forces, so they  modified an existing commercial item to meet the need, which in turn  was deployed to Afghanistan in June 2012. In another example, a  contracting official from the Air Force Materiel Command identified a  commercially-available airplane landing system that was modified by  the government for military-use. In its response to the fiscal year 2014  DPAP data call, the Air Force noted that the many requirements of the  pilot program that must be met, such as delivery within nine months,  use of nontraditional contractors, the required use of competitive  procedures, and the restriction not to exceed $50 million, limited the  applicability of the program.", "Additionally, several DOD officials cited the requirement to use  competitive procedures as a limiting factor. DPAP officials noted that  Section 866 requires the use of \u201ccompetitive procedures\u201d without  further definition. These officials noted that 10 U.S.C. 2302 defines  competitive procedures as acquisitions conducted under full and open  competition\u2014that is, under which all responsible bidders or offerors  are eligible to compete. As such, DPAP officials did not believe that  the use of Section 866 allowed acquisitions to be conducted using  one of the exceptions to competitive procedures, such as awarding a  contract on a sole-source basis. However, some DOD officials  stated that they thought the program may be more useful if exceptions  to competition could be used. They noted that the ability to use  exceptions to competition would make one of the key features of the  pilot program\u2014the exemption from the need to provide certified cost  and pricing data\u2014more applicable because certified cost and pricing  data would generally apply to contracts that are awarded non- competitively.", "The ability to use other flexibilities to obtain needed items:  Contracting officials from the military departments with whom we  spoke identified other existing authorities\u2014such as commercial item  acquisition procedures\u2014that they would use to acquire items that they  identified as potentially covered by the pilot program. In several  cases, officials provided examples of nondevelopmental items  developed at private expense that they acquired through competitive  commercial item acquisition procedures. As such, DOD would  generally be precluded from obtaining certified cost or pricing data or  from requiring the contractor to adhere to federal cost accounting  standards, two benefits that the pilot program was to provide to attract  commercial firms. For example, during our interview with the Naval  Surface Warfare Center, contracting officials initially identified data  recorders as potentially meeting the requirements of the pilot program  but ultimately concluded that acquisition of these recorders would  most likely be acquired as a commercial item. Further, in another  example, DPAP officials told us that military purpose aviation fuel  tanks were acquired as a commercial item rather than under the pilot  program, because DOD determined the fuel tanks met the definition of  a commercial item. As we found in our February 2014 report on  DOD\u2019s commercial item test program, DOD contracting officers have  many tools in their toolkit and the decision regarding the appropriate  contracting method for a commercial item is left to the contracting  officers\u2019 discretion. We found that several factors influence the  contracting officer\u2019s decision, such as the estimated value of the  contract at award, the urgency of the requirement, the availability of  existing contracts or contracting vehicles, as well as the nature of the  item or service being acquired.", "GAO has issued several reports on DOD\u2019s urgent needs processes. See, for example,  GAO, Warfighter Support: DOD\u2019s Urgent Needs Processes Need a More Comprehensive  Approach and Evaluation for Potential Consolidation, GAO-11-273 (Washington, D.C.:  Mar. 1, 2011); and GAO, Warfighter Support: Improvements to DOD\u2019s Urgent Needs  Processes Would Enhance Oversight and Expedite Efforts to Meet Critical Warfighter  Needs, GAO-10-460 (Washington, D.C.: Apr. 30, 2010). some modifications to the design.

However, DOD has not yet used the program in the 3  years since it was initiated. Determining whether the pilot program  provides meaningful value to the department requires that DOD do more  than make the authority available for use by its personnel. In that regard,  DOD has not provided assistance to its program and contracting officials  to help identify opportunities to use the pilot program as currently  structured, nor has it reported to Congress on issues that hinder its use,  such as the requirement to use competitive procedures. Further, DOD  identified a number of existing authorities that enabled them to acquire  needed goods and services quickly from the private sector. Identifying  whether there are targets of opportunities in terms of industries,  technologies or capabilities that remain untapped, or gaps in existing  authorities or procedures that could be met, or limitations in the pilot  program\u2019s current structure that hinder its use can help shape the future  of the pilot program. Unless DOD takes such action, the remaining 5  years of the authority may not produce results that differ from those  reported over the past 3 years. If so, DOD will have missed an  opportunity to make an informed decision as to whether authority  provided under the pilot program would provide value to the department.
