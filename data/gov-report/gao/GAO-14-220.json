The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) takes a more crosscutting and integrated approach to improving government performance. GPRAMA requires that GAO periodically review implementation of the law. As a part of a series of reports responding to this requirement, GAO assessed how interagency groups addressed the central collaboration challenges identified in its prior work of 1) defining outcomes; 2) measuring performance and ensuring accountability; 3) establishing leadership approaches; and 4) using resources, such as funding, staff, and technology.", "GAO selected four interagency groups that met its key practices for enhancing and sustaining collaboration to learn about the approaches they used and found to be successful. These groups addressed issues of homelessness, reentry of former inmates into society, rental housing policy, and the education of military dependent students. To identify successful approaches, GAO reviewed agency documents, and interviewed agency officials that participated in these groups. Additionally, GAO convened recipients of the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award, who had experience with interagency collaboration. GAO is not making any recommendations in this report. GAO shared a draft of this report with key agencies that participated in the interagency groups GAO reviewed.

However, agencies  face a range of challenges and barriers when they attempt to work  collaboratively. The need for improved collaboration has been highlighted  throughout our work over many years, in particular in two bodies of work.  First, our reports over the past three years identified more than 80 areas  where opportunities exist for executive branch agencies or Congress to  reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication. We found that resolving  many of these issues requires better collaboration among agencies.  Second, collaboration and improved working relationships across  agencies are fundamental to many of the issues that we have designated  as high risk due to their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, or because they are most in need of transformation.", "The current federal budget situation poses additional challenges for  agencies. Federal agencies will need to work even more closely with  other agencies to leverage more limited resources to achieve their  missions in the current fiscally constrained environment. The Budget  Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, established a 10-year cap  on discretionary spending as part of a process to achieve more than $2  trillion in deficit reduction. Spending for the major health and retirement programs is projected to increase as a share of the gross domestic  product in coming decades, putting greater pressure on the rest of the  federal budget. All of these conditions will require greater scrutiny of  federal efforts.", "For almost two decades we have reported on agencies\u2019 missed  opportunities for improved collaboration through the effective  implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA). In our 1997 assessment of the status of the implementation of  GPRA, we reported that agencies faced challenges addressing  crosscutting issues, which led to fragmentation and overlap. Again, we  reported in 2004\u2014more than 10 years after the enactment of GPRA\u2014that  there was an inadequate focus on addressing issues that cut across  federal agencies. Now, more than 20 years since GPRA\u2019s passage, our  work continues to demonstrate that the needed collaboration is not  sufficiently widespread. The GPRA Modernization Act of 2010  (GPRAMA) establishes a new framework aimed at taking a more  crosscutting and integrated approach to focusing on results and  improving government performance. Like the original GPRA, effective  implementation of GPRAMA could play an important role in clarifying  desired outcomes, in addressing program performance that spans  multiple organizations, and in facilitating future actions to reduce  unnecessary duplication, overlap, and fragmentation.", "This report is part of a series of reports under our mandate in GPRAMA to  periodically examine how agencies are implementing the law. The  objectives of this report are to examine how select interagency groups  (such as task forces, working groups, councils, and committees): 1)  defined their outcomes; 2) measured performance and ensured  accountability; 3) established leadership approaches; and 4) used  resources, such as funding, staff and technology. We focused on these  key issues because we determined, based on a sample of prior work on  interagency collaboration from 2005 to 2013, that they are the most  common challenges that interagency groups face when collaborating.  Accordingly, we wanted to identify specific implementation approaches  that interagency groups have used to address these issues. We focused  on interagency groups, which was the most commonly used mechanism  for federal interagency collaboration that we found in our prior reports.", "In 2012, we reported on the multiple interagency mechanisms that the   These mechanisms included federal government uses to collaborate. interagency groups (such as task forces, working groups, councils and  committees); co-location (such as housing one or more federal agencies  that collaborate on various programs in one location); and collaboration  technologies (such as shared databases and web portals), among others.  We found in this work that although collaborative mechanisms differed in  complexity and scope, they all benefitted from certain key practices, many  of which we had identified in 2005. Accordingly, in our 2012 report, we  built on our past work and developed key issues for Congress and others  to consider when implementing these mechanisms. Some of these key  features and issues to consider are:", "Outcomes and Accountability: Have short-term and long-term  outcomes been clearly defined? Is there a way to track and monitor  their progress?", "Bridging Organizational Cultures: What are the missions and  organizational cultures of the participating agencies? Have agencies  agreed on common terminology and definitions?", "Leadership: How will leadership be sustained over the long term? If  leadership is shared, have roles and responsibilities been clearly  identified and agreed upon?", "Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities: Have participating agencies  clarified roles and responsibilities?", "Participants: Have all relevant participants been included? Do they  have the ability to commit resources for their agency?", "Resources: How will the collaborative mechanism be funded and  staffed? Have online collaboration tools been developed?", "Written Guidance and Agreements: If appropriate, have  participating agencies documented their agreement regarding how  they will be collaborating? Have they developed ways to continually  update and monitor these agreements?", "Given agencies\u2019 longstanding challenges working across organizational  lines, in 2005, we identified the following practices that can help enhance  and sustain collaboration among federal agencies. (See figure 1).  Appendixes I and II provide the highlights pages for these reports and  Appendix III contains a list of the collaborative mechanisms we identified.", "To identify these implementation approaches, we focused on four  interagency groups, which we had documented in our prior work as  successfully addressing one or more of the key considerations for  implementing collaborative mechanisms. Based on a review of our prior  work, we identified potential interagency groups that exhibited some of  the practices to enhance and sustain collaboration. We then narrowed  the list of interagency groups to four groups that represented a balanced  and diverse set of characteristics, including the number of participating  agencies, duration, creation vehicle (for example, through laws, etc.), and  groups with both voluntary and mandated participation. Our final selection  of interagency groups includes the following:", "Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Education  (Education) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) Working Group;", "Federal Interagency Reentry Council (Reentry Council);", "Rental Policy Working Group; and the", "U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).", "More details on each of these groups can be found in the background  section of this report. For each of these interagency groups, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed officials from select agencies that  participate in each of these groups, and the Office of Management and  Budget. We also observed a Reentry Council event and a USICH meeting  in order to identify potential implementation approaches. In addition, to  identify collaborative leadership competencies, we reviewed relevant  academic literature and relevant reports.", "In addition to the illustrative examples described above, we hosted two  expert practitioner panels, in coordination with the Senior Executives  Association, to identify and discuss useful approaches for implementing interagency groups. We selected panelists who were recipients of the  Presidential Distinguished Rank Award in 2011 or 2012, and had  experience leading or participating in interagency groups.these panelists to share their perspectives on interagency groups; we did  not ask them to speak on behalf of the federal agencies or organizations  that these participants represent or represented.

We note that our findings rest on the  examples we reviewed and the practitioners we interviewed and thus may  not be applicable to all interagency groups. For example, in this report,  we focus on interagency groups that are not established to respond to an  emergency event, which academic and public policy experts have noted  requires a different type of collaboration than during emergencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2012 to February  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In fiscal year 2011, DOJ, Labor, and HHS separately  administered reentry grant programs. The Attorney General convened  the Reentry Council, in part, to coordinate agencies\u2019 reentry efforts to  further prevent unnecessary duplication and share promising practices.  Participants of the Reentry Council told us they developed an inventory of  federal resources that are used to assess where resources are targeted  to enable federal and local stakeholders to leverage these investments.  To develop this inventory, participants of the Reentry Council created a  spreadsheet that listed relevant funding streams and resources from their  agencies that were dedicated to reentry programs. The inventory  identified the amount of funding, the intended purpose, and jurisdictions  associated with resources. The information from this inventory is available  in an online resource with an interactive map of reentry resources across  the United States.", "Officials we spoke with said this type of inventory can also help  communicate some of the differences between agency organizational  cultures, capabilities of agencies to control spending, and array of  program tools being used to achieve mission objectives. For example, in  the instance of USICH, agency officials reported that their agencies often  had different policy and program tools, such as grants, at their disposal.  Accordingly, in the early days of the Council, participants from the  different agencies needed to understand the different purposes and  requirements of the policy and program tools that each agency could  bring to the table. In the case of HHS, homeless individuals may be  eligible for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  program. But, since TANF is administered by the states, HHS cannot  require states to use those grant funds for certain purposes. HHS officials  told us that HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families sent out an  informational memorandum informing community-based organizations  that they can spend TANF grant funds on homeless individuals. Officials  from USICH told us that this memo sent a powerful message to the field  about the opportunity of TANF agencies to engage in state and local  efforts to end homelessness, and strategic steps they can take that are  within their authority. HHS officials also noted that, given the nature of the  program, they cannot require TANF funds to be dedicated to any specific  group, including those experiencing homelessness. According to HHS  officials, the nature of TANF funds can sometimes present a challenge to  working across agency cultures because partners may expect that HHS  can target funds more directly toward homeless individuals than they can.  In contrast, the VA directly provides services to homeless individuals  through medical centers. Therefore, it has more direct control over the  specific homelessness outcomes that USICH is trying achieve. Officials  from USICH told us their role is to facilitate a broad understanding of the  policy and program tools that each member agency brings to the table.", "Our annual reports on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication have  highlighted the challenges associated with the lack of a comprehensive  list of federal programs and funding information. We have found that a  first step in identifying potential fragmentation, overlap, or duplication  among federal programs or activities involves creating a comprehensive  list of programs along with related funding information. Currently, no  comprehensive list exists, nor is there a common definition for what  constitutes a federal \u201cprogram.\u201d In our prior work, we found that the lack  of a common definition for a program makes it difficult to develop a  comprehensive list of all federal programs. The lack of a list, in turn,  makes it difficult to determine the scope of the federal government\u2019s  involvement in particular areas and, therefore, where action is needed to  avoid fragmentation, overlap, or duplication. We also found that federal  budget information is often unavailable or insufficiently reliable to identify  the level of funding provided to programs or activities. For example,  agencies could not isolate budgetary information for some programs  because the data were aggregated at higher levels. Without knowing the  full range of programs involved or the cost of implementing them, gauging  the magnitude of the federal commitment to a particular area of activity, or  the extent to which associated federal programs are duplicative is difficult.

They  included officials from DOJ who helped Labor officials score the grant  applications and decide which grants would receive funding. Labor staff  members said that this relationship helped them to spend the funds in a  more strategic manner because they had additional information on the  topic. To solicit this participation from DOJ staff, Labor staff members  identified the specific time commitment and expertise that they needed  from the DOJ staff.

If a limited number of groups experienced a specific  challenge, but identified a way to address it, we noted this in the text. For  example, only two interagency groups in our sample had a shared  leadership model. While our examples were limited to two groups, this is  a frequently cited challenge in our work, so we included the approach, but  noted in the text that the finding was only supported by two groups we  reviewed.
