According to the Coast Guard (a military service within the Department of Homeland Security), as of August 2017, $59.9 million was spent on the project over nearly 7 years and no equipment or software could be reused for future efforts. In addition, the Coast Guard could not fully demonstrate the project management actions taken for IHiS, lacked governance mechanisms, and did not document lessons learned for the failed project.", "As a result of the cancelation of the IHiS project and the decommissioning of the two legacy electronic health record (EHR) systems IHiS was to replace, the Coast Guard directed its clinics to revert to maintaining health records using a predominantly paper process. Coast Guard Regional Managers and clinic and sick bay administrators informed GAO of the many challenges encountered in returning to a paper process. These challenges include the inability for some clinics to adequately track vital information such as the medications members are taking\u2014potentially causing harm to them.", "To help alleviate several of these challenges, the Coast Guard has developed alternative work-around processes. However, these alternative processes may not provide sustained solutions to overcoming these challenges.", "In February 2016, the Coast Guard initiated the process for acquiring a new EHR system. As of November 2017, agency officials had conducted research and recommended a solution based on performance, risk, cost, and schedule advantages. However, 2 years after canceling IHiS and moving toward a predominately manual process, the agency has not yet made a final determination on this. Successfully and quickly implementing an EHR system is vital to overcoming the challenges Coast Guard currently faces in managing paper health records.

We also reviewed project expenditures  documentation developed by the Deputy Commandant for Mission  Support and the Acquisition Directorate. We supplemented our review  with interviews of agency officials within the Coast Guard\u2019s Health Safety  and Work-Life (HSWL) Directorate, Office of Budget and Programs, Office  of Resource Management, Office of Contract Operations, and Office of  Acquisition Support, along with interviews of six key IHiS contractors.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed the Coast Guard\u2019s  Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information  Technology (C4&IT) System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Policy and  SDLC Practice Manual intended to guide the management and oversight  of the agency\u2019s acquisition projects. We compared available project  management documentation, such as project plans, the project\u2019s  schedule, decision memorandums, and Executive Oversight Council  (EOC) meeting minutes, which demonstrated actions taken by project  management staff during the IHiS project, against key SDLC Practice  Manual requirements. These included fundamental practices for  conceptual planning, planning and requirements, design, and  development and testing. In addition, we interviewed responsible Coast  Guard officials and contractors regarding their role in the project and  determined whether officials documented lessons learned for future  decisions for the new EHR project.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed Coast Guard medical records  management documentation, such as medical manuals, workflow  procedures, and standard operating policies and procedures for the Coast  Guard\u2019s 166 clinics and sick bays.

Historically, patient health information has been scattered across  paper records kept by different caregivers in many different locations,  making it difficult for a clinician to access all of a patient\u2019s health  information at the time of care. Lacking access to these critical data, a  clinician may be challenged in making the most informed decisions on  treatment options, potentially putting the patient\u2019s health at risk. Thus, the  move toward collecting, storing, retrieving, and transferring these records  electronically can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of care.", "This is especially true in the case of military personnel and veterans, such  as those in the Coast Guard, because they tend to be highly mobile and  may have health records at multiple facilities both within and outside the  United States. Therefore, EHRs that are interoperable among health care  systems of providers such as the Coast Guard, the Department of  Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) are key to  improving the care these patients receive.", "In April 2004, the President called for widespread adoption of  interoperable EHRs by 2014. Similarly, in August 2006, the President  instructed agencies, as they implemented, acquired, or upgraded health  information technology (IT) systems, to utilize systems and products that  met recognized interoperability standards.

The Coast Guard\u2019s healthcare services are supported by  41 U.S. based health clinics and 125 sick bays.", "In an effort to meet the need for interoperable EHRs, in 2002, the Coast  Guard implemented DOD\u2019s Composite Health Care System (CHCS) at  its clinics and sickbays. According to the Coast Guard\u2019s medical manual,  the clinics and sickbays used CHCS for various health care-related  activities, including scheduling patient appointments; documenting patient  consults and referrals; storing prescriptions; tracking and controlling  prescribed medications; and tracking laboratory orders. CHCS interfaced  with the DOD Defense Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System, which  provided verification of the identity and benefit eligibility of Coast Guard  members; other military active duty, reserve, and retired personnel; and  their eligible family members. CHCS also interfaced with other health  care-related systems, such as a DOD prescription repository, a patient  lab delivery system used by health care providers, a system that provided  eyewear-related services, and the military\u2019s health insurance provider\u2019s  system.", "To provide a more user-friendly way of accessing CHCS, the Coast  Guard implemented DOD\u2019s Provider Graphical User Interface (PGUI) in  2004. This interface also provided clinics and sick bays with additional  system functionality, such as the ability to create and store medical notes  electronically.", "According to HSWL staff, although CHCS and PGUI provided the Coast  Guard with a way to manage health records electronically, these systems  were outdated and lacked key functionality such as billing, scheduling,  and case management. Therefore, the Coast Guard intended to transition  from CHCS and PGUI to DOD\u2019s more modernized Armed Forces Health  Longitudinal Technology Application (AHLTA) in 2009 to achieve  interoperability with DOD and VA and comply with executive orders and  statutes that called for efficient health care initiatives. However, HSWL  staff stated that the cost of adopting and maintaining AHLTA, as well as  the need for the Coast Guard to meet its unique mission requirements,  led the agency to move forward with implementing a new system of its  own in 2010. The new system was intended to be interoperable with both  DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s health information systems.", "Toward this end, on September 30, 2010, the Coast Guard awarded a 5- year, $14 million contract to acquire a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)  EHR system. According to the Coast Guard\u2019s EHR business case, the  system was to provide ambulatory services, including online management  of patient health records; patient scheduling and billing services; dental  and radiology modules; management of prescribed medications and  tracking laboratory orders, among other capabilities.", "However, while working to implement the COTS EHR system, HSWL staff  determined that many other Coast Guard health care-related IT systems  were outdated and also needed modernization. As a result, the HSWL  Directorate began an effort to expand the original EHR modernization  effort to integrate these other necessary and outdated services. This  expanded project was called IHiS.", "According to the HSWL Directorate, IHiS was to provide additional  services such as work-life and safety data management, work-life case  management, wireless access, and an integrated patient portal that was  intended to allow patients to access their medical records at any time.  The project consisted of various contracts with 25 different vendors and  was estimated to cost approximately $56 million to implement, which  included the original $14 million COTS EHR contract.", "HSWL staff stated that, at the time that the IHiS project was being  planned and designed, the Department of State was also planning to  develop an EHR system. In order to reduce the overall cost to both  parties, in 2012, the Department of State signed an interagency  agreement with the Coast Guard to utilize IHiS for that department\u2019s  personnel. The system was to be implemented in phases with beta  testing at two to three selected Coast Guard clinics in October 2015, and  then subsequent implementation at the other clinics, sick bays, and  Department of State locations.

The  financial risks that the Director presented were based on internal  investigations initiated in January 2015 and May 2015 to determine  whether the HSWL Directorate had violated the Antideficiency Act by  using incorrect funding sources and incorrect fiscal year funds for the IHiS  project. In this regard, the Coast Guard ordered project management and  contractor staff to cease work on IHiS until a determination was made  regarding the antideficiency violation.", "In addition, the Director stated that she relayed technical risks to the  EOC. These risks were identified in an e-mail in late August 2015 by  Coast Guard project management staff who participated in the design and  development efforts for IHiS. The Director and the related e-mail identified  the following technical risks:", "Lack of testing. IHiS lacked an independent security assessment to  verify that the system\u2019s security infrastructure was adequate. In  addition, full interface testing with systems such as the Defense  Eligibility Enrollment Reporting System had yet to be completed to  ensure security and data integrity.", "Limited system functionality. The system that was to provide user  verification and IHiS role management services was not yet complete.", "In addition, Coast Guard workstations could not yet access IHiS from  the network and the patient portal lacked two-factor authentication.  Further, the service that was to register new IHiS users in the system  had yet to be completed.", "The Director also presented schedule and personnel risks to the EOC:", "Delays in the implementation timeline. The Director stated that  between August 2015 and September 2015, she requested that the  DOD\u2019s Defense Health Agency Solution Delivery IT team  independently validate the IHiS timelines and the status of the project.  The Director said she requested this review because of the technical  risks identified in the August 2015 e-mail and concerns as to whether  IHiS would be ready to be piloted at the first clinic in the fall of 2015.  According to the Director, the Defense Health Agency team projected  the timeline for the first clinic implementation to be approximately 1  year later than originally estimated. The Director added that Defense  Health Agency team members stated that the timeline was delayed, in  part, because critical IHiS interfaces and workflows were not complete  or operational. The Director told us that these estimations were  provided by the Defense Health Agency team verbally and that the  team did not provide the Coast Guard any written documentation  outlining its findings.", "Changes in project management staff. Although HSWL staff had  been managing the IHiS project since it was initiated in 2010, C4&IT  was directed to assume the oversight responsibilities for IHiS  implementation in May 2015 due to concerns about the project\u2019s  adherence to established governance processes raised by the internal  investigators looking into the potential Antideficiency Act violations. By  August 2015, the key project management personnel that had  overseen the project since 2010 had been removed. According to  C4&IT staff, IHiS was cancelled during the transition of project  managers. As a result of the changes in staff, one vendor noted that it  was unclear as to who were stakeholders, responsible parties, and  decision makers.", "According to the Director, these risk factors had demonstrated that the  project was far from ready for deployment and that continuing IHiS could  cause significant stewardship and reputational harm to the Coast Guard.  As a result of the risks presented by the Director, the EOC members  made the decision to cancel IHiS, and did not consider any other  alternatives to its cancelation.", "Subsequent to the project\u2019s cancelation, the Deputy Commandant for  Mission Support conducted an analysis of the amount of money that had  been obligated for and spent on the project. According to the analysis,  which included obligations and expenditures from September 2010 to  August 2017, the Coast Guard had obligated approximately $67 million  and, of that amount, had spent approximately $59.9 million on the IHiS  project at the time of its cancelation. Further, according to Office of  Budget and Programs staff members, no equipment or software from the  IHiS project could be reused for future efforts.", "In addition, according to senior staff within the Acquisition Directorate, the  Coast Guard continued to pay millions of dollars to vendors over 2 years  after the project\u2019s cancelation to satisfy existing contractual obligations.  For example, according to staff within the Acquisition Directorate: $102,993 was paid in November 2017 to one vendor for leased  equipment that was damaged or missing, as part of closing out the  contract. $460,352 was paid in November 2017 to an equipment vendor  because the Coast Guard was obligated to do so after it had  exercised the contract option period just prior to canceling IHiS.", "Approximately $872, 000 was paid to various vendors by November  2017 as part of closing out other contractual obligations for items such  as software licensing and support and a data storage center.", "Approximately $2.4 million is to be paid to one vendor by February  2018 for software and licensing products.", "Approximately $2.8 million is to be paid by February 2018 for removal  and shipment of equipment.", "However, the amount spent on the project is likely underestimated  because the Coast Guard\u2019s analysis of spending did not include labor  costs for the agency\u2019s personnel (civilian or military) who spent  approximately 5 years managing, overseeing, and providing subject  matter expertise on the project.

In this regard, 34 of the  survey respondents reported that not all CHCS and PGUI records were  printed out and included in patients\u2019 paper health records as required  before the systems were retired; therefore, they had no way to ensure the  patients\u2019 paper records were complete. According to one respondent,  paper records are also often incomplete due to parts of the record being  dispersed across different medical facilities, thus, making it difficult to put  together a complete patient history and sometimes resulting in the need  to repeat testing and treatment of patients.", "Penmanship. Among the 91 (76 percent) survey respondents that  reported penmanship as challenging, several noted that it is difficult for  staff to read illegible handwritten medical notes. This, in turn, results in  difficulty determining the accurate diagnosis, the required prescription, or  a referral.", "Tracking medications. According to 89 (76 percent) of the respondents,  it is challenging to track medications without an EHR. For example, one  administrator stated that the lack of an EHR makes the management of  patient medication use difficult, as staff are unable to verify what  medications a patient is taking, what medications have been prescribed  from an outside location, and/or the effectiveness of medications. Another  administrator stated that staff members rely heavily on patients to  remember what medications they are taking\u2014potentially causing harm if  patients cannot remember what medications they are taking and the  medications have dangerous interactions.", "Amount of time to manage records. According to 86 (72 percent) of the  respondents, managing paper health records is challenging and requires  more time for staff to complete and file paperwork. Several respondents stated that the size of the paper health records has increased, resulting in  additional time required to review and file records.", "Ability to search within records. Eighty-three (70 percent) of the  respondents reported the ability of clinical staff to search within paper  health records for information as challenging. For example, one  respondent stated that providers must flip through individual pages of a  record to search for necessary information. Another respondent reported  that some patients have up to three volumes of a health record and it can  take up to 2 or 3 days to find requested information if the patient does not  recall when or where the medical care was performed. Figure 3 shows a  large paper health record and the multiple storage cabinets used to store  them, which illustrates the difficulty in manually searching for information  within the records.", "Missing records. Eighty-three (69 percent) of the survey respondents  stated that missing records are challenging. According to one  administrator, repeat evaluations that may not be required for chronically  ill patients are being conducted due to missing records. Another  administrator stated that information can often get misfiled in the record of  a patient with a similar name.", "Availability of records. Seventy-eight (65 percent) of the respondents  reported that the availability of records is challenging. For example, one  administrator reported that many records are located in different  locations, making it difficult to access the necessary information. Another  administrator stated that delays occur when clinic staff have to wait for  patients to bring records in for review or wait for updated notes from a  previous location.", "Amount of time for patient encounters. According to 65 (55 percent) of  the respondents, the lack of an EHR has resulted in an increase in the  amount of time required to check-in patients, complete patient  appointments, and enter information in the patient record.

Another administrator reported that the clinician stays after the clinic  closes to complete notes.", "Conducting consultations. Sixty-one (51 percent) of the respondents  reported conducting consultations with paper records as challenging.  Several administrators stated that patient information is faxed or scanned  and submitted for the consulting provider to review.

According to 59 (50 percent) of the respondents, the use  of paper records makes combining data to understand population health  trends challenging. According to one survey respondent, accomplishing  this without an EHR requires manually searching through every paper  health record.", "Ability to view and print laboratory reports. Fifty-six (47 percent) of the  survey respondents reported that the inability to view and print laboratory  reports without an EHR is challenging. One administrator stated that their  clinic could view and print the results from one particular laboratory, but if  a patient received services from any other lab the clinic staff would have  to request that the patient bring the laboratory results to the clinic.  Another administrator stated that it could take 2 or more days to receive  requested lab results because there was no way to easily obtain them via  a centralized system.", "Sending referrals. Forty-two (35 percent) of the respondents stated that  sending referrals is challenging. One administrator reported facing  challenges with faxed referral forms not being received after obtaining a  fax confirmation. Another respondent reported having to spend an  increased amount of time on the referral process with each referral  necessitating at least 20 minutes to complete the required forms and fax  them to the external provider\u2014with 10\u201325 referrals being sent each day.", "Cost of maintaining records. Thirty-nine (33 percent) of the  respondents reported that the cost of maintaining paper health records is  challenging. For example, one administrator reported that health records  are frequently mailed to other medical locations or to the National  Archives (for those separated or retired), which is a large expense for the  Coast Guard. Another administrator stated that the time taken to gather  paperwork, wait for civilian providers to send notes, and coordinate and  execute health record updates is costly to the Coast Guard. Lastly,  several administrators reported that expenditures for paper and printing  products have increased due to the lack of an EHR. For example, one  administrator reported that the clinic had increased its expenditure for  paper by 50 percent.", "Scheduling of appointments. Thirty-eight (32 percent) of the  respondents reported that the time it takes to schedule appointments is  challenging. One administrator stated that, due to the lack of a scheduling  system, patient appointments are being scheduled using the Outlook  calendar function, which is time consuming when there are network  slowdowns or freezes during high rates of utilization. Another  administrator reported that appointments are sometimes double  scheduled or occasionally disappear from the calendar and, in one  instance, a patient received an appointment reminder for an appointment  that the patient had never scheduled.", "Security/privacy of records. According to 34 (28 percent) of the  respondents, the security and privacy of health records is challenging.  One administrator reported that paper records are more prone to be  within reach of individuals that should not have access to them because  they are not stored in a secure EHR that has protections built in.", "Ordering x-rays. Thirty-one (26 percent) of the respondents reported that  the process for ordering x-rays is challenging. According to several  administrators, the current process for ordering x-rays involves submitting  a referral by fax, which takes additional time for processing and waiting  for results to be returned by fax. Several administrators reported that it is  difficult to know if all x-ray results have been received and filed.", "The responding clinic and sickbay administrators described a range of  alternative work-around processes that they have developed to help  alleviate several of the challenges. Specifically, they reported having  developed additional forms, tracking methods, and alternative processes,  as well as having notified Coast Guard HSWL management of the  challenges they face.", "Regarding developing forms, approximately 31 percent of the survey  respondents noted that they had developed additional forms in order to  more easily obtain the information that they would have had available to  them with an EHR in place. According to one administrator, these forms  are based on the most common patient encounter needs and capture  information such as medications, allergies, chronic issues, and family  history. In addition, these administrators reported developing electronic  file versions, such as a Microsoft Word document, of the standard health  forms so that they can e-mail them to patients and reduce the number of  paper forms that have to be completed by hand and scanned. According  to the administrators, these steps help address handwriting and space  challenges.", "In addition, approximately 37 percent of the respondents reported  developing tracking methods, such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and  logs, to collect data and assist in tracking patient and provider  information. One administrator reported that a spreadsheet was created  to track patients with conditions that require monitoring, since there is no  longer a system that has the data in one place. Another administrator  reported creating a spreadsheet to track referrals, numbers of physicals,  patient encounters, and medical readiness. Based on the survey  responses, these tracking methods have helped address the challenges  related to combining data to understand health trends, and tracking  medications and referrals.", "Further, 30 percent of the survey respondents noted that they have also  developed alternative processes to mitigate some of the challenges with  managing paper health records. For example, one administrator stated  that the clinic started conducting weekly reconciliations of referrals to  ensure that all treatment records from outside referrals were obtained by  the clinic and placed in the paper health record. Another administrator  stated that the clinic had begun e-mailing patient encounter notes to the  medical officer for review in an effort to ensure patient records are  complete.", "Finally, approximately 55 percent of the respondents reported that they  have notified HSWL senior management of the challenges encountered  with managing and maintaining paper records. According to an official  within the Acquisitions Directorate, the Coast Guard plans to mitigate  many of the challenges identified by the Regional Managers with a new  EHR system initiative.

The process, as described in the Coast Guard\u2019s SDLC Practice  Manual, consists of seven phases and related practices\u201430 of which we  selected for evaluation for the initial four SDLC phases of Integrated  Health Information System (IHiS). The following is a summary of each  SDLC phase and a description of the project management practices we  selected for review:  Phase 1: Conceptual Planning  This phase is the first step of the development or significant enhancement  process. During this phase, high-level business needs are identified, a  concept for fulfilling the business needs is proposed and validated, and  resources are committed. Activities (or practices) we selected for review  in this phase include formalizing SDLC role designations, such as the  project manager, asset manager, and sponsor; developing the initial  business case with information regarding the background, system  justification, and project risk management, among other things; validating  alignment with the enterprise architecture; identifying the funding source  and providing a rough order of magnitude cost estimates as part of  developing the acquisition strategy; designating the system as a  Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information  Technology (C4&IT) system; and obtaining approval to exit the  conceptual planning phase.", "Phase 2: Planning and Requirements  This phase begins after the project has been defined and appropriate  resources have been committed. During this phase, business  requirements are collected, defined, and validated. More specifically, as  part of the phase practices we selected for review, the SDLC tailoring  plan is completed; and initial life cycle management plans for project  management, risk management, integrated logistics support, training,  and information assurance are developed. In addition, a cost benefit  analysis is conducted; functional requirements are documented; external  mandates are reviewed; the system development agent and system  support agent are designated; and approval to exit the planning and  requirements phase is obtained.", "During this phase, business requirements are translated into system  requirements to develop the detailed system design. Selected practices  for this phase include developing the detailed system design to specify  the operating system, architecture components, timing and sizing, and  interfaces, among other things; developing the operational analysis plan  to document system performance measures, system operating measures  that address reliability, maintainability, availability, training, and user satisfaction; and system support measures containing the level of effort  needed to support the system; conducting review sessions with the user  community to ensure that the system design sufficiently met all functional  requirements; developing contingency and disaster recovery plans;  completing the privacy impact analysis; documenting the test and  evaluation master plan with the scope, content, methodology, sequence,  management of, and responsibilities for test activities; testing the system  design according to the operational test and evaluation plan and  capturing design test results in the test and evaluation master plan; and  obtaining approval to exit the design phase.", "Phase 4: Development and Testing  The system is developed or acquired based on detailed system design  specifications and validated through a variety of tests during this phase.  The objective is to ensure that the system functions as expected and that  sponsor and user requirements are satisfied. More specifically, as part of  the phase practices that we selected, system testing is conducted;  system documentation, such as system manuals, user manuals, and  diagrams of the system is developed; an implementation plan is  developed; and an authority to operate is obtained.", "During this phase, the system is placed in the production environment  and system users are trained. It also includes efforts required to  implement the system and resolve problems identified during the  system\u2019s transition from development to deployment. We did not select  practices to evaluate in this phase since the system was discontinued  before implementation.", "Phase 6: Operations and Maintenance  The system becomes operational during this phase, and its main purpose  is to ensure that the system continues to perform according to  specifications. In addition, routine hardware and software maintenance  and upgrades are performed to ensure effective system operations; user  training continues as needed; and additional user support is provided to  help resolve reported problems. We did not select practices to evaluate in  this phase since the system was discontinued before implementation.", "This phase represents the end of the system\u2019s life cycle. It provides for  the systematic termination of a system to ensure that vital information is  archived. The emphasis of this phase is to ensure that the system (e.g.,  equipment, software, data, procedures, and documentation) is packaged  and disposed of in accordance with appropriate regulations and  requirements. We did not select practices to evaluate in this phase since  the system was discontinued before implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Copy of the Survey That GAO Administered to Coast Guard Health Safety and Work-Life Regional Managers", "paragraphs": ["The questions we asked in our survey of the 12 Health Safety and Work- Life (HSWL) Regional Managers from March 2017 to April 2017 are  shown below.
