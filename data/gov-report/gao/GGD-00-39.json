Border Patrol agents perform their duties near and along about 8,000 miles of United States boundaries by land, sea, and air. The Border Patrol is divided into 21 sectors, 9 of which are along the southwest border. Sectors are further subdivided into stations.", "To stem the growing flow of illegal entry into the country, the Attorney General announced in 1994 a five-part strategy that included strengthening border enforcement. To support this strategy, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, among other things, required that the Attorney General increase the onboard strength of Border Patrol agents by not less than 1,000 each year for fiscal years 1997 through 2001. Deployment of new agents to particular sectors along the southwest border has generally corresponded with INS\u2019 implementation of its border strategy. However, because the strategy was designed to allow for flexibility in responding to unexpected changes in the flow of illegal immigration, some sectors have received additional agents before the strategy was implemented in their sectors. With increased hiring, the Border Patrol has experienced dramatic growth in recent years. From the end of fiscal year 1994 to the end of fiscal year 1999, the size of the Border Patrol nearly doubled\u2014from 4,226 to 8,351.", "INS uses a variety of approaches to attract applicants to the Border Patrol, including advertising in magazines and newspapers, on the Internet, in movie theaters, and on billboards; targeting key colleges and universities with degree programs in law enforcement, criminal justice, and police science; attending recruitment events; and visiting military bases to recruit departing military personnel. Although INS has recruited in different parts of the country, it is now focusing its efforts on locations near the southwest border.", "Those applying to be Border Patrol agents must initially complete a self- screening questionnaire for basic eligibility (i.e., age, education, and citizenship), after which they must successfully complete a multistep hiring process. This process is comprised of a written examination, which includes a Spanish test or an artificial language test designed to measure an applicant\u2019s ability to learn a foreign language (e.g., Spanish); a structured interview with a panel of Border Patrol agents; a medical examination; a drug screening; and a full background investigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine if INS is on track in meeting its hiring goals, we analyzed hiring and attrition data from INS\u2019 Budget Office.

To analyze experience, we used data on Border Patrol agents\u2019 years of service with INS because INS does not maintain data on agents\u2019 length of service with the Border Patrol. However, agency officials told us that most Border Patrol agents begin their INS careers with the Border Patrol, and it is unusual for other INS personnel to transfer into the Border Patrol. To provide information on supervision, we analyzed changes in the ratio of nonsupervisory agents (GS-5 through GS-11) to first-line supervisory agents (GS-12).

This resulted in a net shortfall of 594 agents for the 3-year period ending September 30, 1999. Because of attrition, INS would have had to hire 1,757 agents in fiscal year 1999 to meet that year\u2019s hiring goal.", "As shown in table 1, to account for attrition, INS has had to hire far more than 1,000 agents in each year to meet its hiring goal. During fiscal year 1997, the first year of its goal to increase the Border Patrol\u2019s onboard strength by 1,000 agents, INS actually hired 1,726 agents, which resulted in a net increase of 1,002 agents. In fiscal year 1998, it hired 1,919 agents for a net increase of 1,035. In fiscal year 1999, INS hired 1,126 agents, but because 757 agents left the Border Patrol during the year, the size of the Border Patrol only increased by 369 agents. The Border Patrol\u2019s 9-percent attrition rate for fiscal year 1999 was actually lower than the 13 percent INS originally anticipated. According to an INS official, during fiscal year 1999, some Border Patrol agents applied for, and were accepted to, other INS positions. However, in August 1999, an INS official told us that due to funding difficulties, INS would not be transferring these agents until fiscal year 2000.

As shown in table 1, the annual attrition rate for Border Patrol agents was 5 percent in fiscal year 1994, but by 1998, the rate had risen to 13 percent. Although INS maintains data on categories of attrition, such as retirement and termination, it has limited information on why agents leave the Border Patrol. However, its data do show that in fiscal years 1994 through 1998, almost half of the agents who left the Border Patrol left within their first 10 months of service.

In the first 2 fiscal years of the program, INS met its hiring goal. However, by November 1998, INS foresaw difficulties in meeting its fiscal year 1999 goal and was projecting a hiring shortfall.

Officials believe that the country\u2019s strong economy and job market have contributed significantly to the agency\u2019s hiring troubles. INS officials estimate that, historically, INS has hired about 4 percent of eligible applicants, but it hired only an estimated 2 percent in fiscal year 1999.

For example, the Los Angeles Police Department typically hires about 5 percent of its applicants, the Texas Department of Public Safety about 3 percent of its State Trooper applicants, and the U.S. Coast Guard about 1 percent of its applicants, according to officials of these organizations. The U.S. Customs Service only hired 1 percent of its applicants for inspector positions in fiscal year 1999, although 2 percent of the applicants who applied were qualified to be hired.", "A small percentage of Border Patrol applicants were hired because most failed the written or physical examination, the interview, or the background investigation, or they voluntarily dropped out of the hiring process. However, INS knows little about why some applicants chose to withdraw from the process.", "The size of the Border Patrol\u2019s applicant pool declines with each stage of the hiring process, but losses are particularly heavy in its early stages. However, in fiscal year 1999, applicant losses were higher throughout the entire process. INS officials estimated that in fiscal year 1996, about half of those who were scheduled to take the written examination actually showed up for the test, and in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, about 60 percent of those scheduled did not report for testing. In contrast, INS estimated about 75 percent of applicants who were scheduled did not report for the written examination in fiscal year 1999. According to an OPM official, a 50- percent no-show rate for initial written testing has been considered typical among government agencies. INS officials do not know why INS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 no-show rate increased.", "Furthermore, many Border Patrol applicants failed a step of the hiring process in recent years, and this was also true in fiscal year 1999. INS estimated about 72 percent of those who took the written test in fiscal year 1999 failed it, and according to an INS official, failure rates were even higher in the last quarter of the year.", "In addition, a greater percentage of applicants failed the background investigation in fiscal year 1999. INS estimated that about 15 percent failed the investigation in fiscal year 1998. However, it estimated about 40 percent of applicants failed it in fiscal year 1999. According to an INS official, the more stringent security requirements instituted in May 1998 have increased the background investigation failure rate. INS instituted the tighter requirements to address security concerns.", "INS officials cite other aspects of the hiring process that may have also contributed to INS\u2019 hiring difficulties. However, their identification of these contributing factors is largely based on anecdotal information from their program staff, and not on any systematic data collection effort. Officials believe that the length of the standard hiring process\u2014-typically 6 months to 1 year\u2014may be a factor in the agency\u2019s inability to hire a greater percentage of Border Patrol applicants. Although most of the other law enforcement agencies we contacted had hiring processes that fell within the range of 5 months to 1 year, recent recruiting literature point out that recruiters are shortening their hiring processes to avoid losing qualified applicants. Other aspects of the hiring process that INS officials believe may have contributed to hiring problems include the out-of-pocket costs applicants incur during the hiring process and in reporting for duty, and a lack of flexibility regarding location and start dates for newly hired agents.

According to INS officials, about 30 percent of the nonsupervisory agents are at the GS-11 level. INS officials believe the current classification standard could support an across-the-board increase to the GS-11 level, but recognize that sufficient GS-11 work must exist and be organized and assigned in a manner that would support the GS-11 level. These changes are being considered as part of a broader effort to bring parity to all INS law enforcement positions, as well as achieve parity with law enforcement positions in other federal agencies.

In addition, to better understand why so many applicants who sign up for the written examination never report for testing, INS plans to conduct telephone surveys of those applicants as part of its hiring initiatives. INS also plans to survey applicants who took the written examination to obtain feedback on the initial steps of its application process. Since April 1999, INS has been asking applicants their reasons for declining offers to join the Border Patrol. However, INS does not have plans to collect data on why it is losing applicants at other stages later in the hiring process. Losing applicants at the later stages is costly to INS because it has already committed Border Patrol agents\u2019 time to conduct interviews, and it has spent about $500 on each medical examination and drug screening, and another $3,000 on each background investigation.

New agents may be assigned to work with GS-9 or GS-11 Field Training Officers who have received special training, or with other nonsupervisory agents. However, even though these agents provide guidance to new agents, they are not officially classified as supervisors. Furthermore, according to Border Patrol officials, new agents may be assigned to work with other nonsupervisory agents who are not Field Training Officers. Because of a lack of data regarding agents who are assigned to work with new agents, and because sectors differ in how they assign new agents, we were unable to measure the level of experience of agents who work with new agents or analyze changes over time.", "See appendix III for additional analyses comparing grade level and years of service of all Border Patrol agents and those assigned to southwest border sectors, for fiscal years 1994 and 1998.
