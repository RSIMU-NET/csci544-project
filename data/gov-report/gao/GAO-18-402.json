According to the Department of Energy (DOE), the  electric utility industry, regulators, and other stakeholders are working to  understand the role of energy storage in grid operations and how to  integrate it into the grid. Simultaneously, utilities in the United States are  investing in an aging grid with a growing segment in need of replacement  and modernization. One trend across the electric sector is a reduced  reliance on large, central power plants and greater use of more diverse  resource portfolios. The increasing use of variable energy resources such  as wind and solar power, the interaction of distributed energy resources\u2014 including energy storage\u2014with traditional generation sources, and the  changing role of electricity customers have increased the complexity of  matching electricity supply with demand at all times.", "Batteries and other energy storage technologies can store energy in one  form\u2014such as chemical, mechanical, or thermal energy\u2014and transform  the energy to generate electrical power.

Historically, electricity  storage has consisted of pumped hydroelectric storage projects, which  pump water to higher-elevation reservoirs when electricity demand is low  and allow it to flow downhill through electricity-generating turbines when  demand increases. Other energy storage technologies include electrochemical technologies such as batteries (lead acid, lithium ion,  sodium sulfur, and flow); electromechanical technologies such as flywheels (mechanical  devices that harness rotational energy to store and deliver energy)  and compressed air energy storage (that uses electricity to compress  air, then release it through a turbine to generate electricity later); and other forms of storage such as thermal storage.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates  interstate electricity transmission and oversees wholesale interstate  electricity markets, plays a role in addressing barriers to competition in  electricity markets as part of its statutory duty to ensure that market rates  are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

The studies we reviewed were published from  2012 through 2017, the five most recent years for which studies were  available, and we identified them by conducting database and Internet  searches and asking stakeholder groups for recommendations.  Specifically, we searched sources including ProQuest and WorldCat,  among others, and the websites of national laboratories. We selected  studies to review based on their relevance to energy storage, its role in  grid operations, and factors affecting deployment of storage for grid  operations. We selected 29 studies from the Congressional Research  Service (CRS); DOE; national laboratories; government-sponsored  research; non-governmental organizations such as nonprofits and  research institutes; industry associations; and peer-reviewed scientific  and trade journals. We reviewed the methodologies of these studies and  determined that they were sufficiently sound for describing the ways  energy storage can be used to enhance grid operations and factors  affecting deployment. We also reviewed other documents including FERC  proposed and final rules, guidance, and conference and meeting  transcripts; reports from state agencies, DOE, and national laboratories;  and industry papers and reports on topics relevant to our work. We  identified the ways energy storage can be used to enhance grid  operations and the factors affecting deployment often cited by  stakeholders, studies, and documents. Given our methodology, we may  not have identified every relevant study and every potential use of storage  and factor that affects deployment of storage, therefore our findings may  not be generalizable to all energy storage technologies but provide  examples of such technologies.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed and described documentation  of energy storage efforts at DOE and relevant FERC orders and proposed  and final rules addressing the deployment of storage. In addition, we  reviewed documentation of Internal Revenue Service efforts to solicit  comments on regulations that affect how a tax credit can be used for  storage projects. We identified state policies and efforts addressing  storage deployment by reviewing documents from federal and state  agencies, stakeholder groups, relevant databases, and industry news  sources and asking stakeholders. To describe these state policies and  efforts, we reviewed state government documents, reports, policies, and  legislation. Given our methodology, we identified examples that illustrate  the range of state policies and other efforts that may encourage the  deployment of energy storage or that address market barriers; however,  these examples do not represent a comprehensive list of all state policies  and efforts.", "For all of the objectives, we conducted interviews with officials and  representatives of 41 stakeholder groups including federal and state  government agencies, industry, and other stakeholders. Specifically, we  interviewed officials and representatives from 4 federal agencies (DOE,  FERC, CRS, and the Internal Revenue Service); 3 national laboratories  (the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Pacific Northwest  National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories); 8 state government  agencies; 11 grid operators and utilities; 7 industry associations; 2  nongovernmental organizations; and 6 other market participants,  including storage project developers and consultants.

Because this was a  nonprobability sample of stakeholders, views are not generalizable to all  potential stakeholders. For interviews with state entities, we selected a  nonprobability sample of four states that have policies encouraging  storage deployment, which stakeholders identified as leading in the  development and establishment of such policies, and that vary based on  geographic location because factors affecting deployment tend to vary in  different parts of the country. We also considered information on the  extent of energy storage deployed in the state.

Electricity is generated at power plants by burning fossil fuels; through  nuclear fission; or by harnessing renewable sources such as wind, solar,  geothermal, or hydropower. Once electricity is generated, it is sent  through the electricity grid, which consists of high-voltage, high-capacity  transmission systems, to areas where it is transformed to a lower voltage  and sent through the local distribution system for use by residential and  other customers. Throughout this process, a grid operator, such as a local  utility, must constantly balance the generation and consumption of  electricity. To do so, grid operators monitor electricity consumption from a  centralized location using information systems, and send minute-by- minute signals to power plants to adjust their output to match changes in  the demand for electricity.", "As we previously reported, continuously balancing the generation and  consumption of electricity can be challenging for grid operators because  customers may use sharply different amounts of electricity over the  course of a day and throughout the year. For example, in many areas,  customer demand for electricity rises throughout the day and reaches its  highest point\u2014or peak demand\u2014in late afternoon or early evening.  Throughout the day, grid operators direct power plants to adjust their  output to match changes in demand for electricity. Grid operators typically  first use electricity produced by baseload power plants that are the least  expensive to operate, then progressively increase the supply of electricity  generated by power plants that are more expensive to operate as needed  to match increases in electricity demand. As a result, providing electricity  to meet peak demand is generally more expensive than during other parts  of the day, because to do so, grid operators use power plants that are  more expensive to operate. Peak periods are generally short and account  for only a few hours per day and, overall, a small percentage of the hours  during a year, but can significantly contribute to the overall costs of  serving customers.", "Grid operators conduct planning to assess the adequacy of existing grid  infrastructure, identify capacity needs, and evaluate the cost and  effectiveness of potential solutions to address these needs. As we  previously reported, to ensure that grid infrastructure has sufficient  capacity to meet future peak demand, grid operators typically develop  forecasts of future electricity demand based on historical information  about customer electricity use combined with assumptions about how  customer demand will change in the future based on population growth,  economic conditions, and other factors.", "Utilities deal with uncertainty partly by producing a range of forecasts  based on demographic and economic factors, and by maintaining excess  generating capacity, known as reserves. Models help utilities choose the  least-cost combination of generating resources to meet demand. If  demand forecasts are too high or low, a utility could end up with more or  less generating capacity than it needs to serve its customers reliably, or it  could end up with a mix of generating capacity that is not cost effective.  These outcomes can affect electricity rates as well as the utility\u2019s financial  situation. To meet demand for electricity, utilities can construct new  plants, upgrade existing plants, purchase power from others, build new  transmission and distribution lines, and provide incentives to customers to  reduce and shift their demand for electricity through energy efficiency or  demand-response programs. In addition, utilities may use time-based  pricing\u2014prices that vary throughout the day and year to reflect the costs  of serving consumers\u2014to encourage consumers to lower their electricity  use at times of high prices or shift their use to times of the day when  prices are lower, which can lower their electricity bills."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Storage Operational Characteristics, Technologies, and Deployment", "paragraphs": ["Energy storage includes a number of different technologies that have the  ability to store energy for use at a later time.

Specifically, compressed  air and pumped hydro are capable of discharge times\u2014the length of time  that a storage device can discharge electricity\u2014in tens of hours and have  large capacities that can reach 1,000 megawatts (MW). According to  DOE and CRS, storage projects involving these types of technologies  generally have unique siting requirements, including specific geographical  features, or long construction times. In contrast, other storage  technologies such as batteries and flywheels are smaller in terms of  capacity and have shorter discharge times, ranging from a few seconds to  several hours, and these technologies can generally be built without  specific geographical features at the site.

As the primary regulator of electricity on the retail level,  state public utility commissions have a variety of responsibilities, such as  approving utility investments in generation and distribution assets, the  rates retail customers pay, and how those rates are set. Before  electricity is sold to retail customers, it may be bought, sold, and traded in  wholesale electricity markets that the federal government oversees  through FERC.

For  example, storage can help grid operators address supply disruptions,  relieve transmission congestion during periods of high demand, defer the  need for transmission or distribution system upgrades, and provide  backup power during a power outage. Figure 6 illustrates examples of  potential applications across the electricity grid.", "Energy storage can support the reliability of grid operations by helping  grid operators respond to fluctuations in electricity supply resulting from  the variability of renewable energy resources, such as solar or wind, or  disruptions to the grid, such as the loss of a transmission line or a  generating unit. Specifically, according to some studies we reviewed, the  fast-ramping nature of some storage technologies that can change  generation output quickly\u2014within a few seconds or minutes\u2014makes  them suitable for addressing short-term changes in variable energy  generation resources (referred to as variable resources) such as when  the sun sets and output from solar resources quickly declines. Moreover,  storage can provide ancillary services needed to maintain system  reliability and support the transmission of electricity. Specifically,  according to some studies we reviewed, storage can provide frequency  regulation services\u2014which entail moment-to-moment reconciliation of the  difference between supply and demand\u2014to maintain the stability of the  system. The services that storage provides can be performed by  traditional assets but because certain storage technologies are fast- ramping they can be better-suited to provide certain services, according  to several studies we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed.", "Systems with a large portion of generating capacity from variable  resources can face reliability challenges because the intermittent nature  of these sources can cause fluctuations in voltage and frequency,  according to some studies we reviewed. Grid operators are adopting  storage to support increasing use of renewable energy and address the  associated challenges. For example, in 2017, San Diego Gas & Electric  deployed a 30 MW energy storage facility at its Escondido substation to  help improve regional reliability and support greater amounts of  renewable energy in the region\u2019s energy supply (see fig. 7). According  to San Diego Gas & Electric, the Escondido storage facility is helping to  enhance grid reliability and increase the use of renewable energy; the  facility is capable of the equivalent of serving 20,000 customers over a  period of 4 hours.", "Similarly, in 2017, according to Tucson Electric Power documents, the  utility installed two 10 MW battery storage projects to support its ability to  achieve long-term renewable energy goals without compromising the  reliability of service. According to representatives from the utility, the  projects provide frequency control and voltage support and the  deployment shortened the reaction time to system disruptions and  supported the utility\u2019s compliance with reliability standards in its role as  balancing authority.", "Storage can also provide services that support resilience by helping the  grid adapt to changing conditions and potentially disruptive events and, if  a disruptive event occurs, to rapidly recover, according to several studies  we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed. Specifically, in the event  of an outage during which power sources or power lines become  unavailable, storage can respond quickly to provide backup power or  black start services\u2014the provision of the power necessary to restore a  generation plant when power from the grid is unavailable during a major  outage. In addition, storage can also support microgrids\u2014systems that  can connect and disconnect from the grid depending on operating  conditions\u2014that could maintain power for a small area independent of the  grid. For example, in 2015 a Vermont utility installed a 4 MW energy  storage system in conjunction with a 2.5 MW solar project at a school that  serves as an emergency shelter. In case of grid failure or an extended  emergency, the facility can separate from the rest of the grid and operate  independently. In addition, in 2016 in Massachusetts, the Sterling  Municipal Light Department installed a storage system that can isolate  from the main grid in the event of a power outage and provide emergency  backup power to the Sterling police station and dispatch center, a facility  providing first responder services. In the event of an outage, the 2 MW  storage system could provide the police station with up to 12 days of  power, according to the utility.", "Storage also has the potential to improve efficiency of grid operations and  help reduce operating costs, according to studies we reviewed and  stakeholders we spoke with. For example, storage has the potential to  reduce costs by capturing energy generated during low-cost periods to be  used to meet demand later during more expensive periods, according to  studies we reviewed. Specifically, energy time-shift, also referred to as  arbitrage, involves utilities purchasing inexpensive electric energy,  available during periods when prices or system marginal costs are low, to  charge the storage system so that the stored energy can be used or sold  at a later time when the price or costs are high. In addition, storage can  help make the capacity of variable resources more consistent by storing  electricity during periods of high generation, such as a sunny afternoon,  and releasing it later during periods of high demand, such as the early  evening. Moreover, storage can provide similar energy time-shift by  storing excess energy production from renewable sources, which could  otherwise be curtailed.", "Storage also has the potential to reduce costs by avoiding or delaying  investments in infrastructure. Specifically, storage may be used to reduce  the capacity demands on existing generation, transmission, and  distribution infrastructure. As a result, according to many studies and  stakeholders we interviewed, utilities may be able to avoid or delay  investments in generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure  that would otherwise be necessary to maintain adequate supply. For  example, in 2017, a utility that serves customers in Massachusetts  announced plans to install a 6 MW energy storage system with an 8-hour  duration alongside a new diesel generator on Nantucket Island to provide  backup power and postpone the need to construct a costly submarine  transmission cable to bring electricity from the mainland to meet  anticipated growth in electricity demand. In some cases, an investment in  a storage system could be a more cost-effective way to manage peak  demand, and in such cases, utilities could reduce the need for operation  of peaking resources or investment in new peaking resources, such as a  natural gas plant.", "Additionally, according to many studies we reviewed and stakeholders we  interviewed, storage can help customers reduce demand charges.  Demand charges are fees included on electricity bills in many parts of the  country to cover the cost of ensuring that sufficient generation and  transmission resources are available to serve customers during periods of  peak demand. Energy storage provides an opportunity for potential  savings by helping a customer to manage their peak demand. Using  storage can also allow some utilities to avoid charges that they might  incur when purchasing wholesale electricity to serve their customers  during a system\u2019s peak demand; this could allow them to pass savings on  to their customers in the form of lower rates. For example, although the  Sterling, Massachusetts, Municipal Light Department installed its storage  system to provide emergency backup power, the primary benefits of the  project since its installation have resulted from using it to reduce peak  demand which has reduced the utility\u2019s transmission charges, and, in  turn, has allowed it to reduce rates paid by its customers, according to  utility representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Affect the Deployment of Storage for Grid Operations, Including Industry and Technology Readiness, Cost- Competitiveness, and the Regulatory Environment", "paragraphs": ["Studies we reviewed and stakeholders we interviewed identified a variety  of factors that affect energy storage deployment.

The models that grid operators typically  use to help make decisions about investments in generation, transmission  and distribution infrastructure are based on traditional resources with  better-understood capabilities. Moreover, storage can be more  challenging to integrate than other resources, such as solar, because it  changes its function in the system from charging\u2014consuming electricity\u2014 to discharging\u2014generating electricity, according to some stakeholders.", "Because storage must provide power when called upon but also must be  recharged from another resource at a later time, tools that planners rely  on must keep an accurate accounting of the amount of energy stored and  available to supply power to meet demand. According to one stakeholder,  installation of storage requires grid operators to develop operating  requirements and identify control and mitigation strategies for proper  coordination with larger grid operations. In addition, existing utility  systems may not be designed to incorporate storage and may require  customization to integrate storage, according to several stakeholders.", "Industry and technical challenges affecting deployment of storage include  uncertainty about the performance of certain storage technologies over  time and in various operating conditions. Energy storage systems  generally are expected to last for a decade or more, but the actual  degradation of battery storage under various conditions is still largely  unknown, according to some studies we reviewed and stakeholders we  spoke with.

According to the Energy  Information Administration, utility-scale solar installations grew at an  average rate of 72 percent per year between 2010 and 2016, faster than  any other generating technologies. Moreover, increasing use of these  resources is expected to continue, which could drive the adoption of  storage deployment in the future, according to some studies we reviewed  and stakeholders we spoke with.

While the cost of some technologies has fallen in  recent years, the cost of storage systems\u2014including all the system  components, installation, and integration costs\u2014is still high when  compared to more traditional resources available to electric utilities,  according to many studies we reviewed and stakeholders we spoke with.  On the other hand, the adoption of storage for certain purposes, such as  supporting increased use of renewable resources or providing backup  power, includes potential benefits such as reducing greenhouse gas and  other harmful emissions, or enhancing the resilience of the grid.", "While the cost of lithium-ion batteries has declined in recent years, the  storage device is one component of a storage system, and estimates of  the device\u2019s share of the total cost of an energy storage system range  from about 25 percent to 50 percent of the total costs, according to  studies we reviewed. According to some stakeholders, the cost of the  system components and other costs to integrate storage with the grid can  be substantial and are not declining as quickly as the cost of storage  devices. In addition to the cost of the storage device, other system  component costs include power conversion electronics, software, and  monitoring and control systems, among others, that are essential to  maintain the health and safety of the entire system, according to some  studies.", "Moreover, valuing investments in energy storage must consider both the  cost and benefits, but assessing the potential benefits and costs of  storage can prove challenging, according to several studies we reviewed  and stakeholders we spoke with. These challenges identified in these  studies and by these stakeholders include the following:", "Quantifying benefits. Benefits can be difficult to quantify, as they  depend on the application, location, and ability to capture multiple  benefits. Specifically, the compensation for services that storage can  provide reflects local market conditions, and these vary across  regions. In addition, the value of certain storage applications can be  harder to quantify than for others. For example, if a utility is  considering deployment of storage in order to defer an investment in a  transmission and distribution infrastructure upgrade, then determining  the value of the storage asset involves analyzing the avoided cost of  that investment, which is quantifiable. However, it is more difficult to  quantify the value of less tangible benefits of storage, such as  improvements to operational flexibility and grid resilience, which are  not monetized and therefore are difficult to quantify.", "Life expectancy. For certain storage technologies, much is still  unknown about their useful life, which depends on the number of  charge and discharge cycles, among other things. Reliable estimates  of the expected life of an asset are necessary for accurately  estimating lifecycle costs and benefits. Given the fact that battery  technologies are evolving, the lack of data makes it more challenging  for utilities to estimate expected costs and benefits to justify their  investment expense.", "Limited information on cost. Sufficient information on the cost of  storage systems is not readily available, limiting utilities\u2019 ability to  include storage in modeling and investment decisions, according to  some stakeholders. Energy storage price and cost data vary among  sources because of aggregation to protect proprietary interests, which  unit is chosen to present price and cost data, and limited information  about how projects operate. Specifically, information on the  operational conditions, specifications, and performance of energy  storage systems is difficult to obtain. In addition, according to some  studies we reviewed, uncertainty exists about the future cost outlook  and pace of technological maturity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Environment", "paragraphs": ["The regulatory environment can pose barriers to the deployment of  energy storage.

Moreover, when market  rules do not clearly define what type of asset they consider storage to be,  this can make it difficult to determine whether storage can participate in  the market or to receive compensation, making storage in that market  financially unviable, according to some studies and stakeholders. One  RTO, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), has established  participation models to accommodate resources, such as storage, that  are operationally unique.

DOE also supported the development of documentation and tools to  assist utilities in the design, deployment, and operation of energy  storage systems including valuation models, procurement guidelines,  commissioning procedures, and data acquisition guidelines. In  addition, Sandia published guidance to provide information for  municipalities on the elements that should be included in a solicitation  for procurement and installation of an energy storage project and a  handbook to provide information and tools to guide investors\u2019  evaluations of energy storage opportunities. DOE has a proposal  under way for a study to gather pricing information for energy storage  technologies that will be used as part of future updates to the  handbook. DOE also held a financial summit in June 2017 to provide  information to the financial community on solicitations and contracts.  In addition, to evaluate storage projects, DOE and the Washington  Department of Commerce established a memorandum of  understanding to have PNNL characterize and analyze the technical  and economic attributes of storage projects.
