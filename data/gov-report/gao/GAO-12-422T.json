For example, in 2009, CBP implemented the Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier Requirements to collect additional information for targeting. The additional cargo information required, such as country of origin, is to be provided to CBP in advance of arrival of the cargo containers at U.S. ports. In September 2010, GAO recommended that CBP establish milestones and time frames for updating its targeting criteria to include additional information. In response, CBP updated its targeting criteria in January 2011.", "DHS has made some progress in developing and implementing container security technologies to protect the integrity of containers and to scan them. GAO reported in September 2010 that DHS\u0092s Science and Technology Directorate initiated four container security technology projects to detect and report intrusions into cargo containers. However, operational testing had not occurred to ensure the prototypes would function as intended. Therefore, GAO recommended that testing and evaluation occur in all environments in which DHS planned to implement the technologies. DHS concurred and has made progress implementing this recommendation. To prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials, CBP, in coordination with the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), has deployed over 1,400 radiation portal monitors (RPM) at U.S. ports of entry to detect the presence of radiation in cargo containers. Since 2006, GAO reported on problems with DNDO\u0092s efforts to deploy a more-advanced and significantly more-expensive type of RPM. Among other things, GAO reported that an updated cost-benefit analysis might show that DNDO\u0092s program to replace existing equipment with the advanced technology was not justified. After spending more than $200 million, DHS ended the program in July 2011.", "Uncertainty persists over how DHS and CBP will fulfill the mandate for 100 percent scanning given that the feasibility remains unproven in light of the challenges CBP has faced implementing a pilot program for 100 percent scanning. In response to the SAFE Port Act requirement to implement a pilot program to determine the feasibility of 100 percent scanning, CBP, the Department of State, and the Department of Energy announced the formation of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) pilot program in December 2006. However, logistical, technological, and other challenges prevented the participating ports from achieving 100 percent scanning and CBP has since reduced the scope of the SFI program from six ports to one. In October 2009, GAO recommended that CBP perform an assessment to determine if 100 percent scanning is feasible, and if it is, the best way to achieve it, or if it is not feasible, present acceptable alternatives. However, to date, CBP has not conducted such an assessment or identified alternatives to 100 percent scanning. Further, as GAO previously reported, DHS acknowledged it will not be able to meet the 9/11 Act\u0092s July 2012 deadline for implementing the 100 percent scanning requirement, and therefore, it expects to grant a blanket extension to all foreign ports pursuant to the statute, thus extending the target date to July 2014.

The potential for terrorists to smuggle  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) inside cargo containers bound for  the United States has remained a concern since the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001. Cargo containers are an important segment of the  global supply chain\u2014the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers. In  2011, about 10.7 million oceanborne cargo containers arrived at U.S.  ports, and according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the  majority of U.S. imports arrive by ocean vessel. The typical supply chain  process for transporting cargo containers to the United States involves  many steps and participants. For example, the cargo containers, and the  goods in them, can be compromised not only by the manufacturers or  suppliers of the goods being shipped, but also by vessel carriers who are  responsible for transporting the containers from foreign ports to U.S.  ports, as well as by personnel who load and unload cargo containers onto  and off vessels.", "Given the complexity of the global supply chain process and the vast  number of cargo containers that are shipped to the United States each  year, the global supply chain is vulnerable to threats that terrorists and  criminals might be able to exploit. As we reported in October 2009, while  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has noted that the likelihood  of terrorists smuggling WMD into the United States in cargo containers is  low, the nation\u2019s vulnerability to this activity and the consequences of  such an attack\u2014such as billions of losses in U.S revenue and halts in  manufacturing production\u2014are potentially high.", "November of 2012 will mark the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the  Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002, which, among  other things, called for the establishment of a program to evaluate and  certify secure systems of international intermodal transportation, including  standards and procedures for screening and evaluating cargo prior to  loading and for securing and monitoring cargo while in transit. In 2006,  the Security and Accountability For Every (SAFE) Port Act, which  amended MTSA, required DHS to develop, implement, and update as  appropriate a strategic plan to enhance the security of the international  supply chain. To address concerns regarding international supply chain  security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component of  DHS, developed a layered security strategy for cargo containers. Core  components of the layered security strategy include analyzing information  to identify containers that may be at high risk of transporting WMD or  other contraband, working with governments of other nations to examine  containers CBP has determined to be high risk before such containers  are loaded onto U.S.-bound vessels at foreign ports, and providing  benefits to companies that comply with predetermined security measures.", "6 U.S.C. \u00a7 981.

Specifically, CBP\u2019s 24-hour rule  requires that vessel carriers submit cargo manifest information to CBP 24  hours before U.S.-bound cargo is loaded onto a vessel. To further  enhance CBP\u2019s ability to target high-risk shipments, in 2006 the SAFE  Port Act required CBP to collect additional data related to the movement  of cargo to identify high-risk cargo for inspection, and in 2009 CBP  implemented the Importer Security Filing and Additional Carrier  Requirements, collectively known as the 10+2 rule. The cargo  information required by the 10+2 rule comprises 10 data elements from  importers, such as country of origin, and 2 data elements from vessel  carriers, such as the position of each container transported on a vessel,  all of which are to be provided to CBP in advance of arrival at a U.S. port.", "Some of the data are required to be submitted prior to loading the  container onto a U.S.-bound vessel. Additionally, the United States has  worked to expand the program beyond domestic implementation by  coordinating with the World Customs Organization (WCO) to  incorporate some of the 10+2 data elements into the international supply  chain security standards, which are discussed later in this statement.

Specifically, within ATS, CBP uses various  data elements to determine an overall risk score for a particular threat in a  shipment. CBP officers use these scores to help them make decisions on  the extent to which documentary reviews or nonintrusive inspections are  to be conducted on cargo containers. In our September 2010 report on  the implementation of the 10+2 rule, we recommended that CBP establish  milestones and time frames for updating ATS to use the 10+2 data in its  identification of shipments that could pose a threat to national security. In  response to this recommendation, CBP took steps in January 2011 to  improve targeting efforts by updating its targeting criteria in to include risk  factors present in the 10+2 data.

Specifically, a CBP study recognized that  existing container seals provided inadequate security against physical  intrusion (e.g., removing a container door to bypass a container seal) and  therefore CBP should develop a technology to monitor and record  intrusions on any of the six sides of a container. In September 2010, we  reported that DHS had conducted research and development for these  projects, but had not yet developed performance standards for them.  Specifically, each project had undergone laboratory testing, but S&T had  not yet conducted testing in an operational environment to ensure that the  prototypes for those projects that had passed laboratory testing would  function as intended. Furthermore, S&T\u2019s plans for conducting operational  testing, did not reflect all of the operational scenarios being considered for  implementation. We recognized that successfully testing the performance  of these technologies is a precursor to developing performance standards  for them; therefore, we recommended that DHS test and evaluate the  technologies within all of the operational scenarios DHS identified for  potential implementation before S&T provides performance standards to  the Office of Policy Development and CBP\u2014DHS concurred with our  recommendation and has completed operational testing for two of the four  container security technology projects in the maritime environment. S&T  officials considered the laboratory and operational testing of both  technology projects a success because they were proven to function  under one operational scenario, which resulted in the development of  performance standards that are necessary to pursue implementation of  these technologies. To fully address our recommendation, however, DHS  would need to test and evaluate the technologies within each of the  remaining operational scenarios it identified for potential implementation.  DHS has informed us that it plans to conduct further operational testing  and anticipates completing this testing in May 2013.", "We also reported on the challenges DHS and CBP could face regarding    the implementation of the four container security technology projects. For example, DHS and CBP could face challenges in obtaining support  from the trade industry and international partners as it pursues  implementation of the security technologies. Specifically, some members  of the trade industry we spoke with were resistant to purchasing and  using the technologies given the number of container security programs  with which they already have to comply.  DHS will also need to obtain  support from international organizations and the WCO to implement new  container security technologies. For instance, for container security  technologies to be admitted to foreign countries without being subject to  import duties and taxes, as well as import prohibitions and restrictions,  the technologies first have to be recognized as accessories and  equipment of the containers under the Customs Convention on  Containers. The successful implementation of security technologies also  depends on the security procedures throughout the supply chain as well  as people engaged in those procedures, which are typically documented  in the concept of operations. As a result, DHS and CBP could face  challenges developing a feasible concept of operations that addresses  the necessary technology infrastructure needs and protocols. Container  security technologies require a supporting technology infrastructure,  including readers to communicate to customs officials whether a  technology has identified an intrusion. Thus, CBP will be faced with  determining who will have access to the container security technologies  through readers, where to place these readers, and obtaining permission  to install fixed readers at domestic and foreign ports.  Also, protocols will  need to be developed to identify which supply chain participants will be  involved in arming and disarming the technologies, reading the status  messages generated by the technologies, responding to alarms, and  accessing data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Radiation Detection and Nonintrusive Imaging Technology Can Help Identify Container Contents", "paragraphs": ["To prevent the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials, as of  September 2010, CBP in coordination with DHS\u2019s Domestic Nuclear  Detection Office (DNDO), has deployed over 1,400 radiation portal  monitors (RPM) at U.S. ports of entry. Most of the RPMs are installed in  primary inspection lanes through which nearly all traffic and shipping  containers must pass before they can exit U.S. ports. These monitors  alarm when they detect radiation. CBP then conducts further inspections  of the suspect contents at its secondary inspection locations to identify  the cause of the alarm and determine what further security measures, if  any, need to be taken.", "While these RPMs are sensitive and have been effective at detecting  radiation, they also have limitations. In particular, in May 2009 we  reported that RPMs are capable of detecting certain nuclear materials  only when these materials are unshielded or lightly shielded. In contrast,  advanced nonintrusive inspection equipment can be used to detect dense  material that may be consistent with the presence of certain nuclear  materials. CBP already uses nonintrusive inspection equipment to more  closely investigate the contents of cargo containers that it has selected for  secondary inspection at a U.S. port of entry; however, according to CBP  officials, only a small percentage of vehicles or cargo containers are  subjected to secondary inspections.", "Since 2006, we have been reporting on long-standing problems with  DNDO\u2019s efforts to deploy advanced spectroscopic portal (ASP) radiation  detection monitors, a more-advanced and significantly more-expensive  type of RPM designed to replace the RPMs CBP currently uses. GAO last  reported on ASP testing in 2009 and found that DHS\u2019s cost analysis of  the ASP program did not provide a sound analytical basis for DHS\u2019s  decision to deploy the portals. We also reported that an updated cost- benefit analysis might show that DNDO\u2019s plan to replace existing  equipment with ASPs was not justified, particularly given the marginal  improvement in detection of certain nuclear materials required of the ASP  and the potential to improve the current-generation RPM\u2019s sensitivity to  nuclear materials, most likely at a lower cost. DNDO officials stated that  they planned to update the cost-benefit analysis; however, after spending  more than $200 million on the program, in February 2010, DHS  announced that it was scaling back its plans for development and use of  the ASP, and subsequently announced in July 2011 that it was ending the  ASP program, which means DHS continues to face limitations in radiation  detection. Since DNDO continued ASP testing through 2011, GAO has  ongoing work to review, among other things, the results of testing of ASP  since 2009, lessons learned from the ASP program, and whether DNDO  plans to conduct additional ASP testing in the future.", "Since 2005, DNDO was also engaged in trying to develop a more  advanced nonintrusive inspection equipment system in order to detect  nuclear materials that might be heavily shielded.

CSI places CBP officers at select foreign seaports to work  with host-country customs officials to identify and scan high-risk cargo  before it is shipped to the United States. CBP launched CSI in January  2002, and in fiscal year 2007 CBP reached its goal of operating CSI in 58  foreign seaports, and as of October 2011, these ports collectively  accounted for over 80 percent of the cargo containers shipped to the  United States. In 2005 and 2008, we made recommendations to CBP to  further strengthen the CSI program by, among other things, revising its  staffing model, developing performance measures, and improving  processes for gathering information. CBP generally agreed and took  action to implement these recommendations.to one of our recommendations, in January 2009, CBP began transferring  CSI staff from overseas ports to perform targeting remotely from the  National Targeting Center-Cargo in the United States.

Specifically, according to CBP officials, while initiating the SFI program at  these ports satisfied the SAFE Port Act requirement to implement the  program at three ports, CBP also selected the ports of Hong Kong;  Busan, South Korea; and Salalah, Oman to more-fully demonstrate the  capability of the integrated scanning system at larger, more complex ports  with higher percentages of transshipment container cargo\u2014cargo  containers from one port that are taken off a vessel at another port to be  placed on another vessel bound for the United States. However, these  ports faced numerous challenges in implementing the 100 percent  scanning requirement, as we reported in October 2009, and some ports  that initially agreed to participate in the SFI program did so for a limited  time, or on a limited basis. For example, the SFI program began  operating in one of the nine terminals at the port of Hong Kong in January  2008 and ended in April 2009. The SFI program was not renewed at the  port of Hong Kong based on a mutual decision by the Hong Kong  government and DHS, in part, because of concerns that equipment and  infrastructure costs, as well as costs to port efficiency, would make full  implementation of the SFI program at all of its terminals unfeasible. CBP  has since reduced the scope of the SFI program, and currently the only  port that continues to operate under SFI protocols is Qasim, Pakistan.", "Logistical, technological, and other problems at participating ports have  prevented any of the participating ports from achieving 100 percent  scanning, as ultimately required by the 9/11 Act, leaving the feasibility  and efficacy of 100 percent scanning largely unproven. For example, we  reported in October 2009 that while CBP had been able to scan a majority  of U.S.-bound cargo containers from three comparatively low-volume  ports (Qasim, Puerto Cortes, and Southampton), at the higher volume  ports of Hong Kong and Busan, CBP had been able to scan no more than  5 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers, on average. Additionally,  scanning operations at the initial SFI ports encountered a number of  challenges\u2014including safety concerns, logistical problems with  containers transferred from rail or other vessels, scanning equipment  breakdowns, and poor-quality scan images. Furthermore, since the 9/11  Act did not specify who is to conduct the container scans or who is to pay  for scanning equipment or operations and maintenance, questions persist  regarding who will bear the costs of scanning.", "In addition to the challenges CBP faced in implementing 100 percent  scanning at the select SFI pilot ports, CBP also faces a number of  potential challenges in integrating the 100 percent scanning requirement  with the existing container security programs that make up CBP\u2019s layered  security strategy. The 100 percent scanning requirement is a departure  from existing container security programs in that it requires that all  containers be scanned before CBP determines their potential risk level.  Senior CBP officials and international trading partners say this change  differs from the risk-based approach based on international supply chain  security standards and accepted practices. Specifically, as we reported in  October 2009 and October 2010, foreign government officials have  expressed the view that 100 percent scanning is not consistent with risk- management principles as contained in the SAFE Framework. For  example, European and Asian customs officials we spoke with told us  that the 100 percent scanning requirement is in contrast to the risk-based  strategy, which serves as the basis for other U.S. programs, such as CSI  and C-TPAT. Further, the WCO, which represents 177 customs agencies  around the world, stated that the implementation of 100 percent scanning  would be \u201ctantamount to abandonment of risk management.\u201d Some  foreign governments have stated they may adopt a reciprocal  requirement that all U.S.-origin containers be scanned, which would  present additional challenges at domestic U.S. ports.", "We recommended that CBP perform analyses to determine whether 100  percent scanning is feasible, and if so, the best way to achieve it; or,  alternatively, if it is not feasible, present acceptable alternatives. To date,  however, CBP has not conducted such a feasibility assessment. CBP has  not pursued a feasibility assessment, in part, due to the interagency effort  to develop the recently issued National Strategy for Global Supply Chain  Security. CBP officials told us in August 2011 that the agency\u2019s position  was that a risk-based approach to global supply chain security was a  more feasible and responsible approach than 100 percent scanning.

Rather, the strategy notes that  the federal government intends to focus its efforts on \u201cthose  enhancements that result in the most significant improvement or  reduction in risk.\u201d", "As the July 2012 deadline in the mandate approaches, uncertainty  remains regarding DHS\u2019s long term course of action to satisfy the 100  percent scanning mandate. As we previously reported, in the short term,  DHS acknowledged it will not be able to meet this deadline for full-scale  implementation of the 9/11 Act\u2019s scanning requirement and will need to  grant extensions to those foreign ports unable to meet the scanning  deadline in order to maintain the flow of trade and comply with the 9/11  Act. The 9/11 Act allows DHS to grant an extension to a port or ports by  certifying that least two of six conditions exist, and as we previously  reported, DHS believes the last two conditions\u2014(1) use of the equipment  to scan all U.S.-bound containers would significantly impact trade  capacity and the flow of cargo and (2) scanning equipment does not  adequately provide automatic notification of an anomaly in a container\u2014 could apply to all foreign ports that ship containers to the United States.  Therefore, DHS expects to grant a blanket extension to all foreign ports  pursuant to the statue, thus extending the target date for compliance with  this requirement by 2 years, to July 2014. To do so, the 9/11 Act requires  DHS to report to Congress 60 days before any extension takes effect on  the container traffic affected by the extension, the evidence supporting  the extension, and the measures DHS is taking to ensure that scanning  can be implemented as early as possible at the ports covered by the  extension. As a result, DHS will need to notify Congress by May 2,  2012, of any extensions it plans to grant.", "Given that the feasibility of 100 percent scanning remains unproven and  DHS and CBP have not yet identified alternatives that could achieve the  same goals as 100 percent scanning, uncertainty persists regarding the  scope of DHS\u2019s and CBP\u2019s container security programs and how these  programs will collectively affect the movement of goods between global  trading partners.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Cuellar, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
