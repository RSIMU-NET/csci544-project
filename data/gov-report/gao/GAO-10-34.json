Under federal law, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for fostering a competitive wireless marketplace while ensuring that consumers are protected from harm. States also have authority to oversee some aspects of service. As requested, this report discusses consumers' satisfaction and problems with wireless phone service and FCC's and state utility commissions' efforts to oversee this service. To conduct this work, Government Accountability Office (GAO) surveyed 1,143 adult wireless phone users from a nationally representative, randomly selected sample; surveyed all state utility commissions; and interviewed and analyzed documents obtained from FCC and stakeholders representing consumers, state agencies and officials, and the industry."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on a GAO survey of adult wireless phone users, an estimated 84 percent of users are very or somewhat satisfied with their wireless phone service. Stakeholders GAO interviewed cited billing, terms of the service contract, carriers' explanation of their service at the point of sale, call quality, and customer service as key aspects of wireless phone service with which consumers have experienced problems in recent years. The survey results indicate that most users are very or somewhat satisfied with each of these key aspects of service, but that the percentages of those very or somewhat dissatisfied with these aspects range from about 9 to 14 percent. GAO's survey results and analysis of FCC complaint data also indicate that some wireless phone service consumers have experienced problems with billing, certain contract terms, and customer service. While the percentages of dissatisfied users appear small, given the widespread use of wireless phones, these percentages represent millions of consumers. FCC receives tens of thousands of wireless consumer complaints each year and forwards them to carriers for response, but has conducted little other oversight of services provided by wireless phone service carriers because the agency has focused on promoting competition. However, GAO's survey results suggest that most wireless consumers with problems would not complain to FCC and many do not know where they could complain. FCC also lacks goals and measures that clearly identify the intended outcomes of its complaint processing efforts. Consequently, FCC cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of its efforts to process complaints. Additionally, without knowing to complain to FCC or what outcome to expect if they do, consumers with problems may be confused about where to get help and about what kind of help is available. FCC monitors wireless consumer complaints, but such efforts are limited. Lacking in-depth analysis of its consumer complaints, FCC may not be aware of emerging trends in consumer problems, if specific rules are being violated, or if additional rules are needed to protect consumers. FCC has rules regarding billing, but has conducted no enforcement of these rules as they apply to wireless carriers. This August, FCC sought public comment about ways to better protect and inform wireless consumers. In response to GAO's survey, most state commissions reported receiving and processing wireless phone service consumer complaints; however, fewer than half reported having rules that apply to wireless phone service. Stakeholders said that states' authority to regulate wireless service under federal law is unclear, leading, in some cases, to costly legal proceedings and reluctance in some states to provide oversight. FCC has provided some guidance on this issue but has not fully resolved disagreement over states' authority to regulate billing line items and fees charged for terminating service early. State commissions surveyed indicated that communication with FCC about wireless phone service oversight is infrequent. As such, FCC is missing opportunities to partner with state agencies in providing effective oversight and to share information on wireless phone service consumer concerns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Wireless phone use in the United States has risen dramatically over the  last 20 years, and Americans increasingly rely on wireless phones as their  primary or sole means of telephone communication. According to industry  data, the total number of wireless phone service subscribers nationwide  has grown from about 3.5 million in 1989 to about 270 million in 2008 (see  fig. 1). As a result of this rapid growth, today the vast majority of  Americans are wireless phone service users. Although the actual number  of wireless users is less than the number of subscribers\u2014since some users  have multiple wireless phones\u2014estimates indicate that about 84 percent  of Americans 18 years of age or older use wireless phones.", "Concerns have arisen in recent years about the quality of wireless phone  service, including specific concerns about billing; customer service; and  carriers\u2019 contract terms, such as the fees carriers charge customers for  terminating their service before the end of the contract period (early  termination fees). In June 2009, we reported that such issues continued to  be of concern to some consumers, as demonstrated by the results of our  survey of wireless phone service users. Under federal law, the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) is responsible for fostering a  competitive wireless marketplace while ensuring that consumers are  protected from harmful practices. FCC\u2019s rules (or regulations) include  procedures for handling consumer complaints. States, which have  traditionally regulated local telephone service through regulatory bodies  known as state utility commissions, also retain some authority under  federal law to regulate wireless phone service and many also process  consumer complaints.", "Citing concerns about the quality of wireless phone service, you asked us  to examine consumers\u2019 concerns and government oversight in this area.  This report discusses (1) consumers\u2019 satisfaction with wireless phone  service and problems they have experienced with this service, as well as  the industry\u2019s response to these problems; (2) FCC\u2019s efforts to oversee  services provided by wireless phone service carriers; and (3) state utility  commissions\u2019 efforts to oversee services provided by wireless phone  service carriers.", "To determine consumers\u2019 satisfaction with wireless phone service and  problems they have experienced in recent years, we surveyed a nationally  representative, randomly selected sample of adult wireless phone users 18  years of age or older who had cell phone service in 2008. From this  sample, we completed 1,143 interviews. In addition, we interviewed FCC  and stakeholders from organizations representing consumers, state  agencies, and industry and reviewed documents obtained from these  sources. We also analyzed consumer complaints about wireless phone  service that FCC received from 2004 through 2008 and reviewed complaint  data from other sources. To determine the industry\u2019s response to these  problems, we interviewed industry officials from the four largest U.S.  carriers, two smaller carriers, and two national associations. To evaluate  FCC\u2019s efforts to oversee services provided by wireless phone service  carriers\u2014including the agency\u2019s efforts to process complaints, monitor  sources of information to inform policy decisions, and create and enforce  rules\u2014we interviewed FCC officials responsible for such oversight,  including those responsible for consumer issues and enforcement. We also  reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and procedures and FCC\u2019s quarterly  complaint reports, strategic plan, and budget, including the agency\u2019s  performance goals and measures. To describe state utility commissions\u2019  efforts to oversee services provided by wireless phone service carriers, we  surveyed state utility commissions in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia about their wireless regulatory authority and efforts to oversee  wireless phone service and process consumer complaints. All 51  commissions responded to our survey. We also interviewed officials and  examined documents from state utility commissions, consumer advocate  offices, and attorneys general offices in California, Nebraska, and West  Virginia.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The use of wireless phone service has grown rapidly in recent years. By  the end of 2008, about 82 percent of adults lived in households with  wireless phone service, up from 54 percent at the end of 2005.  Furthermore, by the end of 2008, about 35 percent of households used  wireless phones as their primary or only means of telephone service, of  which about 20 percent had only wireless phones and the other 15 percent  had landlines but received all or most calls on wireless phones.  Consumers\u2019 use of wireless phones for other purposes, such as text  messaging, photography, and accessing the Internet, has also increased  dramatically. For example, FCC reports that, while a subscriber\u2019s average  minutes of use per month grew from 584 to 769 from 2004 to 2007, the  number of text messages grew more than tenfold during the same period.", "Within the wireless phone industry, four nationwide wireless phone  service carriers\u2014AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon\u2014operate alongside  regional carriers of various size. The four major carriers serve more than  85 percent of wireless subscribers, but no single competitor has a  dominant share of the market. As recently as 2007, more than 175  companies identified themselves as wireless phone service carriers.", "To subscribe to wireless phone service, a customer must select a wireless  phone service carrier and either sign a contract and choose a service plan  or purchase prepaid minutes and buy a phone that works with the prepaid  service. Most customers sign contracts that specify the service plan and  the number of minutes and text messages the customer is buying for a  monthly fee. Also, new customers who sign contracts for wireless phone  service sometimes pay up-front fees for \u201cnetwork activation\u201d of their  phones and usually agree to pay an \u201cearly termination fee\u201d if they should  quit the carrier\u2019s network before the end of the contract period. In return  for signing a contract, customers often receive wireless phones at a  discount or no additional cost.", "In 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (1993 Act) was enacted,  creating a regulatory framework to treat wireless phone service carriers  consistently and encourage the growth of a competitive marketplace.  Specifically, the law required FCC to treat wireless carriers as common  carriers but gave FCC authority to exempt wireless service carriers from  specific regulations that apply to common carriers if FCC could  demonstrate that doing so would promote competition, that the  regulations were unnecessary to protect consumers, and that the  exemption was consistent with the public interest. FCC has specific  authority to regulate wireless phone service rates and market entry, while  states are preempted from doing so; however, states may regulate the  other \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of wireless phone service.", "The 1993 Act also directed FCC to require wireless carriers, like other  common carriers, to provide service upon reasonable request and terms  without unjust or unreasonable discrimination, as well as to adhere to  procedures for responding to complaints submitted to FCC.  Subsequently, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized FCC to  exempt wireless service carriers from these sections; however, in a 1998  proceeding to consider whether to exempt certain wireless phone service  carriers from these requirements, FCC specifically stated that it would not  do so, noting that these respective sections represented the \u201cbedrock  consumer protection obligations\u201d of common carriers. FCC\u2019s rules  specify that the agency has both informal and formal complaint  processes. FCC\u2019s informal complaint process allows consumers to file  complaints with FCC that the agency reviews and forwards to carriers for  a response. The formal complaint process, which is similar to a court  proceeding, requires a filing fee and is rarely used by consumers.", "State agencies also play a role in wireless phone service oversight. State  utility commissions (sometimes called public utility commissions or public  service commissions) regulate utilities, including telecommunications  services such as wireless phone service and landline phone service. State  commissions may also designate wireless phone service carriers as eligible  telecommunications carriers (ETC)\u2014a designation that allows carriers to  receive universal service funds for serving consumers in high-cost areas.  Through this process, state utility commissions may place conditions on  how wireless carriers provide services in those high-cost areas in order for  them to be eligible for such funds. State attorneys general broadly serve as  the chief legal officers of states while also representing the public interest,  and their work has included addressing wireless consumer protection  issues. For example, in 2004, the attorneys general of 32 states entered  into voluntary compliance agreements with Cingular Wireless (now  AT&T), Sprint, and Verizon, under which the carriers agreed to disclose  certain service terms at the point-of-sale and in their marketing and  advertising, provide a service trial period, appropriately disclose certain  taxes and surcharges on customers\u2019 bills, and respond to consumers\u2019  complaints and inquiries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Consumers Are Satisfied with Their Wireless Phone Service, but Some Have Experienced Problems", "paragraphs": ["According to our consumer survey, overall, wireless phone service  consumers are satisfied with the service they receive. Specifically, we  estimate that 84 percent of adult wireless users are very or somewhat  satisfied with their wireless phone service and that approximately 10  percent are very or somewhat dissatisfied with their service (see fig. 2).", "Stakeholders we interviewed identified a number of aspects of wireless  phone service that consumers have reported problems with in recent  years. We identified five key areas of concern on the basis of these  interviews and our review of related documents, and we subsequently  focused our nationwide consumer survey on these areas (see table 1).", "Based on our survey results, we estimate that most wireless phone users  are satisfied with these five specific aspects of service (see table 2). For  example, we estimate that 85 percent of wireless phone users are very or  somewhat satisfied with call quality, while the percentages of those very  or somewhat satisfied with billing, contract terms, carrier\u2019s explanation of  key aspects of service at the point of sale, and customer service range  from about 70 to 76 percent. Additionally, we estimate that most wireless  phone users are satisfied with their wireless phone service coverage. For  example, we estimate that 86 to 89 percent of wireless phone users are  satisfied with their coverage when using their wireless phones at home, at  work, or in their vehicle.", "While we estimate that about three-fourths or more of wireless phone  service users are satisfied with specific aspects of their service, the  percentages of those very or somewhat dissatisfied range from about 9 to  14 percent, depending on the specific aspect of service. For example, we  estimate that 14 percent of wireless phone users are dissatisfied with the  terms of their service contract or agreement. While the percentages of  dissatisfied users appear to be small, they represent millions of people  since, according to available estimates, the number of adult wireless  phone service users is over 189 million.", "Other results of our survey suggest that some wireless phone consumers  have experienced problems with billing, certain service contract terms,  and customer service recently\u2014that is, during 2008 and early 2009.  Specifically, our survey results indicate the following:    Billing. We estimate that during this time about 34 percent of wireless  phone users responsible for paying for their service received unexpected  charges and about 31 percent had difficulty understanding their bill at  least some of the time. Also during this time, almost one-third of wireless  users who contacted customer service about a problem did so because of  problems related to billing.", "Service contract terms. Among wireless users who wanted to switch  carriers during this time but did not do so, we estimate that 42 percent did  not switch because they did not want to pay an early termination fee.", "Customer service. Among those users who contacted customer service,  we estimate that 21 percent were very or somewhat dissatisfied with how  the carrier handled the problem.", "Our analysis of FCC consumer complaint data also indicates that billing,  terms of the service contract, and customer service are areas where  wireless consumers have experienced problems in recent years.  Furthermore, FCC complaint data indicate that call quality is an area of  consumer concern. Specifically, our analysis of FCC data indicates that  the top four categories of complaints from 2004 through 2008 regarding  service provided by wireless carriers were billing and rates, call quality,  early termination of contracts, and customer service, as shown in figure 3  (see app. II for additional discussion of FCC wireless consumer complaint  data).", "Our survey of state utility commissions also found that billing, contract  terms, and quality of service were the top categories of consumer  complaints related to wireless phone service that commissions received in  2008. Specifically, among the 21 commissions that track wireless  consumer complaints, 14 noted billing, 10 noted contract terms, and 10  noted quality of service as among the top three types of complaints  commissions received in 2008. Additionally, 3 commissions specifically  cited early termination fees as one of the top three categories of  complaints they received in 2008.", "In response to the areas of consumer concern noted above, wireless  carriers have taken a number of actions in recent years. For example,  officials from the four major carriers\u2014AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and  Verizon\u2014reported taking actions such as prorating their early termination  fees over the period of the contract, offering service options without  contracts, and providing Web-based tools consumers can use to research a  carrier\u2019s coverage area, among other efforts. In addition, in 2003, the  industry adopted a voluntary code with requirements for dealing with  customers and, according to CTIA\u2013The Wireless Association, the wireless  industry spent an average of $24 billion annually between 2001 and 2007  on infrastructure and equipment to improve call quality and coverage.  Also, carriers told us they use information from third-party tests and  customer feedback to determine their network and service performance  and identify needed improvements. (See app. III for additional information  about industry actions to address consumer concerns.)", "Representatives of state agencies and various consumer and industry  associations we interviewed expressed concern to us that many of the  actions the industry has taken to address consumers\u2019 concerns are  voluntary and have not effectively addressed some major consumer  concerns. For example, officials from some state public utility  commissions indicated that there are no data to support the effectiveness  of the wireless industry\u2019s voluntary code and that this code lacks the level  of oversight that state agencies can offer. Moreover, officials from state  utility commissions and consumer associations we spoke with indicated  that the industry\u2019s actions to prorate early termination fees may be  inadequate because the fees are not reduced to $0 over of the course of the  contract period. Furthermore, some representatives of state agencies and  consumer groups suggested that the industry has taken voluntary actions  such as adopting the voluntary code and prorating early termination fees  to avoid further regulation by FCC. Industry representatives, however, told  us that the voluntary approach is more effective than regulation, since it  gives the industry flexibility to address these concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Processes Wireless Consumer Complaints but Has Conducted Little Other Oversight of Services Provided by Wireless Phone Service Carriers", "paragraphs": ["FCC processes tens of thousands of wireless consumer complaints each  year but has conducted little additional oversight of services provided by  wireless phone service carriers because the agency has focused on  promoting competition.

Given that our survey indicates that an estimated  21 percent of consumers who contact their carrier\u2019s customer service  about a problem are dissatisfied with the result, FCC\u2019s efforts to process  complaints are an important means for consumers to get assistance in  resolving their problems. After reviewing a complaint received, FCC  responds by sending the consumer a letter about the complaint\u2019s status. If  FCC determines that the complaint is valid, the agency sends the  complaint to the carrier and asks the carrier to respond to FCC and the  consumer within 30 days.", "Once FCC receives a response from the carrier, the agency reviews the  response, and if it determines the response has addressed the consumer\u2019s  complaint, it marks the complaint as closed. According to FCC officials, if  the response is not sufficient, FCC contacts the carrier again. FCC officials  told us they consider a carrier\u2019s response to be sufficient if it responds to  the issue raised in the consumer\u2019s complaint; however, such a response  may not address the problem to the consumer\u2019s satisfaction. When FCC  considers a complaint to be closed, it sends another letter to the  consumer, which states that the consumer can call FCC with further  questions or, if not satisfied with the carrier\u2019s response, can file a formal  complaint. FCC officials also told us that if a consumer is not satisfied, the  consumer can request that FCC mediate with the carrier on his or her  behalf; however, the letter that FCC sends to a consumer whose complaint  has been closed does not identify mediation as an option. FCC closes most  wireless phone service complaints within 90 days of receiving them.  Specifically, according to FCC\u2019s complaint data, the agency closed 61  percent of complaints received in 2008 within 90 days (see fig. 4).", "FCC uses several methods to inform consumers that they may complain to  the agency about their wireless phone service and has taken steps to  improve its outreach. According to FCC officials, the agency provides  information on how to complain to FCC on its Web site and in fact sheets  that are distributed through various methods, including its Web site. Also,  in response to a recommendation from its Consumer Advisory Committee  in 2003 to improve outreach to consumers about the agency\u2019s process for  handling complaints, FCC switched from using one complaint form to  having multiple forms for different types of complaints to make filing  complaints easier for consumers. FCC also made its complaint forms and  fact sheets available in Spanish and has distributed consumer fact sheets  at outreach events and conferences. Furthermore, the agency created an e- mail distribution list for disseminating consumer information materials,  which it used to inform consumers about the revised complaint forms. We  have previously noted that it is important for an agency\u2019s consumer  protection efforts to inform the public effectively and efficiently about its  role and how to seek redress. Additionally, we have reported on various  ways an agency can communicate with the public about its efforts,  including how exploring multiple methods for communicating with the  public may improve public outreach. Such outreach methods can include  making effective use of Web sites, e-mail listserves, or other Web-based  technologies like Web forums, as well as requiring relevant companies to  provide information to their customers. For example, many state utility  commissions require landline carriers to include information on  customers\u2019 bills about how to contact the commission with a complaint.", "Despite FCC\u2019s efforts to improve its outreach, these efforts may not be  adequately informing the public about the agency\u2019s role in handling  consumer complaints. Specifically, based on the results of our consumer  survey, we estimate that 13 percent of adult wireless phone users would  complain to FCC if they had a problem that their carrier did not resolve  and that 34 percent do not know where they could complain. Therefore,  many consumers that experience problems with their wireless phone  service may not know to contact FCC for assistance or may not know at  all whom they could contact for help. We reported these survey results in  June 2009. In August 2009, noting our survey results, FCC sought public  comment on whether there are measures the agency could take to ensure  that consumers are aware of FCC\u2019s complaint process, including whether  FCC should require carriers to include information for consumers on their  bills about how to contact FCC with a complaint."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Lacks Goals and Measures That Articulate the Intended Outcomes of Its Efforts to Process Consumer Complaints", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s goals and measures related to its efforts to process wireless  consumer complaints do not clearly identify the intended outcomes of  these efforts. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993  (GPRA) requires an agency to establish outcome-related performance  goals for its major functions. GPRA also requires an agency to develop  performance indicators for measuring the relevant outcomes of each  program activity in order for the agency to demonstrate how well it is  achieving its goals.", "The key goal related to FCC\u2019s consumer complaint efforts is to \u201cwork to  inform American consumers about their rights and responsibilities in the  competitive marketplace.\u201d This key goal also has a subgoal to \u201cfacilitate  informed choice in the competitive telecommunications marketplace.\u201d  According to FCC officials, \u201cinformed choice\u201d means consumers are  informed about how a particular telecommunications market works, what  general services are offered, and what to expect when they buy a service.  FCC\u2019s measure related to its efforts to process wireless consumer  complaints under this subgoal is to respond to consumers\u2019 general  complaints within 30 days, which reflects the time it takes FCC to initially  respond to the consumer about the status of a complaint. The measure  does not clearly or fully demonstrate FCC\u2019s achievement of its goal to  facilitate informed consumer choice. Instead, it is a measure of a program  output, or activity, not of the outcome the agency is trying to achieve.  Another subgoal is to \u201cimprove customer experience with FCC\u2019s call  centers and Web site.\u201d While this subgoal does identify an intended  outcome, FCC does not have a measure related to this outcome that  pertains to consumers who complain about services provided by their  wireless carrier. FCC officials told us that they do not measure customer  experience with the agency\u2019s call centers and Web sites but sometimes  receive anecdotal information from customers about their experiences.", "We have previously reported that to better articulate results, agencies  should create a set of performance goals and related measures that  address important dimensions of program performance. FCC\u2019s goals may  not represent all of the important dimensions of FCC\u2019s performance in  addressing consumer complaints. A logical outcome of handling  complaints is resolving problems or, if a problem cannot be resolved,  helping the consumer understand why that is the case. However, it is not  clear whether resolving problems is an intended outcome of FCC\u2019s  consumer complaint efforts. While FCC\u2019s goals in this area indicate that  informing consumers is a goal of the agency, some information from FCC  implies that another intended outcome of these efforts is to resolve  consumers\u2019 problems. For example, FCC\u2019s fact sheets state that  consumers can file a complaint with FCC if they are unable to resolve a  problem directly with their carrier, which may lead consumers to believe  that FCC will assist them in obtaining a resolution. However, FCC officials  told us that the agency\u2019s role in addressing complaints, as outlined in the  law, is to facilitate communication between the consumer and the carrier  and that FCC lacks the authority to compel a carrier to take action to  satisfy many consumer concerns. Thus, it is not clear if the intended  outcome of FCC\u2019s complaint-handling efforts is resolving consumer  problems, fostering communication between consumers and carriers, or  both. Furthermore, FCC has not established measures of its performance  in either resolving consumer problems or fostering communication  between consumers and carriers. For example, FCC does not measure  consumer satisfaction with its complaint-handling efforts. Without clear  outcome-related goals and measures linked to those goals, the purpose  and effectiveness of these efforts are unclear, and the agency\u2019s  accountability for its performance is limited.", "As noted above, consumers may not know to contact FCC if they have a  complaint about their wireless phone service. Additionally, because FCC  has not clearly articulated the intended outcomes of its complaint- processing efforts, consumers may not know the extent to which FCC can  aid them in obtaining a satisfactory resolution to their concerns, and since  FCC\u2019s letters to consumers do not indicate that mediation is available,  consumers may not know that they can request this service from FCC.

FCC also has specific  rules requiring wireless carriers and other common carriers to present  charges on customers\u2019 bills that are clear and nonmisleading, known as  truth-in-billing rules. Additionally, FCC\u2019s rules establish other consumer  protections, such as requiring wireless carriers to provide enhanced 911  and other emergency services and number portability rules that allow  customers to keep their phone numbers when switching between wireless  carriers or between landline and wireless services.

According to representatives of FCC\u2019s Enforcement  Bureau, trends in consumer complaints that identify potential violations of  FCC rules may signal the need for FCC to conduct an investigation, which  could lead to an enforcement action. For example, in reviewing complaint  data, the bureau identified five wireless carriers that had not responded to  consumer complaints, which in 2008, led the agency to initiate  enforcement actions against these carriers. However, Enforcement  Bureau officials told us that they have not reviewed complaints to look for  potential wireless truth-in-billing rules violations. Under the method it  currently uses to categorize informal complaints, FCC cannot easily  determine whether complaints may indicate a potential violation of FCC\u2019s  truth-in-billing rules. For example, FCC officials told us that while the  agency uses category codes to identify types of complaints related to  billing, such as codes for rates, line items, and fees, FCC officials would  have to review complaints individually to determine whether they revealed  a potential violation of its truth-in-billing rules\u2014an analysis FCC has not  conducted. Furthermore, according to FCC officials, since the application  of the agency\u2019s truth-in-billing rules to wireless carriers was expanded in  2005, the agency has conducted no formal investigations of wireless  carriers\u2019 compliance with these rules because investigating other issues  has been a priority and FCC has received no formal complaints in this  area. Since our consumer survey indicates that about a third of consumers  responsible for paying their wireless bills have had problems  understanding their bill or received unexpected charges, the enforcement  of truth-in-billing rules is important for the protection of consumers.", "Lacking in-depth analysis of its consumer complaints, FCC may not be  aware of trends or emerging issues related to consumer problems, if  specific rules\u2014such as the truth-in-billing rules\u2014are being violated, or if  additional rules are needed to protect consumers. Our standards for  internal control in the federal government state that agencies should have  policies and procedures as an integral part of their efforts to achieve  effective results.

Specifically, the number of commissions that have rules in  these areas ranges from 3 that have rules about disclosure of service terms  and conditions to 15 that have rules about service quality (see fig. 6).", "While fewer than half of the commissions have wireless rules, most  designate wireless carriers as eligible telecommunication carriers (ETC) to  receive universal service funds for serving high-cost areas. Although ETC  status is not required for a wireless carrier to operate in a high-cost area, it  is required if the carrier wants to receive universal service funding. We  previously reported that wireless carriers often lack the economic  incentive to install wireless towers in rural areas where they are unlikely  to recover the installation and maintenance costs, but high-cost program  support allows them to make these investments. Most commissions place  conditions on receiving these funds related to various aspects of service.  Specifically, 41 commissions in our survey reported having processes to  designate wireless carriers as ETCs, and 31 reported placing such  conditions on carriers to receive these funds. For example, the Nebraska  state commission requires designated wireless ETCs to submit reports  about coverage, service outages, complaints, and their use of universal  service funding. For each of the five main areas related to the terms and  conditions of service we asked about, more commissions reported having  conditions for wireless ETCs than rules for wireless carriers (see fig. 6).

Twenty-one commissions reported that they do not have wireless  regulatory authority and another 9 commissions would not assert whether  they did or did not have wireless regulatory authority for various reasons  (see fig. 7).

As discussed earlier, in 1993, Congress  developed a wireless regulatory framework that expressly prohibited  states from regulating the market entry or rates charged by wireless phone  service carriers, while retaining states\u2019 authority to regulate other \u201cterms  and conditions\u201d of wireless service. In an accompanying report, Congress  stated that \u201cterms and conditions\u201d was intended to include billing  practices and disputes, as well as other consumer protection matters. The  report further stated that examples of service it provided that could fall  within a state\u2019s lawful authority under \u201cterms and conditions\u201d were  illustrative and not meant to preclude other matters generally understood  to fall under \u201cterms and conditions.\u201d Despite this guidance, whether  specific aspects of service are considered \u201crates\u201d or \u201cterms and  conditions\u201d has been the subject of disputes at FCC, in state regulatory  bodies, and in the courts. For example, courts have recently been  grappling with cases about whether billing line items and early termination  fees are defined as \u201crates,\u201d and are therefore not subject to state  regulation, or as other \u201cterms and conditions,\u201d which may be regulated by  states. Such cases have not resolved the issue, as courts have reached  different conclusions about the meaning of these terms or await action by  FCC. (See app. IV for examples of legal proceedings that address states\u2019  authority to regulate terms and conditions of wireless phone service.)", "FCC has provided limited guidance about the meaning of \u201cterms and  conditions.\u201d The agency did offer preliminary observations in response to  petitions states filed with FCC seeking to continue regulating wireless  rates and in a few other proceedings. For example, in 1995, FCC noted  that while states could not set or fix wireless rates in the future, they could  process consumer complaints under state law because \u201cterms and  conditions\u201d was flexible enough to allow states to continue in this role.  FCC has also said that states may designate wireless carriers as ETCs and  that states may impose consumer protection requirements on wireless  carriers as a condition for ETC designation. In 1999, FCC concluded that  billing information, practices, and disputes fall within these other terms  and conditions. Subsequently, in 2005, as part of its truth-in-billing  proceeding, FCC concluded that regulation of line items by states  constituted rate regulation, thereby preempting state authority; however,  this conclusion was rejected by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In  this proceeding, FCC also asked commenters to address the proper  boundaries of \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d and to describe what they  believe should be the roles of FCC and the states in defining carriers\u2019  billing practices. However, this proceeding is still open, and FCC has taken  no further action to define the proper role of states in regulating billing  practices.", "The lack of clarity regarding states\u2019 authority to regulate wireless service  has led to delays in deciding some legal matters and some states\u2019  reluctance to provide oversight. In some instances, when hearing cases  involving early termination fees, courts have halted proceedings pending  FCC\u2019s resolution of its own proceedings examining whether such fees  should be defined as \u201crates\u201d or \u201cterms and conditions.\u201d For example, in  2008, rather than issue a ruling, a U.S. District Court in the state of  Washington deferred to FCC a case against a wireless carrier involving  early termination fees, citing FCC\u2019s primary jurisdiction over the issue.  According to FCC officials, when courts defer cases to FCC, the agency  does not automatically address the issue, but requires that a party file a  petition asking FCC to do so. Officials of national organizations  representing state agencies and officials from state agencies we  interviewed told us that some states are reluctant to regulate wireless  phone service until their authority is clarified. This is due, in part, to the  potential legal costs that could be incurred if their authority is challenged  in court by the industry. Such reluctance may lead to less consumer  protection in certain states that otherwise might issue regulations.", "As we have previously reported, to develop an efficient and effective  regulatory framework, the appropriate roles of participants, including  states, should be identified. Because of the lack of clarity noted above,  various stakeholders have expressed a desire for clearer roles for FCC and  the states in providing wireless phone service oversight. For example,  officials of national organizations representing state agencies, as well as  officials from state agencies we interviewed, told us that clarity from  Congress or FCC about the scope of state authority in regulating wireless  phone service is needed. Some industry representatives also told us that  there should be better guidance on the respective roles of state and federal  agencies. A report by the FCC Wireless Broadband Access Task Force in  2005 recommended that FCC further clarify states\u2019 authority to regulate  \u201cterms and conditions,\u201d saying ambiguity about this authority has resulted  in several disputes at FCC, in state regulatory bodies, and in the courts,  and has caused significant regulatory uncertainty that will adversely affect  investment in and deployment of wireless networks and other services. In  2005, CTIA\u2013The Wireless Association petitioned FCC to declare that early  termination fees are rates, and FCC sought comment on the petition.  Recently, when CTIA\u2013The Wireless Association withdrew its petition, four  consumer groups opposed its withdrawal, hoping that FCC would offer  some clarity on whether early termination fees are subject to state laws  and regulations in order to help resolve some pending state lawsuits.", "State, consumer, and industry stakeholders hold varying views about how  the meaning of \u201cterms and conditions\u201d should be clarified, which would  affect states\u2019 authority to regulate wireless phone service. Industry  representatives argue that \u201cterms and conditions\u201d should be defined  narrowly, which would preempt states\u2019 ability to regulate aspects of  wireless phone service that fall outside the definition. For example,  industry representatives have stated that early termination fees and billing  line items should be considered \u201crates,\u201d rather than \u201cterms and  conditions,\u201d which would preclude state utility commissions from  regulating these aspects of service. In general, industry representatives  have supported regulation at only the federal level, which they claim  would avoid inconsistent state regulatory requirements they say would  add to their costs. In contrast, state agency representatives and some  consumer organizations have supported clarifying the meaning of \u201cterms  and conditions\u201d to broadly encompass various aspects of wireless phone  service, since they oppose efforts to preempt states\u2019 regulatory authority.  For example, state consumer advocates and consumer organizations have  argued that aspects of service such as early termination fees and billing  line items should fall within the definition of \u201cterms and conditions\u201d of  service that states have authority to regulate.

We previously reported that collaboration between agencies  tasked with shared responsibilities produces more public value than  independent actions by such agencies. These practices include  identifying and addressing needs by leveraging resources to support a  common outcome and agreeing on roles and responsibilities in agency  collaboration.

While most states  accept wireless consumer complaints, many do not work with the carrier  and the consumer to resolve those complaints, making FCC\u2019s efforts an  important resource for consumers in those states that do not accept or  work to resolve complaints. However, if, as our survey of wireless users  suggests, most consumers are not aware they can complain to FCC, those  with problems may not know how to seek a fair resolution.

Percentage estimates have a margin of error of less than 5 percentage  points, unless otherwise noted. We conducted this survey of the American  public from February 23, 2009, through April 5, 2009. A total of 1,143  completed interviews were collected, and calls were made to all 50 states.  Our sampling approach included randomly contacting potential  respondents using both landline and cell phone telephone numbers. Using  these two sampling frames provided us with a more comprehensive  coverage of adult cell phone users than if we had sampled from only one  frame.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence  intervals in this report will include the true values in the study population.", "Each sampled adult was subsequently weighted in the analysis to account  statistically for all of the adult cell phone users of the population. The final  weight applied to each responding adult cell phone user included an  adjustment for the overlap in the two sampling frames, a raking  adjustment to align the weighted sample to the known population  distributions from the 2009 supplement of the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s  Current Population Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention\u2019s 2008 National Health Interview Survey, and an expansion  weight to ensure the total number of weighted adults represent an  estimated adult population eligible for this study.", "We conducted an analysis of the final weighted estimates from our survey  designed to identify whether our results contain a significant level of bias  because our results inherently do not reflect the experiences of those who  did not respond to our survey\u2014i.e., a nonresponse bias analysis.

While we  identified evidence of potential bias in the unadjusted weighted estimate,  the final weighting adjustments appear to address this potential bias, and  we did not observe the same level of bias when examining the final  weighted estimates. Based on these findings, we chose to include final  weighted estimates at the national level from our survey in the report.

Based on these assumptions, the response rate for the  survey was 32 percent; however, the response rate could have been lower  if different assumptions had been made and might also be different if  calculated using a different method. We used random digit dial (RDD)  sampling frames that include both listed and unlisted landline numbers  from working blocks of numbers in the United States. The RDD sampling  frame approach cannot provide any coverage of the increasing number of  cell-phone-only households and limited coverage of cell-phone-mostly  households (i.e., households that receive most of their calls on cell phones  in spite of having a landline). Because of the importance of reaching such  households for this survey about wireless phone service, we also used an  RDD cell phone sampling frame. The RDD cell phone sampling frame was  randomly generated from blocks of phone numbers that are dedicated to  cellular service. About 43 percent of the completed interviews were from  the RDD cell phone sample.", "Because many households contain more than one potential respondent,  obtaining an unbiased sample from an RDD frame of landline numbers  requires interviewing a randomly selected respondent from among all  potential respondents within the sampled household (as opposed to  always interviewing the individual who initially answers the phone). We  obtained an unbiased sample by using the most recent birthday method, in  which the interviewer asks to speak to the household member aged 18 or  older with a wireless phone who had the most recent birthday. If the  respondent who was identified as the member of the household with the  most recent birthday was unavailable to talk and asked to schedule a  callback, the call representative recorded the person\u2019s name and preferred  telephone number for the callback. There were also cases when a  respondent from the cell phone sample asked to be called back on his or  her landline. These respondents, if they completed the survey, were  considered a completed interview from the cell phone sample.

For example, questions about the prevalence of billing  problems were asked only of respondents who indicated they were solely  or jointly responsible for paying for their service. Additionally, satisfaction  with wireless coverage for particular locations (i.e. at home, at work, and  in a vehicle) was calculated only among respondents who indicated they  used their wireless phone service in those locations. The survey and a  more complete tabulation of the results can be viewed by accessing  GAO-10-35SP.", "To identify the type and nature of problems consumers have experienced  in recent years with their wireless phone service, we interviewed officials  from FCC, consumer organizations, national organizations that represent  state agency officials, and state agency officials from three selected  states\u2014California, Nebraska, and West Virginia\u2014representing utility  commissions, offices of consumer advocates, and offices of attorneys  general (see table 4). We selected these states based on their varying  geography, populations, region, and approaches to overseeing wireless  phone service, as indicated in part by information obtained from national  organizations representing state agency officials. We also interviewed  officials from the four major wireless carriers, two selected smaller  carriers that serve mostly rural areas, and wireless industry associations.  In addition, we reviewed documents obtained from some of these sources.  We also analyzed FCC\u2019s wireless complaint data on complaints received  from 2004 through 2008. We reviewed FCC\u2019s processes for generating  these data and checked the data for errors and inconsistencies. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review. We also obtained the total number of wireless complaints received  in 2008 by the 21 state utility commissions that record and track wireless  phone service consumer complaints. While we did not assess the reliability  of the state complaint data, we are providing the numbers of complaints  states reported receiving for illustrative purposes.", "To identify major actions the industry has taken in recent years to address  consumers\u2019 concerns, we interviewed the industry organizations named  above and reviewed related documentation (see table 4). We also  requested service quality information from the four major carriers,  including measures of network performance and the number and types of  customer complaints. Carriers told us that this information is proprietary  and sensitive, and as we did not obtain comparable information from all  four carriers, we were not able to present any aggregate information based  on these data. Additionally, we interviewed consumer, state, and federal  stakeholders about the effectiveness of industry efforts to address  consumers\u2019 concerns (see table 4).", "To evaluate how FCC oversees wireless phone service, including the  agency\u2019s efforts to process complaints, monitor sources of information to  inform policy decisions, and create and enforce rules, we interviewed FCC  officials about these activities and reviewed related documentation  obtained from these officials. We also reviewed relevant laws, regulations,  and procedures, as well as FCC\u2019s quarterly complaint reports, strategic  plan, and budget with performance goals and measures. In addition, we  reviewed requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 and our prior recommendations on performance goals and measures  and determined whether FCC\u2019s efforts to measure the performance of its  efforts to process consumer complaints are consistent with these  requirements and recommendations. We also interviewed consumer, state,  and industry stakeholders about their views on FCC\u2019s efforts to provide  oversight (see table 4). We focused our review on FCC\u2019s oversight of  wireless phone service issues that have been major areas of concern for  consumers in recent years, specifically targeting consumer protection  efforts and those actions related to how wireless carriers interact with and  serve their customers. We did not assess how FCC oversees a number of  other facets of the wireless industry, including competition, spectrum  allocation, licensing, construction, technical issues such as interference,  public safety, or the agency\u2019s obligations under the Telephone Consumer  Protection Act and the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited  Pornography and Marketing Act.", "To describe state utility commissions\u2019 efforts to oversee wireless phone  service, we surveyed commissions in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia. We conducted this survey from March 3, 2009, through April 1,  2009. We received responses from all 51 commissions, which we obtained  through a Web-based survey we administered and subsequent follow-up  with some states. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the  results can be viewed by accessing GAO-10-35SP. To obtain illustrative  information about these issues, we interviewed state officials in public  utility commissions, consumer advocate offices, and offices of attorneys  general in three selected states (California, Nebraska, and West Virginia).

Of the nearly 55,000 billing complaints FCC received during this  period, there were 28,000 focused on obtaining credits, refunds, or billing  adjustments. FCC also received almost 9,000 billing complaints about  charges for minutes talking on a wireless phone. Additionally, there were  more than 5,500 complaints about recurring charges on consumers\u2019 bills  and more than 5,500 complaints about the rates they received from their  wireless service providers. Finally, our analysis of FCC\u2019s data identified  more than 2,100 wireless complaints concerning unauthorized, misleading,  or deceptive charges (known as \u201ccramming\u201d).", "Call quality: Within this category, the majority of consumers complained  about three issue areas: the quality of wireless phone service in their local  service area, the premature termination of calls (i.e., \u201cdropped calls\u201d), and  the inability to use their wireless phone because of service interruption by  wireless phone service providers. Specifically, of the more than 14,000 call  quality complaints FCC received during this period, more than 7,300 were  about the quality of wireless phone service in the local service area. FCC   also received more than 3,200 complaints about dropped calls and more  than 2,000 complaints about interruption of service by wireless service  providers.", "Contract early termination: This category includes termination of  wireless phone service by the consumer or by the carrier. Nearly 12,000, or  just under 90 percent, of all terms-of-service contract complaints FCC  received were about termination by consumers prior to the end of a  specified contract term, which would result in an early termination fee.", "Customer service: Customer service complaints were the fourth largest  category of complaints; however, FCC did not report customer service  complaints as a top category of complaints in its quarterly reports from  2004 through 2008. In comparison, FCC identified carrier marketing and  advertising as a top category of complaint in each year from 2004 through  2008, even though there were more customer service complaints in 2005,  2006, and 2007. An FCC official told us they did not include customer  service complaints in the quarterly reports because they fell within the  \u201cother\u201d category, which FCC does not report. FCC also indicated that the  large decrease in the number of customer service complaints from more  than 3,500 in 2007 to fewer than 500 in 2008 was due in part to the agency\u2019s  redesign of its complaint forms, which allows for more accurate coding of  complaints under specific topics rather than placing them in the \u201cservice  treatment\u201d category FCC uses to track customer service issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Industry Actions to Address Wireless Consumer Concerns", "paragraphs": ["The wireless phone service industry has taken some actions to address the  types of consumer concerns we identified.

Section 332(c)(3)(A) of title 47 of the U.S. Code  does not define what constitutes rate and entry regulation or what  comprises other terms and conditions of wireless phone service. This has  left it up to FCC and courts to further define which specific aspects of  service fall within the scope of these respective terms. Recently, two areas  have garnered much attention at FCC and in the courts\u2014the ability of  states to regulate billing line items and the imposition of early termination  fees. However, clarity has not yet been achieved."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Billing Line Items", "paragraphs": ["One area of disagreement is whether billing line items, such as surcharges  and taxes that appear on consumers\u2019 wireless bills, should be considered a  rate or a term and condition of service. In 2005, under its truth-in-billing  proceeding, FCC held that state regulations requiring or prohibiting the  use of line items for wireless carriers constituted rate regulation and  therefore were preempted. In the same proceeding, FCC solicited  comments on the proper boundaries of \u201cother terms and conditions\u201d  within the statute and asked commenters to delineate what they believe  should be the relative roles of FCC and the states in defining carriers\u2019  proper billing practices. The National Association of State Utility  Consumer Advocates challenged FCC\u2019s preemption finding in court, and  the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Eleventh  Circuit) found that FCC had exceeded its authority. Specifically, the court  found that the presentation of a line item on a bill is not a \u201ccharge or  payment\u201d for service, but rather falls within the definition of \u201cother terms  and conditions\u201d that states may regulate.", "Subsequent to the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s ruling, the Western District Court of  Washington rejected the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s analysis and concluded that  FCC did not exceed its statutory authority when it preempted line-item  regulation and that line items are charges. However, the United States  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) reversed the district  court, finding that the Eleventh Circuit decision is binding outside of the  Eleventh Circuit. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit stated that it agreed with  the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s determination that how line items are displayed or  presented on wireless consumers\u2019 bills does not fall within the definition  of \u201crates.\u201d", "FCC has not responded to these court decisions, nor has FCC concluded  its truth-in-billing proceeding. While FCC has received comments on its  2005 truth-in-billing proposal, it has taken no further action in this  proceeding. Accordingly, the issue of how states may regulate billing line  items remains unclear. In August 2009, as part of its effort to seek  comment on a number of telecommunications consumer issues, FCC  sought comment on the effectiveness of its truth-in-billing rules and  whether changes in these rules are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Termination Fees", "paragraphs": ["Early termination fees are another area where the distinction between  \u201crates\u201d and \u201cterms and conditions\u201d is not clear. Wireless carriers routinely  offer customers discounts on cell phones in exchange for the customer\u2019s  commitment to a 1- or 2-year contract. If the contract is canceled before  the end of the contract term, the customer is generally charged a fee,  commonly referred to as an early termination fee.", "The Western District Court of Washington, in recently considering an early  termination fees case, noted that it is not clear whether a wireless service  carrier\u2019s early termination fees are within the preemptive scope of \u201crates  charged\u201d under the statute. The court noted that federal courts that have  considered the matter appear to be split on the issue, citing the examples  of a district court that found early termination fees to fall under \u201cterms  and conditions\u201d and another district court that found them to be \u201crates  charged.\u201d Because of the ongoing FCC efforts in this area, the Western  District Court of Washington halted its proceeding pending a  determination from FCC about this issue.", "In 2005, FCC was drawn into this debate at the request of a South Carolina  court. In February 2005, SunCom, a wireless carrier, at the request of the  court, filed a petition with FCC on whether early termination fees are rates  charged. In May 2005, FCC released a public notice seeking comments on  this matter. Subsequently, the parties to the litigation entered into a  settlement agreement and jointly requested that FCC dismiss the matter  without further review. FCC issued an order terminating the proceeding;  however, the agency noted that it had a similar petition under review that  it intended to address \u201cin the near future.\u201d The similar petition was filed  by CTIA\u2013The Wireless Association in March 2005, asking for an  \u201cexpedited\u201d ruling on whether early termination fees are rates. FCC  sought comments on the matter from interested parties, who have  submitted over 37,000 filings in this proceeding.", "In view of the growing concern over early termination fees and the  number of complaints that FCC receives from consumers on this issue,  FCC held a hearing in June 2008. At this hearing, expert panelists testified  on the use of early termination fees by communications service providers.  A year after the hearing, CTIA\u2013The Wireless Association notified FCC that  it was withdrawing its petition, citing the evolution of the competitive  wireless marketplace as a reason for its withdrawal. However, the  National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, the National  Consumer Law Center, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and  Consumers Union filed a joint response in opposition to the petition\u2019s  withdrawal, arguing that a ruling from FCC would help clarify this issue  and help resolve some pending lawsuits about it.
