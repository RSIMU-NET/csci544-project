Leaks from these sites, such as one near Los Angeles that led to the temporary relocation of about 8,000 families in 2015, can result in environmental and economic damage. Until 2016, states set standards for 211 sites, but there were no standards for 204 sites connected to interstate pipelines subject to federal jurisdiction.

Under the interim standards, site operators are to follow industry-developed best practices to detect and prevent leaks and plan for emergencies, among other things. Since the interim rule went into effect in January 2017, the minimum safety standards apply to all 415 natural gas storage sites, and the rule will be subject to further revision before it is final.", "To enforce its safety standards, PHMSA has taken steps to establish a natural gas storage safety enforcement program. For example, PHMSA has started developing a training program for its inspectors. PHMSA also has identified a strategic goal for its program\u2014to promote continuous improvement in safety performance\u2014and is developing a performance goal for its training program.", "However, PHMSA has not yet followed certain leading strategic planning practices. For example, PHMSA has not yet defined the level of performance to be achieved, fully addressed all core program activities, or used baseline data to develop its performance goal. GAO has previously reported that requirements under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and GPRA Modernization Act of 2010\u2014which include establishing performance goals to define the level of performance\u2014can serve as leading practices for lower levels of an agency, such as PHMSA. GAO also has found that successful performance goals address all core program activities. PHMSA's goal focuses on training and does not address other core program activities, such as conducting effective inspections. For example, a goal to evaluate whether PHMSA's inspections are effective could be to annually reduce, by a certain percentage, the number of sites not meeting minimum standards. PHMSA officials told GAO that they will strive to add and refine performance goals as the program evolves. As they do so, ensuring that these goals define the level of performance, address all core program activities, and use baseline data could help PHMSA better track progress toward its strategic goal."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, which are that PHMSA (1) define levels of performance and address all core program activities and (2) use budget data to refine performance goals for its gas storage program.

There are 415 active natural gas storage sites  located in 31 states. These sites store natural gas in underground  geologic formations such as caverns, depleted aquifers, and depleted oil  and gas reservoirs.", "Major leaks from these sites can result in serious economic disruption  and environmental damage. Natural gas leaks can cause explosions or  fires and, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  natural gas is considered to be a significant greenhouse gas which, if  released, can pose significant environmental harm. One such leak  occurred in 2015 at the Aliso Canyon Underground Storage Facility near  the neighborhood of Porter Ranch in suburban Los Angeles, California.  This leak released 5.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas into the atmosphere  over the course of almost 4 months, which caused the temporary  relocation of more than 8,000 families. In addition, the accident disrupted  the ability of the Aliso Canyon site to deliver stored gas to electrical power  plants, which in turn posed risks to the stability of California\u2019s electrical  grid. Like the Aliso Canyon facility, many of the nation\u2019s natural gas  storage sites are located within 3 miles of a city, town, or other populated  area, according to the Department of Energy (DOE).", "Until 2016, states had sole responsibility for overseeing the safety of the  intrastate natural gas storage sites within their states, but states\u2019 safety  standards for these sites varied and applied only to the intrastate sites  that were wholly within their borders. In contrast, interstate natural gas  storage sites were not covered by state regulations. These interstate  sites are subject to state and local permitting and federal licensing  requirements, but they were not regulated for safety. Existing Department of Transportation (DOT) safety regulations, which had been in place for  more than 30 years, applied to conventional surface pipelines and above- ground equipment at all natural gas storage sites. However, these  existing regulations did not apply to the underground portions of the sites,  such as wells, wellbore tubing, and casing. In June 2016, the Protecting  Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2016  directed DOT to develop and issue minimum safety standards for all  natural gas storage sites.

To examine the extent to which PHMSA has  planned strategically to enforce its safety standards for natural gas  storage sites, we examined PHMSA\u2019s policies, guidance, and plans and  interviewed agency officials about their plans for oversight. We compared  PHMSA\u2019s plans with leading practices for strategic planning identified by  our prior work.

Natural gas storage sites provide a way to meet peak energy  needs\u2014such as during a cold spell in the winter or during periods of high  electricity demand in the summer\u2014more quickly than would be possible if  relying solely on pipelines that transport natural gas from distant  production fields. Natural gas storage sites are privately owned and  operated by a variety of companies in the energy industry, including local  utilities, independent companies that store gas for sale at peak times to  other companies, and interstate pipeline companies.", "There are three major types of underground geologic formations where  natural gas storage sites are found: (1) underground salt caverns,  (2) depleted aquifers, and (3) depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The wells  that inject or withdraw natural gas from the underground formations can  extend thousands of feet underground. The 415 natural gas storage sites  in the United States contain about 17,000 wells, ranging from a few wells  per site to over a hundred wells at some larger sites. Figure 1 illustrates  the types of geologic formations where natural gas storage sites are  constructed and operated.", "Natural gas storage sites are found in 31 states across the country,  according to EIA data. Over 300 cities, towns, and other populated areas  are located near a natural gas storage site, according to a DOE analysis.

For example, natural  gas poses the risk of explosion and asphyxiation within enclosed spaces.  In addition, other components of natural gas can cause short-term  neurological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms, according to the  Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. Moreover, if a large  gas storage facility unexpectedly goes offline due to a major leak, it can  disrupt the natural gas supply system, which in turn may affect the flow of  gas to heat homes and businesses or may cause electrical blackouts due  to the loss of fuel for gas-fired electrical generators. According to a DOE  report, the natural gas stored in geologic formations is under high  pressure and may find its way to the surface if underground fissures or  unplugged oil and gas wells allow the geologic formation to be breached.  Leaks can also occur if the wells used to inject and withdraw natural gas  from geologic formations lose integrity due to cracking of cement used to  seal the well or other factors. Older wells used for natural gas storage  were often drilled for other reasons, such as oil and gas production, and  are more likely to have age-related degradation, according to DOE. About  half of the about 17,000 wells that inject and withdraw natural gas from  storage sites are more than 50 years old, and many wells are more than  100 years old, according to DOE. In addition, DOE reported that other  factors may contribute to leaks, such as earthquake activity, nearby  drilling activity, or other mechanical stresses and undetected corrosion  that may not be known by the natural gas storage site operators. Further,  DOE has reported that operators can sustain safety by regularly  maintaining site equipment, monitoring and repairing leaks, keeping  records about the site, and planning for possible emergencies, among  other things.", "Leaks from natural gas storage sites can result in significant and harmful  effects on public health and safety, the environment, and the energy  system. DOE, PHMSA, and others have identified three major leaks from  natural gas storage sites since 2000 that illustrate these potential  negative effects:", "The Aliso Canyon leak, which was detected in October 2015 and  continued for nearly 4 months, focused national attention on natural  gas storage safety. As of August 2017, the cause of the leak had not  been conclusively determined. However, the leak occurred in a well  that, at the time, was about 60 years old, according to DOE. The  operator of the Aliso Canyon site unsuccessfully attempted to stop the  leak several times over the 4-month event and eventually was able to  do so in February 2016 by permanently sealing the well. According to  the private operator, it temporarily relocated about 8,000 neighboring  families until the leak was abated. Also, the leak disrupted the Aliso  Canyon site\u2019s ability to supply natural gas to electricity generating  plants. Because the Aliso Canyon site supplies gas for nearly 10  gigawatts of electricity in the Los Angeles basin, the leak led to  concerns that there may not be enough gas to serve the electricity  needs of the surrounding region during peak times. In July 2017,  California state regulators announced that the operator had conducted  a comprehensive safety review and that the regulators would allow  Aliso Canyon to reopen at a greatly reduced capacity in order to  prevent energy shortages.", "In August 2004, the Moss Bluff natural gas storage site in Liberty  County, Texas, experienced a major leak due to a damaged well. The  leaking gas caught fire and burned for over 6 days, according to DOE  and PHMSA documents. As a result, the gas was released into the  atmosphere as carbon dioxide, which, according to an EPA analysis,  is a less potent greenhouse gas than natural gas, which was released  by the Aliso Canyon leak.", "In January 2001, the Yaggy natural gas storage site leaked through  underground fissures from the site\u2019s salt caverns into the nearby city  of Hutchinson, Kansas, eventually causing an explosion in the city\u2019s  downtown business district, DOE reported.

States were responsible for regulating and  enforcing safety at sites that were located solely within their boundaries  and only linked to pipelines within the state. Agencies representing  26 state governments licensed 211 such sites, which amounted to about  half of the 415 active sites in the United States. Prior to 2017, these state  governments applied various safety standards that addressed  underground conditions, such as the integrity of the geologic formations  that store natural gas, or the construction and maintenance of wells that  inject and withdraw gas. For example, according to a DOE report, some  states\u2019 standards specified how site operators should safely construct the  wells. Other states\u2019 standards specified how wells were to be maintained  during their useful life, or how they were to be safely plugged and  abandoned after their useful life ended.", "Prior to 2017, the remaining 204 interstate natural gas storage sites were  subject solely to federal oversight. However, the federal government had  not issued safety standards for them. The Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) licenses storage sites that serve the interstate  natural gas market\u2014a market regulated by FERC. However, according to  FERC, its licensing process focuses on whether a proposed site serves  an economic need, and it does not review the safety conditions of a site  when reviewing whether to grant a license. In this role, FERC has  licensed 204 sites in 24 states. As part of its mission to ensure the safety  of the interstate natural gas pipeline system\u2014of which natural gas  storage sites are a part\u2014PHMSA had the regulatory authority to issue  and enforce safety standards for interstate natural gas storage sites.  However, PHMSA\u2019s interstate pipeline safety regulations did not extend to  underground natural gas storage facilities, even when connected to  interstate pipelines. Moreover, because interstate sites were under  federal jurisdiction, state safety standards could not be applied to such  sites.", "Other federal agencies had responsibilities that addressed limited aspects  of safety at natural gas storage sites. DOE provided technical assistance  to California during the Aliso Canyon incident, and has researched the  effects of natural gas storage leaks on the reliability of the electricity grid.  The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), within the Department of the  Interior, manages public lands that overlap, either partially or fully, with  33 natural gas storage sites. EPA provides funding and oversight to  help states and local pollution control agencies meet their responsibility to  monitor air quality within their jurisdictions, according to EPA officials.

Consensus standards for the oil and gas industry\u2014including those for  natural gas storage\u2014are issued by various entities, including the  American Petroleum Institute (API). API consensus standards describe  how to safely perform technical procedures, such as drilling wells for oil  and gas production, refining produced natural gas into usable gas for  heating and electricity generation, and conducting \u201cworkover\u201d operations  to refurbish existing wells. API develops its consensus standards  involving industry, manufacturers, engineering firms, the public,  academia, and government, and API\u2019s recommended practices are  frequently adopted by a majority of the industry, according to API and  PHMSA. Following several years of study and discussion by industry  experts and government officials, including participation by PHMSA, API  issued two documents outlining recommended practices for the  development and operations of natural gas storage sites. These  recommended practices describe the procedures for designing, locating,  constructing, and operating natural gas storage sites, and include such  activities as inspecting and testing the wells used to inject and withdraw  gas from natural gas storage sites and monitoring the integrity of the  underground formations where natural gas is stored. The API documents  also recommend that operators prepare for emergencies and train the  personnel who operate the sites.", "Under the PIPES Act, state governments also have a continuing role in  enforcing natural gas storage safety for the sites in their states. The act  allows states to certify with PHMSA that they have adopted state  standards that meet or exceed the federal standards and can enforce  these standards. Once a state certifies that it has met these conditions,  the state is responsible for enforcing safety standards on state-regulated  intrastate natural gas underground storage sites through inspections  conducted by state employees, according to PHMSA officials. In addition,  PHMSA officials told us that they would periodically assess whether  states are meeting these conditions. PHMSA officials told us that PHMSA  will have direct responsibility for inspecting federally-licensed interstate  facilities for the next few years because federal safety standards are still  being established, but officials noted that state inspectors could  eventually seek permission from PHMSA to assume the role of inspecting  interstate natural gas storage sites on behalf of PHMSA in the future.  PHMSA officials also noted that PHMSA does not force states to  participate in their pipeline safety program, and so in cases where a state  chooses not to certify its safety enforcement program, PHMSA has stated  that it will assign its own inspectors and staff to enforce federal natural  gas storage safety standards in that state.

PHMSA had already  advised operators to follow industry-recommended practices published by  API, which develops consensus standards for the oil and gas industry.  Specifically, in February 2016, before the passage of the PIPES Act,  PHMSA issued a bulletin encouraging operators to follow the API  recommended practices to update their safety programs. The API  recommended practices contain many provisions that are mandatory, and  other provisions that are nonmandatory. The interim final rule provides  that the nonmandatory provisions of the recommended practices that are  incorporated by reference in the rule are adopted as mandatory.

The API recommended practices address, among  other things, general operations, monitoring the sites for potential leaks,  and emergency response and preparedness. For new storage sites  starting construction after July 18, 2017, the rule requires operators to  meet all sections of the applicable API recommended practices.", "According to PHMSA officials, PHMSA considered the recommendations  of the task force in developing its minimum safety standards, as required  by the PIPES Act, and continues to do so. PHMSA\u2019s minimum safety  standards addressed certain recommendations made by the task force,  according to an analysis performed by PHMSA. However, PHMSA did not  require operators to implement one key recommendation of the task force  report with its minimum standards, according to PHMSA officials. In  particular, the October 2016 task force report recommended that  operators phase out most storage wells with single-point-of-failure  designs\u2014where the failure of a single component, such as a well casing,  could lead to a large release of gas\u2014by installing multiple points of  control at each well. According to an API official, its recommended  practices do not direct operators to phase out such wells because this  practice may not significantly improve safety in all cases; for example, this  practice may not have prevented the leak at Aliso Canyon. The API  official and PHMSA officials noted that API recommended practices direct  operators to assess the risks at their sites and to take steps to address  these risks. According to PHMSA officials, assessing the risks of a site  could include identifying wells with a single point of failure and developing  steps to mitigate this risk. Mitigating the risk could include installing  multiple points of control for certain wells, among other possible mitigation  steps. Neither PHMSA nor API officials could tell us how many of the  approximately 17,000 wells at the nation\u2019s 415 natural gas storage sites  have single-point-of-failure designs, because this information has not  been centrally gathered to date. However, PHMSA plans to gather  information about how many storage wells have single-point-of-failure  designs by asking operators to provide this information as part of a  required annual report.", "To fund its enforcement of its minimum safety standards, PHMSA also  issued a notice to set the user fees that PHMSA charges operators, as  required by the PIPES Act. In November 2016, PHMSA published a  notice of agency action and request for comment, describing its user fee  structure. PHMSA collected public comments, evaluated them, and  finalized its user fee structure in April 2017. As set forth in this notice,  PHMSA will charge each operator based on the size of the operator\u2019s  storage sites as measured by working gas capacity range. The notice  stated that PHMSA plans to collect a total of up to $8 million annually in  fees from all operators combined; however, PHMSA may seek authority  to increase or decrease the amount it charges operators if it finds that the  cost of inspection and enforcement is more or less than it initially  estimated, according to PHMSA officials. Following enactment of an  appropriations act provision, PHMSA is authorized to use the fees it  collects to fund its enforcement activities and plans to use a portion of the  fees to reimburse states for enforcing its minimum safety standards,  according to PHMSA officials.", "Table 1 provides a timeline of key events in the development of PHMSA\u2019s  minimum safety standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PHMSA Is Considering Comments on Its Interim Final Rule and Plans to Issue Final Safety Standards in January 2018", "paragraphs": ["Since issuing its interim final rule, PHMSA has been collecting public  comments and plans to adjust some aspects of the rule in response to  comments from the public, industry representatives, and others.

PHMSA\u2019s interim final rule states that, with respect to incorporation by  reference of the standards, the nonmandatory provisions it adopted are  adopted as mandatory provisions. API and two other organizations  representing natural gas utilities and transmission companies submitted  comments asking PHMSA to reconsider how it used the API  recommended practices in its minimum safety standards. While API and  the other industry representatives agreed that it was appropriate for  PHMSA to use API recommended practices for its minimum safety  standards, they stated that making all portions mandatory would make the  standards burdensome. In June 2017, PHMSA published a notice in the  Federal Register stating that it would consider these comments as it  finalized its minimum safety standards, which it stated it expects to issue  by January 2018. The notice stated further that PHMSA will not issue any  enforcement citations to operators for failure to meet any standards that  were nonmandatory but that were converted to mandatory by provisions  of the interim final rule until 1 year after it issues the final rule.", "PHMSA also provided additional guidance and clarifications to operators  about scheduling and its plans for enforcement.

They have identified learning objectives for the program and have begun  developing learning materials. According to PHMSA officials, developing  a training program for inspectors is central to safety enforcement efforts,  in part because PHMSA has a limited number of staff members with  expertise in natural gas storage. For example, PHMSA had 10 employees  with natural gas storage experience as of August 2017, according to  PHMSA officials. In addition, PHMSA officials have completed eight  safety assessments of selected natural gas storage operators to  document the initial condition of gas storage sites and safety practices.  According to PHMSA officials, their methodology for conducting these  assessments involved visiting a cross section of operators, including  operators of interstate and intrastate sites and multiple types of facilities.", "PHMSA officials also have developed workload and budget estimates for  their new program, according to PHMSA documentation. In recent years,  the Office of Pipeline Safety, which will be responsible for natural gas  storage inspections in addition to pipeline inspections and other activities,  has initiated about 1,100 inspections annually, according to PHMSA data.  When natural gas storage site inspections begin, PHMSA officials  estimate that the Office of Pipeline Safety\u2019s inspection workload could  increase 14 percent due to their new responsibilities. They reached this  estimate by dividing the 203 new natural gas storage units they anticipate  needing to inspect by the total number of inspection units they currently  inspect. To meet the demands of this increased workload, officials  estimate that PHMSA will need $2 million annually to fund 6 new  inspector positions, training, travel, and other expenses associated with  managing the natural gas storage safety enforcement program. With this  number of inspectors, PHMSA officials believe that they can inspect all  203 natural gas storage units within about 4 years. Because PHMSA  officials expect that many states that have previously conducted similar  inspections will help PHMSA conduct inspections, officials also estimate  that PHMSA will need to provide $6 million annually to states. However,  PHMSA officials noted that their estimates may change as they gain  additional information about the program. Specifically, after PHMSA  begins initial inspections in early 2018, officials will have more information  about the time it takes to inspect natural gas storage sites.

As of June 2017, PHMSA officials expected all states with intrastate  natural gas storage sites to pursue certification. However, officials  explained that they may not know until the end of fiscal year 2017 exactly  how many states will pursue certification. If some states choose not to  pursue certification or are not approved by PHMSA, PHMSA will be  responsible for inspecting natural gas storage sites in those states, which  could increase its inspection workload beyond the level it has estimated.  For states that choose certification and are approved, PHMSA plans to  use grants to fund up to 80 percent of state inspection costs. However,  PHMSA officials told us that PHMSA may not be able to fund states to  this level, depending on the approved costs requested by all states and  levels of funding PHMSA receives through the appropriations process. In  either circumstance, PHMSA\u2019s grant program for certified state partners  leverages state dollars, since it requires states to fund the portions of their  programs not covered by grant funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PHMSA Has Established a Strategic Goal but Has Not Yet Followed Certain Leading Practices of Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["PHMSA also has established a strategic goal for its natural gas safety  enforcement program, but it has not yet followed other leading practices  for strategic planning.

PHMSA officials also told us that they are developing a  performance goal for their training program and that other performance  goals are still being identified and developed. The Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as amended\u2014which  seeks to improve the effectiveness of federal programs by establishing a  system for agencies to set goals for program performance and measure  results\u2014defines a performance goal as the target level of performance  expressed as a tangible, measurable objective against which actual  achievement is to be compared. For example, in the area of weather  forecasting, we have previously reported that such a goal could be to  increase the lead time for predicting tornadoes from 7 to 9 minutes.", "PHMSA has not yet followed certain leading practices for strategic  planning, as it has not: (1) defined the level of performance or fully  addressed core program activities with its existing performance goal; or  (2) used baseline data and other data or budget information to inform and  refine performance goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defining Level of Performance and Addressing All Core Program Activities", "paragraphs": ["Our prior work has identified several leading practices for strategic  planning that PHMSA has not yet followed, such as setting goals that  define a certain level of performance and address all core program  activities. Some of this prior work has examined requirements under  GPRA and the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. GPRA, which was  significantly enhanced by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, requires  agencies to develop annual performance plans that, among other things,  establish performance goals to define the level of performance to be  achieved. We have previously reported that requirements under these  acts can serve as leading practices for planning at lower levels of the  agency. As one of several operating administrations within DOT,  PHMSA would be considered a lower level of the agency. In addition, we  have found that a key attribute of successful performance measures is  that they reflect the full range of core program activities.

For example, PHMSA has developed a performance goal for its training program, and agency officials told us that they plan to review the  number of students who pass their gas storage training course as a  measure of the agency\u2019s training performance goal. However, with this  measure PHMSA has not defined the level of performance to be  achieved. An example of a measure of the agency\u2019s training performance  goal that defines the level of performance could be one that specifies that  a certain percentage of students will pass the course on their first attempt.  In addition, PHMSA has not yet developed performance goals for other  core program activities, such as conducting effective inspections.  According to PHMSA subject-matter experts, one of the critical tasks  associated with inspecting a gas storage site will be determining whether  the operator has met all well monitoring requirements specified in API\u2019s  Recommended Practice 1171, which addresses the functional integrity of  gas storage in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and aquifers. An  example of a performance goal that could indicate whether PHMSA\u2019s  inspections are effective could be to annually reduce, by a certain  percentage, the number of operators that do not meet the well monitoring  requirements of Recommended Practice 1171. Another critical task  identified by PHMSA\u2019s subject-matter experts will be to determine  whether the operator has followed its own risk management plan for gas  storage sites\u2014another area where PHMSA has not developed a  performance goal.

As they do so, ensuring that their performance goals define the  level of performance to be achieved and address core program activities  could help them ensure that they effectively track progress toward their  strategic goal and make adjustments to activities and resources, if  needed, to better meet the goal. In addition, because PHMSA plans to  leverage state resources to oversee gas storage sites, the success of its  gas storage program will depend, in part, on collaboration with state  partners.

We have previously reported that baseline and trend data can  provide a context for drawing conclusions about whether performance  goals are reasonable and appropriate. For example, we found in 1999  that the Department of Education was able to use such information to  gauge the appropriateness of its goals for reducing the default rate on  student loans provided through the Federal Family Education Loan  program. The program\u2019s annual plan provided baseline and trend data  for the default rate, which indicated that the rate declined from 22.4  percent to 10.4 percent from fiscal years 1990 to 1995. According to  Education\u2019s analysis of the data, future declines were likely to be steady  but smaller because of the large number of high-default schools that had  already been eliminated from the program.

For example, officials told us that,  over time, they will have access to data about operators\u2019 facilities,  functional integrity work, and operations and maintenance procedures  starting in early 2018. These data will likely include the number of wells  that have leaked and been repaired during the last calendar year. As  specified in PHMSA\u2019s minimum safety standards, PHMSA also plans to  collect safety and incident reports to track gas releases, deaths, and  injuries resulting in hospitalizations. In addition, in August of 2017,  PHMSA officials completed eight industry safety assessments, which  involved visiting natural gas storage sites and studying sites\u2019 safety  procedures. As previously mentioned, these assessments aimed, in part,  to document the initial condition of gas storage sites and safety practices.  Agency officials told us that they had planned to use the data they collect  from these assessments to inform the agency\u2019s state certification and  inspection programs.
