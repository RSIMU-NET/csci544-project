Key to these programs are security threat assessments that screen individuals for links to terrorism, criminal history, and immigration status. TSA's Adjudication Center serves as the primary operational component in this process. GAO was asked to examine the performance and staffing strategy of the center. This report addresses the extent to which 1) TSA has measured performance for the center and what the data show; 2) TSA offices have coordinated to meet security threat assessment workload; and 3) TSA addressed potential risks posed by using a mix of government employees and contractors to adjudicate security threat assessments. GAO analyzed TSA data describing the center's performance since October 2010; reviewed documentation, including staffing plans; and interviewed TSA officials about data measurement and staffing practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Adjudication Center performance data show mixed results, and the center's performance measurement practices have limitations. The Adjudication Center relies on contractors to adjudicate security threat assessments and uses three primary measures to evaluate their performance--timeliness for completing adjudication, adjudication accuracy, and caseload status. GAO found that the Adjudication Center contractor met its timeliness and accuracy measures, but faced challenges in meeting its caseload measure. The Adjudication Center's timeliness and accuracy measures did not capture key data. According to TSA officials, the Adjudication Center's accuracy rate is based on a review of all cases where adjudicators had disqualified an applicant. However, this calculation generally does not include the accuracy rate for those applicants adjudicators had approved--which account for roughly 90 percent of the Adjudication Center's caseload. In this way, the accuracy rate provides a limited assessment of adjudicator performance. By developing an accuracy rate that includes data on both incorrectly disqualified and incorrectly approved applicants, TSA can better identify and addresses performance issues among its workforce.", "Two TSA offices that share responsibility for implementing security threat assessments--the Program Management Division in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis and the Adjudication Center in the Office of Law Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service--can improve coordination on workforce planning. While the offices share information on workload completion, they do not have a process in place to ensure that information in the Adjudication Center's staffing plan--which the Adjudication Center periodically updates to reflect caseload projections and associated staffing needs--reflects the mutual understanding of both offices. For example, program managers in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis reported to GAO that they were unfamiliar with the staffing plan and they disagreed with workload projections in the plan. Establishing a mechanism for the offices to share and reconcile information in the plan can help better support the Adjudication Center's workforce planning.", "TSA has been delayed in addressing risks posed by using contractors to adjudicate security threat assessments. In October 2011 TSA's Balanced Workforce Strategy Working Group completed its assessment for the Adjudication Center and determined that an excessive risk exists by allowing contractors to make security threat assessment approvals without sufficient federal oversight. The Working Group recommended that TSA convert to an all government workforce. According to a May 2012 implementation plan, TSA planned to convert this workforce by the end of calendar year 2013. However, delays have rendered the timelines and cost information in its plan outdated and TSA has not updated the plan or determined a revised implementation schedule. Completing this review and updating the plan would help TSA and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) decision makers by providing a roadmap for moving forward. Finally, providing this plan to DHS for review will be important to help ensure TSA can begin its conversion and mitigate identified risks of using contract adjudicators to conduct security threat assessments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA, among other things: direct the Adjudication Center to calculate an accuracy rate that includes adjudicator performance for cases where applicants were both approved and disqualified; share adjudicator staffing plans among key program offices; and update its Adjudication Center workforce conversion plan and provide it to DHS for review and approval. DHS concurred with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s transportation systems and facilities requires  balancing security to address potential threats while facilitating the  legitimate flow of people and goods that are critical to the U.S. economy  and international commerce. Within the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is responsible for  managing vetting and credentialing programs to ensure that individuals  that transport hazardous materials or have unescorted access to secure  or restricted areas of transportation facilities at maritime ports and TSA- regulated airports do not pose a security threat. Key to these programs  are background checks\u2014known as security threat assessments\u2014which  are TSA reviews of applicant information and searches of government  databases to determine whether the applicant has known ties to terrorism  and whether the applicant may be otherwise precluded from obtaining an  endorsement, credential, access and/or privilege (hereafter called a  credential) based on, among other factors, their immigration status and  criminal history.", "Multiple TSA offices coordinate in implementing security threat  assessments, with TSA\u2019s Adjudication Center serving as the primary  operational component by reviewing derogatory applicant background  information to determine if applicants are eligible to obtain credentials for  12 TSA programs, including the Transportation Worker Identification  Credential (TWIC) program for maritime workers, Hazardous Materials  Endorsement (HME) program for commercially licensed drivers, and the  Aviation Worker program. These efforts are intended to reduce the  probability of a successful terrorist or other criminal attack on the nation\u2019s  transportation systems, which include approximately 360 seaports and  450 TSA-regulated airports.", "As we have previously reported, TSA\u2019s Adjudication Center has faced  recurring challenges in meeting its security threat assessment  performance requirements and has attributed these challenges in part to  its reliance on a contractor workforce. For example, in December 2011,  we reported that insufficient federal staffing had hampered the  Adjudication Center\u2019s ability to meet its workload requirements and  ensure necessary oversight of the credential decision-making process. In  particular, TSA attributed Adjudication Center backlogs to turnover among  its contractor workforce. At the time, TSA reported that it had initiated but  not yet completed an assessment through the DHS Balanced Workforce  Strategy (BWS) to determine if (1) the Adjudication Center\u2019s reliance on  a largely contractor workforce to conduct security threat assessment  adjudication was appropriate, or if the work is an inherently governmental  function requiring a government workforce and (2) if there would be a  cost savings resulting from conversion of the contract positions to  government personnel positions. According to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, inherently governmental functions include activities that  require either the exercise of discretion in applying government authority,  or value judgments in making decisions for the government, and therefore  should be performed by government employees, not contractors. Further,  federal procurement policy explains that a function is not appropriately  performed by a contractor where the contractor\u2019s involvement is or would  be so extensive, or the contractor\u2019s work product so close to a final  agency product, as to effectively preempt the federal officials\u2019 decision- making process, discretion or authority. Thus, determining whether TSA  is using an appropriate Adjudication Center workforce, and addressing  the potential risks associated with its use of contractors, is important for  TSA to ensure it effectively implements security threat assessments.", "You requested that we review the performance and staffing capacity of  the Adjudication Center. This report addresses the following questions:", "To what extent has TSA measured performance for the Adjudication  Center, and what do these data show?", "To what extent have TSA offices coordinated to ensure that the  Adjudication Center effectively meets an evolving security threat  assessment workload?", "To what extent has TSA addressed potential risks posed by using a  mix of government employees and contractors to adjudicate security  threat assessments?", "To determine the extent to which TSA has measured performance for the  Adjudication Center, and what these data show, we focused our review  on Adjudication Center performance in processing cases for the TWIC,  HME, and Aviation Worker programs. We selected and obtained  Adjudication Center performance in processing cases for these three  programs because TSA reported these programs accounted for  approximately 95 percent of its security threat assessment caseload.  Therefore, we considered Adjudication Center performance in processing  the caseload for these three programs to generally reflect the  performance of the Adjudication Center as a whole. We analyzed  pertinent laws and regulations related to TSA\u2019s security threat  assessments and program requirements for the TWIC, HME, and Aviation  Worker programs, including provisions enacted through the Uniting and  Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to  Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001, the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act, and the Maritime  Transportation Security Act (MTSA) of 2002. We also reviewed TSA  program documentation that included performance standards and  requirements for the Adjudication Center and its contractor, such as  Standard Operating Procedures for Case Management and contract  documentation which included performance standards and requirements  for the Adjudication Center and its contractor, such as the Adjudication  Center\u2019s Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and Evaluation and  Performance Reports. Through our review, we determined TSA used  three key performance metrics to measure the performance of the  Adjudication Center in processing security threat assessments: (1)  timeliness for completing initial adjudication of a case, (2) caseload size,  and (3) adjudication accuracy. We obtained and analyzed performance  data for these programs and measures for the period of October 2010  through January 2013 because this time period covers the operations of  the Adjudication Center\u2019s current contractor. We assessed the reliability  of these data by reviewing TSA\u2019s data management practices and  questioning knowledgeable officials about the data and the systems that  produced the data. On the basis of our assessments, we determined that  some of the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report,  but that other data were not. In particular, we found that TSA\u2019s Aviation  Worker caseload size data had been unreliable since April 2012\u2014so as  we describe later in this report, we did not include data after that time in  our analysis. We evaluated Adjudication Center performance  measurement practices against criteria outlined in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. Finally, we interviewed officials from  various TSA offices with responsibilities for implementing aspects of  security threat assessments or measuring performance of the  Adjudication Center. These included officials from the Office of Law  Enforcement/Federal Air Marshal Service (OLE/FAMS) Adjudication  Center and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA), including the (1)  Technology Infrastructure Modernization (TIM) program, (2) Program  Management Division which is responsible for managing TSA\u2019s maritime,  surface, and aviation credentialing programs, which include the TWIC,  HME, and Aviation Worker programs, and (3) Office of Technology, which  is responsible for managing TSA\u2019s case management systems. In  addition, we interviewed officials with the American Association of Airport  Executives, to obtain information about their role as a vendor in TSA\u2019s  Designated Aviation Channeler program, which TSA uses to transmit  Aviation Worker case information with TSA-regulated airport authorities.", "To determine the extent to which TSA offices have coordinated to ensure  that the Adjudication Center meets evolving security threat assessment  workload demand, we reviewed and compared staffing related  information in TSA documents, including the Adjudication Center\u2019s  October 2012 staffing plan which details staffing levels and workload  projections for current and future year needs, as well as Adjudication  Center workload and performance reports and project management  reports. We interviewed TSA officials, including OIA officials responsible  for implementing maritime, surface, and aviation security programs and,  OLE/FAMS Adjudication Center officials responsible for workforce  planning and operations at the Adjudication Center.

We analyzed DHS  BWS guidance detailing the roles and responsibilities of the DHS BWS  Program Management Office (BW PMO) and department components for  implementing the BWS, and compared TSA actions against this  guidance. We also interviewed DHS and TSA officials responsible for  implementing the BWS, including officials from the DHS Office of the  Chief Human Capital Officer, and the Executive Director and staff of the  DHS BWPMO, which is responsible for developing, implementing, and  overseeing department implementation of the BWS. We also interviewed  TSA officials responsible for implementing the BWS for the Adjudication  Center, including officials from the Office of Acquisition, which serves as  the lead for the effort, the Office of Human Capital, the Office of the Chief  Counsel, and from OLE/FAMS, the Business Management Office and the  Adjudication Center.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2012 to July 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Security threat  assessments are designed to ensure that only eligible individuals are  granted TSA-related credentials, such as a TWIC. Specifically, security  threat assessments focus on identifying threats posed by individuals  seeking to obtain an endorsement, credential, access, and/or privilege  for, among other purposes, unescorted access to secure or restricted  areas of transportation facilities at maritime ports and TSA-regulated  airports, and for commercial drivers transporting hazardous materials.  Implementing these programs is a shared responsibility among multiple  TSA offices, including the OIA Program Management Division which  manages the programs, and the Adjudication Center within OLE/FAMS,  which serves as the primary operational component for conducting  security threat assessments for 12 of TSA\u2019s 17 aviation, maritime, and  surface transportation credentialing programs\u2014with the TWIC, HME and  Aviation Worker programs accounting for a reported 95 percent of the  Adjudication Center\u2019s workload.

Among the checks  conducted by TSA, one is against criminal history records maintained  by or available through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  These records contain information from federal, state and local  sources in the FBI\u2019s National Crime Information Center database and  the FBI\u2019s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification  System/Interstate Identification Index, which maintain criminal records  and related fingerprint submissions. A check is also conducted  against the Terrorist Screening Database, which is the federal  government\u2019s consolidated terrorist watchlist and from which the  Selectee and No-Fly lists, among others, are compiled. To  determine an applicant\u2019s immigration/citizenship status, applicant  information is checked against the Systematic Alien Verification for  Entitlements system. If the applicant is a U.S.-born citizen with no  related derogatory information, the system can approve the  individual\u2019s application for a credential with no further review of the  applicant or human intervention.", "Adjudication Center review: A manual, second level review is  conducted as part of an individual\u2019s security threat assessment if (1)  the automated vetting uncovers any derogatory information, such as a  criminal offense or (2) the applicant has identified himself or herself  to be a non-U.S.-born citizen or national. As such, not all applicants  will be subjected to a second-level review. The Adjudication Center  plays an integral role in the security threat assessment process by  adjudicating cases for which an initial automated check finds potential  links to criminal history or immigration eligibility issues. Adjudication  Center staff review the program applicant\u2019s enrollment file to  determine if derogatory or other information may be potentially  disqualifying. The applicant\u2019s files are processed from credentialing  program enrollment centers through two-web enabled case  management systems, called the Screening Gateway and  Consolidated Screening Gateway. Adjudication Center staff use the  Screening Gateways as their tool for gathering, viewing, and  synthesizing the information needed to conduct security threat  assessments.", "Since its establishment in 2005, the Adjudication Center has relied  primarily upon contractor staff to complete its security threat assessment  workload, and a smaller number of federal government staff to conduct  oversight and other functions. Contractor staff performs initial  adjudication of cases, and may either approve applications if they  determine an applicant is eligible to obtain a credential or refer the  application to a federal (that is, TSA) adjudicator for further review if they  determine the applicant to be ineligible. Federal staff review cases of  potential ineligibility, issue Preliminary Determination of Ineligibility letters  to applicants, and conduct redress actions, among other things.

While contractors, when properly used, can play an important role in  helping agencies accomplish their missions, our prior work has shown  that agencies face challenges with increased reliance on contractors to  perform core agency missions. Consistent with Office of Management  and Budget procurement policy, agencies should provide a greater  degree of scrutiny when contracting for professional and management  support, program evaluation, and other services that can affect the  government\u2019s decision-making authority\u2014functions that may be  considered as being closely associated with inherently governmental  functions. Contractors can provide services that closely support  inherently governmental functions, but agencies must provide greater  scrutiny and enhanced management oversight to ensure that the  contractors\u2019 work does not limit the authority, accountability, and  responsibilities of government employees.", "The DHS BWS refers to the department\u2019s effort to identify the appropriate  balance of federal and contractor employees required to support critical  agency functions. Consistent with our recommendations and in  accordance with the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 DHS adopted  the BWS in August 2010 to undertake risk analyses that are to enable the  department to achieve the appropriate mix of Federal employees and  contractors to accomplish its mission while minimizing mission risk that  may result from an over-reliance on contractors. DHS uses an  automated tool to help components\u2014such as TSA\u2014perform the  necessary analysis to categorize work as appropriate for use of a  contractor, inherently governmental, or closely associated with an  inherently governmental function. The assessment tool is intended to  facilitate an assessment of mission risk, level of contractor oversight  needed, risk mitigation strategies, and cost analysis. Based on  component responses, the tool is to provide a recommended sourcing  decision on whether the work is appropriate for federal or contractor  performance, or both. For example, should the BWS assessment find that  a function is inherently governmental, the component would recommend  the function be insourced to government employees, whereas a  determination that the function was closely associated with an inherently  governmental function would require the agency to either insource the  function (also known as federalizing), or strengthen oversight of the  contractor workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjudication Center Contractor Related Performance Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In December 2011, we reported that the Adjudication Center had faced  recurring challenges in meeting its security threat assessment workload  requirements and largely attributed these challenges to its reliance on a  contractor workforce.

Officials at the time reported  that the challenge was that the Adjudication Center had used three  different contractors since establishing the Adjudication Center in 2005,  and on each occasion the contract adjudicator turnover had led to  backlogs as adjudicators were hired and trained. TSA reported that it did  not consider the risks of acquiring contractor support services to provide  adjudication services before awarding its first contract in 2005. Rather,  TSA reported that it chose to use contract adjudicators when the  Adjudication Center was created because, at the time, it considered them  to be the most readily available workforce and effective way to augment  federal staff with skilled resources. TSA reported that the agency had  initiated an assessment in March 2011 through the DHS BWS process to  determine whether the adjudication functions were appropriate to be  performed by a contractor workforce, whether the work was inherently  governmental and whether there would be cost savings resulting from  conversion of the contract positions to government positions. We  recommended TSA develop a workforce staffing plan with timelines  articulating how the Adjudication Center will effectively and efficiently  meet its current and emerging workload requirements, and incorporate  the results of TSA\u2019s study examining the appropriateness and costs and  benefits of using contractors.

The Adjudication Center contractor met timeliness standards  for completing initial adjudication of its TWIC, HME, and Aviation Worker  caseloads (see figure 1 for a description of this process).

For example, as specified in statute, TSA shall review an  initial TWIC application and provide a response to the applicant, as  appropriate, within 30 days of receiving the initial application. Moreover,  officials with the OIA Program Management Division and Adjudication  Center reported that TSA had established internal requirements for the  agency to meet 30 day and 14 day applicant response times for HME and  Aviation Worker applicants. Officials from the OIA Program Management  Division reported tracking this measure through weekly Adjudication  Center performance reports and identifying and addressing those cases  that do not meet applicant response time standards. However, officials  reported that they did not maintain documentation showing the extent to  which TSA had responded to applicants within their applicant response  timeframe requirements. Officials reported that maintaining such  performance data would be of use, but noted it was rare that they did not  meet their initial adjudication standards and respond to applicants on or  within established applicant response time requirements. Officials noted  that functional limitations in TSA\u2019s Screening Gateway reporting system  limits their ability to efficiently run reports showing the extent to which  TSA responds to applicants within required timeframes. A senior OIA  Program Management Division official reported it was her understanding  that the division would have to obtain the capability to automatically run  applicant response time reports from TSA\u2019s Technology Infrastructure  Modernization program, known as TIM. However, we reviewed TIM  program documentation and did not find this data management capability  requirement in TIM planning documents. We raised this issue with TSA  TIM program officials, and in response to our inquiry, in May 2013, the  TIM program added documentation of this requirement to its plans and  reported that the capability would be available to the Adjudication Center  beginning in March 2014 for TWIC program cases, and by 2016 for  surface and aviation program cases.", "Caseload size. The Adjudication Center generally did not meet its  contract caseload performance standards and experienced backlogs for  its TWIC and HME program caseloads the majority of the time between  October 2010 and January 2013. According to TSA contractor evaluation  and performance reports, the Adjudication Center requires its contract  workforce to maintain a total number of new TWIC, HME, and Aviation  Workers cases at or below 1,500 cases\u2014and Adjudication Center  officials told us that a caseload above this threshold was considered a  backlog. Adjudication Center data we reviewed for the period of October  2010 through January 2013 showed that the Adjudication Center had a  backlog of HME cases approximately 60 percent of the time and TWIC  cases approximately 61 percent of the time. In addition, the Adjudication  Center had a backlog of Aviation Worker cases approximately 15 percent  of the time from October 2010 through March 2012. Moreover, many of  these backlogs were far higher than the Adjudication Center\u2019s 1,500  caseload standard. For example, the Adjudication Center had a backlog  of more than 4,000 HME cases roughly 16 percent of the time (20 of 122  weeks) during this period. Figure 2 shows Adjudication Center caseload  levels for TWIC, HME, and Aviation Worker cases from October 2010  through January 2013.", "According to Adjudication Center officials and TSA documentation we  reviewed, technical issues and a lack of sufficiently trained contract  adjudicators contributed to the workload backlogs at the Adjudication  Center. First, the Adjudication Center operations manager reported that  technical problems with its case reporting systems had contributed to  both challenges in assessing workload backlogs and, in some cases,  growth in the backlog itself. For example, the Screening Gateway  systems, which the Adjudication Center relies on for processing applicant  cases and communicating results to TSA enrollment centers, has  experienced periodic technical errors that have delayed the Adjudication  Center\u2019s ability to process new cases. According to TSA evaluation and  performance reports we reviewed, between February 2012 and August  2012, TSA was unable to evaluate contractor performance in meeting its  workload on several occasions, including approximately 3 months,  because of technical problems with its case management systems.  Adjudication Center officials reported that TSA\u2019s Office of Technology  was pursuing a solution to the technical errors with a solution expected by  May 2012; however, as of May 2013 this had not been corrected. They  also reported that TSA plans to replace this system with a more functional  system through its TIM program, but as noted earlier, according to TSA\u2019s  schedule for the program and TSA officials, this system is not scheduled  to be fully operational until 2016. In addition, since April 2012 TSA has  experienced technical problems related to the Designated Aviation  Channeler program that TSA uses to process Aviation Worker program  cases into the Screening Gateway systems. According to TSA officials,  technical problems with one of its vendors were delaying processing of  cases and returning previously adjudicated cases into the Adjudication  Center\u2019s new caseload queue and not distinguishing between the two  sets of cases. This was delaying processing time and Adjudication Center  management was unable to determine the true extent of its new  caseload. TSA officials responsible for managing the Designated Aviation  Channeler program reported that they had been in discussions with the  vendor since April 2012 to address the technical processing issues, and  as of May 2013, the vendor was in the process of implementing corrective  actions.", "Another factor contributing to growth in the workload backlog according to  TSA Adjudication Center management officials and a contractor  performance report we reviewed has been the lack of trained adjudicators  provided by the contractor. According to a senior Adjudication Center  official, the contractor lacked a sufficient number of staff who had been  certified as self approvers, and this had required the Center\u2019s limited  federal staff to assume additional responsibilities and reduced the  Center\u2019s progress in meeting its caseload. Adjudication Center officials  reported that they were working with the contractor to address this issue.

According to Adjudication Center data, from August 2011 to December  2012, the Adjudication Center\u2019s contract workforce met TSA\u2019s accuracy  standard for the TWIC, HME, and Aviation Worker programs. However,  the accuracy rate is not a complete representation of Adjudicator contract  accuracy because it does not include evaluation of a key population of  cases. According to Adjudication Center officials, the Adjudication  Center\u2019s average accuracy rate is generally based on error rates  identified from a daily review of all cases where adjudicators found an  applicant was disqualified, but reviewers found an applicant should not  have been (i.e., incorrectly disqualified). However, according to officials,  this calculation generally does not include those cases where  adjudicators had approved applicants, but reviewers found they should  have been disqualified (i.e., incorrectly approved). For example,  according to our analysis of TSA data, approvals comprised over 90  percent of the Adjudication Center\u2019s TWIC and HME caseload from  August 2011 to January 2013\u2014and TSA reviewed roughly 7 percent of  these approvals. In this way, the average accuracy rate TSA uses to  evaluate the performance of its contractor is incomplete and limited  because it does not include the extent contract adjudicators incorrectly  approved applicants.", "The Adjudication Center official responsible for reporting the accuracy  rate told us that the accuracy rate of the contract workforce includes only  those cases that were incorrectly found to have disqualifying factors  because that is how the contract evaluation standards were established.  The official noted that the Adjudication Center processes included a  review of all trainee adjudicators approved cases and a separate quality  assurance review process to spot check approved cases to identify  errors among all adjudicators who are certified to approve cases without  further review. However, the official reported that these performance  measurement practices were not documented and that a lack of staffing  capacity had limited the extent to which the Adjudication Center  conducted the quality assurance spot checks\u2014with the Center meeting  only about two-thirds of its 10 percent goal for the number of cases  selected for spot checking. Nonetheless, the results of this quality  assurance review are not factored into the rate TSA uses to measure  contractor accuracy performance and award funds to its contractor.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government specifies the  need to comprehensively identify risks and consider all significant  interactions. Once risks have been identified, they should be analyzed for  possible effect. Moreover, internal control and all transactions and other  significant events need to be clearly documented, and the documentation  should be readily available for review. The overall accuracy rate  calculated by the Adjudication Center is generally limited to incorrectly  disqualified cases and does not include incorrectly approved cases. In  this way, TSA does not have a representative assessment of the  Adjudication Center\u2019s average accuracy rate. If error rates for approved  cases were included in its evaluation, the Adjudication Center\u2019s reported  average accuracy rate may ultimately be higher or lower than it has  reported\u2014but it will remain unclear until the Adjudication Center captures  this information in its accuracy rate. Determining the performance of the  workforce in adjudicating security threat assessments for this population  is important for overseeing adjudicator performance and identifying cases  where the Adjudication Center is incorrectly approving applicants. By  developing and documenting an accuracy rate measure that includes  data on both types of incorrectly adjudicated cases (approved and  disqualified), the Adjudication Center can determine an accuracy rate that  comprehensively captures accuracy performance and enables  Adjudication Center management to more effectively identify and address  performance issues among its workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Adjudication Center\u2019s Manual Performance Management Process is not Documented", "paragraphs": ["Since beginning operations in 2005, Adjudication Center management  officials told us that they have used a complex, manual process to track  the performance data of its contract adjudicator workforce.

As a result, Adjudication Center management has used a cumbersome,  manual process to track case production and performance of its contract  adjudicator workforce. For example, each week, one adjudication center  official is responsible for reviewing contractor reported caseload  information, compiling spreadsheets summarizing contractor  performance, verifying and reconciling the information with the contractor,  and preparing weekly summary reports for distribution to TSA  credentialing program stakeholders. Adjudication Center management  told us that it has used these reports to measure Adjudication Center  performance and support oversight of its contract adjudicator workforce.", "The manual process exists because, according to Adjudication Center  officials, TSA\u2019s Screening Gateway case management systems were not  designed to meet the functional requirements of the Adjudication Center  for tracking contractor operational performance, and TSA has been  unsuccessful to date in developing a technical solution to do so. TSA  officials recognized that the system did not meet the needs of the  Adjudication Center and reported that the agency\u2019s TIM program would  replace the Screening Gateway systems and enable the adjudication  center to automate its case tracking and performance requirements.  However, as noted earlier, TSA officials reported that this new system is  not scheduled to be fully operational until 2016.", "In the meantime, however, Adjudication Center management officials  reported that they had not documented the manual process currently in  use.

According to Adjudication Center officials, time  constraints in meeting the Adjudication Center\u2019s workload of security  threat assessments had been a factor that had prevented the Operations  Manager from updating or developing new documentation of the  procedures in recent years.

According to the  assessment, the adjudicator functions performed by the contractor are  critical to TSA\u2019s accomplishment of the security threat assessment  process to ensure terrorist and other security threats are identified and  prevented from gaining credentialed access to critical U.S. transportation  system infrastructure. The assessment found that TSA was reliant upon  contractors for making decisions regarding criminal history and  immigration status for a majority of applicants and if contractors were to  continue performing the adjudicator function, the government would need  to provide continuous and substantive oversight of them to ensure  successful performance. However, the assessment found that the  Adjudication Center did not have an effective oversight process in place  to do so\u2014noting that the federal government staffing at the Adjudication  Center is not sufficient to adequately oversee contractor case processing  for quality control, as contract staff have independent decision making  ability on the majority of cases. Further, the assessment noted that the  Adjudication Center\u2019s use of a mixed contractor and government  workforce was inefficient. For example, according to the assessment, for  every contractor work hour, a federal government employee must check  that work and this had led federal government staff to work more than  2,500 overtime and compensation hours over the preceding year\u2014an  inefficient and duplicative process that would not be necessary if the  workforce were all federal government officers.", "In light of these factors, in October 2011, TSA\u2019s BWS Departmental  Working Group determined that the adjudicator function was closely  associated with inherently governmental functions and recommended  TSA end the Adjudication Center\u2019s reliance on a contract workforce and  convert to an all federal employee workforce.

However, the Adjudication Center has faced challenges in  fulfilling this role. First, while the Adjudication Center uses three key  measures to evaluate the performance of the Adjudication Center\u2019s  contract workforce, it has not documented its methods and two of its  measures are limited. For example, TSA\u2019s timeliness measure does not  capture the extent to which the agency has communicated its adjudication  decision to the applicant in a timely manner\u2014a key TSA requirement for  its credentialing programs\u2014and TSA officials reported they did not  maintain such documentation. Ensuring that the TIM program provides  the capability for Adjudication Center officials to efficiently prepare and  document applicant response time reports would help ensure TSA meets  standards and decisionmakers identify and address performance  challenges. In addition, the Adjudication Center\u2019s accuracy rate generally  does not include cases in which contract adjudicators incorrectly  approved an applicant\u2014and these constitute roughly 90 percent of the  Adjudication center\u2019s caseload.
