Congress appropriated $40 billion to the President for emergency expenses (Emergency Response Fund) to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11. Emergency response funds available for transfer to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) could be used for CDBG programs, as authorized by title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended. Specifically, on November 1, 2001, the Office of Management and Budget designated $700 million for CDBG funding for New York City out of the Emergency Response Fund that Congress had appropriated. On January 10, 2002, Congress appropriated an additional $2 billion for CDBG funding, earmarking at least $500 million to compensate small businesses, nonprofit organizations, and individuals for their economic losses. Finally, on August 2, 2002, Congress appropriated an additional $783 million for CDBG funding.", "Although the CDBG program\u2019s primary purpose is community development, not disaster assistance, supplemental CDBG appropriations have been made to provide recovery assistance from past natural disasters, usually severe hurricanes, earthquakes, or floods. As in the aftermath of natural disasters, HUD waived many requirements\u2014such as assisting persons of low and moderate income\u2014of the general CDBG program. HUD is one of many federal agencies that offer disaster assistance, and HUD requires that its funds not be used to duplicate benefits provided by other federal agencies, such as SBA.", "Empire State is the New York State entity designated by the Governor to administer the first CDBG appropriation of $700 million. Created in 1968, Empire State is a corporate governmental agency of the state of New York and is currently engaged in housing and economic development and special projects throughout the state. To carry out large-scale economic development activities, Empire State has created various consolidated subsidiaries. In November 2001, the Empire State board of directors authorized the creation of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) to assist in the economic recovery and revitalization of lower Manhattan, with special emphasis on the redevelopment of the areas damaged by the terrorist attacks. LMDC functions as a joint city-state development corporation with a 16-member board of directors that is appointed by the Governor and the Mayor. For the amounts appropriated by Congress in the 2002 Emergency Supplemental and the 2002 Supplemental previously noted, which totaled $2.8 billion, LMDC was designated in the legislation as the entity to develop programs and distribute assistance.", "In its January 30, 2002, action plan, Empire State estimated that almost 18,000 businesses in New York City, representing approximately 563,000 employees, were disrupted or forced to relocate as a result of the terrorist attacks. Empire State estimated that businesses with 200 employees or fewer accounted for 99 percent of all affected businesses and about 50 percent of all affected employees. As lead agency in administering federal assistance to New York City businesses, Empire State is carrying out the action plan, which HUD approved, for providing $700 million in business assistance, with $506 million allocated for small business programs. Additionally, LMDC has a HUD-approved action plan for spending $306 million, primarily to provide residential retention and attraction grants to individuals.

To a great extent, larger businesses and their employees provide small businesses in lower Manhattan with a client base. Small businesses in turn provide larger businesses and their employees with services ranging from business consulting, accounting, and office supplies to personal services, such as dry cleaning, dining establishments, and newsstands.

The BRG Program is Empire State\u2019s most far-reaching business assistance program. The first BRGs were provided in mid- February 2002. As of September 11, 2002, 8,783 businesses had received BRG grants totaling $254 million. The median grant amount was $9,261. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees accounted for 95 percent of the businesses receiving BRGs and received $200 million, or 79 percent of the total amount of BRGs disbursed. All types of businesses are eligible for BRGs, and assisted businesses can be categorized into various sectors, as shown in figure 1. The largest number of businesses assisted falls into three sectors: professional and technical services; finance, which also includes insurance; and retail trade.", "To be eligible for a BRG, businesses must have had fewer than 500 employees worldwide; have been located on or south of 14th Street in Manhattan on September 11, 2001; and have suffered uncompensated economic losses related to the attacks. The program identifies four geographic areas, or zones, upon which it then bases the number of days of revenue for which it will compensate. In the BRG computation, the number of days of revenue increases the closer the zone is to the World Trade Center site. See appendix II for a map that identifies these geographic areas. Revenue periods range from 3 to 25 days, and maximum grant amounts range from $50,000 to $300,000, not to exceed a business\u2019 economic loss after adjusting for insurance and other compensation. In addition to other eligibility requirements, businesses must still be operating in the city or agree to resume operations in the city within 1 year of the receipt of grant funds as well as agree to retain a substantial portion of their business operations in the city for at least 3 years. The program will accept applications through December 31, 2002.", "The size of businesses assisted varies as measured by the number of employees and annual revenues. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees accounted for about 75 percent of the businesses assisted (see fig. 2). Recipients of BRG assistance who had revenues of less than $1 million accounted for 5,785 businesses, or about 67 percent of the businesses assisted (see fig. 3).", "The BRG Program has provided assistance to thousands of businesses; however, it has awarded only about one-half of the number of grants it originally estimated and has not covered a substantial portion of the uncompensated economic losses reported by businesses. Although Empire State estimated that it would make 19,600 grant awards, on the basis of the number of small businesses believed to be located in the eligible area, as of September 11, 2002, it had provided 9,373 grants. Empire State is making additional outreach efforts and hopes to increase the number of businesses assisted. Analysis of the economic losses reported by businesses shows that at the median of businesses receiving a BRG, the BRG covered about 17 percent of a business\u2019 losses that were not covered by insurance and other city and state grants. Empire State recently changed the BRG computation, both retroactively and prospectively, to increase the number of business day revenues considered in determining the grant amount, particularly for those businesses that were in or near the World Trade Center. This change will result in increased payments to some businesses and thereby reduce the amount of their uncompensated economic losses.", "With new criteria for increased payments and additional applications expected, Empire State is estimating that the total allocation for the BRG Program will be $481 million. Empire State also is expected to use CDBG funds to reimburse city and state programs that provided grants to small businesses soon after the September 11 attacks. The city and state programs have disbursed $24 million in assistance; however, as of September 11, 2002, neither had filed for reimbursement. As previously noted, LMDC is currently seeking approval to provide Empire State with additional CDBG funds, of which $150 million would go toward the BRG Program, bringing the total program allocation from $331 million to $481 million. Empire State and LMDC plan to meet the federal legislative requirement that $500 million in CDBG assistance be used to compensate small businesses, nonprofits, and individuals located in lower Manhattan almost exclusively through the BRG Program.

Accion also was located at a business recovery center, where clients had access not only to Accion but also to Empire State and SBA programs. The partnership\u2019s program specifically chose to target retail businesses with 50 or more employees, in part, because Seedco\u2019s program covers those with fewer than 50 employees. Many of the nonprofits have far more flexible lending criteria than either SBA or the banks, thereby allowing them to make loans the others have eschewed. Unlike SBA, Renaissance does not require collateral or tax receipts, instead it relies on store receipts, site visits, lottery sales, and personal knowledge of a business to determine business viability. Table 3 shows major nongovernmental assistance as of September 11, 2002.", "The nonprofits noted above and other groups also have played an important role in advocating for the interests of small businesses. For example, newly founded business advocacy groups, such as From the Ground Up and the World Trade Center Tenants Association, have lobbied Empire State, city and federal officials, and others to change programs to benefit small businesses. Some of these groups also have helped facilitate the flow of information among businesses and organizations, either formally or informally. The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce, for instance, has held networking events in lower Manhattan to bring various resources to one place. Seedco has published a widely used directory of resources available to help small businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided HUD, SBA, and Empire State with an opportunity to review this report.

For our analysis, we obtained detailed program information and data on the various programs that HUD, Empire State, and LMDC have created to assist businesses after September 11, including an Empire State database of grant recipients. This database is the same one used by the HUD Office of Inspector General to monitor expenditures in New York. We ascertained how information for this database was collected and maintained to determine its reliability, and we found the information to be reliable for our purposes.", "To obtain information on other sources of funds available to rebuild and sustain business in lower Manhattan, we interviewed officials from the following: the Small Business Administration (SBA), the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the New York Small Business Development Center (SBDC), FleetBoston and the Bank of New York, and nonprofit organizations that provided financial assistance. We selected the nonprofit organizations by reviewing various media and Internet sources on the rebuilding effort in New York as well as through referrals from other organizations concerned with economic renewal in lower Manhattan. We met with officials from the following nonprofit and other organizations that offer financial assistance toward the rebuilding and economic renewal efforts:   Accion New York,   Downtown Alliance,   New York City Partnership,   Renaissance Development Corporation,   SeedCo, and  the September 11th Fund.", "We also met with business advocacy groups, whose directors are often small business owners, to obtain their views on the assistance that Empire State, SBA, and others provided. These groups included the following:   From the Ground Up,   Manhattan Chamber of Commerce,   Tribeca Organization,   Wall Street Rising, and the World Trade Center Tenants Association.", "We obtained the Empire State disaster recovery database, which captured data on program activity through September 11, 2002. We used these data to calculate descriptive statistics on the numbers of businesses, dollar amounts, and other characteristics of the Business Recovery Grant (BRG) Program, the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Grant (SFARG) Program, and the large business recovery grant program. We used median instead of mean values because the median values were more representative of the \u201ctypical\u201d grant. In addition, we analyzed the database to determine other characteristics of BRG recipients, including annual gross revenues, number of employees, type of business on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System code given, and the extent to which BRGs covered businesses\u2019 reported losses. We limited our analysis to disbursed grants. When multiple grants went to the same business as the result of an appeal or from an award for a supplemental grant, we summarized the data by business, not by grant. Since the BRG Program includes nonprofits in addition to small businesses, we included nonprofits in our analysis, although entities that identify themselves as nonprofits accounted for less than 3 percent of the total receiving grants. Other conditions or limitations are described in the explanations of specific analyses that follow.", "For our analysis of business employee size, we used the total number of employees of the business; when the business had other business affiliations, we used the total number of employees worldwide. The BRG Program uses the total number of employees worldwide to determine if a business qualifies as a small business. In our analysis of revenues of BRG recipients, we used the gross revenue amount reported at the business location. This gross revenue amount is the figure used in computing the grant amount. The database did not have total business gross revenues that included affiliated businesses. We included both businesses that received one grant and businesses that received multiple grants, when the database included the same gross revenue figure for each of the multiple grants. Also, Empire State informed us that the gross revenue entries include projected annual revenues for some new businesses that did not have a year of revenue data, as well as annual expenses, in lieu of revenue, for some businesses that do not generate revenues and for nonprofits. For our analysis of type of business, we used the business classification code from the database and grouped the results by the first two letters of the code, which designate the general industry type. Where the groups represented less than 3 percent of all businesses, we grouped them in the \u201cother\u201d category.", "We made two calculations of the extent to which BRGs compensated for business losses. The business loss data are self-reported and unaudited by Empire State. In the first calculation, we determined to what extent BRGs covered the uncompensated loss incurred by each business. The uncompensated loss was determined by using the business \u201cnet loss\u201d database entry, which reflected remaining losses after adjusting for insurance proceeds and the city\u2019s Lower Manhattan Business Retention Grants; we further reduced this amount by the amount of the state Retail Recovery Grant. The BRG amount was then divided by the uncompensated loss figure to obtain the percentage of uncompensated loss covered by BRGs for each business. Where businesses had received multiple grants and the net loss figures were the same for each grant, we totaled the disbursed grant amounts and divided the total by the uncompensated loss amount. In the second calculation, we determined to what extent BRGs covered the total loss incurred by each business. We divided the BRG amount by the total business loss to obtain the percentage of the total loss covered by BRGs for each business. Where businesses had received multiple grants and the total loss figures were the same for each grant, we totaled the disbursed grant amounts and divided it by the total loss amount. To more accurately characterize the loss and compensation experience of small businesses in lower Manhattan for this report, we considered the entire distribution of the above statistics over all businesses to identify any uneven distribution around the median, or 50 percentile, which was the most common single summary measure we chose to report.", "We conducted our review between April and September, 2002 in Washington, D.C., and New York, New York, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Map of Lower Manhattan with Highlighted Empire State Program Areas", "paragraphs": ["South of Canal St.", "Houston St. - Canal St. 14th St. - Houston St."], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
