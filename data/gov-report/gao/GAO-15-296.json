The Departments of Defense and Homeland Security accounted for most of the difference (see fig. below). Further, although the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) made its data center consolidation initiative part of PortfolioStat in 2013, agencies have not consistently included planned savings from this initiative in their PortfolioStat reporting. As a result, the total amount that agencies expect to save through fiscal year 2015 is understated.", "As of January 2015, agencies reported having achieved approximately $1.1 billion in PortfolioStat-related savings during fiscal years 2013 and 2014. However, only 9 of 26 agencies met or exceeded their revised planned savings goals. Further, inconsistencies in OMB and agencies' reporting make it difficult to reliably measure progress in achieving PortfolioStat savings: (1) OMB included fiscal year 2012 savings in reporting against the fiscal years 2013 to 2015 goal, and (2) agencies had additional cost-savings initiatives they reported to GAO but not to OMB, and vice versa.", "Three selected agencies explained how they reinvested their PortfolioStat savings, but did not always provide supporting documentation.

OMB reported that the PortfolioStat effort has the potential to save the  government $2.5 billion from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2015 by  consolidating and eliminating duplicative systems.", "For PortfolioStat, OMB defined 13 types of commodity IT investments in  three broad categories:  1.  Enterprise IT systems, which include e-mail; identity and access  management; IT security; web hosting, infrastructure, and content;  and collaboration tools.  2.  IT infrastructure, which includes desktop systems, mainframes and  servers, mobile devices, and telecommunications.  3.  Business systems, which include financial management, grants- related federal financial assistance, grants-related transfer to state  and local governments, and human resources management systems.", "PortfolioStat is also intended to assist agencies in meeting the targets  and requirements under other OMB initiatives aimed at eliminating waste  and duplication and promoting shared services, such as the Cloud  Computing Initiative, the IT Shared Services Strategy, and the Federal  Data Center Consolidation Initiative.

The law also includes provisions that enhance CIOs\u2019  authority. For example, it requires agencies to ensure that CIOs have a  significant role in programming and budgeting decisions, as well as in  management, governance, and oversight processes related to IT.", "The PortfolioStat process consists of three key phases: (1) preparation, in  which agencies provide information to OMB, including draft information  resources management strategic plans and enterprise roadmaps; (2)  PortfolioStat session, in which agencies are required to hold a face-to- face, evidence-based review of their IT portfolio with the Federal CIO and  key stakeholders from the agency to discuss the agency\u2019s portfolio data  and agree on concrete next steps; and (3) post-session, in which  agencies work with OMB to establish follow-up discussion to track their  progress in addressing agreed upon next steps.", "In March 2013, OMB initiated the second round of PortfolioStat. In  addition to establishing guidance for conducting PortfolioStat sessions  during fiscal year 2013, the associated memorandum  highlighted  lessons learned from the initial round, integrated PortfolioStat and other  IT reform efforts like the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, and  streamlined agency reporting requirements (including those for other  OMB initiatives) into three primary collection channels\u2014an enterprise  roadmap, and information resources management strategic plan, and an  integrated data collection channel.

However, we also  reported that planned savings may be higher because six agencies that  reported closing as many as 67 data centers reported limited or no  savings. In addition, 11 of the 21 agencies with planned cost savings  were underreporting their fiscal years 2012 through 2015 figures to OMB  by approximately $2.2 billion. While several agencies noted  communication issues as the reason for this, others did not provide a  reason. We concluded that until OMB assists agencies in reporting  savings and agencies fully report their savings, the $5.3 billion in total  savings will continue to be understated. Accordingly, we recommended  that OMB assist agencies in reporting cost savings and develop a metric  for server utilization as part of any reevaluation of the metrics.

In 2013, DOD stated that it was  pursuing 26 PortfolioStat initiatives that were to contribute at least  $3.2 billion in savings. However, as of January 2015, DOD only  reported planned savings for its ongoing data center consolidation  initiative, which it estimated at approximately $560 million between  fiscal years 2013 and 2015. Though the department appears to be  pursuing the other 25 initiatives it identified in 2013, its Office of the  Chief Information Officer stated that it no longer considers them to be  part of PortfolioStat. This is because, in its view, the initiatives are not  well aligned with the commodity IT categories defined by OMB due to  their scope, scale, and complexity. In addition, the Acting Chief  Information Officer stated that DOD\u2019s systems are not capable of  easily generating the data needed to track savings as required under  PortfolioStat and that the costs of attempting to collect some of the  information far outweigh any potential benefits. However, OMB\u2019s  commodity IT definition does not depend on the scope, scale, or  complexity of initiatives, and would apply to any initiative that involved  the consolidation or elimination of commodity IT such as e-mail,  servers and mainframes, and mobile devices. We therefore disagree  with DOD\u2019s position that the 25 initiatives should not be considered to  be part of PortfolioStat. We also disagree with the Acting CIO\u2019s view  that the cost of attempting to collect savings information outweighs the  benefits, particularly since our extensive experience at federal  agencies and recent reports have shown that the reporting of current  and accurate information about the status of the PortfolioStat and  other key reform initiatives, including financial savings, is a critical  component to ensuring OMB\u2019s effective management and oversight of  these initiatives. Until DOD commits to tracking the 25 initiatives  under the PortfolioStat umbrella and reporting the savings to OMB, as  required by PortfolioStat guidance, potentially billions of dollars in  savings will go unaccounted.", "DHS accounts for approximately $925 million of the overall decrease  in planned savings (about 23 percent). Officials stated that they  erroneously mislabeled planned savings figures reported to GAO in  2013. Specifically, DHS stated that planned savings they reported for  fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015 actually represented cumulative  savings from fiscal year 2011 through those years. For example, the  $73.39 million reported as planned savings for the Workplace as a  Service initiative for fiscal year 2013 actually represented planned  savings for fiscal years 2011 to 2013, and the $153.80 million  reported as planned savings for fiscal year 2014 actually represented  cumulative planned savings for fiscal years 2011 to 2014. As a result  of the error, the fiscal years 2013 through 2015 planned savings we  reported were significantly overstated. DHS officials stated that they  subsequently informed OMB of their error.", "Figure 1 underscores how significant the changes in planned savings  made by DOD and DHS are relative to the total overall change for all  other agencies participating in PortfolioStat.", "The remaining agencies provided various reasons why their number of  cost savings initiatives or planned savings changed in the past year,  including the termination, consolidation, or addition of new savings  initiatives, and revised strategies for implementing planned or ongoing  initiatives. For example, we reported in 2013 that the Department of  Education had identified 18 initiatives that were planned to achieve  approximately $5.3 million in savings.

In addition, Education officials stated that, after receiving  additional guidance from OMB about how to calculate PortfolioStat cost  savings, they also needed to revise their planned savings totals.  Consequently, Education\u2019s revised total is $4.63 million, a reduction of  about 13 percent from what it reported a year ago. The Nuclear  Regulatory Commission stated that the previously reported estimate for  some of its initiatives had been zeroed out due to funding changes.

The following  are specific examples of action items assigned to agencies.", "Improve access control: OMB requested that DHS accelerate and  complete an initiative to strengthen access controls across the  department in accordance with its related directive.", "CIO authorities: OMB recommended that the Department of the Interior  consider policies and procedures that (1) require the CIO to review and  concur, prior to contract award, all IT commodity acquisitions; and (2)  consolidate IT commodity acquisitions within the acquisition directorate.  This was in response to the finding that the department was duplicating IT  acquisition activities and not leveraging economies of scale and volume  discounts.", "Accelerate and complete Internet Protocol version 6  implementation: OMB recommended that the Department of Housing  and Urban Development accelerate its implementation of Internet  Protocol version 6 and achieve 100 percent compliance no later than  January 2015.", "Improve mobile contract management: The Department of Energy  agreed with OMB to review its mobile acquisitions and achieve  performance that is equal to or better than the rates identified by the  General Services Administration.", "Increase participation in government-wide mobile application  gallery: OMB noted that the Department of Transportation should  increase its participation in the government-wide mobile application  gallery (apps.usa.gov) by centralizing its mobile application inventory  across the department, continuing to develop mobile capabilities centered  on customers, and registering all existing mobile applications on  apps.usa.gov.", "Of the 86 incomplete action items, about 78 percent do not have any  associated time frames or due dates for completion. Further, OMB did not  establish time frames for any action items for six agencies (Defense,  Education, General Services Administration, Homeland Security, Labor,  and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), and only one agency  (Department of Transportation) had time frames associated with all of its  action items.

He stated he did  not believe time frames were needed to follow up on the status of the  action items, particularly in cases when time frames established in policy  have already passed (such as for the implementation of the Internet  Protocol version 6). However, establishing time frames for action items  and following up on whether they are being met\u2014consistent with OMB\u2019s  own PortfolioStat guidance\u2014would increase agencies\u2019 accountability in  completing activities they agreed to and would help improve their portfolio  management posture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In a little over a year, agencies reduced the amount of savings they plan  to achieve via PortfolioStat between fiscal years 2013 and 2015 by about  68 percent\u2014from at least $5.8 billion to about $2 billion. The decision of  the Department of Defense, which represents the biggest decrease, to no  longer consider 25 of its 26 cost savings initiatives part of the PortfolioStat  effort and not to track associated savings suggests that the department  may not agree with the importance of reporting cost savings information  to OMB in accounting for and achieving the benefits of PortfolioStat.  Moreover, since agencies have not consistently included data center  consolidation initiatives in their planned PortfolioStat savings estimates as  OMB requires, those revised estimates are, at best, highly questionable  and as such cannot serve as an accurate indicator of the level of potential  savings that are achievable. Until OMB and agencies revisit these  planned savings estimates to consistently include data center  consolidation initiatives, opportunities for savings may be missed or  overlooked and the PortfolioStat initiative will likely not yield expected  benefits.", "Similar to agencies\u2019 revised plans, the reported savings of $1.1 billion is  questionable because many agencies omitted savings from their data  center consolidation efforts in reports to OMB and because of other  inconsistencies in reporting from both OMB and agencies. Without  ensuring the accurate and complete reporting of savings, OMB will have  difficulty holding agencies accountable for meeting the goals of the  PortfolioStat initiative and determining the true extent of the initiative\u2019s  results.", "Although selected agencies were able to provide explanations for how  they reinvested the savings from selected initiatives, they were not, in  some cases, able to provide supporting documentation, in part because  there is no requirement to develop such documentation. Having this  documentation would provide OMB and Congress with greater assurance  that agencies are effectively using savings generated through the  PortfolioStat process.", "Finally, while agencies and OMB agreed on action items as a result of  agencies\u2019 PortfolioStat sessions, most incomplete action items did not  have associated time frames consistent with OMB\u2019s guidance.

In a written response to our draft report (reprinted in app.  III), DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to maintain the 25  cost savings initiatives that we identified in GAO-14-65 under the  PortfolioStat umbrella and report the associated savings to OMB.  Specifically, DOD stated that it supports the PortfolioStat process and  reporting savings to OMB.", "However, DOD stated that its \u201cfederated approach\u201d to tracking cost  savings does not align with the 25 cost savings initiatives reported to us in  2013, although it did not provide any further information to support this  assertion. On a related note, during our review, the department stated  that DOD\u2019s systems are not capable of easily generating the data needed  to track savings as required under PortfolioStat and that the costs of  attempting to collect some of the information far outweigh any potential  benefits. As noted in the report, we disagreed that the costs of attempting  to collect savings information outweigh the benefits. Our extensive  experience at federal agencies has shown that the reporting of current  and accurate information about the status of the PortfolioStat and other  key reform initiatives, including financial savings, is a critical component  to ensuring OMB\u2019s effective management and oversight of these  initiatives.", "In its comments, the department also noted that a number of the 25  initiatives identified in 2013 had been ineffective in generating savings, or  had not been achievable. Because DOD did not specify which of its  initiatives had been ineffective or unachievable, we modified our  recommendation from \u201cmaintain the 25 cost initiatives under the  PortfolioStat umbrella\u201d to \u201crevisit the 25 cost initiatives\u201d to identify those  that have achieved savings and cost avoidances, and to report those  savings and avoidances to OMB. This is consistent with OMB guidance  requiring quarterly reports of cost savings and/or avoidances achieved  through the implementation of the PortfolioStat initiative. It also supports  recently enacted legislation recognizing the importance of the  PortfolioStat initiative and its focus on identifying cost savings and  avoidance. Specifically, as stated earlier, the law requires agencies to,  among other things, identify or develop opportunities to consolidate the  acquisition and management of information technology services; reduce  duplication and waste within the portfolio; and identify potential cost  savings and avoidances.", "Finally, DOD stated that it is in the process of developing more useful  performance indicators to more closely align with OMB\u2019s intent, is seeking  continuous improvement in its enterprise-wide efforts to achieve cost  savings, and will report such savings to OMB. While the department did  not provide any specific information on what would be more useful  performance indicators, we recently reported that OMB and agency chief  information officers did not fully agree on the usefulness of reporting  requirements integral to the success of OMB\u2019s reforms. We made  recommendations to OMB aimed at enhancing its collaboration with CIOs  and achieving a common understanding of the priority of current reporting  requirements and related IT reform initiatives.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the  secretaries and agency heads of the departments and agencies  addressed in this report, and other interested parties.
