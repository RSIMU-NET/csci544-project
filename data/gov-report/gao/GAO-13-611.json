NTSB also  develops studies that raise awareness of emerging safety issues. Since  2008, NTSB has investigated more than 1,100 aviation accidents and  dozens of accidents in other transportation modes, and issued over 1,000  recommendations to different agencies for improving safety. Most  recently, in 2012 NTSB launched 279 accident investigations and made  207 recommendations to improve transportation safety. NTSB is a  relatively small agency with a staff of about 400 employees and a fiscal  year 2013 budget of $104 million. In light of NTSB\u2019s expansive mission to  investigate accidents across all transportation modes, it is critical that  NTSB manage its resources and operations as efficiently as possible.", "In 2006, NTSB\u2019s reauthorization legislation mandated GAO to annually  evaluate its programs. GAO conducted a series of annual reviews  covering NTSB\u2019s management and operations, including examining the  extent to which NTSB (1) followed leading practices in selected  management areas, (2) addressed challenges in completing  investigations, and (3) generated sufficient revenues to cover its Training  Center costs. GAO\u2019s reviews resulted in 21 recommendations to NTSB  aimed at improving management and operations across 12 areas. In  2012, we reported that all 21 of these recommendations had been  implemented and closed. Since then, NTSB has undertaken numerous  actions and continues to plan and implement changes in an effort to  improve its management and operations. However, measuring the  outcomes of NTSB\u2019s actions is necessary to determine whether those  actions have led to measurable improvements and whether NTSB is  efficiently marshalling these efforts and using resources effectively. Our  objective in this review was to assess whether there has been  management and operational improvements associated with NTSB\u2019s  actions. We considered recommendations within management and  operational areas of key importance to NTSB\u2019s current priorities, as  stated in its 2013-2016 Strategic Plan and areas that required continuing  effort to achieve desired outcomes. This process yielded five  recommendations for our review. We then identified outcome measures  to assess changes by comparing current conditions with the initial  conditions at the time we performed our previous work, or earlier in some  instances, to establish a baseline. We used NTSB\u2019s financial and  program data, employee survey data from the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), and workforce data from NTSB and the Bureau of  Labor and Statistics (BLS). To ensure the data used were of sufficient  reliability for our analysis, we examined program reporting procedures  and quality assurance controls, and discussed various data elements with  knowledgeable agency officials. We also spoke with NTSB officials who  were knowledgeable about management and operations related to the 5  selected recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 through July  2013 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. See Appendix I for a more  detailed explanation of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NTSB was initially established within the newly formed Department of  Transportation (DOT) in 1966, but was made independent from DOT in  1974. NTSB is charged by Congress with investigating every civil  aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in other  modes of transportation\u2014railroad, highway, marine and pipeline. NTSB  determines the probable cause of the accidents and issues safety  recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents. In addition,  NTSB carries out special studies concerning transportation safety and  coordinates the resources of the federal government and other  organizations to provide assistance to victims and their family members  impacted by major transportation disasters. Unlike regulatory  transportation agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration,  NTSB does not have the authority to promulgate regulations to promote  safety, but instead makes recommendations in its accident reports and  safety studies to agencies that have such regulatory authority.", "NTSB is comprised of a five-person board\u2014a chairman, vice chairman,  and three members\u2014appointed by the President with the advice and  consent of the Senate. The chairman is the NTSB\u2019s chief executive and  administrative officer. The agency is headquartered in Washington, D.C.,  and maintains 7 regional offices and a training center located in Ashburn,  Virginia. In fiscal year 2013, the board was supported by a staff of about  400, which includes nearly 140 investigators assigned to its modal  offices\u2014aviation; highway; marine; and rail, pipeline, and hazardous  materials\u2014as well as 73 investigation-related employees, such as  engineers and meteorologists. NTSB\u2019s modal offices vary in size in  relation to the number of investigators, with the Aviation Safety office  being the largest. In addition, the Office of Research and Engineering  provides technical, laboratory, analytical, and engineering support for the  modal offices. Staff from this office interpret information from flight data  recorders, create accident computer simulations, and publish general  safety studies.", "This review focuses on the extent to which NTSB has achieved  measurable improvements from actions the agency has taken in five  management and operational areas based on prior GAO  recommendations.", "Training Center utilization. Making efficient and effective use of  resources provided by Congress is a key responsibility of federal  agencies. NTSB\u2019s Training Center, which opened in August 2003 in  Ashburn, Virginia, consists of classrooms, offices, and laboratory  facilities used for instructional purposes and active investigations.  NTSB uses this center to train its own staff and others from the  transportation community to improve accident investigation  techniques. NTSB charges tuition for those outside NTSB to take its  courses, and generates additional revenue from space rentals to other  organizations for events such as conferences on a cost reimbursable  basis. Although there is no statutory requirement that NTSB cover the  cost of its Training Center through the revenues generated from the  facility, a 2007 review we conducted found that NTSB was not  capitalizing on its lease flexibility to generate additional revenues and  classrooms were significantly underutilized. For example, we found  that less than 10 percent of the available classroom capacity was  used in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Furthermore, NTSB was  encouraged in a Senate report accompanying the 2006 appropriations  bill for DOT to be more aggressive in imposing and collecting fees to  cover the costs of the Training Center. Since then, NTSB leased a  large portion of the Training Center\u2019s non-classroom space to the  Federal Air Marshall Service and provided short-term leases of  classroom space to other organizations. In addition, NTSB increased  the amount of training it delivered at the Training Center.", "Recommendation close-out process. Efficiently managing the  recommendation tracking process is a key function, according to  NTSB officials. The recommendation close-out process is managed  by the Safety Recommendations and Quality Assurance Division,  which has responsibility for tracking the status of its  recommendations. When NTSB receives correspondence from an  agency about an NTSB recommendation, this division ensures it is  properly routed and reviewed and contacts the agency about whether  the response is acceptable. If NTSB is delayed in communicating with  agencies about whether NTSB considers actions to address  recommendations acceptable, that agency could delay implementing  a course of action pending approval. In fiscal year 2010, NTSB  replaced a lengthy, paper-based process with an automated system\u2014 the Correspondence, Notation, and Safety Recommendation system  (CNS)\u2014intended to facilitate the recommendation close out process  by electronically storing and automatically routing agencies\u2019 proposals  to the appropriate NTSB reviewers, allowing for concurrent reviews by  multiple parties within NTSB, and more accurately tracking responses.  It is important to note that an agency is not necessarily restricted from  implementing action prior to formal NTSB approval of that action.  Depending on the complexity of the issue, agencies may begin to  address issues prior to NTSB\u2019s providing formal approval. In other  circumstances, NTSB addresses safety deficiencies immediately  before the completion of an investigation. For example, during the  course of the TWA flight 800 investigation, NTSB issued an urgent  safety recommendation once it was determined that an explosion in a  fuel tank caused the breakup of the aircraft.", "Communication. Useful management practices include seeking and  monitoring employee attitudes, encouraging two-way communication  between employees and management, and incorporating employee  feedback into new policies and procedures. This type of  communication and collaboration across offices at all levels can  improve an agency\u2019s ability to carry out its mission by providing  opportunities to share best practices and helping to ensure that any  needed input is provided in a timely manner. To this end, NTSB  managers and board members began holding periodic meetings with  staff, conducting outreach to regional offices, and surveying staff  about the effectiveness of communication techniques.", "Diversity management. Implementing a diversity management  strategy and a more diverse workforce helps foster a work  environment that not only empowers and motivates people to  contribute to mission but also provides accountability and fairness for  all employees. Diversity management helps an organization create  and maintain a positive work environment where the similarities and  differences of individuals are valued, so that all can reach their  potential and maximize their contributions to the organization\u2019s  strategic goals. NTSB has developed diversity training courses and  held events to educate staff on diversity and inclusiveness issues,  created career development and mentoring programs to create  upward mobility, targeted its recruitment program to reach a more  diverse pool of applicants, and surveyed staff to assess the  effectiveness of its efforts.", "Financial management. Sound financial management is crucial for  responsible stewardship of federal resources. Traditionally,  government financial systems and government managers have  focused on tracking how agencies spend their budgets but did not  focus on assessing the costs of activities to achieve efficiencies. More  recently however, some government agencies have adopted cost  accounting systems that track the cost of providing a service\u2014in  NTSB\u2019s case, an accident investigation. In 2006, GAO recommended  that NTSB develop a cost accounting system to track the amount of  time employees spend on each investigation and other activities. This  approach allows management to link the cost of providing a service  directly with the budget and allocate resources based on those costs.  To determine the costs associated with conducting accident  investigations, NTSB launched a time and attendance program tied to  its cost accounting platform that allows the agency to collect and  analyze labor and certain other costs associated with individual  investigations. Investigators account for their time on investigations  through the time and attendance system using specific codes that  identify different investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results across NTSB Management Areas", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis found varying degrees of improvement associated with  NTSB\u2019s actions in each of the management and operational areas we  selected for review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Training Center Utilization", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that NTSB improved the utilization of the Training  Center, which allowed it to recover a larger portion of its operating costs.  NTSB increased utilization of both classroom and non-classroom space  at the Training Center since we conducted our work in 2006. NTSB  subleased all available office space at the Training Center to the Federal  Air Marshal Service in 2007, and utilization of non-classroom spaces has  been at 95 percent since then. At the same time, NTSB increased  utilization of the classroom space, increasing its own use of classrooms,  subleasing approximately one-third of the classroom space to the  Department of Homeland Security in 2008, and providing short term  leases to other outside parties for classroom use. Subsequently, NTSB  reported classroom utilization rose from less than 10 percent in 2005 to  18 percent in fiscal year 2007. By fiscal year 2009, it had increased to  over 60 percent\u2014the target we identified in our 2008 report as the  appropriate minimum level. Classroom utilization has remained above  60 percent through fiscal year 2012.", "We also found that improved Training Center utilization generated  additional revenue over time, which allowed NTSB to recover a larger  portion of the facility\u2019s operating costs. When the Training Center first  opened in fiscal year 2004, NTSB recovered about 4 percent of its  operating costs, resulting in a deficit of nearly $6.3 million. Portions of the  Training Center\u2019s costs that are not covered by revenues from tuition and  other sources such as facility rentals are offset by general appropriations  to the agency; therefore, generating additional revenue makes those  appropriated funds available for other uses. In 2011, NTSB indicated that  it was committed to improving cost recovery at the Training Center. That  year the agency set a goal to recover costs of the Training Center within  10 percent of the previous fiscal year. For example, in fiscal year 2010,  NTSB recovered $2 million in operating costs, making the fiscal year  2011 goal to recover at least $1.8 million of the Training Center\u2019s costs.  NTSB achieved its goal in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 by which time the  agency was recovering about half of the Training Center\u2019s operating  costs, reducing the operating deficit at the Training Center to $2.1 million,  one-third of what it was in 2004. (See fig. 1 for changes in the Training  Center\u2019s expenses and revenues.)", "The automation of NTSB\u2019s recommendation follow-up process has  reduced the amount of time it takes to formally respond to agencies about  whether planned actions to implement an NTSB recommendation are  acceptable. In fiscal year 2010, NTSB deployed the previously  described CNS to manage the Board\u2019s correspondence, including  accident reports, safety studies, recommendation transmittals, and public  notice responses. CNS allows for the relevant modal offices and the  Research and Engineering Office to simultaneously review and assess  planned actions to address NTSB recommendations. According to NTSB  officials, prior to the implementation of CNS, the average time NTSB took  to respond to an agency\u2019s proposals to address an NTSB  recommendation was 216 days. After CNS was implemented, that figure  dropped to 115 days\u2014a reduction of 47 percent. At the same time, the  number of responses the agency put out each quarter also increased.  (See fig. 2.) NTSB officials have indicated that they have an internal goal  to further reduce the response time to 90 days on average.", "Our analysis of improvements in NTSB\u2019s employee and management  communication related to NTSB\u2019s efforts indicated uneven results;  specifically we observed improvements in some but not all measures.

We  identified 7 of the 12 original management and operational areas in  NTSB\u2019s current strategic plan. These 7 areas contained 13 of the 21  original recommendations. Many of the 13 recommendations within these  areas required only a single action by NTSB to implement (e.g. develop a  strategic plan that follows performance based practices, articulate risk- based criteria for selecting which accidents to investigate, or obtain  authority to use appropriations to make lease payments in order to correct  its violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act) while other of those  recommendations included strategies involving continual action and  monitoring overtime in order to achieve desired improvements (e.g.,  increased utilization of the training center and improve the  recommendation close out process). It is these latter types of  recommendations that we focused on in this review, and based on these  criteria, we identified 5 for review:  increase the utilization of the Training Center,  improve the process for changing the status of recommendations  through computerization and concurrent review, develop mechanisms to facilitate communication from staff to develop strategies for diversity management as part of the human develop a full cost accounting system to track time employees spend  on each investigation in training.", "We identified a sixth recommendation\u2014maximize the delivery of core  curriculum for each mode at the Training Center\u2014based on our selection  criteria.

The measures we identified for each recommendation are: (1)  Training Center utilization\u2014utilization of classroom and non-classroom  space and operating deficit; (2) recommendation close-out process\u2014 average time to respond to agency proposals; (3) employee and  management communication\u2014employee responses to Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) federal employee surveys; (4) diversity  management\u2014employee responses to OPM\u2019s federal employee surveys  and NTSB employment levels of women and members of racial and  ethnic groups; and (5) financial management\u2014cost accounting reports  used to measure performance.", "To measure whether there was improvement in the outcomes and results  associated with NTSB\u2019s actions, we compared current conditions with the  initial conditions at the time we performed our previous work or earlier in  some instances in order to establish a baseline before actions occurred.  We used NTSB\u2019s financial and program data, employee survey data from  OPM, and workforce data from NTSB and the Bureau of Labor and  Statistics (BLS). To ensure the data used were of sufficient reliability for  our analysis, we examined program reporting procedures and quality  assurance controls, and discussed various data elements with  knowledgeable agency officials. We also spoke with NTSB officials who  were knowledgeable about operations and management in these five  selected areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Transportation Safety Board", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, H.
