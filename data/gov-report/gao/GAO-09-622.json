(\"Prime awardee\" refers to an organization that directly receives USAID funding to implement projects. \"Subawardee\" refers to an organization that receives funding from prime awardees.) USAID strengthened its policies and procedures in response to our 2006 recommendations by, for example, strengthening its vetting process, which involves investigating a person or entity for links to terrorism. Since 2006, USAID has instituted new procedures to monitor prime awardee compliance with antiterrorism requirements, which have allowed it to take some actions to address areas of concern. The agency has hired a specialist who reviews prime awardees' subaward files for compliance with its antiterrorism policies. All 32 new prime awards made by USAID in fiscal year 2008 included all applicable clauses. USAID obtained the applicable antiterrorism certifications and conducted required vetting for all applicable new prime awards. For a random sample of fiscal year 2008 subawards, applicable antiterrorism certifications were obtained and vetting was conducted. However, an estimated 17 percent of subawards had insufficient evidence to assess compliance related to mandatory clauses. For the remaining subawards, an estimated 5 percent did not contain the mandatory clauses at the time of the award. GAO also found limitations in the agency's monitoring of subawards for inclusion of mandatory clauses. Since 2003, State and UNRWA have strengthened policies and procedures to conform with conditions on U.S. contributions to UNRWA, but weaknesses remain. Section 301(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, prohibits U.S. contributions to UNRWA except on the condition that UNRWA take all possible measures to assure that no part of the U.S. contribution shall be used to furnish assistance to, among others, any refugee who has engaged in any act of terrorism. UNRWA has agreed to conform to conditions on U.S. contributions, but State has not established criteria to determine whether UNRWA's actions are consistent with this agreement. While State has not defined the key term \"all possible measures\" or defined nonconformance, it has strengthened some policies and procedures to oversee UNRWA's conformance. UNRWA has strengthened policies and procedures to promote neutrality of its beneficiaries, staff, contractors, and facilities that cover a broader range of conduct than covered in section 301(c). UNRWA reported denying approximately 110 applications for cash assistance to refugees since July 2006, because the agency found the refugees' behavior was inconsistent with UN neutrality or restrictions related to section 301(c). However, limitations exist. UNRWA said it has screened all staff, contractor, and beneficiary names against a UN Security Council list of potential terrorists and found no matches. However, the list does not include Hamas and Hezbollah, which the United States has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Finally, internal UNRWA audits do not assess controls for all cash assistance programs or whether contracts contain antiterrorism clauses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the United States has played a leading role in efforts to  resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

To determine whether the mission\u2019s prime awards  contained the applicable antiterrorism certification and clauses as  required by Mission Order 21, we reviewed copies of all 32 new prime  awards issued by the mission during fiscal year 2008. To determine  whether the subawards complied with relevant Mission Order 21  requirements, we selected a random stratified sample of 95 subawards  made to non-U.S. organizations and 49 subawards made to U.S.  organizations, a total of 144 subawards. Initially, we selected a random sample of 147 subawards. However, because one of the reported  subawards (to a U.S. organization) ide ntified by USAID was not actually  executed, we had a random sample of 146 subawards. We also removed  from the sample 2 subawards that did not require mandatory clauses,  resulting in a random stratified sample of 144 subawards. Our sample of 49subawards made to U.S. organizations was drawn from a subpopulation o f  101 subawards and our sample of 95 subawards made to non-U.S.  organizations was drawn from a subpopulation of 2,519 subawards.

The percentages report for all subawards are weighted to reflect the fact that we  oversampled the U.S. subawards in order to ensure that we obtained a  sufficient number for making projections for that strata.", "We selected these random stratified samples from a universe of 2 fiscal year 2008 subawards identified by the mission based on subaward  activity reported to the mission by prime awardees. The mission  developed the universe by assembling the subaward spreadsheets that  were available as of October 2008 and provided by each partner who had  an active prime award during the period from October 3, 2007 through  September 30, 2008. The spreadsheets included U.S. and non-U.S.  subawards. From the subawards reported on these spreadsheets, the  mission identified subawards made during the period from October 1,  through September 30, 2008 and filtered out all subawards made outside of those dates. The mission then created a list containing the names of the  organizations receiving each subaward and the start and end date of each subaward. At our request, the mission then added information to the list t include the amount and type of each subaward (e.g. contract, grant). In  addition, if the mission found a subaward reported in New Israeli Shekels,  it replaced the amount in shekels with an estimated conversion to U.S.  dollars to help facilitate the GAO selection process. In addition, if the  mission found an entry with an end date listed as \u201cimmediately,\u201d it  replaced this word with a date identical to the start date. The mission's  objective was to include all individual subaward agreements and exclude  any extensions and modifications to those awards.  However, according to  the mission, their attempt to exclude extensions and modifications was  o  limited to those instances in which the information was available from prime awardee\u2019s monthly reports.  As a result, our sample included s modifications and extensions.  In addition, our sample included 2  instances in which prime awardees bundled multiple procurements and  reported them as a single subaward.

We also examined five UNRWA semiannual reports on  UNRWA\u2019s efforts to conform to agreements with U.S. conditions on fund from July 2006 through December 2008. These reports provide data on staff disciplinary actions, denial of benefits to refugees, inspection incursions into UNRWA facilities, and screening of recipients of  funds against the UN Security Council\u2019s Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions  Committee Consolidated List (UN 1267 list). We also interviewed UNRWA  headquarters and field officials in Amman, Jordan and Jerusalem  responsible for implementing and overseeing UNRWA\u2019s programs,  including the Commissioner-General; Deputy Commissioner-General;  Directors of UNRWA Field Offices; senior officials in the Departments of  Administrative Support, Finance, Internal Oversight, Legal Affairs, and  several program offices; and staff responsible for monitoring facilities in the West Bank and Gaza areas. Furthermore, to obtain information on  UNRWA\u2019s programs and oversight activities in the agency\u2019s refugee camp we visited three camps in the West Bank and outside Amman (Jalazone,  Jabal el-Hussein, and Baqa\u2019a refugee camps) where we spoke with  UNRWA staff and Palestinian refugees about their understanding of the   the  agency\u2019s policies and procedures.

Our relatively basic computerized matching  comparison focused strictly on the \u201cname\u201d field supplied by UN OFAC, including both individuals and entities, although information fo the place of birth and date of birth fields were available for some  r  individuals in the OFAC list. The UNRWA list contained approximately  20,000 records with names, while the OFAC list contained approximately  9,000 primary names and more than 5,000 aliases.

While a perfect match between the two lists wou require the records in each list to be identically matched, we found that  ,  names in the two lists may have varied in terms of the number of tokens punctuation considerations, the translation of foreign sounding names an variations in spelling. Therefore, we identified records that were  reasonably similar to be potential matches. For each potential match, we  performed a manual review of the available information on the records  using other Internet sources, to help determine whether these were possible matches.
