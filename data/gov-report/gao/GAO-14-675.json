In May 2011, VHA implemented its Family Caregiver Program at all VAMCs across the country, offering caregivers an array of services, including a monthly stipend, training, counseling, referral services, and expanded access to mental health and respite care. In fiscal year 2014, VHA obligated over $263 million for the program.", "GAO was asked to examine VA's implementation of the Family Caregiver Program. This report examines how VHA is implementing the program, including the types of issues that have been identified during initial implementation. GAO obtained and reviewed relevant policy documents and program data and interviewed officials from VHA's Caregiver Support Program office. GAO also met with officials from five VAMCs and their corresponding Veterans Integrated Service Networks to obtain information on program implementation at the medical facility level."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\u2014within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\u2014significantly underestimated caregivers' demand for services when it implemented the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (Family Caregiver Program). As a result, some VA medical centers (VAMCs) had difficulties managing the larger-than-expected workload, and some caregivers experienced delays in approval determinations and in receiving program benefits. VHA officials originally estimated that about 4,000 caregivers would be approved for the program by September 30, 2014. However, by May 2014 about 15,600 caregivers had been approved\u2014more than triple the original estimate. The program's staffing was based on VA's initial assumptions about the potential size of the program and consisted of placing a single caregiver support coordinator at each VAMC to administer the program. In addition, each VAMC was to provide clinical staff to carry out essential functions of the program, such as conducting medical assessments for eligibility and making home visits. This led to implementation problems at busy VAMCs that did not have sufficient staff to conduct these program functions in addition to their other duties. As a result, timelines for key program functions, such as those for completing applications within 45 days and making quarterly home visits to caregivers, are not being met. VHA has taken some steps to address staffing shortages; however, some VAMCs have not been able to overcome their workload problems because the program continues to grow at a steady rate\u2014about 500 approved caregivers are being added to the program each month. Federal internal control standards emphasize the need for effective and efficient operations, including the use of agency resources.", "The Caregiver Support Program office, which manages the program, does not have ready access to the type of workload data that would allow it to routinely monitor the effects of the Family Caregiver Program on VAMCs' resources due to limitations with the program's information technology (IT) system\u2014the Caregiver Application Tracker. Program officials explained that this system was designed to manage a much smaller program, and as a result, the system has limited capabilities. According to federal standards for internal control, agencies should identify, capture, and distribute information that permits officials to perform their duties efficiently. However, outside of obtaining basic aggregate program statistics, the program office is not able to readily retrieve data from the system that would allow it to better assess the scope and extent of workload problems at VAMCs. Program officials also expressed concern about the reliability of the system's data, which they must take steps to validate. The lack of ready access to comprehensive workload data impedes the program office's ability to monitor the program and identify workload problems or make modifications as needed. This runs counter to federal standards for internal control which state that agencies should monitor their performance over time and use the results to correct identified deficiencies and make improvements. Program officials told GAO that they have taken initial steps to obtain another IT system, but they are not sure how long it will take. However, unless the program office begins taking steps towards identifying solutions prior to obtaining a new system, VAMCs' workload problems will persist and caregivers will not be able to get the services they need."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA (1) expedite the process for implementing a new IT system that will enable officials to obtain workload data; and that VHA (2) identify solutions to alleviate VAMCs' workload burden in advance of obtaining a new IT system, and (3) use data from the new IT system, once implemented, and other relevant data, to re-assess the program and implement changes as needed.

Within 10 days after the caregiver completes the  training, an initial home visit is conducted to determine if the caregiver  has the physical capacity and skills necessary to provide medical care to  the veteran, and if the home is safe and adequately equipped. Since the  initial home visit includes physical assessment and medical components,  it must be completed by a medical professional such as a registered  nurse, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, physician assistant or  physician.

The  program initially placed a single CSC at each VAMC largely to perform  administrative and caregiver support functions, with the expectation that  each VAMC would provide the program with physician, nursing, and  administrative staff as needed to perform specific program functions.  However, VISN officials and VAMC officials we spoke with said that there  are too few CSCs to handle the program\u2019s workload effectively.  Specifically, at some VAMCs, CSCs have been unable to perform all of  the routine administrative tasks associated with their approved  caregivers, as initially expected. For example, some VISN and VAMC  officials told us that the number of appeals filed by veterans and  caregivers has become an unexpectedly large component of CSCs\u2019  workload, making it difficult to fulfill the full range of their responsibilities.  A Caregiver Support Program official clarified that while CSCs typically  work with the VAMC patient advocates to handle appeals, they may be  taking on greater responsibility for the appeals process at VAMCs with  large numbers of appeals for the program.", "Caregiver Support Program officials acknowledged that the workload for  the Family Caregiver Program has been burdensome for some CSCs,  depending on the number of their approved caregivers and the amount of  assistance they have at the local level. As of May 2014, the number of  approved caregivers per CSC varied widely across VAMCs, ranging from  6 to 251. (See fig. 4.) Caregiver Support Program officials stated that their  office does not use a formal CSC-to-caregiver target ratio because  staffing decisions are largely the domain of local managers and the use of  a specific workload ratio by the Caregiver Support Program could limit  VAMCs\u2019 discretion in determining when to request additional CSCs. (See  app. I for a list of VAMCs\u2019 CSC-to-caregiver workload ratio.)", "Furthermore, Caregiver Support Program officials had expected VAMC  officials to direct their clinical staff to perform the medical assessments  and home visits needed by the Family Caregiver Program as part of their  ongoing care to veterans. However, VISN and VAMC officials we  contacted told us that their facilities do not have sufficient medical staff to  effectively manage the additional workload generated by the Family  Caregiver Program, which they view as a collateral duty. According to  most VISN and VAMC officials, obtaining clinical staff for the program can  be difficult at VAMCs where directors may not consider the Family  Caregiver Program to be a high priority. For example, officials at one  VAMC told us that lack of support from the VAMC director led to a  situation in which the director refused to have nurses conduct home visits  for the Family Caregiver Program. At another facility, a VAMC director  told us that lack of support by her predecessor led to large backlogs of  unprocessed applications and incomplete home visits for the Family  Caregiver Program, which she discovered following her recent transfer to  that facility. According to some VISN officials, this dynamic sometimes  placed CSCs, as the administrators of the local Family Caregiver  Program, in the position of pleading for support from VAMC physicians  and nurses. In May 2014, a Caregiver Support Program official explained  that although the office has issued program policy and guidance to  medical facilities, it also plans to issue a directive that outlines  organizational responsibilities for the Family Caregiver Program, including  those at the VAMC level. This official did not provide a specific timeframe  for the issuance of the directive but stated that it would occur following the  issuance of final program regulations.", "VISN and VAMC officials we spoke with noted that the Family Caregiver  Program\u2019s approach of having VAMC physicians conduct medical  assessments for program eligibility has been a challenge. Physicians at  the VAMCs we contacted were already experiencing heavy workloads  prior to the implementation of the Family Caregiver Program, and some  physicians were not able to take on additional tasks that they viewed as  collateral duties, according to VISN and VAMC officials. Some physicians  who were initially willing to conduct medical assessments could not  continue doing so when the number of applications for the program  increased. VISN and VAMC officials also stated that some physicians do  not want to perform medical assessments because they are concerned  that having a role in determining eligibility for a program that includes a  financial stipend could compromise their clinical relationship with the  patient. As a result of these factors, the number of physicians willing to  conduct medical assessments for the program is limited at some VAMCs.  CSCs at some VAMCs told us that the typical wait time for a medical  assessment can be a month or longer.", "VISN and VAMC officials also agreed that providing nurses for the home  visits needed by the Family Caregiver Program has posed problems and  remains an ongoing challenge. These officials explained that most clinic  nurses are already too busy to assume an additional workload. Officials at  one VISN told us that some nurses who originally agreed to conduct  quarterly home visits for the Family Caregiver Program stopped doing so  after home visits became a burden, due to the increasing number of  approved caregivers. In addition, VAMC and VISN officials at every  location we contacted told us that home visits to remote areas require  long driving times, which are challenging to accommodate. Staff at one  VAMC we contacted pointed out that their catchment area covers  147,000 square miles, and some of their caregivers live over 8 hours  away, requiring nurses to contend with multiple overnight stays per month  and dangerous travel conditions in the winter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing Shortages Impeded Timeliness of Key Functions and Negatively Affected Services to Caregivers Despite Actions Taken to Address Them", "paragraphs": ["Timelines for key functions of the caregiver program, such as those for  adjudicating applications within 45 days or making quarterly home visits  to family caregivers, are not being met because CSCs at some VAMCs  were not able to obtain sufficient support from medical facility staff.

Staff at many of the  VAMCs we contacted told us that delays exist at some or every step of  the application process for the Family Caregiver Program, including  determining caregiver eligibility, administering medical assessments, and  conducting initial home visits. Officials at all of the VAMCs we contacted  stated that there were applications at that facility that had been open for  longer than 45 days, and one VAMC had over 400 open applications,  some going back to June 2013. According to the Caregiver Support  Program office, in June 2014, 111 VAMCs had applications that had been  in process for 45 to 90 days; most of these facilities (95 percent) had 20  or fewer applications in this category. Additionally, the office reported that  65 VAMCs had applications that had been open 91 days or more; most of  these VAMCs (85 percent) had 25 or fewer applications in this category.", "Furthermore, home visits are not always being made on a timely basis. At  one VAMC, initial home visits to assess caregivers\u2019 skills, which are  supposed to take place within 10 days of the caregiver\u2019s completion of  core training, took from one to two months to complete, which delayed  eligibility determinations. Staff at some of the VAMCs we contacted were  also struggling to maintain the quarterly schedule for follow-up home  visits due to the larger-than-expected number of approved caregivers. At  one VAMC, CSCs told us that follow-up home visits occur every 6 to   9 months, in contrast to the program\u2019s standard of every 90 days. Delays  in home visits could be problematic because these visits provide medical  staff with an opportunity to assess the welfare and environment of the  caregiver and veteran\u2014issues that may not be evident during clinic visits,  such as whether special dietary needs are being met and whether  medications are being properly administered.", "At some VAMCs, the volume of administrative and procedural activities  performed by CSCs has curtailed or even displaced their ability to provide  services to caregivers and veterans. VISN staff we spoke with told us that  as a result of the high workload burden, CSCs who are overwhelmed do  not have the ability to perform some caregiver support functions offered  by the Family Caregiver Program, such as support groups and  counseling. Caregivers and officials from non-VA organizations told us  that some CSCs do not return caregivers\u2019 phone calls. One caregiver  recounted that when she became desperate to learn how to manage a  veteran with increasingly severe symptoms from a TBI, her CSC told her  that hers was one of many requests and that the program could not  provide counseling for caregivers. This caregiver subsequently received  services from a non-profit organization.", "Officials from the Caregiver Support Program and the VAMCs we  contacted also told us that they have taken steps to address staffing  shortages for the Family Caregiver Program, although some of the steps  have had limited success. For example,  In recognition that some VAMCs had more approved caregivers than  originally anticipated, the Caregiver Support Program office began to  allow VAMCs to request additional CSCs in August 2011. By May  2014, VAMCs had submitted 99 requests for salary funding to the  Caregiver Support Program office for adding one to five more CSCs to  their facility. Specifically, the requests from VAMCs totaled 112  additional CSCs, of which the Caregiver Support Program office  approved about 94 additional positions.", "In March 2014, the Caregiver Support Program also began funding  temporary CSCs, who were hired for terms of 120 days. As of May  2014, the office has funded 10 CSCs on a temporary basis. According  to a Caregiver Support Program official, these CSCs must meet the  same qualifications as a full-time CSC, and their duties are to be  established at the local level. In addition, some VAMCs have provided  their own clerical support to CSCs for routine administrative tasks.", "In August 2012, the Caregiver Support Program office also began  allowing VAMCs to conduct home visits by telephone after 1 year of  satisfactory home visits had been completed for cases that do not  pose exceptional medical risk. Some of the VAMCs we contacted are  planning to expand their use of follow-up telephone contact with  caregivers in lieu of in-person home visits. However, officials at one  VAMC told us that they did this with only three to four families  because they considered almost all families approved for the Family  Caregiver Program to be at risk because of the high proportion of  caregivers who were caring for veterans with PTSD who were not  clinically stable.", "VAMCs have also tried various approaches for improving physicians\u2019  willingness and ability to participate in the Family Caregiver Program.  For example, officials from the Caregiver Support Program office told  us that some VAMCs use a multidisciplinary team\u2014instead of  individual physicians\u2014to make determinations for eligibility and for the  level of financial stipend, enabling the workload to be shared by  multiple clinicians. Another VAMC hired a physician on a part-time  basis just to perform eligibility examinations for the program. One  VAMC with serious workload backlogs is examining the option of  using physicians who are already under contract for conducting  medical assessments for determining disability benefits, instead of  using VAMC treatment physicians. The VAMC director who is  exploring this option mentioned that this approach could also resolve  physicians\u2019 concerns about compromising the physician/patient  relationship posed by determining eligibility for a program that  includes a financial stipend. However, Caregiver Support Program  officials stated that regardless of the approaches VAMCs may take to  conduct the medical assessments, the program\u2019s regulation requires  that the physician making eligibility determinations for the Family  Caregiver Program be a member of the veteran\u2019s treatment team.", "To increase nurses\u2019 willingness to provide assistance to the program,  some VAMCs offered their nurses overtime pay to conduct home  visits, and other VAMCs made temporary work-sharing arrangements  with nearby VAMCs for nursing coverage. Officials in the VISNs we  contacted told us that some VAMCs have used the funding they  received for additional CSC positions to hire nurses for the sole  purpose of conducting home visits for the program because of the  heavy workload. Some officials also told us that they consider the  home visit reimbursement amounts to be insufficient to cover their  expenses, such as for GPS units, other electronic devices, and time  needed for associated administrative activities. However, an official  with the Caregiver Support Program office stated that this should not  be necessary because the program\u2019s reimbursement for home visits  covers salary expenses, travel costs, and time for administrative  activities.", "Some VAMCs have also hired contractors to conduct home visits,  although contractors may not be available in some locations.", "A Caregiver Support Program official stated that the budget for the Family  Caregiver Program has been adequate to meet operating costs as of  March 2014. Nonetheless, VHA officials at all levels told us that VAMC  directors were cautious about requesting additional CSCs or hiring  additional nurses for making home visits. These officials explained that  VAMC directors are concerned that when the Family Caregiver Program\u2019s  initial 5-year budget authorization expires, the cost of the additional  nurses and CSCs could shift from the Caregiver Support Program office  to the VAMCs. VAMC directors stated that their caution is based on  experience, in that this shift has occurred in the past with other new VHA  programs that had initially received funding support from their program  offices. Caregiver Support Program officials acknowledged VAMC  officials\u2019 concerns about the program\u2019s funding and added that they are  aware of some VAMCs\u2014even facilities with growing numbers of  approvals\u2014that are cautious about requesting additional CSCs.  Nonetheless, a Caregiver Support Program official stated that VHA  continues to request funding for the Family Caregiver Program, including  a funding request for fiscal year 2015 that was submitted with the budget  request.", "Notwithstanding incremental efforts to improve staffing levels for the  program at some VAMCs, CSCs and VAMC staff predict that staffing  shortages and the ensuing workload problems are likely to recur because  VHA\u2019s current staffing of the program is not sufficient and overall  approvals continue to increase at a steady rate\u2014about 500 approvals per  month. As a result, according to VAMC officials, some facilities have not  been able to overcome the workload problems that developed upon  program implementation. A Caregiver Support Program official stated that  program officials recognize the need to formally re-evaluate key aspects  of the Family Caregiver Program, including program staffing and the  processes for eligibility assessments and home visits, in light of the fact  that the program was designed to manage a much smaller caregiver  population. This is consistent with federal internal control standards,  which emphasize the need for effective and efficient operations, including  the use of agency resources such as human capital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA\u2019s Oversight of the Family Caregiver Program Is Impeded by IT System Limitations", "paragraphs": ["The Caregiver Support Program office does not have ready access to the  workload data that would allow it to monitor the effect of the Family  Caregiver Program on VAMCs\u2019 resources due to limitations with the  Caregiver Application Tracker\u2014the IT system that was established for the  program. According to federal standards for internal control, agencies  should identify, capture, and distribute pertinent information in a form and  time frame that permits officials to perform their duties efficiently.However, the Caregiver Support Program office is not able to easily  retrieve data that would allow it to better assess workload trends at  individual VAMCs\u2014such as the length of time applications are delayed or  the timeliness of home visits\u2014even though these data are already  captured in the Caregiver Application Tracker. Consequently, Caregiver  Support Program officials only retrieve these data on an ad hoc, as- needed basis, which limits their ability to assess the scope and extent of  workload problems comprehensively at individual VAMCs and on a  system-wide basis.", "A Caregiver Support Program official told us that the office becomes  aware of workload problems at some VAMCs through various informal  information channels, such as CSCs\u2019 requests for application extensions  and communication with the CSCs and VISN CSC leads. relying on informal information channels does not provide the office with a  comprehensive picture of the program\u2019s workload across all VAMCs, and  this puts it in a reactive position of addressing workload issues after  problems have already developed. Having a system that allows for easy  retrieval of data would better position the office to proactively identify both  existing and potential workload problems at VAMCs and work with their  CSCs to identify solutions before problems develop or worsen. It would  also facilitate access to data needed for pinpointing where certain  processes may be getting stalled. For example, a Caregiver Support  Program official told us that it would be helpful to be able to track the  status of the various phases of the application process to identify the  phases that are taking too long, which would help the office to better  determine how to improve the overall timeliness of application  adjudication.", "According to this official, in these instances, they provide coaching and support to the  CSC and VISN CSC lead and may work with them on identifying solutions, which may  include the development of an action plan with the support of VAMC leadership. caregivers between VAMCs and other VHA entities, including the Health  Administration Center, which processes the caregiver stipend payments  and administers CHAMPVA. CSCs are responsible for entering  nonclinical data into the system, which includes information related to the  application process and the status of home visits. The Caregiver Support  Program office manages the system and uses its data to monitor certain  aspects of the program. Specifically, a program official explained that the  system can generate a few basic reports that have been preprogrammed,  including a weekly report with aggregate data on the status of  applications and stipend payments. The Caregiver Support Program  office uses these data to monitor the program as well as data from other  sources, including data on the number of approved caregivers who have  completed training and the number of telephone calls to the Caregiver  Support Line. However, data that are not contained in the  preprogrammed reports must be extracted from the system on an ad hoc  basis.", "Caregiver Support Program officials told us that they take steps to  validate the data they obtain from the system because they have  observed some inconsistencies\u2014particularly with ad hoc data\u2014and as a  result, they have concerns about its reliability. These officials told us that  each time they extract ad hoc data from the system, they validate the  data through additional sources to ensure its accuracy. Caregiver Support  Program officials explained that they have already taken steps to verify  the sources of the data that are used for the system\u2019s reports and do not  need to verify these data every time a report is generated. Nonetheless,  these officials noted that they will periodically compare the current weekly  data that is reported by the system with data from the prior week to  ensure that there are no drastic changes which would indicate a need for  additional verification.", "Program officials explained that the system has no agility or flexibility to  perform additional tasks beyond its basic tracking functions, and  retrieving data from the system on an ad hoc basis often requires time- consuming manual procedures. These officials explained that the  system\u2019s data files are organized by veteran, and all of the veterans who  apply for the program are captured in the system whether or not their  caregivers were approved. As a result, the system that was designed to  manage 5,000 records by the end of 2015 had over 30,000 records as of  May 2014. Officials said that the system\u2019s limited capabilities became  more apparent as the number of records in the system increased, which  made retrieving data on an ad hoc basis more difficult and time  consuming. For example, according to program officials, in response to  our request for the number of VAMCs with applications over 45 days old,  they had to download all of their relevant data into a spreadsheet, review  the data for accuracy, make the necessary corrections, and then  manually count the number of applications over 45 days old. A Caregiver  Support Program official told us that it took three people about 8 to   10 hours in total to pull this information together.", "Officials further explained that the Caregiver Application Tracker is a  stand-alone system that is not integrated with other VHA systems, and as  a result, it cannot perform sophisticated functions or searches that would  require pulling information from these other systems. Officials told us that  this hinders their ability to monitor certain aspects of the program and  results in time-consuming efforts to compile program-related data. For  example, the use of respite care\u2014one of the benefits of the Family  Caregiver Program\u2014is tracked by a different VHA system. To determine  how many veterans in the Family Caregiver Program are using respite  care, program officials told us that they must download their data into a  spreadsheet and then upload this information to the IT system for respite  care use in order to crosswalk the information. Furthermore, data on  Family Caregiver Program appeals are maintained in the Patient  Advocate Program\u2019s tracking system, which is also managed by a  different VHA office. Caregiver Support Program officials told us that they  have to request appeals data from this office, and to date, there have  been a few requests for caregiver appeals data in response to  congressional inquiries. However, because the Patient Advocate  Program\u2019s tracking system was not designed in a way that allows them to  easily retrieve information that is specific to the Family Caregiver  Program, the Caregiver Support Program office had received a report for  only one of the inquiries as of May 2014. A Caregiver Support Program  official told us that they are working with the Patient Advocate Program to  identify methods to obtain the appeals data they need, such as by  capturing whether an appeal is related to the Family Caregiver Program.", "As a result of these system limitations, the Caregiver Support Program  office does not have the capability to routinely track and analyze the type  of workload data it needs to produce a meaningful assessment of the  program\u2019s impact on VAMCs. According to federal standards for internal  control, agencies should conduct monitoring activities to assess the  quality of performance over time and should use the results to correct  identified deficiencies and make improvements. However, the lack of  ready access to comprehensive workload data impedes the program  office\u2019s ability to proactively identify and correct workload problems as  they manifest or to identify and make modifications as necessary to  ensure that the program is appropriately structured to meet caregivers\u2019  demand for its services. Consequently, a Caregiver Support Program  official told us that the program office has only been able to assess  workload problems and make interim adjustments, such as allowing  VAMCs to request additional CSC positions, based on informal feedback  and has not been able to conduct a formal re-assessment of the program  that is based on comprehensive program data.", "A Caregiver Support Program official acknowledged that they recognize  the need for a more capable, flexible system that can interface with other  departmental systems. This official also told us that program office  officials are working with their information technology office to develop the  requirements for a comprehensive system and that they are exploring the  possibility of whether an existing VHA system could be adapted to meet  their needs. However, this official was not sure how long it would take to  obtain another IT system and whether this effort would be displaced by  higher priorities. As a result, it is not clear when program officials will have  access to comprehensive workload data for the Family Caregiver  Program to better assess how it is functioning. Although it will be difficult  to identify changes needed to improve the program\u2019s efficiency and  effectiveness without these data, VAMCs\u2019 workload problems will  persist\u2014and caregivers will not get the services they need\u2014unless the  program office begins taking steps towards identifying solutions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Family caregivers play a crucial role in caring for seriously injured post- 9/11 veterans by taking on critically important and often stressful  responsibilities for their well-being and potentially keeping them out of  costly institutions. The Family Caregiver Program was intended to provide  supportive services to this caregiver population, but VHA significantly  underestimated program demand. The subsequent stress on resources at  some VAMCs resulted in delayed application decisions and home visits\u2014 ultimately limiting services to caregivers. Incremental steps to alleviate  staffing shortfalls have benefited the program in some locations, but these  efforts will not likely be sufficient in light of the steady growth of approved  caregivers in the program. After 3 years of operation, it is clear that VHA  needs to formally reassess and restructure key aspects of the Family  Caregiver Program, which was designed to meet the needs of a much  smaller population. This would include determining how best to ensure  that staffing levels are sufficient to manage the local workload as well as  determining whether the timelines and procedures for application  processing and home visits are reasonable given the number of approved  caregivers.", "To accomplish this, the Caregiver Support Program office will need to  take a strategic, data-driven approach that would include an analysis of  the program\u2019s workload data at both the aggregate and VAMC levels. It  will therefore be necessary for VHA\u2019s Caregiver Support Program office to  obtain an IT system that will facilitate access to the types of data\u2014 including interfacing with other VHA systems, such as systems for clinical  patient records and respite care\u2014that would allow it to more fully  understand the program\u2019s workload and its effect on VAMCs, CSCs, and  caregivers. The current approach of relying on informal information  channels limits the program office\u2019s ability to comprehend the scope and  magnitude of workload problems system-wide and leaves it in a reactive  position of adding staff to the program only after significant workload  problems have developed. A more capable IT system would enable the  Caregiver Support Program to comprehensively monitor the program and  proactively identify both actual and potential VAMC workload problems  and target areas where improvements could be made. However, without  a clear time frame for obtaining another IT system, workload issues will  persist unless the Caregiver Support Program office starts to identify  solutions to help alleviate VAMCs\u2019 workload burdens, such as  modifications to the timelines and procedures for application processing  and home visits, and the identification of additional ways to provide  staffing support. If the program\u2019s workload problems are not addressed,  the quality and scope of caregiver services, and ultimately the services  that veterans receive, will continue to be compromised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Family Caregiver Program is able to meet caregivers\u2019  demand for its services, we recommend that the Secretary of the  Department of Veterans Affairs expedite the process for identifying and  implementing an IT system that fully supports the program and will enable  VHA program officials to comprehensively monitor the program\u2019s  workload, including data on the status of applications, appeals, home  visits, and the use of other support services, such as respite care.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans  Affairs direct the Undersecretary for Health to  identify solutions in advance of obtaining a replacement IT system to  help alleviate VAMCs\u2019 workload burden, such as modifications to the  program\u2019s procedures and timelines, including those for application  processing and home visits, as well as the identification of additional  ways to provide staffing support, and use data from the IT system, once implemented, as well as other  relevant data to formally reassess how key aspects of the program  are structured and to identify and implement modifications as needed  to ensure that the program is functioning as envisioned so that  caregivers can receive the services they need in a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment.

They explained that obtaining a new IT system would require the  involvement of multiple offices within VA, including central offices that  are under the Secretary of VA. Based on this information, we revised  our recommendation and have redirected it to the Secretary to ensure  that it is inclusive of all necessary offices within the department.", "Officials also commented on our recommendation about using data  from the new IT system to formally reassess key aspects of the  program and make modifications as needed. They suggested  broadening the recommendation to include data from other sources,  such as any data they may obtain through the solutions they  implement in advance of obtaining a new IT system. In consideration  of this information and the fact that we refer to relevant data from  other IT systems in our report, we modified our recommendation to  state that the Undersecretary for Health should use data from the IT  system, once implemented, as well as other relevant data to formally  reassess how key aspects of the program are structured.", "As a result of these revisions, VA concurred with all three of our  recommendations in its letter, which is reprinted in appendix II.
