The Global Report consolidates and tracks information about identity theft incidents and IRS detection and resolution efforts from multiple sources within IRS. The report provides information to IRS senior management and a standard source of information for responding to data requests from external entities. GAO's selected review of the Global Report against key attributes of successful performance measures found that it had many of the attributes useful for program monitoring, but also had some areas where additional information or clarification would make the report more helpful. Updating the Global Report to provide information on definitions, data sources, and limitations such as the unknown number of undetected fraudulent returns, could help ensure users have a more complete picture of the data and its strengths and limitations.

We also reviewed our past  reports to identify key attributes of successful performance measures and  compared information provided by IRS\u2019s Refund Fraud and Identity Theft  Global Report.

They can obtain identity  information by hacking into a computer system or paper files at one of the  many entities that use names and SSNs in their records (e.g., employers,  schools, or financial institutions). Thieves can trick the taxpayer into  revealing such information, or they can steal it from the taxpayer. Armed  with the stolen identity, the thief can then file a fraudulent tax return  seeking a refund. The thief typically files a return claiming a refund early  in the filing season, before the legitimate taxpayer files. If IRS determines  the name and SSN on the tax return appear valid (IRS checks all returns  to see if filers\u2019 names and SSNs match before issuing refunds) and it  passes through IRS\u2019s other filters, IRS will issue the refund to the thief.", "IRS often becomes aware of a problem after the legitimate taxpayer files  a return. At that time, IRS discovers that two returns have been filed using  the same name and SSN, as shown in figure 1. The legitimate taxpayer\u2019s  refund is delayed while IRS spends time determining who is legitimate.", "As we have previously reported, IRS has taken multiple steps to detect,  resolve, and prevent identity theft-based refund fraud. IRS developed  new filtering processes in 2012 to detect identity theft based on the  characteristics of incoming tax returns that do not rely on a duplicate filing  or self-identification by filers. Identity theft indicators\u2014also known as  account flags\u2014are a key tool used to resolve and detect identity theft.  Identity theft indicators speed resolution by making a taxpayer\u2019s identity  theft problems visible to all IRS personnel with account access. In some  cases, IRS uses its identity theft indicators to screen tax returns filed in  the names of known identity theft victims. If a return fails the screening, it  is subject to additional IRS manual review, including contacting  employers to verify that the income reported on the tax return was  legitimate.", "IRS uses the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP  PIN)\u2014a single-use identification number sent to victims of identity theft  that have validated their identities with IRS\u2014to prevent refund fraud.  When screening returns for possible identity theft, IRS excludes returns  with an IP PIN, which helps avoid the possibility of a \u201cfalse positive\u201d and a  delayed tax refund. If a taxpayer was issued an IP PIN and does not use  it when filing electronically, IRS rejects the electronically filed return and  prompts the taxpayer to file on paper. Taxpayers that do not use an IP  PIN or enter an incorrect IP PIN filing on paper experience processing  delays as IRS verifies the taxpayers\u2019 identity. As of June 30th, IRS  reported providing more than 251,500 IP PINs to taxpayers in 2012 and  of those, 150,506 taxpayers filed using an IP PIN. Of filers that filed using  an IP PIN, 8.6 percent (12,936) used an invalid IP PIN. IRS officials told  us their review of a sample of these cases found that the majority of the  invalid IP PINs were due to transposition or keying errors. Details on  other IRS actions can be found in our previous reports.", "Other steps taken in 2012 include temporarily reallocating hundreds of  staff from other business units to resolve duplicate filing cases and issue  refunds to legitimate taxpayers. Officials in IRS\u2019s accounts management  function told us that in October 2012 there were more than 1,700 staff  working to resolve identity theft cases. Also, in April 2012, IRS began the  Law Enforcement Assistance Pilot Program in Florida to help state and  local law enforcement agencies obtain tax return data vital to local identity  theft investigations. The pilot allows taxpayers to give their permission for  IRS to provide state and local law enforcement with the returns submitted  using their SSN in certain cases. IRS expanded the pilot to eight  additional states in October 2012. As of September 2012, 49 state and  local agencies participated in the pilot.

Program officials said that one of  the challenges they face in combating this type of fraud is its changing  nature.

IRS  officials explained that \u201cwe don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know,\u201d because  if a fraudulent return goes through IRS\u2019s identity theft models and  other programs, they are unable to tell if they failed to detect the  fraudulent return. Officials explained that it is very difficult to detect a  fraudulent return when an identity thief uses a correct SSN and has  enough identifying information to make the return \u201clook\u201d like it came  from the legitimate tax filer. The tax return appears to be legitimate as  it has been filed with a name and SSN that match. Detecting identity  theft can also be challenging because some legitimate filers  mistakenly file duplicate returns. For example, IRS officials told us that  in some cases, taxpayers intending to amend their return are  confused and file a second Form 1040. In such a case, IRS has to  investigate whether the duplicate filing is due to taxpayer confusion or  identity theft.", "IRS captures data on the amount of money it recovers from all types  of fraudulent returns, but it does not distinguish whether the type of  fraud was identity theft or some other type of fraud. In some cases,  external entities, such as banks or other agencies, may notify IRS of  potential refund fraud, including suspected identity theft-based refund  fraud. IRS reported it had received information from 116 banks and  external leads on more than 193,000 accounts between January 1  and September 30, 2012, for all types of refund fraud. IRS reported  that banks and other external entities returned almost $754 million  dollars during this period. These cases are ones where fraudulent  returns passed through IRS processes and refunds were issued. W&I  officials told us they analyze data from such cases to identify  characteristics of the fraudulent returns to improve their screening for  identity theft and other types of refund fraud. The officials told us that  the procedure for banks to notify IRS of suspected refund fraud is not  new, but more financial institutions have now begun doing so.", "Identity of the thieves. Unless IRS pursues a criminal investigation,  IRS generally does not know the real identity of the thieves. An  investigation is necessary because the only identity information IRS  has on the fraudulent tax return is that of the identity theft victim, not  the thief. Officials responsible for processing returns said that they do  not have the sort of information that would be needed to even begin  such an investigation.", "CI has substantially increased efforts to criminally investigate identity  theft cases in fiscal year 2012; however, as with other forms of fraud,  CI focuses its investigative resources on the most serious cases. The  number of identity theft investigations opened and time spent  investigating identity theft cases have increased from fiscal year 2010  to fiscal year 2012, as shown in table 2. Although identity theft is one  of CI\u2019s investigative priorities, the number of investigations initiated is  substantially less than the number of identity theft incidents confirmed  by IRS in 2012. CI officials told us that while other IRS functions share  leads with CI, not all of these leads meet CI\u2019s criteria for developing a  case for prosecution. CI officials told us they generally focus their  investigative resources on the most egregious and significant identity  theft cases, as measured by volume and refund amounts.", "Whether a fraudulent return is an individual attempt or part of a  broader scheme. W&I and CI officials told us the two units work  closely to utilize the information they obtain from identity theft cases.  They use this information to improve their measures to identify new  identity theft-based refund attempts and to identify especially  significant or egregious cases to consider for possible criminal  investigations. When either W&I\u2019s analysis of identity theft cases or CI  investigations lead to the identification of new schemes, that  information is reported to the Return Integrity and Correspondence  Services unit so it can strengthen its identity theft filters. Identifying  new schemes or significant cases, such as one identity thief using  numerous taxpayer identities, depends on analysts noticing patterns  or other indications that a few cases may be part of a larger scheme.  As a result, some schemes or cases involving multiple taxpayers may  go undetected.", "Characteristics of known identity theft returns. IRS officials told us that  the agency does not systematically track characteristics of known  identity theft returns, including the type of return preparation (e.g. paid  preparer or software), whether the return is filed electronically or on  paper, or how the individual claimed a refund (e.g. check, direct  deposit, or debit card).
