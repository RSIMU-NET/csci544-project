Stations may participate in more than one type of agreement. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) officials and industry representatives could not identify a central data source that tracks all broadcaster agreements. Station owners and financial analysts said that agreements are more prevalent in small markets because they have lower advertising revenues than large markets. Further, FCC officials and stakeholders said that agreements are becoming more prevalent, and stakeholders stated that economic factors, including declining advertising revenues, drive the use of agreements.", "Stakeholders expressed mixed views on the effects of broadcaster agreements. Consumer groups raised concerns that agreements in which stations share news resources can lead to duplicative content in local newscasts. Station owners counter that the agreements are needed to allow some stations to continue providing news and allow other stations that previously did not provide news to begin doing so. In addition, some agreements include provisions that allow stations to jointly negotiate for their signals to be carried by cable and satellite providers. Cable and satellite providers argue that these agreements increase stations' negotiating leverage and thereby contribute to higher prices for cable and satellite service. In contrast, station owners counter that these concerns are overstated. Comprehensive data are not available to evaluate this issue, because the negotiations are subject to nondisclosure agreements, and there is no data source identifying which stations participate in agreements.", "FCC evaluates broadcaster agreements that occur in the context of a merger or acquisition, but it has not collected data or completed a review to understand the use and effects of broadcaster agreements. FCC's recent regulatory approach has been to evaluate broadcaster agreements that occur as part of a merger or acquisition and to propose specific remedies as needed. To promote its media policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity, FCC established media ownership rules that limit the number of stations an entity can own or control in a local market. Station owners and consumer groups said that broadcaster agreements are used in situations where common ownership of stations is prohibited by FCC's media ownership rules. FCC has stated that it is unable to determine the extent to which broadcaster agreements affect its policy goals and media ownership rules. Specifically, FCC does not collect data and has not completed a review on the prevalence of agreements, how they are used, or their effects on its policy goals and media ownership rules.

Congress and the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) have recognized the importance of  this role by allowing local television stations to use the public airwaves to  broadcast their signals, and by giving stations specific rights with respect  to carriage of their broadcast signals on cable, satellite, and other  subscription video services. In return, Congress and FCC have  established certain obligations for local television stations, such as  requiring that stations operate in the public interest. The laws and  regulations outlining how local television stations should serve the public  interest have evolved over time and become less prescriptive. However,  three long-standing policy goals have guided FCC\u2019s regulation of stations:  competition, localism, and diversity. To advance these policy goals,  Congress empowered FCC, and FCC has implemented broadcast  ownership rules that limit the number of stations an entity can own or  control locally and nationally. Since these rules were established, the  media landscape has evolved, resulting in the proliferation of cable  networks and Internet outlets, to provide citizens a broader array of  content than was once the case. This increase in media competition has  presented economic challenges for local television stations. In some  cases, stations have entered into broadcaster agreements that allow  them to share resources with other stations or contract out certain  services.

A JSA is an agreement in which one  station is allowed to sell the advertising time for another station in  exchange for a percentage of the advertising revenues, a flat fee, or  some other consideration. For example, stations WEEK-TV and  WHOI-TV in Peoria, Illinois, entered into a JSA agreement in 2009.

According to the agreement, KXAN\u2019s owner (LIN Media  LLC) has the sole right to sell advertising time to be placed in all  programming broadcasted on KNVA and also retains all advertising  revenues from the advertising sales. In exchange, KXAN\u2019s owner  pays KNVA\u2019s owner an annual fee for the duration of the agreement.", "Local news service agreement (LNS). LNSs are agreements in which  multiple stations in a local market share news-gathering resources.  LNSs can include sharing photographers, news helicopters, or  satellite trucks to cover a news event. For example, stations can rely  on one camera crew shared by all participating stations to get footage  of a press conference rather than covering it individually.", "Shared service agreement (SSA). SSA is a broad term that can  include a variety of services. SSAs can include arrangements wherein  one station produces another station\u2019s news content and also  provides operational, administrative, and programming support.

The Pew Research Center\u2019s analysis of BIA/Kelsey data shows  that in 2011, stations in the largest 25 local television markets had  average revenues substantially greater than stations in smaller markets.  In particular, stations in the largest 25 DMAs received, on average,  advertising revenues of $57 million per year, while stations in DMAs  ranked 151 through 210 according to size received $3 million (see table  3). However, the costs of broadcasting (cameras, vehicles, bandwidth,  monitors, and other production infrastructure) can be similar across small  and large markets. Thus, broadcasters in small- and medium-sized  markets are more likely to enter into agreements to share or reduce  costs.", "Stakeholders also noted that stations in small and medium markets may  be more likely to enter into agreements because FCC\u2019s ownership rules  disproportionately affect stations in these markets. Specifically, as  mentioned previously, FCC rules allow a single entity to own two  television stations in the same DMA if at least one of the stations is not  ranked among the top four stations in terms of audience share and at  least eight independently owned and operating full-power television  stations would remain in the DMA. Small markets are less likely to have  enough stations to meet these requirements. For example, the smallest  market with 9 or more stations, which could support a merger, is the  Spokane, Washington, market. Thus, stations in smaller markets may  use broadcaster agreements to gain operating efficiencies that they  cannot obtain through common ownership.", "The estimates are based on the Pew Research Center\u2019s Journalism Project.

For example, one station owner told us that providing the  exact same newscast on two different stations can lead to a  cannibalization of both stations\u2019 audience ratings, advertising revenues,  and profits, so it is in the stations\u2019 self-interest to maintain separate  identities and target different audiences.

They added that the agreements have also provided  localism and diversity benefits by allowing some stations that previously  did not provide news to begin doing so, or to add additional local  programming. For example, in Wichita Falls, Texas, Nexstar\u2019s NBC  station provides services that allowed the FOX station, which previously  did not air local news, to air a 9:00 p.m. newscast. Similarly, a trade  association told us that a JSA and SSA between stations owned by  Schurz Communications Inc. and Entravision Holdings LLC resulted in  the launch of Spanish-language news on a station in Derby, Kansas,  making it the first and only Spanish-language local television news  operation in the state.

Station owners and MVPDs both noted that  in such a negotiation, the amount of leverage each party\u2014the station  owner and MVPD\u2014has depends on the overlap in the stations\u2019 audience  size and the number of MVPD subscribers. For example, one MVPD  stated that if a station group owns stations in 70 percent of the MVPD\u2019s  service area, then the station group has more leverage because a  programming blackout would affect a large percentage of the MVPD\u2019s  subscribers than would be the case if the station group only covered 10  percent of the MVPD\u2019s service area.", "Comprehensive data are not available to evaluate the effect of  broadcaster agreements on retransmission consent fees, but FCC  recently took action to prohibit separately owned top-four stations in the  same market from engaging in joint retransmission consent negotiations.  Broadcasters and MVPDs have each submitted economic studies to FCC  supporting their positions, and a few individual MVPDs provided data to  FCC on how joint retransmission consent negotiations affected their  retransmission consent fees. However, comprehensive data on the extent  to which these agreements affect retransmission consent fees are not  available, because retransmission consent fee negotiations are subject to  non-disclosure agreements. Moreover, even if the retransmission consent  fees were publicly available, as we noted earlier, it is not always known  when stations are involved in a broadcaster agreement. On March 31,  2014, FCC adopted an order prohibiting separately owned, top-four  stations in the same market from entering into joint retransmission  consent negotiations with one another, or otherwise collaborating during  retransmission consent negotiations. In the order, FCC concluded that  joint negotiation by same market, separately owned top-four stations  eliminates price rivalry between and among stations that otherwise would  compete directly for carriage on MVPD systems and the associated  retransmission consent revenues. FCC added that joint negotiation gives  such stations both the incentive and the ability to impose on MVPDs  higher fees for retransmission consent than they otherwise could impose  if the stations conducted negotiations for carriage of their signals  independently.", "DOJ took action in 1996 when three companies, each owning a network  affiliate in Corpus Christi, Texas, agreed not to enter into a retransmission  consent agreement with any cable operator until the operator had  reached an agreement with all three companies. In the complaint, DOJ  stated that the effect of this combination was to increase the price of  retransmission consent and to restrain competition among the defendants  in the sale of retransmission rights. DOJ officials told us that in this  case, the companies were not involved in any other agreements, such as  SSAs, and if they had been, DOJ would have evaluated whether there  were efficiencies derived from the agreements that would have balanced  against the anticompetitive effects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FCC Has Not Completed a Review of the Use and Impacts of Broadcaster Agreements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCC Evaluates Individual Broadcaster Agreements as Part of Its Review of Mergers and Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s Media Bureau will also review agreements if they are challenged by an outside  party.

For  example, consumer groups have stated that agreements in which one  company provides the studio, production facilities, tower, and local news  for another company\u2019s station, while also controlling the sale of  advertisements and entering into agreements such as securing the  station\u2019s debt or receiving a percentage of the station\u2019s profits, result in  the station owner ceding control of the station to another party.", "FCC has previously stated that its analysis of transfer of control  \u201ctranscends formulas\u201d and must be determined on a case-by-case  basis.

As long as the licensee meets this requirement and  retains ultimate control of station operations pertaining to personnel  responsibilities, the station providing services can place its employees  at the station receiving the services. For example, FCC officials told  us that if another station\u2019s employees are performing work related to  functions the licensee of the station receiving services should control,  then the employees should report to the licensee\u2019s managers.", "Finances: Payment for services rendered in broadcaster agreements  may factor into a case-by-case determination of financial control. FCC  officials noted that ultimate authority for all aspects of a station\u2019s  financial operations must rest with the licensee, and FCC\u2019s analysis of  control may consider payments for services. For example, FCC has  previously approved agreements in which the licensee of the station  receiving services retained 70 percent of cash flow resulting from  operation of the licensee\u2019s station. FCC has also approved previous  agreements where a flat fee for services rendered, as part of a  shared-service agreement, was combined with a split of advertising  revenue.", "FCC has previously held that participation in an agreement does not  necessarily establish a transfer of control, even if the agreement  constitutes an attributable interest that should be counted under the  ownership cap. The licensee can delegate responsibility over a station  as long as the licensee sets basic policy and retains ultimate control over  the station. While there are some provisions codified in regulation,  stakeholders told us that they typically use previously approved  agreements as precedence on how to structure agreements so that they  will garner FCC approval. However, in March 2014, the Media Bureau  issued a notice stating that it would closely scrutinize applications for the  assignment or transfer of a license that propose that two or more stations  in the same market will (1) enter into an arrangement to share facilities,  employees, or services or to jointly acquire programming or sell  advertising and (2) enter into certain financial agreements, such as loan  guarantees or options to purchase the station.

Station owners told us that by limiting the number of stations  an entity can own in a local market, the media ownership rules have led  companies to enter into broadcaster agreements as a means of realizing  economic efficiencies that they are unable to achieve through  acquisitions. Consumer groups have raised concerns that the use of such  agreements constitutes an \u201cend-run\u201d around the media ownership rules  because they amount to common ownership of two stations in the same  market. While both groups recognize the relationship between the media  ownership rules and broadcaster agreements, each group proposes  differing solutions. For example, station owners note that the agreements  are not as efficient as joint ownership and state that the media ownership  rules should be relaxed due to the increasing competition that broadcast  stations face from new media, such as Internet-delivered programming.  Conversely, consumer groups want the agreements made attributable  due to concerns that they increase media consolidation and reduce  viewpoint diversity.", "Similarly, in February 2014, DOJ filed comments with FCC noting that  there has been a pronounced trend in broadcaster agreements that allow  one station to control another station that is nominally owned by a  separate entity, often called a \u201csidecar.\u201d DOJ stated that its investigations  have revealed that these \u201csidecars\u201d often exercise little or no competitive  independence from the station providing services and that the extent of  cooperation and integration with \u201csidecars\u201d is so extensive that some  television-station ownership groups even consolidate the financials of  affiliated \u201csidecars\u201d in their securities filings.", "FCC has stated that it is unable to determine the extent to which  broadcaster agreements affect its media ownership rules and policy goals  of competition, localism, and diversity. In 2014, FCC noted that public  interest groups had raised meaningful concerns about the impact of  agreements on its policy goals, but also stated that broadcast  stakeholders had provided evidence that agreements may produce public  interest benefits. FCC concluded that it lacked information about the  scope and prevalence of broadcaster agreements and, thus, could not  conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of the agreements on its rules  and policy goals.

Specifically, FCC has not collected  comprehensive data to determine the number of agreements, the  services provided through the agreements, and other relevant data to  provide useful context, such as the market and station characteristics  associated with the use of agreements. FCC has instead relied on  comments from stakeholders on these issues and its experience  reviewing individual transactions. As part of its 2010 Quadrennial Review  of its ownership rules, FCC requested comment on making LNSs and  SSAs attributable, and on how to determine the impact of such  agreements on its policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity,  but it has not completed the review. FCC continued its assessment of  these issues in its 2014 Quadrennial Review. Specifically, FCC\u2019s notice  for its 2014 Quadrennial Review stated that it needed additional  information to assess whether additional regulation of agreements is  warranted, and solicited comments on requiring the disclosure of SSAs,  tentatively defining the term in a manner that would include LNS  agreements.

FCC seeks to achieve competition, localism, and diversity through its  media ownership rules; however, restrictions on local television station  ownership have remained largely unchanged since 1999. Meanwhile, the  media marketplace is rapidly evolving and offering consumers a variety of  platforms for receiving information and programming, including a number  of Internet-based sources. This has led to increased competition between  broadcast stations and other media platforms for viewers, content, and  advertising. In addition, broadcaster agreements appear to be increasing  and evolving with respect to the types of services provided. While few  disagree that broadcaster agreements have evolved partly in response to  FCC\u2019s restrictions on media ownership, broadcast stations and consumer  groups offer varying perspectives on whether the agreements positively  or negatively affect FCC\u2019s policy goals of competition, localism, and  diversity.", "FCC has recognized both sides of the issue, noting that broadcaster  agreements can provide important public interest benefits, such as  helping a struggling station improve its operations and adding local news  programming in a market, but these agreements can also create  relationships that would be viewed as joint ownership under FCC\u2019s  existing regulations. FCC has also recognized that in certain  circumstances, its policy goals of competition, localism, and diversity may  conflict, such as in cases where preventing consolidation leads to less  economically healthy stations that cannot invest in local news. Given the  complexity of regulating an evolving industry, FCC would benefit from  improved data on and analysis of the extent to which broadcaster  agreements affect its media ownership rules and its media policy goals of  competition, localism, and diversity.

We also  reviewed the descriptions and definitions of broadcaster agreements  provided in FCC regulations and rulemakings. We obtained specific  examples of agreements from filings submitted to FCC by broadcasters,  station owners, and public-interest groups, as well as descriptions of  agreements reported by station owners in press releases, and U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K and 10-Q filings. We verified  information from the literature review through interviews with FCC and  Department of Justice (DOJ) officials. We also interviewed a variety of  stakeholders, including representatives of broadcast networks, television  broadcast station owners, multichannel video programming distributors  (MVPDs),1 trade associations, labor groups, consumer groups, financial  analysts, and other individuals with knowledge of the broadcast industry.  We selected local television station owners and MVPDs that filed  comments in FCC\u2019s media ownership proceeding and that varied in the  number of stations they owned or the number of subscribers they served,  respectively; we selected other stakeholders by reviewing prior GAO  reports, academic studies, and comments filed in FCC media ownership  proceedings, and through recommendations from other interviewees.", "MVPD refers to cable operators, satellite providers, and telecommunications companies  that provide subscription video services to consumers. told us that broadcaster agreements are less common in those markets  and likely to have less impact in those markets. We divided the remaining  markets into three separate groups based on market size. We randomly  ordered the markets within each stratum and selected the first DMA listed  in each of the three stratums to conduct the case study. If there was a  broadcaster agreement in the selected market, we then matched it with a  similarly-sized market without an agreement, and if a chosen market did  not have a broadcaster agreement, we looked for a similarly-sized market  with an agreement. To determine whether stations in a market  participated in a broadcaster agreement, we used the Warren Television  and Cable Factbook, FCC\u2019s website, stations\u2019 public inspection files, and  a BIA/Kelsey database to identify full-power commercial and non- commercial stations within each DMA. We then used the above- mentioned sources, press releases, news articles, a Georgetown  University study, a University of Delaware study, and data from MVPDs,  to identify whether any broadcaster agreements exist within the three  selected markets.", "After the 6 case study markets were selected, we contacted and  interviewed station owners to learn more about the specific broadcaster  agreements being used in the selected DMA. In addition, we contacted  cable companies in the DMAs we identified having agreements to learn  more about how or if the broadcaster agreements within their respective  DMAs affected the retransmission consent fee negotiations. In the DMAs  we identified as not having an agreement, we contacted and interviewed  owners of the top-four stations in the market. We defined a broadcaster  agreement as any instance where two or more independently owned  stations within the same DMA have entered into any of the following  agreements:  time brokerage agreement/local marketing agreement,  shared service agreement, joint sales agreement, and local news service  agreement. We did not include instances where a station entered into a  broadcaster agreement with another separately-owned out-of-market  station because we focused on FCC\u2019s local ownership rules, which limit  the number of stations a company can own within a market. In addition,  we did not include low power or translator stations, but we did include  satellite stations. The three DMAs that we selected that had a  broadcaster agreement were Casper-Riverton, Wyoming, Topeka,  Kansas, and Paducah, Kentucky.  The three DMAs we selected that did  not have a broadcaster agreement were Mankato, Minnesota, Columbia- Jefferson City, Missouri, and Madison, Wisconsin.3    To assess what is known about the prevalence of broadcaster  agreements, we interviewed stakeholders about the comprehensiveness  of data collected by FCC, private-sector, public-interest, and academic  sources on the number of broadcaster agreements nationwide. In  addition, we acquired data from BIA/Kelsey, a market-research firm, to  assess the prevalence of certain types of agreements, the stations  involved in the agreements, and the size of the market served by the  stations. We analyzed BIA/Kelsey data on television markets, stations,  and agreements. We tested the reliability of BIA\u2019s data by reviewing  stakeholder opinions on the reliability and accuracy of the data, reviewing  existing information about the data, and obtaining information from BIA  officials about how they collect the data.
