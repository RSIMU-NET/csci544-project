We issued several reports and testimonies in fiscal year 1995 dealing with IRS\u2019 primary compliance measurement program and IRS\u2019 efforts to reduce noncompliance.", "Status of Tax Year 1994 Compliance Measurement Program. IRS\u2019 Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP) plays an important role in national tax policy and administration decisions. IRS collects TCMP data by doing extensive audits on a random sample of tax returns. IRS uses the sample data to measure compliance levels, estimate the tax gap, develop formulas for selecting returns to audit, identify compliance issues, and allocate its resources. Because of TCMP\u2019s importance, we monitored IRS\u2019 plans to develop and implement the tax year 1994 TCMP for which audits were slated to begin in October 1995. We concluded that (1) IRS\u2019 1994 TCMP would be the most comprehensive TCMP effort ever undertaken, (2) its larger sample compared with past TCMP efforts would allow for more sophisticated and powerful analyses, (3) new audit techniques and more information should help IRS auditors do higher quality audits, and (4) the many changes and added complexity would increase the importance of adequate training of the auditors and supervisory review of their work. We continue to believe that TCMP is a good investment because it is IRS\u2019 tool for objectively measuring compliance with tax laws. The 1994 TCMP was delayed indefinitely, however, because of congressional concerns about both the cost and taxpayer burden associated with the TCMP and budget cuts. IRS is considering several alternatives, but as of December 31, 1995, no alternative had been selected (GAO/GGD-95-39, Dec. 30, 1994; GAO/T-GGD-95-207, July 18, 1995). (See p. 20.)", "Reducing the Income Tax Gap.  One of the greatest challenges facing IRS is finding ways to reduce the gross income tax gap\u2014the difference between income taxes owed and those voluntarily paid. IRS estimates that more than $100 billion in income from legal sources is at stake annually. IRS attributes about three-fourths of the tax gap to individuals and about one-fourth to corporations. To explore innovative and practical ways to reduce the tax gap, we sponsored a symposium on January 12, 1995, that brought together well-known tax authorities with congressional, IRS, and our staff. In general, the panelists identified several objectives that, if met, could help improve compliance: (1) reduce tax law ambiguity and complexity; (2) extend the reach of tax requirements, such as income tax withholding, that tend to promote taxpayer compliance; (3) expand compliance techniques such as information sharing with states and enhanced penalties; (4) more aggressively focus on unreported income; (5) improve IRS\u2019 compliance data; and (6) improve IRS\u2019 ability to resolve compliance problems quickly. The panelists also cautioned against excessive intrusions into taxpayers\u2019 affairs, which could defeat IRS\u2019 objectives. In June 1995, we testified that (1) compliance varies across groups of taxpayers and is lowest where there is neither withholding nor information reporting and (2) some of the tax gap may not be collectible at an acceptable cost, making it important that IRS measure compliance and use that information to effectively focus its resources. In a December 1994 report, we discussed the tax gap for one group of taxpayers\u2014 self-employed persons who provide services (GAO/GGD-95-59, Dec. 28, 1994; GAO/GGD-95-157, June 2, 1995; GAO/T-GGD-95-176, June 6, 1995). (See pp. 19, 26, and 27.)", "Tax Compliance Burden Facing Business Taxpayers. As business taxpayers strive to comply with federal, state, and local tax requirements, they expend time, incur costs, and experience frustrations. We define this effort as \u201ctaxpayer compliance burden.\u201d Using available studies on federal compliance burden, supplemented with interviews of business taxpayers, we found that the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code, compounded by the frequent changes made to the code, is the source of most business taxpayer burden. Determining a reliable estimate of the cost of such burden would be costly and in itself burdensome on businesses. In testimony, we provided examples of code provisions and of IRS\u2019 administration of the code that are most problematic to business. We also provided some of the businesses\u2019 suggestions for simplification (GAO/T-GGD-95-42, Dec. 9, 1994). (See p. 18.)", "Pricing of Intercompany Transactions (Transfer Pricing). Transfer pricing affects the distribution of profits and therefore taxable income among related companies and sometimes across tax jurisdictions. Abusive transfer pricing occurs when income and expenses are improperly allocated among related companies to reduce certain companies\u2019 taxable income. Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code allows IRS to reallocate income among related parties if it finds violations. In an April 1995 report, we (1) provided information on IRS\u2019 recent experiences in dealing with transfer pricing issues and its use of available regulatory and procedural tools and (2) updated earlier analyses showing how many U.S.-controlled corporations and foreign-controlled corporations paid no U.S. income tax. In 1993 and 1994, IRS examiners found, as they had in previous years, many section 482 violations. Also, as in past years, IRS sustained less than 30 percent of the proposed adjustments. According to IRS officials, certain procedural tools, such as measures to obtain information and stronger penalties, had served mostly as deterrents. It was too soon to assess the success of transfer pricing regulations issued in July 1994 (GAO/GGD-95-101, Apr. 13, 1995). (See p. 22.)", "California\u2019s Experiences in Taxing Multinational Corporations.  A worldwide formulary apportionment system has been proposed by some state tax officials and other tax experts as an alternative to the existing tax system. In a July 1995 report, we discussed the issues to be considered before a federal formulary apportionment could be adopted. Also, we discussed California\u2019s experience with its own version of the advocated federal system in which multinational enterprises apportion a share of their worldwide income to California. The California formulary approach can be applied to income from a single corporation or from a group of affiliated corporations (GAO/GGD-95-171, July 11, 1995). (See p. 30.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assist Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["To ease taxpayer frustration and increase the likelihood of voluntary compliance with the tax laws, IRS must (1) treat taxpayers fairly, (2) provide timely and accurate assistance, and (3) communicate clearly. Several of our fiscal year 1995 products dealt with those issues.", "Treating Taxpayers Fairly. Several initiatives have been undertaken in recent years to better protect taxpayers, including enactment of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights in 1988 and internal IRS efforts to treat taxpayers as customers and to improve its operations. IRS has a wide range of controls, processes, and oversight offices to govern the behavior of its employees in dealing with taxpayers. Despite the many controls intended to protect taxpayers, we found examples that fell within our definition of taxpayer abuse. We concluded that IRS needs to specifically define taxpayer abuse and develop management information about it to identify and rectify future instances of abuse. We recommended that IRS strengthen its controls in several areas and provide additional information to taxpayers that will increase their ability to protect their rights. Such steps would enable IRS and Congress to better evaluate IRS\u2019 performance in protecting taxpayers\u2019 rights (GAO/GGD-95-14, Oct. 26, 1994). (See p. 34.)", "Telephone Assistance. Many taxpayers who seek help through IRS\u2019 telephone assistance program are not getting it. Even with increased productivity, IRS has not kept pace with the significant growth in the number of calls received. IRS employees answered about one out of two calls in fiscal year 1989 but only one out of four calls in fiscal year 1994. Even with new technology, IRS has been unable to provide the level of telephone service provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and four private sector companies we contacted. We recommended that IRS improve its technology to include real-time call traffic monitoring and management, using the routing capability of its telecommunications vendor and fully implementing the features of call routing technology already available (GAO/GGD-95-86, Apr. 12, 1995). (See p. 41.)", "Improving IRS Notices. Each year IRS sends millions of notices to taxpayers concerning the status of their tax accounts. We reviewed 47 of the most commonly used notices and identified clarity concerns with 31 of them. We also found that IRS\u2019 ability to improve its notices is adversely affected by limited computer programming resources and higher priority programming requests. Further, the lack of a system to track the progress of proposed notice language changes limits IRS\u2019 ability to oversee notice clarity improvements. We recommended changes to its current notice generation process and a new system to monitor proposed notice text revisions (GAO/GGD-95-6, Dec. 7, 1994). (See p. 37.)", "Improving Forms and Publications. Providing taxpayers with easy-to-read tax forms and publications is a difficult task for several reasons. The tax code is frequently revised, consequently many publications must also be revised annually under short time constraints. In addition, taxpayers\u2019 comprehension levels vary. Generally, we found IRS\u2019 process for developing and revising tax forms and publications reasonable. IRS maintains a dialogue with tax professionals and attempts to generate as much feedback as possible from taxpayers. We recommended that IRS take additional steps to identify the specific concerns of individual taxpayers. Specifically, gathering information on the nature of taxpayer questions through its toll-free telephone system and making greater use of IRS field personnel who have more contact with taxpayers should generate additional useful feedback to IRS (GAO/GGD-95-34, Dec. 7, 1994). (See p. 39.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enhance Effectiveness of Tax Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Congress continues to seek equitable ways to reform the current tax system. At the same time, it adopts tax incentives and preferences to promote certain social policy goals. The result is often foregone revenues to the federal treasury. In response to congressional requests, we provided information on two such incentives, the Earned Income Credit (EIC) and the research tax credit.", "Earned Income Credit. The EIC is a major federal effort to assist the working poor. Established in 1975, Congress intended that the EIC (1) offset the impact of Social Security taxes on low-income workers and (2) encourage low-income individuals to seek employment rather than welfare. Congress and IRS have long been concerned about EIC noncompliance.  In 1988, according to IRS, about 42 percent of the EIC recipients received too large a credit and about 34 percent of total EIC paid out may have been awarded erroneously. Limited studies since then by IRS suggest that noncompliance is still a problem. Further, some EIC recipients are illegal aliens who may receive the EIC if they meet the credit\u2019s eligibility rules. Awarding the EIC to illegal aliens, however, works at cross-purposes with federal policies that prohibit illegal aliens from legally working in the United States. An IRS analysis of some tax returns filed in 1993 provided enough information to convince IRS officials that about 160,000 EIC recipients probably were illegal aliens at that time. To better target the EIC to the working poor, IRS needs to change some of the definitions used to determine eligibility and develop better measures of EIC filers\u2019 resources to determine their eligibility (GAO/GGD-95-27, Oct. 25, 1994; GAO/GGD-95-122BR, Mar. 31, 1995; GAO/T-GGD-95-136, Apr. 4, 1995; GAO/T-GGD-95-179, June 8, 1995). (See p. 45.)", "Benefits from the Research Tax Credit. In 1981, Congress created the research tax credit to enhance the competitive position of the United States in the world economy by encouraging the business community to do more research. The credit has been extended six times and modified four times since its inception. It expired in June 1995. Legislation to extend the credit was introduced but had not been enacted as of December 31, 1995. We took no position on whether the research credit should be made a permanent part of the tax code or allowed to expire given the lack of empirical data for evaluating the credit\u2019s net benefit to society. We said that the credit\u2019s net benefit to society would ideally be evaluated in terms of the ultimate benefits derived from the additional research that it stimulated and not just on the basis of how much research spending it stimulates for a given revenue cost. We suggested that Congress review the base of the credit periodically and adjust it as needed because the credit can become too generous or too restrictive over time. We presented evidence from corporate tax returns indicating that the accuracy of the credit\u2019s base had eroded significantly since 1989 (GAO/T-GGD-95-140, Apr. 3, 1995; GAO/T-GGD-95-161, May 10, 1995).

In testimony and a companion report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, we discussed IRS\u2019 progress in implementing its $8 billion modernization program and described serious management and technical weaknesses that must be corrected if TSM is to succeed. We made numerous recommendations for improving IRS\u2019 business management and information systems management and development capabilities so that TSM is better focused to meet IRS\u2019 mission needs. IRS has several efforts under way to deal with our concerns and has developed an action plan for implementing our recommendations (GAO/T-AIMD-95-86, Feb. 16, 1995; GAO/AIMD-95-156, July 26, 1995).

In accordance with the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990, we reported the results of our efforts to audit IRS\u2019 Principal Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1994. The report included an assessment of IRS\u2019 internal controls and its compliance with laws and regulations. As in prior years, we were unable to express an opinion on the reliability of the financial statements. Our report discussed the scope and severity of financial management and control problems and IRS\u2019 actions to remedy them and updated the status of recommendations from our audits of fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Overcoming these problems will be difficult because of the long-standing nature and depth of IRS\u2019 financial management problems and the antiquated state of its information systems (GAO/AIMD-95-141, Aug. 4, 1995).

We issued a series of reports on federal program areas considered to be high risk because they are especially vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. This report discussed one such area, IRS\u2019 management of its accounts receivable. IRS\u2019 failure to resolve nearly $156 billion in outstanding tax delinquencies has not only lessened the revenues immediately available to support government operations but could also jeopardize future taxpayer compliance by giving the impression that IRS is neither fair nor serious about collecting overdue taxes. In spite of several initiatives to solve this problem, IRS has been unable to significantly improve the accuracy of its delinquent accounts inventory, slow the growth in accounts receivable, or accelerate and increase the collection of overdue taxes. IRS still lacks needed information to guide collection efforts, its collection process is outdated and inefficient, and its decentralized organizational structure makes dealing with problems that cut across the agency difficult (GAO/HR-95-6, Feb. 1995).

Since 1991, taxpayer use of installment agreements has grown considerably, and such agreements have accounted for a growing portion of IRS\u2019 collection activity. Much of the growth occurred after April 1992 when IRS streamlined the installment agreement approval process. IRS internal auditors reported that some taxpayers were using installment agreements when they were able to fully pay taxes. This practice conflicts with IRS\u2019 intent to encourage installment agreements for taxpayers who cannot otherwise pay their taxes in full when they are due. In addition, the auditors were concerned about the ease with which taxpayers could accumulate additional tax debt by adding new income tax liabilities to existing installment agreements. We raised concerns about certain administrative aspects of the program and recommended changes whereby IRS would (1) provide taxpayers more information about the terms, conditions, and costs of installment agreements and (2) experiment with several methods for reducing installment agreement servicing costs (GAO/GGD-95-137, May 2, 1995).

This report discussed IRS\u2019 procedures for processing and posting tax returns in which the primary filer does not provide a Social Security Number (SSN) or provides a name and SSN that do not match SSA records.

From 1986 through 1994, the average annual growth rate of accounts on the invalid segment of the IMF was more than twice the growth rate for accounts on the valid segment. IRS paid $1.4 billion in refunds on returns that were posted to the invalid segment of the IMF for tax year 1993. No one knows how much, if any, of this amount was erroneously paid; however, the risk of error was higher because IRS was less certain of these filers\u2019 identities. We recommended ways IRS could improve the processing of returns with missing or incorrect SSNs and clean up IMF accounts which could adversely affect IRS\u2019 tax modernization plans (GAO/GGD-95-148, Aug. 30, 1995).

Although some gains can be made by reducing administrative burden imposed by IRS, the greatest potential for reducing taxpayer compliance burden is by dealing with the complexity of the tax code. One approach to reducing burden would be to tackle particularly burdensome provisions individually.

By allowing purchasers to \u201clock in\u201d today\u2019s prices, these programs are intended to ease families\u2019 concerns about whether they will have enough money in the future to pay for their children\u2019s college expenses.", "We reported that (1) while none of the seven implemented state programs has achieved an average annual participation rate that seems very high, the programs vary widely among the states; (2) program officials identified several factors as important for maximizing participation\u2014advertising and marketing, a positive public perception of the program, program simplicity and flexibility, and affordably priced benefits; (3) most participants in state tuition prepayment programs come from middle- and upper-income families; (4) program officials considered sliding-scale fees and tax credits poor options for increasing lower-income participation; and (5) some of the major issues concerning the state tuition prepayment programs are the potential effects they may have on students\u2019 educational choices, their appeal to middle- and upper-income families, their value as an investment for purchasers, and the degree of risk they pose for states.", "The most significant issue facing states in establishing and operating a tuition prepayment program, however, is the possible applicability of federal tax provisions to purchasers, beneficiaries, and the programs themselves. This is important because certain tax consequences could make it more difficult for programs to survive. Concerns about taxation have led some states to defer implementation of their programs.", "Officials are most concerned about two potential consequences. First, officials hope these programs are exempt from federal taxes on their investment earnings because paying such taxes makes it more difficult to meet future liabilities. What it takes to qualify as exempt, however, is somewhat unclear, in part because IRS and a federal appeals court have disagreed on the tax status of Michigan\u2019s program and also because other existing programs have not received IRS guidance.", "Second, program officials are concerned that IRS may decide that purchasers or beneficiaries are liable for federal income taxes annually on the imputed interest earned from their investments in prepaid tuition benefits. Officials have been following guidance IRS issued for Michigan\u2019s program, which said that beneficiaries are liable for taxes on the increased value of their prepaid benefits at the time of redemption.
