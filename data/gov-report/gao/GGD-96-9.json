It received the most visitors in 1984, with 14.4 million. The museum had 8.2 million visitors in 1993 and 8.5 million visitors in 1994.", "Since 1976, 106 aircraft have been on display at the Mall museum. Of NASM\u2019s 344 aircraft, 62 are currently on display at the Mall museum and seen by millions of visitors to the museum. Of the remaining 282 aircraft, 210 are stored at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility, Suitland, MD; 58 are on loan to and exhibited by other museums;12 are stored at Dulles International Airport, VA; 1 is stored at the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC), Tucson, AZ; and 1 is at Andrews Air Force Base, MD. NASM estimates that 245 of the 344 aircraft are exhibitable, 55 need minor work to become exhibitable, and 44 need major restoration work. Since the early 1980s, NASM has planned to build an extension facility at Dulles International Airport to replace the Garber facility and to display large aircraft that cannot be shown at the Mall museum.", "The Smithsonian\u2019s earliest acquisition of aviation artifacts was made in 1876, when it received kites from the Imperial Chinese government to celebrate the American Centennial celebration. In 1905, the Smithsonian acquired its first flying machine, Langley Aerodrome No. 5, a model aircraft that made the first successful flight of any unmanned, engine-driven aircraft. Several other aircraft were added to the Smithsonian\u2019s collection before World War I, including the 1909 Wright Military Flyer, the world\u2019s first military airplane.", "In the decade after World War I, the Smithsonian acquired several World War I aircraft. Paul E. Garber, a Smithsonian employee with an interest in airplanes who joined the Smithsonian in 1920, arranged for the Smithsonian to acquire the \u201cSpirit of St. Louis\u201d in 1928, a year after Charles Lindbergh\u2019s historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean. During the 1930s, the Smithsonian added many historic aircraft to its collection, which was housed in a small metal building behind the Smithsonian\u2019s Arts and Industries Building in Washington, D.C.", "In 1946, Congress passed legislation that the Smithsonian establish a separate air museum, which became the National Air Museum.", "Mr. Garber also obtained many of the Smithsonian\u2019s World War II aircraft from a collection assembled by Army Air Force General Hap Arnold, who believed that it was in the national interest to obtain one example of each type of World War II aircraft, including captured enemy aircraft. After World War II, most of these aircraft were stored in an automobile factory building in Park Ridge, IL, until the government sought to reactivate the factory for the Korean War in 1950. That collection subsequently was divided between the Smithsonian and the Air Force. The Smithsonian\u2019s then newly organized National Air Museum acquired its share of the collection, which was moved to a 21-acre tract of federally owned land, located by Mr. Garber, in Suitland, MD, about 7 miles from Washington, D.C. The aircraft were mainly stored outside at Suitland from the early 1950s until they were moved into temporary storage buildings that were constructed primarily in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. \u201cmemorialize the national development of aviation and space flight; collect, preserve, and display aeronautical and space flight equipment of historical interest and significance; serve as a repository for scientific equipment and data pertaining to the development of aviation and space flight; and provide educational material for the historical study of aviation and space flight.\u201d", "According to the legislative history, the museum was designed to display to the public notable exhibits comprising the nation\u2019s air and space collection, including historic and scientific \u201cfirsts\u201d such as the original Wright Brothers flyer, the first to fly at Kitty Hawk in 1903; Charles Lindbergh\u2019s \u201cSpirit of St. Louis,\u201d the first solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927; the first Earth satellites; and Alan Shepard\u2019s Freedom 7 and John Glenn\u2019s Friendship 7, the first manned spacecraft in the Mercury program. Testifying before Congress in 1964, the Director of the National Air Museum said that the museum \u201c. . . cannot accept one of each airplane and launch vehicle. We accept only those of great historical significance.\u201d The congressional report accompanying the authorizing legislation emphasized that NASM would make possible for the first time a comprehensive presentation to the public of the notable exhibits comprising the nation\u2019s air and space collections.", "NASM\u2019s collection tracks the country\u2019s early developments of flight to the most recent space ventures. Although NASM\u2019s collection contains some military aircraft, the museum\u2019s focus is not military aviation. By contrast, other federally funded aviation museums, such as the Air Force Museum in Dayton, OH, and the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, FL, primarily display military aircraft. Further, NASM does not display replicas but restores aircraft to original, although not flyable, condition. NASM\u2019s restorations involve using original parts or locating similar parts, or constructing the parts if they cannot be found.", "Some officials in other air and space museums told us that NASM has very high restoration standards\u2014standards that they said their museums generally could not afford to meet. The Director of the Air Force Museum, for example, said that NASM \u201cwrote the book on aircraft restoration,\u201d and that NASM\u2019s restoration process is \u201cexcruciatingly thorough and detailed.\u201d The Air Force Museum Director also said that the museum cannot afford to follow NASM\u2019s restoration standards and must make compromises in seeking originality. The Director of the Champlin Fighter Museum in Mesa, AZ, told us that NASM\u2019s restoration process is more tedious than Champlin\u2019s. An official from the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson, AZ, told us that his museum tries to put acquired aircraft on display as soon as possible, limiting restoration work to cosmetic changes.

It also received $10.6 million in nongovernmental funds, such as private donations and theater and gift shop revenues. Table 1.1 details the sources of NASM funding for fiscal year 1994.", "Of the $26 million of funds received in fiscal year 1994, NASM spent about $20 million, as of September 30, 1994.

We selected NASM employees based on their involvement with managing the collection for our interviews. Some of the individuals we interviewed contacted us on their own initiative to provide information.", "To compare NASM\u2019s restoration and preservation practices with other federally funded museums, we visited and interviewed officials from the Air Force Museum in Dayton, OH, and the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and obtained data from these museums about their restoration staffing levels. We also visited and interviewed officials from the Champlin Fighter Museum in Mesa, AZ, about its restoration of an airplane for NASM under contract.", "To compare restoration and preservation practices at a nonprofit museum that receives no government funds, we visited and interviewed an official from the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson, AZ. We also interviewed other individuals knowledgeable about NASM\u2019s restoration and preservation policies and practices, including the Director of the San Diego Aerospace Museum in San Diego, CA, and the Air Force Historian. We also reviewed reports from 1988 to 1994 of the Research and Collections Management Advisory Committee, an advisory group consisting of academic and museum professionals that was formed by the most recent NASM Director to provide senior management with outside reviews of museum programs.

The ratio of restorers to total staff at NASM and the Air Force Museum may not be directly comparable, however, because of differences in the museums\u2019 funding, condition of aircraft, number of visitors, and other factors.", "In fiscal year 1994, NASM devoted about $2.7 million to collections management, or 14 percent of its total expenditures. NASM\u2019s collections management department staff work mainly at the Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, MD. Collections management personnel who work at the Garber facility include the restoration staff; personnel who handle the shipping, receiving, and storage of artifacts; the conservator\u2019s staff; and the archival staff. The Garber facility contains the restoration shop, stored aircraft and spacecraft and related parts and artifacts, and film storage. Public access is limited to 3 of the 13 storage buildings at the Garber facility, plus the restoration shop. The archival staff work both at the Garber facility and at the Mall museum, where the photo collections are stored. The collections management department also includes the registrar, who maintains the official object records at the Mall museum. Collections management personnel also maintain the 12 aircraft and 2 hangars that NASM has at Dulles Airport.", "NASM\u2019s restoration staff told us they spend about half of their time working on tasks other than restoration, such as delivering and hanging aircraft, training and supervising interns and volunteers, performing maintenance on shop equipment, research, and administrative work.", "During the past 5 years, NASM completed seven restoration projects, while continuing the restoration of four other projects. These 11 projects involved 3 U.S. aircraft and 8 foreign aircraft. NASM spent about $1.4 million to restore 9 of the 11 aircraft; it did not maintain cost records for the other 2. The largest project undertaken was the restoration of the \u201cEnola Gay,\u201d which took over 10 years to complete at a cost of about $809,000. During the past 5 years, NASM spent a total of $11.3 million for collections management. Table 2.2 shows a list of restoration projects that NASM worked on from 1990 to 1995.", "NASM\u2019s former Senior Curator, who still works at the museum as a volunteer, told us that the restoration staff\u2019s productivity has decreased in recent years. He attributed that productivity decline to (1) the restoration staff being diverted from restoration to other tasks, (2) little or no interest shown by the museum management in restoration, and (3) a decrease in the curators\u2019 involvement in restoration.", "Although NASM prepares a yearly restoration schedule, it does not have a long-range plan for which aircraft it plans to restore beyond the coming year or specifically what work is needed for each airplane in the collection. Further, NASM does not determine the relative importance of each aircraft or whether and how each aircraft will be used in future exhibits. In commenting on a draft of this report, Smithsonian officials said it was more important to explain why an aircraft was collected and what role it plays in the collection than to plan its use in future exhibits.", "NASM does not use any work measurement standards or other estimates of the time it should take to prepare work or aircraft restorations. The Assistant Director for Collections Management told us that she does not have a technical background in aircraft restoration and does not know how long the restoration work should take. She said that she relies on the restoration shop foreman to evaluate the restoration staff\u2019s performance and provide technical guidance to them.", "At our request, NASM estimated the amount of time it would take to restore all aircraft currently in its collection that needed work. NASM said that of the 344 aircraft in its collection, 245 were exhibitable, 55 needed minor work to become exhibitable, and 44 needed major restoration work. Assuming that a 12-person restoration staff worked full-time on restoring aircraft, NASM estimated in May 1995 that it would take about 52 years to restore the 99 aircraft. However, since the restoration staff told us they spend only half of their time on restoring aircraft, we estimated that it would take about 100 years to restore the 99 airplanes, assuming that no additional aircraft needing work were added to the collection, the current staffing trends continue, and the restoration staff continue to spend half of their time on other work.", "When we asked about the rate of restoration at NASM, the former NASM Director said that he saw no need to accelerate the restoration backlog or to plan NASM\u2019s restoration work for the next 50 years because too many changes in restoration techniques would occur over that period. He said that because of the cost of restoring the \u201cEnola Gay,\u201d NASM has adopted a new policy whereby any large planes will be accepted only if they do not need restoration work. He added that the museum\u2019s mission is broader than restoration and includes research and education, which also have to be supported.", "The former director also said that it is harder to obtain additional resources for collections management from outside sources than it is for exhibits. He said that NASM had received some private donations in recent years, including a $250,000 corporate gift that was made after loaning spacecraft and aircraft to Japan, new paint-mixing equipment worth $50,000 from a U.S. corporation, an airplane hangar at Dulles Airport worth $100,000 from a group of local construction companies, $27,000 for the \u201cEnola Gay\u201d restoration from veterans, and restoration of two engines of the \u201cEnola Gay\u201d by the San Diego Aerospace Museum."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collections Management Staff Generally Feel Disenfranchised", "paragraphs": ["We asked members of the collections management staff, including the Assistant Director for Collections Management, the conservator, 10 restorers, 4 employees involved in maintaining the collection, and 3 volunteers, about the rate of aircraft restoration.

Management\u2019s primary responses were that (1) exhibits are generally privately funded and do not take away funds from restoration; (2) the collections management department is tasked with many responsibilities in addition to aircraft restoration; (3) NASM\u2019s requests for increased funding for collections management have been rejected by the Smithsonian or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); (4) NASM\u2019s management staff have backgrounds in museums, aircraft, and management; (5) the Smithsonian requires curators to spend time on research and publishing; (6) the retreat was useful to prepare the museum\u2019s mission statement; and (7) that one manager had opposed creating new exhibits with few or no artifacts.", "A comparison of the collections management staff\u2019s views and management\u2019s responses to them is provided in table 2.3.", "The concerns raised in table 2.3 and NASM\u2019s responses show a high level of disagreement and morale problems among the staff who are responsible for preserving and restoring NASM\u2019s artifacts. While these concerns were not the focus of our review, our overall work in the management area indicates that some of the conflict that exists could be explained by communications problems and the different perspectives of collections management staff and NASM management.", "NASM\u2019s focus on research and exhibits, compared to collections management, also has been cited by the Research and Collections Management Advisory Committee, an advisory group formed by the former NASM Director and consisting of academic and museum professionals. The committee\u2019s 1994 report indicated that curators perceive that research and exhibition are the only work that counts for advancement, and as a result, many do not spend time with the collection, visit the Garber facility, or address collections issues on an ongoing basis. \u201cthe leadership of the Museum must continue to focus its attention on collections management issues. The perception amongst the staff is that the Director is most interested in and concerned with research, publication, exhibition, and scholarship generally, and while the Committee knows of the leadership\u2019s dedication to the collection and its care, it believes that this commitment needs continually to be communicated outward to the rest of the staff: to the curators, who need to be reminded of the realities of limits and resources; and to the collections management staff, which often must struggle internally inside the Museum to get the attention and cooperation of other staff.\u201d", "Morale problems among the collections management staff are not new. According to a 1982 book by a former NASM Director, in the early years of the Garber facility, \u201ca split developed, whereby the people at Silver Hill regarded themselves and were regarded as blue-collar renegades, necessary, but somehow not part of the Smithsonian.\u201d The author added that no one really knew or cared how hard and how well the Silver Hill crew was working. In 1994, the Advisory Committee noted that friction between the curators and collections management staff remained, in spite of improved dialogue and increased contact.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, Smithsonian officials said that feelings of disenfranchisement on the part of the collections management staff resulted from a number of factors, most notably resource-related matters.", "A NASM Collections Management Advisory Committee member also expressed the view that NASM management and exhibits appeared to be geared more toward pleasing academic peers than the public, and that exhibits have too much interpretation of the role that aircraft and spacecraft played in history and society. He cited, for example, the criticism that occurred with respect to the interpretation that was contained in a proposed script for the exhibit of the \u201cEnola Gay,\u201d the aircraft that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan. In January 1995, 81 Members of Congress wrote to the Secretary of the Smithsonian, complaining that the former director\u2019s actions in drafting the exhibit script \u201cwere a slap in the face to all the parties who contributed their time and expertise in creating an exhibit that best reflects the contributions that all Americans made to the culmination of World War II\u201d and demanding the NASM Director\u2019s resignation. On May 2, 1995, the NASM Director resigned, citing the controversy involving the exhibit, which received considerable media attention.

Current conditions are much improved since the time when much of the collection was stored outdoors, and some repairs have been made in recent years to the Garber facility. However, the buildings in which the aircraft are stored do not have humidity controls or air-conditioning, and only a few are heated. As a result, the collection in storage is continuing to deteriorate, including previously restored aircraft. NASM has consistently requested increased funding for collections management and for storage facilities repairs in recent years, but NASM must compete with other Smithsonian museums for limited resources and has been unable to obtain needed funding. In the absence of additional funding, NASM has not developed a strategy to pursue alternatives to lessen the storage burden, such as loaning aircraft to other museums for 5 to 10 years for display in exchange for their restoring the aircraft for NASM or deaccessioning items with less historical or technological significance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inadequate Storage Facilities Are Causing the Collection to Deteriorate", "paragraphs": ["The Smithsonian\u2019s collections management policy, issued in May 1992, requires museums to ensure that collections are maintained in conditions intended to preserve and extend physical integrity.

The National Park Service, which has prepared guidance on museum collection policies, indicates that collections should be maintained in storage facilities with appropriate levels of relative humidity and temperature.", "Much of NASM\u2019s aircraft collection was stored outside in Suitland, MD, from the early 1950s until they were moved into temporary storage buildings that were constructed primarily in the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s. Although moving the aircraft indoors was an improvement over storing them outdoors, the Garber storage facilities are still not environmentally controlled. The wood, fabric, and even metals used in aircraft are susceptible to deterioration and corrosion when exposed to great differences in temperature and humidity, even though aircraft may be protected from rain and snow. Storing the aircraft outdoors and later in facilities that were not environmentally controlled caused aircraft in the collection to deteriorate, which meant that additional restoration work had to be done.", "NASM currently has 236,300 square feet of storage space at the Garber facility, including the restoration shop, and 50,200 square feet of space at Dulles Airport, or a total of 286,500 square feet. Of the 286,500 square feet of space for storage and the restoration shop, 101,500 square feet are heated. The storage space is overcrowded and lacks humidity controls. Overcrowding has resulted in 5 of NASM\u2019s 344 aircraft being stored outdoors: 2 are at Dulles International Airport; 1 is at AMARC in Tucson, AZ;1 is at Andrews Air Force Base, MD; and 1 is on loan at the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson.", "From 1991 to 1994, NASM undertook a conservation assessment, examining the condition of the museum\u2019s 13 storage buildings at the Garber facility and the condition of the artifacts contained in them. According to the assessment, the buildings and artifacts are suffering from wide temperature fluctuations, leaky roofs, structural problems, and dirt and dust accumulation. Moreover, the reports indicated that the building conditions are promoting the deterioration of the collection, including restored aircraft. For example, the assessment on a building that contains restored aircraft indicated that \u201cthe restoration process alone cannot be considered a solution because many restored objects in Building 20 are deteriorating . . . . Almost all recently restored aircraft in Building 20 have evidence of corrosion.\u201d Excerpts from the reports are contained in appendix I.", "The conservation assessment also commented on overall preservation practices at the Garber facility. According to a June 1993 report, \u201che condition of many objects stored at the Garber Facility illustrates what can happen when museum administrators permit a collection to grow and develop without providing direction and funding for its preservation . . . . reservation is a primary museum responsibility, moreso than education, research, or exhibition, given that those functions are, or should be, collection-dependent. Therefore, preservation is not an option or a low priority, nor is it a one-time budget expense. It is a continuous process that requires adequate levels of staffing and funding.\u201d", "In the past 10 years, the Smithsonian spent $9.1 million to improve the Garber facility, including roof repairs, asbestos removal, and storm-water structures, or an average of $910,000 per year. Also, a new artifacts storage building to be shared with the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History (NMAH) and a new chemical building for NASM are being constructed at a cost of about $1.4 million. While these repairs have helped improve conditions at the Garber facility, much more repair work is needed.", "We interviewed officials from the Smithsonian\u2019s Office of Design and Construction, which is responsible for maintaining and repairing Smithsonian facilities and asked about the feasibility of obtaining additional repair funds for the Garber facility. The Design and Construction officials indicated that during the last 5 years, the Smithsonian spent over 8 percent of its total repair funds on NASM facilities (including the Garber facility and the Mall museum), which represent  7 percent of the square footage of all Smithsonian facilities, and spent  5 percent of its total repair funds on the Garber facility alone, which represent 3 percent of the square footage of all Smithsonian facilities. The officials also said that over the next 5 years, the Mall museum needs at least $33.8 million in repairs and that the Garber facility needs at least $7.4 million in repairs. However, the officials said that it is unlikely that NASM will receive the needed repair funds because NASM must compete with other Smithsonian museums for scarce repair funds.", "The Design and Construction officials said that the Smithsonian has a backlog of $250 million in deferred maintenance for all of its museums, can only afford to make about $25 million in repairs each year, and accrues another $32 million to $35 million in additional repair work each year. Because new requirements exceed available funding each year, the backlog of deferred work will continue to grow. The Office of Design and Construction officials also said that recent improvements that have been made to the Garber facility are not expected to last long. They added that some of the Garber buildings have structural problems and may not be repairable.", "NASM must compete with other Smithsonian museums for its overall funding, including collections management, as well as repair funds. In 4 of the past 5 years, NASM\u2019s requests for increased funding for collections management have been turned down either by the Smithsonian or OMB. In fiscal year 1994, for example, NASM requested an additional $395, 000 and 3 additional positions for collections management. The Smithsonian reduced that request to $150,000 and 1 additional position, which OMB rejected. For fiscal year 1996, NASM requested an additional $576,000 and 9 additional positions for collections management.

Judging by the millions of visitors who visit the Museum and by the many letters from the public urging us to step up our efforts to preserve this evidence of flight, there is a broad base of public support for artifact restoration. Sadly, without additional resources, some of our treasures may be lost.\u201d", "Museum officials said that they must rely on federal funds for maintaining their facilities because of the difficulty of raising private funds for storage facilities with no public access.

The official also said that no one from NASM had visited AMARC to inspect its aircraft for 2 or 3 years.

Smithsonian officials said that some curators spend an average of 30 percent of their time on collections management and that one curator spent 3 years working on an engine maintenance program. However, some curators told us that they generally do not inspect the collection unless they have a reason to do so, such as preparing an exhibit involving the artifacts. NASM has adopted a new policy that 0.5 percent of the collection be randomly inspected by 1996 and then the same amount be inspected on a biannual basis.

However, the former senior curator said that it is unclear who is responsible for the collection. The collections management staff said that the Collections Management Department is responsible for the physical care of the collection.

NMAH officials said that in the early 1980s, the museum was forced to decide that it could no longer collect large objects because of the lack of storage space. The officials said that of the seven storage buildings NMAH has at the Garber facility, all have leaky roofs, three have asbestos, and one is quarantined because of asbestos contamination.", "In a 1991 article for a Smithsonian publication, NASM\u2019s conservator said that collections storage is often the most neglected function within a museum. He said that exhibition is generally considered a higher priority and receives a greater share of the funding, and that storage is considered by many to be a static function requiring only space. The conservator also noted that one of the major threats to important collections is poor storage and that as a result of poor storage (1) objects could be misplaced, (2) important information could be lost, (3) irreversible damage could develop and progress go undetected, and (4) theft and damage could go unnoticed for years. NASM\u2019s conservator told us that NASM\u2019s aircraft need more preservation and less restoration.

However, the Research and Collections Management Advisory Committee has recommended that improvements be made to the Garber facility, despite the extension plans. In its 1990 report, for example, the committee noted needed improvements in the chemical treatment facility and welding shop, and overcrowding at the Garber facility.

But, even if NASM were to increase its restoration efforts, the museum would have no place to properly display or store the aircraft. Therefore, it is important for NASM to determine how to better preserve its collection in view of the limited financial resources available for aircraft restoration and storage, including determining what size collection can be adequately supported.", "Since NASM was established, certain aspects of the museum\u2019s mission as a national air and space museum have been vague. For example, the legislation does not specify whether the museum should duplicate collections at other federally funded air and space museums or whether a national museum should include foreign aircraft. Once NASM\u2019s mission is clarified, NASM would be better able to develop criteria for what constitutes historically and technologically significant aircraft and, in the context of such criteria, which aircraft it should have in its collection to fulfill its mission, considering available resources and the adequacy of storage facilities.", "If it is determined that NASM\u2019s current collection is too large in view of resources and facilities available, options to reduce the collection size so that the remaining aircraft can be stored or displayed in space with adequate environmental controls include deaccessioning aircraft and obtaining second-party restorations with temporary loans to other museums. Using additional second-party restorations would help preserve NASM\u2019s collection, alleviate its storage capacity problems, and share its collection with the public.", "The planned extension at Dulles Airport should help alleviate NASM\u2019s storage facility problems, but funding is uncertain and the extension may take several years to complete. One option that may be available to reduce costs would be to limit the new space to the same size of current storage facilities. If feasible, this option should help NASM expedite plans to replace its deteriorating storage facilities with new storage and restoration space at Dulles Airport with proper environmental controls. Including lower cost, limited public access and a few amenities would make the new space more useful.", "In addition to storing aircraft in substandard space, NASM does not have a management plan for each aircraft that describes (1) whether and how the aircraft will be used in future exhibits, (2) to what extent and when it will be restored, and (3) who is responsible for monitoring its condition.", "The lack of resources devoted to collections management has resulted in the restoration staff feeling disenfranchised from the Mall museum staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Smithsonian, together with the Acting NASM Director consult with the appropriate Committees of Congress to better define the mission of a national air and space museum, and within that definition, criteria for identifying historically and technologically significant aircraft.

The Under Secretary disagreed with some of our findings and indirectly indicated disagreement with some of our proposed solutions to the collections care problems that we identified.", "Regarding our first recommendation, the Under Secretary indicated that (1) the Board of Regents will shortly review the scope of NASM\u2019s mission; (2) NASM has rationales that define criteria to assess an object\u2019s value to the collection; (3) when NASM was created, it was recognized that there might be some duplication between NASM and other museums; and (4) the overwhelming emphasis of the NASM collection is American. Our work indicated that the scope of NASM\u2019s mission was unclear. The Air Force Historian, for example, questioned the wisdom of NASM having acquired a large collection of World War II Japanese aircraft. We still believe that the Smithsonian should consult with Congress to better define NASM\u2019s mission and the criteria for identifying historically and technologically significant aircraft. We believe this consultation is necessary primarily because of the inadequate resources NASM has to take care of its current collection and the need to address that problem in a systematic fashion.", "Our recommendations to determine the relative priority of all aircraft in the collection in the context of the criteria for historical and technological significance and determining the number of aircraft that should be retained are parts of our proposed systematic solution to NASM\u2019s storage problems. However, the Smithsonian did not address these recommendations in its comments. Also, while the Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents may help define NASM\u2019s mission, the board is not in a position to decide whether federally funded museums should duplicate military aircraft in their collections. Further, the budget climate has changed since NASM was created, and Congress now may want to look for opportunities to reduce or eliminate duplication. Although NASM officials indicated that the practical criteria for assessing priorities in collecting future space artifacts applies to aircraft acquisitions, the written rationale does not indicate that the criteria also apply to aircraft. Moreover, since most of NASM\u2019s operating costs probably will be paid by federal funds, including the Dulles extension, we believe that Congress should be further involved in determining the role of the nation\u2019s air and space museum.", "With respect to our recommendation to deaccession aircraft that cannot be adequately stored and maintained, the Under Secretary said the Smithsonian tries hard to deaccession aircraft and would welcome additional loans to other museums but cannot always find takers.

However, as discussed in this report, NASM does not prepare long-range plans for exhibits and restorations. We are not suggesting that an exhibit plan be developed for each aircraft in the collection. However, we are suggesting that NASM make determinations about the likelihood of whether aircraft will be exhibited at some point and the extent of restoration that would be needed to put the aircraft that are likely to be exhibited into exhibitable condition. Further, the lack of resources for collections management demonstrates an even greater need for a management plan.", "In response to our recommendation that NASM increase the interaction between the curators and collections management staff, the Under Secretary said that they already collaborate and that such collaboration has developed into a full and genuine partnership. Our interviews with several collections management staff (discussed in ch. 2) disclosed viewpoints that were substantially different from this.
