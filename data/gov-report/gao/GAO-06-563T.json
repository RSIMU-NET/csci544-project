According to the most recent reliable data, about 56 percent of all the individual tax returns filed for tax year 2002 used a paid preparer, with higher paid preparer usage among taxpayers with more complicated returns such as those claiming the earned income credit (EIC). All paid preparers are subject to some IRS regulations and may be penalized if they fail to follow them. For example, all paid preparers must identify themselves on the returns they prepare and must not deliberately understate a taxpayer's tax liability. When the EIC is involved, paid preparers must also ask specific questions to determine a taxpayer's eligibility for the credit. In GAO visits to commercial preparers, paid preparers often prepared returns that were incorrect, with tax consequences that were sometimes significant. Their work resulted in unwarranted extra refunds of up to almost $2,000 in 5 instances, while in 2 cases they cost the taxpayer over $1,500. Some of the most serious problems involved preparers not reporting business income in 10 of 19 cases; not asking about where a child lived or ignoring GAO's answer to the question and, therefore, claiming an ineligible child for the EIC in 5 out of the 10 applicable cases; failing to take the most advantageous postsecondary education tax benefit in 3 out of the 9 applicable cases; and failing to itemize deductions at all or failing to claim all available deductions in 7 out of the 9 applicable cases. GAO discussed these findings with IRS and referred to it problems that were found.

Enrolled agents are approved by  IRS once the agents pass an examination on tax matters or demonstrate  past IRS employment experience. In 2003, the National Taxpayer Advocate  said the number of unenrolled preparers\u2014those not enrolled with IRS\u2014 ranged from 300,000 to 600,000.

However, there are different types of preparers. Paid  preparers who hold professional certification include CPAs and attorneys.  CPAs and attorneys are licensed through state agencies, although  licensure is not focused on their role as tax preparers. CPAs, attorneys,  and enrolled agents are referred to collectively as practitioners. Other  preparers are called unenrolled preparers. This population of preparers is  very diverse, ranging from many of the individuals employed by  commercial tax preparation companies to those who are self-employed.  Some have extensive training and experience and others do not.", "In 2003, we reported to this Committee that while many taxpayers who  used paid preparers believed they benefited from doing so, some were  poorly served. We said that the available evidence did not allow a precise  estimate of the percentage of taxpayers affected, but none of it suggested  that the percentage was large. We reported that preparer mistakes can  cause taxpayers to over- or underpay their taxes, and that taxpayers may  pay for certain services, such as short-term loans called Refund  Anticipation Loans (RAL), without understanding their costs and benefits.  In an April 2003 hearing of this Committee, we testified that taxpayers can  take common sense steps when choosing or working with a paid preparer,  such as:    when searching for a preparer, obtain recommendations from people you    check out your preparer\u2019s qualifications;    make sure you understand the services you will be getting, how much they  cost, and how they will benefit you;    make sure your preparer understands your personal circumstances and  reviews your official tax documents; and  review your completed return before you sign it.", "Although taxpayers should take these common sense steps, IRS also notes  on its Web site under \u201cTips for Choosing a Tax Preparer\u201d that no matter  who prepares a tax return, the taxpayer is legally responsible for all of the  information on that tax return.", "My statement today is based on recent work we have done at the request  of the Committee.

We chose  a large metropolitan area in which several chain preparers were  represented so that we could do our investigation in different sections of  the area. Our staff posed as taxpayers and asked the paid preparers to  prepare, but allow us to file, our federal tax returns under two scenarios.  In one scenario, a plumber and his wife, with one of their children in  college, derived almost all of their income from his job, some work on the  side, and a mutual fund. They had enough deductions of various kinds to  make it advantageous for them to itemize tax deductions using Schedule  A. We had 9 returns prepared for this scenario. In the second scenario, a  low-income single mother was a retail sales worker who had side income  from babysitting. She had one child who lived with her and one who did  not. We had 10 returns prepared for this scenario. In general, we used each  scenario twice when visiting individual chain preparers but at different  outlets. Our 19 site visits cannot be used to generalize our findings to the  retail tax preparation community. We did not visit any law firms, CPA  firms, or single-office tax return preparation businesses.", "To arrive at correct returns for the two scenarios, our staff and staff from  the Senate Committee on Finance and the Joint Committee on Taxation  (JCT) completed the tax returns and agreed on (1) what should and should  not be reported on the returns and (2) the correct refund amount for each  scenario. For each of the 19 visits, we then compared the tax returns  produced with the consensus mock returns. In doing its mock returns, JCT  noted that it relied on the facts we provided and discussions in which we  participated. JCT cautioned that a paid preparer might reach a reasonable  conclusion different from JCT\u2019s on certain issues or on the basis of actual  questions asked or answers given during a site visit. To minimize any  potential for preparers to have legitimately different results from our  returns, we trained our staff to answer preparers\u2019 questions consistently  with the facts we used in preparing our mock returns.

For instance, a preparer must sign the return after it is  completed but before the taxpayer signs it and provide the taxpayer a  copy of the return. The preparer must also put his or her social security  number or other number issued by IRS on the return. The penalty for  failing to meet these requirements is $50 per failure but cannot annually  exceed $25,000 per person for each type of failure.

It requires paid  preparers to take certain actions in determining the taxpayer\u2019s eligibility  for the EIC and the amount of EIC claimed. For instance, preparers are  required to complete an eligibility checklist to determine if a child is a  \u201cqualifying child\u201d by meeting residency, age, and relationship  requirements. Of particular importance in our investigation, a qualifying  child must have lived with the taxpayer for over half of the year.", "Preparers are also subject to criminal sanctions arising from improper  conduct.

Several advised us that reporting such  income was our decision because IRS would not know of it unless we  reported it. One preparer told our investigator posing as a sales worker  that she did not have to report the income unless it was over $3,200.  Another said that her income could not be reported because she did not  have the names and the social security numbers of the children she  watched. On the other hand, the discussion of side income with the paid  preparers (when a discussion took place) often, to the sales worker\u2019s  potential benefit, included detailed probing by the preparer to identify  expenses to offset the income we described.", "The amount of business income we built into our scenarios, and that  preparers often did not include on the tax returns that they prepared, was  not unusual for wage-earning taxpayers who underreported business  income for tax year 2001.

Only 2 of 9 of the plumber\u2019s returns reported the correct  amount of itemized deductions (line 40). Returns done by 2 preparers  claimed the standard deduction, even though it was about $4,000 less than  the total amount of itemized deductions we included in the scenario. Five  other preparers itemized deductions for the plumber, but made other  mistakes. These errors changed the amount of the plumber\u2019s refund,  although sometimes by fairly small amounts. One preparer, however,  missed deductions for property taxes worth about $4,000, meaning that the  claimed refund was hundreds of dollars lower than it should have been.  On the other hand, all 10 of the sales worker returns claimed the standard  deduction, which was to the taxpayer\u2019s advantage in these cases because  she had very few deductions to itemize. In 2002, we reported that as many  as 2 million taxpayers failed to minimize their taxes by failing to itemize  their deductions and that about half of these taxpayers had returns  prepared by another person.", "Foreign tax credit. The plumber\u2019s Form 1099 from his mutual fund  showed a small amount of foreign taxes paid, but only 1 of the 9 preparers  we visited claimed the foreign tax credit (line 47) for which the taxpayer  was eligible.", "Child-care expenses. The sales worker had child-care expenses, but  none of the 10 preparers we visited included the credit for child- and  dependent-care expenses (line 48) for which she was eligible. Some  preparers told her that she could not claim the credit because she did not  have the social security number of her child-care provider. This  information was incorrect. The instructions for Form 2441 state that a  taxpayer who attempts to collect the social security number of his or her  child-care provider but is unsuccessful can report that fact on Form 2441  and still claim the credit.", "Education credits. In the plumber scenario, one of the taxpayer\u2019s  children was a college student in the second year of postsecondary  education, but 6 of 9 paid preparers made some sort of error in  determining the line 50 education credit\u2014either improperly including  items in expenses, not claiming the credit most advantageous to the  taxpayer, or both. The expenses and the year in school made the Hope  education credit far more advantageous to the taxpayer than either the  tuition and fees deduction (line 23) or the Lifetime Learning credit. Of the  9 plumber\u2019s returns, 6 included the Hope credit, but 3 of the 6 preparers  involved improperly included books among the expenses, increasing the  credit by about $100 above what it should have been. One preparer  included the tuition and fees deduction instead of the Hope credit and 2  others claimed the Lifetime Learning credit, reducing the taxpayer\u2019s  refund by hundreds of dollars. In 2005, we reported that many tax returns,  including many prepared by paid preparers, made such suboptimal  choices among the three postsecondary education tax preferences.", "Earned income credit. The EIC on line 66a was another area where paid  preparers made very significant mistakes. Of the 10 returns prepared for  the sales worker, 5 reported two children on Schedule EIC, Earned  Income Credit, instead of the one child who lived with the taxpayer in  2005 and was eligible for the EIC. IRS has estimated that incorrectly  claimed children are the largest category of errors for the EIC, accounting  for about $3 billion of the estimated $8.5 billion to $9.9 billion in EIC  overclaims in tax year 1999. IRS regulations require that paid preparers  ask a series of questions to determine eligibility for the EIC, including  whether children lived with the taxpayer in the United States for more  than half of the year. We were posing as a fairly unsophisticated taxpayer  who was unaware of EIC eligibility rules, so we did not volunteer that one  of our children did not live with us in 2005. Whenever we were asked if our  children lived with us, however, we said that one did and one did not. Only  1 preparer asked all of the required questions. Three preparers asked  about the names, dates of birth, and social security numbers of the two  children but never asked where the children lived in 2005. Three preparers  gave us a worksheet to complete that asked most but not all of the  required questions, but 2 of these preparers still entered two children  when we wrote down that one child did not live with the sales worker at  all during the year. In 1 of these cases, another employee reviewed the  return.", "Refunds. As a result of the errors described above, some claimed refunds  on line 73a on our 19 returns were either substantially higher or lower than  they should have been. Figure 3 shows the deviation from the correct  refund amount under our two scenarios. The pairs of bars shown in the  figure indicate returns prepared by employees affiliated with the same  chain. As shown in the figure, refunds reported for the plumber were  incorrect in all 9 cases\u2014sometimes by only small amounts, but at other  times by substantial sums. Refunds reported for the sales worker were  correct in 2 cases and overstated in the other 8 cases. The paid preparers  that arrived at the refund amount that was $218 too high ignored the sales  worker\u2019s side income but reported the correct number of children living  with her when calculating the EIC. The preparers who arrived at  overclaimed refunds of $1,956 did not include the side income and  reported two children for EIC purposes.", "The 19 paid preparers we visited arrived at the correct refund amount only  twice. On 5 returns, all for the plumber, they understated our refund  amount by a total of $3,465. On 12 returns (4 for the plumber and 8 for the  sales worker) they overstated the refund by a total of $12,169\u2014a total of  $1,735 in overstated refunds for the plumber and $10,434 for the sales  worker.", "Preparer\u2019s identifying information. In addition to various  computational errors, some preparers also did not include identifying  information required on the 1040 forms they completed. IRS regulations  require that paid preparers include a signature or typed name, a social  security number or \u201cPTIN\u201d (an IRS-issued unique identifier for paid  preparers), and the name and employer identification number of their  employer. Four of our 19 returns had no preparer signature and 2 had no  preparer social security number or PTIN. All but 1 return prepared for us  included a company name and employer identification number; that return  was missing all identifying information.", "Preparer services and fees. Most paid preparers we visited offered  services besides the federal tax returns we requested. Some preparers  offered to prepare the state tax return for us. In a few cases the preparer  gave us completed state tax returns along with the federal return and did  not indicate that there was an additional charge. Whenever asked, we said  we only wanted a federal tax return. Electronic filing was always an  option. One preparer proceeded to electronically file our return, even after  we said we wanted to mail in a paper return. In this case, the preparer did  not ask us to provide a personal identification number or ask us directly to  sign a form authorizing the electronic filing, as required by IRS regulations.", "We were also usually offered ways to get our refunds more quickly than  waiting for a check mailed from IRS. Some of these options involved  RALs\u2014short-term loans made to taxpayers and paid off with tax refunds\u2014 and others involved direct deposit alternatives. In some cases, what were  clearly RALs were not described as loans but as \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cbank  products.\u201d One preparer gave us a RAL application to sign at the start of  the visit without explaining what it was we were being asked to sign.  Another preparer told us the size of the refund we could receive in 12 to 48  hours but did not give us the amount we would receive if we were willing  to wait for a check from IRS, did not identify the faster refund as a loan,  and did not explain that the amount we would receive was reduced by the  amount of the fee associated with the option. In this case, the fee for the  RAL was between about $470 and about $570, after subtracting the amount  charged to prepare the return. With a refund amount of about $5,000 and  assuming a 10-day wait for the refund, this means that the annual  percentage rate for the loan was between about 380 percent and about 470  percent.", "The fees charged in our 19 visits varied widely, sometimes between offices  affiliated with the same chain, and were sometimes significantly larger or  smaller than the original estimate we were given. In both the plumber and  the sales worker scenarios, we received 1 set of returns at no cost, and  another paid preparer reduced the fee for the sales worker without  explaining why. Figure 4 shows the fees charged by each of the 19 paid  preparers we visited. The pairs of bars in figure 4 represent the fees  charged by offices of the same chain for the same scenario. In only 1 of the  9 cases where the same firm prepared the same tax return were we  charged the same amount. In some cases, the preparer stressed that one  advantage of purchasing a RAL or paying the fees to arrange for direct  deposit of the refund would mean that the cost of the visit would come out  of the refund and that we would not have to pay any money on the day of  the visit.", "One of the common sense steps we mentioned earlier when choosing or  working with a paid preparer is to make sure you understand how much  the services you are getting cost. For this reason, we asked for an estimate  of fees at the start of every paid preparer transaction. Eight preparers  either did not provide an estimate or gave an estimate with the qualifier  that the fee would depend on the forms required. In the other 11 cases, we  were quoted a fee or a range that did not depend on a variety of forms, and  in 9 of those the fee we were ultimately charged was within the quoted  range, within $30 of the fee quoted, or less than the estimate. Some  preparers provided a detailed receipt showing the forms that were  prepared, but some receipts only showed the final fee. None of the more  detailed receipts, however, included specific costs for individual forms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Problems on Our Tax Returns Could Risk IRS Enforcement Actions against the Paid Preparer, the Taxpayer, or Both", "paragraphs": ["According to IRS officials, paid preparers and taxpayers risk enforcement  action by filing a tax return that includes the types of misstatements or  omissions that we have described. According to the officials, although IRS  seldom has clear evidence about what transpires between a preparer and a  taxpayer, if IRS were to uncover problems with the preparation of real tax  returns similar to several that we found, the preparers would be subject to  civil sanctions.", "Several penalties would be applicable depending on the facts and  circumstances of each situation. IRS officials said that if the preparers had  been preparing tax returns to be actually filed, many of them would have  been subject to civil penalties for such things as negligence and willful or  reckless conduct. For example, as stated earlier in our testimony, if a paid  preparer encourages a taxpayer not to report or to erroneously report  transactions on his or her tax return, resulting in a tax-due understatement  or refund overstatement, the preparer could be assessed penalties of up to  $1,000 for willful or reckless disregard of tax rules and regulations. In  both of our scenarios, information provided to preparers included self- employment income that the preparer did not encourage reporting.  According to IRS officials, the preparer is clearly responsible for properly  reporting all income, including the self-employment income in these  scenarios, on a taxpayer\u2019s return. They added that although preparers are  not required to audit taxpayers to uncover unreported income, they must  make reasonable inquiries to correctly report income.", "IRS officials also said that civil penalties would be applicable to other  issues we encountered, depending on the facts and circumstances.  Preparers who did not ask all the EIC due diligence questions would be  subject to the penalty for the failure to be diligent in determining EIC  eligibility. Similarly, preparers who improperly included hundreds of  dollars of books in the education credit taken would be subject to a  penalty for negligence.", "IRS officials we spoke with, who included representatives of Criminal  Investigation, said that although the dollar amounts of errors made by the  practitioners might not result in prosecutions, criminal sanctions such as  willful preparation of a false or fraudulent return might apply.", "In addition to paying the tax due after correcting the return and any  related late payment interest, the taxpayer may also be assessed a penalty,  depending on the facts and circumstances of each situation, according to  IRS officials. For example, if taxpayers substantially understate income,  overstate deductions, or provide other incorrect information resulting in  decreased tax or improperly high refunds, they may be assessed an  accuracy-related penalty. The penalty could be assessed for any failure to  comply with the tax laws, including the failure to report self-employment  income.", "Because the returns we had prepared were not real returns and were not  filed, penalties would not apply.

Errors in this context changed either the tax due or the amount  to be refunded. A similar statistically significant relationship existed for all  income groups of $80,000 and below that we studied. Of course, as noted  before, it is important to remember that tax preparers are used more often  on some more complicated returns than on some simpler ones, although  we were unable to gauge the full extent to which this might be true. Also,  the fact that errors were made on a return done by a paid preparer does  not necessarily mean the errors were the preparer\u2019s fault; the taxpayer  may be to blame. The preparer must depend on the information provided  by the taxpayer.", "The different error rates for paid preparer and self-prepared returns  translated into different amounts that taxpayers owed IRS after audit. For  instance, as shown in table 8, taxpayers using a paid preparer owed a  median of $363 to IRS after audit, compared with a median of $185 for  taxpayers preparing their own returns. This type of disparity in taxes owed  existed for every income level we studied except for the $40,001\u201360,000  and $60,001\u201380,000 ranges in which the differences were not statistically  significant.", "Table 9 shows some specific Form 1040 line items for which the NRP paid  preparer and self-prepared error rates differed from each other in a  statistically significant way. We also found problems with these line items  in our visits to paid preparers. For example, NRP audits revealed that, for  the Form 1040 line showing the amount of standard deduction or itemized  deductions taken, about 23 percent of self-prepared individual returns had  errors, compared with about 31 percent of returns done by paid preparers.

Undoubtedly, many paid preparers do their best to provide their clients  with tax returns that are both fully compliant with the tax law and cause  them to neither overpay nor underpay their federal income taxes.  Furthermore, as we observed in 2003, it is easy to understand how the  complexity of the tax code brings many taxpayers to conclude that they  should turn to a paid preparer.", "As we also observed in 2003, however, our tax system depends on  taxpayers accurately completing and filing their returns. With their  important role in helping taxpayers meet their obligations, paid preparers  become a critical quality-control checkpoint for the tax system. Where we  saw serious problems in our few visits, these same preparers may make  similar mistakes on the genuine tax returns they complete this year. Their  mistakes and misstatements may also ripple even further through the  system as the taxpayers they serve may come to believe that, for example,  non-W-2 business income does not have to be reported, and they may even  spread that misinformation among their friends and neighbors. In light of  the importance of paid preparers in our tax system today, knowing if what  we found is the exception or the rule in the paid tax preparation services  industry is critical. With better information about the extent of problems,  IRS can better target its limited enforcement and education resources.", "Finally, our observation in 2003 that taxpayers who choose to use paid  preparers need to be wise consumers is even more important today in light  of our most recent findings.

The  preparer also asked about which year the college-age child was in  schooling and whether the tuition in question had been paid in 2005,  questions needed to determine the applicability of the Hope education  credit. While the preparer did not ask about side income, when the  taxpayer volunteered that he had non-W-2 income, the preparer included it  on the return without discussing whether to either change it or not report  it. The preparer also probed for expenses to offset it.", "The refund on the completed tax return was only $4 below the correct  amount.
