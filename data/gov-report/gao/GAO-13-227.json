This initiative called for the administration to establish a  baseline on the extent of improper payments. In July 2001, as part of its  efforts to advance the PMA initiative, OMB revised Circular No. A-11 by  requiring 16 federal agencies to submit data on improper payments,  including estimated improper payment rates. Section 831 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 included the provisions  commonly referred to as the Recovery Auditing Act (RAA).required, among other things, that all executive branch agencies entering  into contracts with a total value exceeding $500 million in a fiscal year   The RAA  have cost-effective programs for identifying errors in paying contractors  and for recovering amounts erroneously paid.", "Fiscal year 2011 marked the eighth year of the implementation of IPIA as  well as the first year of implementation of IPERA.

In addition, IPERA generally repealed the RAA and included a  new, broader requirement for agencies to conduct recovery audits, where  cost effective, for each program and activity with at least $1 million in  annual program outlays. This IPERA provision significantly lowered the  threshold for required recovery audits and expanded the scope for  recovery audits to all programs and activities, including grant and loan  programs. IPERA also added new accountability provisions. For example,  in its improper payments reporting, an agency is to describe how it  ensures that agency managers, programs, and states and localities  (where applicable) are held accountable for meeting applicable improper  payment reduction targets as well as establishing and maintaining  sufficient internal controls to prevent improper payments and promptly  detect and recover those improper payments that are made."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Requirements Related to Identifying, Estimating, Reducing, Recovering, and Reporting Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["The following sections describe key provisions of IPIA, the RAA, and  IPERA.", "Under IPIA, executive agencies were required to annually review all  programs and activities that they administer and identify any that may be  susceptible to significant improper payments.

OMB\u2019s implementing guidance  for IPERA also states that for those agency programs not implemented  directly by federal or state agencies or governments, agencies may also  consider establishing these accountability mechanisms. OMB encouraged  agencies to leverage new technologies and techniques to assist them in  preventing and reducing improper payments.

Because of DOD\u2019s long-standing and pervasive financial  management weaknesses, the department did not have complete and  accurate populations of payments from which to select statistical  samples. We also identified deficiencies related to its (1) sampling  methodologies and (2) maintenance of key documentation supporting its  improper payment estimates.", "The foundation of reliable statistical sampling estimates is a complete,  accurate, and valid population from which to sample. However, the  department\u2019s long-standing and pervasive financial management  weaknesses precluded it from validating the completeness of its payment  transaction populations. For example, DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2011 Statement  of Budgetary Resources (SBR) reported nearly $1,017 billion in gross  outlays in fiscal year 2011. As previously shown in figure 2, the outlays  for the eight programs for which the department reported improper  payments totaled $617 billion. DOD attributed most of the difference  between the SBR gross outlays and outlays for the eight programs to  intragovernmental transactions and trust fund transfers, which IPERA  exempted from improper payment estimation and reporting requirements.  However, the department was unable to reconcile these two outlay  amounts. DOD acknowledged in its fiscal year 2011 AFR that reported  outlays for the eight programs could not be reconciled to gross outlays  reported in the SBR. As a result, DOD could not ensure that all required  outlays for improper payment reporting purposes were included in the  sample populations.", "Although DOD had documented methodologies for developing improper  payment estimates, DOD did not establish and perform key quality  assurance procedures, such as reconciliations, on its program  populations to validate that the populations were complete and accurate  before selecting the statistical samples that were used to estimate  improper payments. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that control activities such as reconciliations are an  integral part of an entity\u2019s planning, implementing, reviewing, and  accountability for stewardship of government resources and achieving  effective results. An effective reconciliation process would involve  comparing transactions to supporting documentation, systems of record,  or both to ensure the completeness, validity, and accuracy of financial  information. An effective reconciliation process also involves resolving  any discrepancies that may have been discovered and determining if  unauthorized changes have occurred to transactions during processing.", "In addition to the lack of complete, valid, and accurate populations,  deficiencies in DOD\u2019s procedures as documented in its sampling  methodologies further impaired DOD\u2019s ability to produce reliable improper  payment estimates. First, DOD\u2019s sampling methodologies are based on  the use of simple random samples to select payments to review for  improper payments and thereby derive error rates. Using these  methodologies, each transaction in the programs\u2019 sample populations had  an equal chance of selection without regard to the complexity of the  transaction or its risk of being an improper payment. OMB guidance  states that agencies will need to utilize complex sample designs to the  extent their payment population contains wide-ranging dollar amounts,  types of payments, or both.", "In addition, DOD did not use a sampling unit that was statistically  appropriate for any of its programs. For example, the sampling unit for  travel pay for fiscal year 2011 was the travel voucher. Each voucher had  an equal chance of selection in the samples upon which improper  payment estimates were based. However, DOD\u2019s travel pay transactions  range in complexity from an individual soldier\u2019s relocation to payments  made on travel vouchers involving multiple travel orders. As another  example, DFAS commercial pay\u2019s sampling unit was an individual  invoice. As DOD reported in the fiscal year 2012 AFR, a $10 million  invoice had the same chance of being sampled as a $100 invoice.  Generally, higher dollar payments involve more complex transactions and  thus are at greater risk of being an improper payment. If a population  contains a few large invoices and many smaller invoices, equal probability  sampling is unlikely to capture the large invoices. DOD\u2019s sampling  methodologies do not account for this risk. By not designing more  complex sampling methodologies that utilize more statistically appropriate  sampling units, such as dollars paid, DOD\u2019s improper payment estimates  could be significantly understated.", "Further, DOD provided evidence that it used its sampling methodologies  to calculate statistically valid improper payment error rate estimates and  related confidence intervals for military pay, civilian pay, and travel pay for  fiscal year 2011, but did not provide such evidence for military health  benefits, military retirement, USACE commercial pay, or USACE travel  pay. Additionally, DOD did not generate statistically valid improper  payment dollar value estimates for any of its programs. For instance,  DOD did not use appropriate weights to calculate the reported dollar  value estimates. Moreover, DOD did not derive confidence intervals for its  improper payment dollar value estimates for any of its programs.  Generally accepted statistical standards require the calculation and  disclosure of confidence intervals around an estimate with a specified  degree of confidence. Confidence intervals are a measure of the  possible difference between the sample estimate and the actual  population value, providing an idea of how close the sample estimate is to  the actual population value.", "As previously mentioned, DOD did not statistically derive an estimate of  improper payments for DFAS commercial pay for fiscal year 2011, but  instead limited its reporting to known improper payments. Although DOD  reported a statistically derived improper payment estimate\u2014  $100.1 million\u2014for DFAS commercial pay for fiscal year 2012, the  sampling methodology used to produce this estimate had deficiencies  similar to the methodologies used for the department\u2019s other programs.", "For example, to estimate DFAS commercial pay improper payments,  DOD did not use a statistically appropriate sampling unit or a  methodology that considered large dollar amounts or the level of  complexity of the related payments. In its AFR for fiscal year 2012, DOD  noted that the department had identified $318.3 million in known improper  payments for DFAS commercial pay for fiscal year 2012. Further, DOD  cited the sampling methodology as the main reason for the difference  between the reported estimate of $100.1 million and the known amount of  $318.3 million for DFAS commercial pay improper payments, which  provides further evidence of how the deficiencies we identified in the  sampling methodologies adversely affect the reliability of the resulting  estimates. In our July 2009 report, we recommended that DOD develop  and implement a statistically valid methodology to estimate and report  commercial improper payments (contract and vendor over- and  underpayments). This recommendation remains valid given the issues we  have found during the course of this review.", "DOD did not have procedures in place to collect and maintain key  supporting documentation needed to substantiate the improper payment  estimates reported in its fiscal year 2011 AFR. For example, DOD did not  maintain complete supporting documentation for the populations of  transactions, from which statistical samples were selected, for most of the  programs for which improper payment estimates were reported. This  deficiency contributed to our determination that DOD\u2019s reported improper  payment estimates were not reliable.
