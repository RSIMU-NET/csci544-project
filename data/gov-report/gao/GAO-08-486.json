To answer these questions, GAO obtained from Labor a list of grants for fiscal years 2001 through 2007, and reviewed relevant laws and Labor's internal grant award procedures.

Under the initiatives, Labor awarded 349 grants totaling almost $900 million to foster this change. However, the grant initiatives were not fully integrated into Labor's strategic plan or overall research agenda; therefore, it is unclear what criteria Labor will use to evaluate their effectiveness. Labor lacks data that will allow it to compare outcomes for grant-funded services to those of other federally funded employment and training services. While grants under all three initiatives are now awarded competitively, the initial noncompetitive process for High Growth grants was not adequately documented and did not include key players. Community Based and WIRED grants have always been awarded competitively, but more than 80 percent of High Growth grants were awarded without competition. Labor began awarding some High Growth grants competitively in 2005 and Congress required Labor to award certain grants competitively in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. This requirement applies only to those years. Labor could not document criteria used to select the noncompetitive High Growth grants or whether these grants met internal or statutory requirements. Labor has taken steps to strengthen the noncompetitive process, but these procedures do not explicitly require documentation of compliance with statutory program requirements. Labor's process for identifying solutions for industry workforce challenges did not include the vast majority of local workforce investment boards, which oversee local employment and training services. Labor provides some monitoring for grantees under all three initiatives and uses a risk-based monitoring approach for the High Growth and Community Based grants, but not for WIRED. Labor has a process to address findings from single audit reports, but its inspector general found problems with Labor's follow up on the completion of these audits for its grantees in general and recommended that Labor put procedures in place to do so.

We obtained a list of all  High Growth, Community Based, and WIRED grants from Labor for fiscal  year 2001, the first year High Growth grants were awarded, through fiscal  year 2007. We assessed the reliability of these data by (1) reviewing the  data for obvious errors and completeness, (2) reviewing related  documentation, and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about  the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We also interviewed relevant Labor officials and  persons with recognized workforce and training expertise. To determine  the extent to which the process used competition, was adequately  documented, and included key players, we reviewed relevant laws, Labor\u2019s  internal procedures for awarding grants, and Labor\u2019s inspector general\u2019s  report on High Growth grants. Out of a universe of about 340 grantees  provided by Labor at the time of our review, we selected 8 for in-depth  study. These were selected because each grant exceeded $1 million, and  they represented the range of grant types. These grantees were located in  seven states: Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania,  New York, and Washington. For each grantee, we conducted semi- structured interviews and reviewed each grantee\u2019s application and recent  quarterly reports.

Under WIA, each state establishes a  state workforce investment board that, among other duties, determines  strategic priorities, current and projected employment opportunities, and  job skills necessary to obtain such employment.  It also designates local  workforce investment areas across the state and develops an allocation  formula for distributing funds to those local areas. Each local area is  governed by local workforce investment boards that make decisions about  the number and location of one-stop career centers, where partner  programs make their services and activities available. Local boards are  required to promote employers\u2019 participation in the workforce investment  system and assist them in meeting hiring needs. Training services provided  must be directly linked to occupations in demand in the local area. To  further the involvement of employers, WIA requires that more than half the  members of each state and local workforce investment board be  representatives of business. The purpose of the one-stop system is to  increase the employment, retention, and earnings of job seekers and, by  increasing their occupational skills, enhance the productivity and  competitiveness of the national economy. WIA requires states and  localities to track the performance of WIA-funded activities and Labor to  hold states accountable for their performance in the areas of job  placement, employment retention, and earnings change.", "The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) oversees the High  Growth, Community Based, and Wired grant initiatives. The vast majority  of these grants are awarded under a provision of WIA, which provides  authority for demonstration, pilot, multi-service, research, and multi-state  projects, and a provision of the American Competitiveness and Workforce  Improvement Act (ACWIA), which provides authority for job training  grants funded by the H-1B visa program.", "Labor is required to conduct impact evaluations of its programs and  activities carried out under WIA, including pilot and demonstration  projects. While impact evaluations make it possible to isolate a program\u2019s  effect on participants\u2019 outcomes, there are several ways to conduct them,  including experimental and quasi-experimental methods. In 2004 and  2007, GAO recommended that Labor comply with WIA requirements to  conduct an impact evaluation of WIA services to determine what services  are most effective for improving employment-related outcomes. Labor  agreed with our recommendation. In December 2007, the agency  announced it had begun a quasi-experimental evaluation\u23afan impact  evaluation that does not use a control group\u2014of the WIA Adult and  Dislocated Worker programs, with a final report expected in November  2008.", "Federal law recommends, but does not require that all grants be awarded  through competition. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act  encourages competition in grant programs, where appropriate, to ensure  that the best possible projects are funded. In addition, Labor\u2019s own  guidance governing procurement and grant operations\u2014the Department  of Labor Manual Series\u2014states that competition is recommended, unless  one or more of eight exceptions apply. Further, a guide on improving  grant accountability developed by the Domestic Working Group Grant  Accountability Project recommends grants be awarded competitively  because competition facilitates accountability, promotes fairness and  openness, and increases assurance that grantees have the systems in place  to efficiently and effectively use funds to meet grant goals.", "Effective monitoring is also a critical component of grant management.  The Domestic Working Group\u2019s suggested grant practices states that  financial and performance monitoring is important to ensure  accountability and the attainment of performance goals. Labor monitors  most grants through a risk-based strategy based on its \u201cCore Monitoring  Guide.\u201d A key goal is to determine compliance with specific program  requirements. The guide includes five monitoring areas: program design  and governance, program and grant management systems, financial  management systems, service, and product delivery, and performance  accountability. In addition, entities receiving Labor grants are subject to  the provisions of the Single Audit Act if certain conditions are met.  The  act established the concept of the single audit to replace multiple grant  audits with one audit of a recipient as a whole. As such, a single audit is an  organization wide audit that covers, among other things, the recipient\u2019s  internal controls and its compliance with applicable provisions of laws,  regulations, contracts, and grants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grants Are Intended to Change the Workforce System, but Labor Will Be Challenged to Evaluate Their Impact", "paragraphs": ["According to Labor officials, the grant initiatives are designed to change  the focus of the public workforce system to emphasize the employment  and training needs of high-growth, high-demand industries, but Labor will  be challenged in assessing their impact.

They characterized High Growth as a systematic change initiative designed  to make the system more demand-driven (i.e., focused on the needs of  growing and high-demand industries) and to make the system\u2019s approach  to workforce development more strategic by engaging business, industry,  and education partners to identify workforce challenges and solutions.   The Computing Technology Industry Association provides one example of  the kinds of activities funded under these grants. It used its High Growth  grant to expand an apprenticeship program in a growing industry\u2014 information technology. As a related effort, the Community Based grants  were designed to build the training capacity of community colleges for  high-growth, high-demand occupations. In expanding existing training  programs and developing new programs aimed at addressing worker  shortages in three high-demand health care occupations\u2014nursing, dental  hygiene, and health unit coordinators, the Seattle Central Community  College in Washington provides an example of efforts funded under these  grants. The goal of third grant initiative, WIRED, was to \u201ccatalyze\u201d the  creation of high-skill and high-wage opportunities for workers within the  context of regional economies, to test models for integrating workforce  and economic development, and to demonstrate that workforce  development is a key driver in transforming regional economies. The  northeast region of Pennsylvania provides one example of the types of  projects funded through WIRED. Pennsylvania is using WIRED grant funds  to develop Wall Street West, a nine county regional project intended to  provide backup and disaster recovery operations and facilities for the New  York City financial markets.  According to Labor officials, these funds  support workforce education and training to support this effort. From  2001 through 2007, Labor awarded 349 grants totaling almost $900 million  for these initiatives (see table 1). For a list of these grants, see appendix II.", "While Labor said the three grant initiatives were necessary to shift the  focus of the workforce investment system, experts held varying opinions  on the extent to which state and local workforce boards were pursuing  demand-driven strategies on their own. Of the experts we spoke with, one  said that many states were already focusing on high-growth sectors,  reaching out to industry, and developing strategic partnerships. Another  characterized innovation among workforce boards as a normal curve that  ranged from highly functional to less than functional. One said that some  boards had always been pursuing these types of strategies. Another said  that the system had been lacking in this regard.", "In addition, when considering how extensive demand-driven practices  might have been, experts identified a number of systematic factors that  might explain why workforce boards would face challenges in pursuing  them. These included insufficient funding, limited flexibility in how funds  can be used, statutory requirements to target services to certain groups of  workers, and the need to respond to local economic conditions.  Commenting on workforce boards\u2019 ability to form strategic partnerships,  one expert noted that there are no funds to support such endeavors and no  performance standards to measure them. With regard to regional  economic development, experts said boards are structured around local  areas, not regions, regional economies are highly variable, regional  governance structures can make achieving buy-in difficult and that rural  areas can be particularly challenged in pursuing regional approaches.", "Beyond the question of how extensive demand-driven practices were,  Labor officials said a number of indicators show that the initiatives are  changing the system. According to Labor, they have seen a \u201csystem-shift\u201d  in the approach to implementing workforce solutions through an increase  in demand-driven topics at conferences since the roll out of the initiatives.  Labor said this shift has been driven by partnerships between the  workforce investment system, business, industry, and educators using the  High Growth framework. Labor also said it is seeing demand-driven  strategies in state and local strategic plans and in states using their own  money to fund High Growth-like projects. Labor pointed out that the  system has evolved to the point where high performing local workforce  boards with demand-driven practices are mentoring lesser performers.  Lastly, Labor said the content on its Web site, Workforce3 One, was also  evidence of change. For example, Labor held an interactive seminar  broadcast on this site to train participants to use an on-line tool to share  curricula developed through the initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Years after Awarding the First Grant, Labor Will Be Challenged to Evaluate Their Impact", "paragraphs": ["Despite the money invested and emphasis placed on these initiatives,  Labor did not fully integrate them into its strategic plan or ETA\u2019s research  plan from the start. The Government Performance and Results Act states  that strategic plans shall contain strategic goals and objectives, including  outcome-related, or performance goals, and objectives for an agency\u2019s  major functions and operations.  However, the strategic plan includes  performance goals only for the Community Based initiative. High Growth  and WIRED\u2014the two initiatives where Labor spent the most money\u23afare  mentioned in the strategic plan, but not specifically linked to a  performance goal; therefore, it is unclear what criteria Labor will use to  evaluate their effectiveness. Moreover, the data needed to assess the  performance of these initiatives are not specified. Labor officials said the  strategic plan did not address the initiatives because it focuses on budget  issues. Just as the initiatives are not fully integrated into the strategic plan,  neither are they fully integrated into ETA\u2019s research plan, which cites  plans for future evaluations, but it does not specify an assessment of their  impact.", "Not fully incorporating the initiatives into its strategic or research plans  may have limited Labor\u2019s ability to collect consistent outcome data. Labor  said that prior to 2005, it consistently collected data from grantees on the  number of participants enrolled in and completing training funded under  High Growth\u2014the only one of the three grant initiatives operating at that  time. However, it did not collect performance outcomes similar to those  being collected for its other training and employment services. In 2005,  Labor instituted what were called common measures to assess the  effectiveness of one-stop programs and services. The common measures  include participant employment outcomes, earnings, and job retention  after receiving services. Currently, Labor cannot require High Growth and  Community Based grantees to provide data on the common measures until  it receives OMB approval. According to Labor, it can collect such  measures for WIRED grantees, but it has not yet done so. As a result,  Labor may not have consistent data for individuals participating in the  programs funded under the grant initiatives. In addition, it may lack data  that will allow it to compare outcomes for individuals served by grant- funded programs with those served by employment and training programs  offered through the one-stop system. Having comparable outcome data is  important because the goal of an impact evaluation is to determine if  outcomes are attributable to a program or can be explained by other  factors.", "Labor will face challenges in obtaining the data necessary to make  meaningful comparisons. Starting in 2006, Labor included information on  the common measures in all new solicitations for High Growth and  Community Based grants, notified grantees of its goal for standardizing  performance reporting, and provided technical assistance to help grantees  prepare for it. Labor also encouraged grantees to work with local  workforce system partners to leverage their experience in tracking and  reporting performance outcomes. Labor anticipates having an OMB  approved reporting format in place by July 1, 2008.  However, because  some of the first grantees have already completed their projects, obtaining  information about workers that have left the program may prove difficult  and costly.", "Labor has some plans underway to evaluate the initiatives, but may face  challenges drawing strong conclusions from them. Labor has conducted  an evaluation of the implementation and sustainability of 20 early High  Growth grantees. It is now evaluating the impact of the training provided  by High Growth grantees. Labor anticipates the final report in December  2008. However, Labor has already experienced a number of challenges in  evaluating the initiatives. These include having to limit its evaluation to  only 6 grantees of 166, because only 6 had sufficient participants to ensure  a statistically significant evaluation.  They also include problems gaining  access to workers\u2019 earnings data, and inconsistent outcome data from  grantees.", "Labor officials said they plan to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of  the Community Based initiative.

This phase will also include an examination of the feasibility of performing  an impact evaluation and will be completed in late 2008.  Depending on the  results of this phase, Labor officials said an impact evaluation will begin in  2009.", "For its evaluation of the WIRED initiatives, Labor says it is examining the  implementation and cumulative effects of WIRED strategies, including  change in the number and size of companies in targeted high-growth  industries and whether new training led to job placement in the targeted  industries. It contracted with the Berkeley Policy Associates to conduct  the evaluation for the first 13 grantees, and a final report is expected by  June 2010.

Labor officials said they review these reports and follow up with grantees  if there are questions.  Labor officials acknowledge, however, that they are  still working to ensure the consistency of performance reports provided  by High Growth and Community Based grantees and are working with  OMB to establish consistent reporting requirements. In addition, while the  finding was not specific to these three grants, Labor\u2019s inspector general  cited high error rates in grantee performance data as a management  challenge. Labor is taking steps to improve grant accountability, such as  providing grantee and grant officer training.", "All grantees receive technical assistance from Labor on how to comply  with laws and regulations, program guidance, and grant conditions. For  example, Labor issued guides for High Growth and Community Based  grantees which include information on allowable costs and reporting  requirements. In addition, Labor officials said they trained national and  regional office staff to address grantees\u2019 questions and help High Growth  and Community Based grantees obtain assistance from experts at Labor  and other grantees. Labor officials said they hold national and regional  High Growth and Community Based grantee orientation sessions for new  grantees, present technical assistance webinars and training sessions  focused on specific high-growth industries, assist grantees with  disseminating grant results and products, such as curricula, and set up  virtual networking groups of High Growth grantees to encourage  collaboration.", "Labor officials told us they have teams who provide technical assistance to  each WIRED grantee including weekly contact. During these sessions,  Labor staff work with WIRED grantees on grant management issues, such  as costs that are allowed using grant funds. Labor staff provide additional  assistance through conference calls, site visits, and documentation  reviews. In addition, Labor officials said they have held five webinars on  allowable costs and provided grantees with a paper on allowable costs in  July 2006, which was updated in July 2007. Finally, Labor officials  explained that they made annual site visits for the first 13 WIRED grantees  in spring and summer of 2007 to discuss implementation plans and  progress toward plan goals. In addition, Labor staff said they have  reviewed the implementation of the remaining WIRED grants to ensure  that planned activities comply with requirements of the law. However,  none of these reviews resulted in written reports with findings and  corrective action plans.", "Labor has spent $16 million on contracts to provide technical assistance,  improve grant management, administration, and monitoring, and to assist  Labor with tasks such as holding grantee training conferences. The larger  of these contracts focus on providing technical assistance to WIRED  grantees. For example, one contract valued at over $2 million provides  WIRED grantees assistance with assessing regional strength and  weaknesses and developing regional economic strategies and  implementation plans. Another grant, valued at almost $4 million, provides  a database and geographic information system that WIRED grantees can  use to facilitate data analysis and reporting, among other things. For a list  of these contracts, see appendix III.", "While these monitoring and technical assistance efforts are useful to help  grantees manage their grants, they do not provide a risk-based monitoring  process to identify and resolve problems, such as compliance issues, in a  consistent and timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Provides Risk-Based Monitoring for High Growth and Community Based Grants", "paragraphs": ["Labor uses a risk-based strategy to monitor grants under two of the three  grant initiatives: High Growth and Community Based.  For these initiatives  it selects grantees to monitor based on indications of problems that may  affect grant performance. Labor\u2019s risk-based approach to monitoring most  grants reflects suggested grant practices. Suggested grant practices  recognize that it is important to identify, prioritize, and manage potential  at-risk grant recipients for monitoring given the large number of grants  awarded by federal agencies. Through this process, Labor staff determine  if grantee administration and program delivery systems operate, the  grantee is in compliance with program requirements, and information  reported is accurate.", "Labor\u2019s risk-based monitoring strategy involves conducting site visits  based on grantees\u2019 assessed risk-levels and availability of resources,  among other things. These site visits include written assessments of  grantee\u2019s management and performance and compliance findings and  requirements for corrective action. For example, Labor\u2019s site visit guide  includes questions about financial and performance data reporting  systems, such as how well the grantee maintains files on program  participants.", "Labor has monitored about half of the High Growth grants and over one- quarter of the Community Based grants. Labor officials said these  monitoring efforts have resulted in a number of significant findings which  have generally been resolved in a timely manner. (See table 4.) For  example, during a November 2006 site visit of a Community Based grantee  Labor identified three findings: incomplete participant files, failure to  follow internal procurement procedures, and missing grant partnership  agreements. Similarly, during a site visit in spring 2006 to a High Growth  grantee, Labor found that the grantee did not accurately track participant  information and reported incorrect information on expenditures, among  other things. As of September 2007 Labor said these findings had been  resolved (see table 4).", "As another part of Labor\u2019s risk-based monitoring strategy, Labor\u2019s internal  requirements specify that Labor staff are to make site visits to all new  grantees, including High Growth, Community Based, and WIRED, within  12 months of beginning grant activity and to new grantees rated as \u201cat  risk\u201d within 3 months. Labor officials said they consider \u201cnew grantee\u201d site  visits to be orientation visits and had not made visits to most new  grantees.   They said they broadly interpret this requirement to include a  variety of methods of contact and generally use teleconference and video  conference training sessions rather than site visits, based on the  availability of resources. For example, Labor calls each new Community  Based grantee to schedule new grantee training. Labor is taking steps to  update its internal requirements to better reflect the purpose of the new  grantee monitoring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Is Planning to Develop a Risk-Based Approach for Monitoring WIRED Grants, but It Has Not Yet Done So", "paragraphs": ["Labor officials said they are developing a WIRED grant assessment tool,  but it is not finalized.

Labor officials  explained that a specific tool is needed for monitoring WIRED grants  because the site visit guide used for most other Labor grants would not be  appropriate for WIRED grants. One reason is that WIRED grants are  awarded to states but are generally administered by other entities.

Because  of poor planning, the agency will not be able to perform the kind of  comprehensive impact evaluation that would have been possible if it had  been collecting data consistent with that collected for other WIA programs  all along. Because Labor lacks such data it will be challenged in drawing  strong conclusions from its planned evaluations. Until Labor collects  consistent outcome data, such as the common measures, that would allow  comparison of impact of each of the three grant initiatives to those of  other Labor programs, Labor cannot know the extent to which the  initiatives improve employment outcomes, if at all.", "The vast majority of High Growth grants\u2014more than $263 million\u2014 were  awarded noncompetitively using inconsistent selection criteria under a  process that was not adequately documented. As a result there is little  assurance that the grants selected were the best possible projects.  Although Labor currently awards grants under all three grant initiatives  competitively, the fact that Labor used inconsistent selection criteria that  changed over time and did not adequately document the process when  awarding High Growth grants noncompetitively raises questions about  how Labor uses this method of awarding grants. This is a critical concern  given that Labor could again award millions of dollars of noncompetitive  grants. While it has taken steps to strengthen the noncompetitive process,  the newly developed procedures do not explicitly identify the statutory  program requirements for which compliance should be documented.", "Finally, the absence of a risk-based monitoring approach for WIRED puts  Labor at risk of not knowing if the millions of dollars awarded to WIRED  grantees have been used for the purposes they are intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To determine the impact of the three grant initiatives, ensure that the best  possible projects are selected, and improve accountability of grant funds,  we recommend that the Secretary of Labor take the following three  actions:    Take steps to ensure that the department can evaluate the impact of the  initiatives so that it can draw strong conclusions based on its evaluations,  such as following through with plans to collect consistent data, integrating  the initiatives into its overall research agenda with relevant performance  goals and indicators, and including these initiatives in its assessment of the  impact of WIA services.", "Direct the Employment and Training Administration to identify the  statutory program requirements for which compliance must be  documented when awarding noncompetitive grants.", "Develop and implement a risk-based monitoring approach for WIRED and  a schedule for its use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the report to Labor for review and comment.

We agree that  the agency has taken initial steps, but these do not ensure that they will be  able to assess the initiatives\u2019 impact.  We do not dispute that the strategic  plan mentions the initiatives; however, we found that both the strategic  and research plans do not tie the High Growth or WIRED initiatives to  performance goals, making it unclear what criteria Labor will use to  evaluate their effectiveness.  In response to the first recommendation,  Labor also disputed a claim that we did not make, namely that the  initiatives belong in the assessment of WIA services.", "In response to our second recommendation, Labor said it recently  developed procedures to document noncompetitive grant proposals\u2019  compliance with statutory requirements.  In its comments and in its  corrective action plan to address Labor\u2019s inspector general\u2019s findings,  Labor noted that its new procedures for reviewing noncompetitive grant  proposals included determining if they met these requirements and  requires documenting this.  Labor\u2019s inspector general is in the process of  reviewing these corrective actions to determine their adequacy.  Our  review of the documents supporting these new procedures found no  specific reference to statutory program requirements against which  proposals would be checked for compliance. We revised our draft  recommendation to clarify that we are asking Labor to identify the  statutory program requirements for which compliance should be  documented.", "In response to our third recommendation, Labor said it plans to implement  a risk-based monitoring approach for the WIRED initiative.   Given that  Labor has not yet done so, we stand by our recommendation that they  follow through with this effort.", "In its comments Labor disagreed with several of our findings and stated  that  the initiatives were not considered research projects and were not  designed to compare participant outcomes with the participant  outcomes achieved under the WIA formula program; workforce boards face no challenges that cannot be overcome in  pursuing demand driven practices that are encouraged under the  three initiatives;   it is not improper to modify criteria for selecting grantees when the  agency assessment of workforce needs changes; and  there are no specific rules for documenting the decision-making  process for noncompetitive grants, but agreed that additional  documentation would be valuable and indicated that it has taken  steps to require such documentation   While we recognize that the grants awarded under these initiatives were  not research projects per se, many were funded as pilots and  demonstrations and by statute were required to have an evaluative  component.  Although Labor says that it did not intend to compare the  initiative participants\u2019 outcomes with those of participants in WIA formula  programs, its own documents suggest that these types of comparisons are  warranted.  We stand by our findings that workforce boards face  challenges implementing demand-driven approaches.  Labor  acknowledged their efforts to provide workforce boards with assistance in  this area. Regarding selection of noncompetitive, High Growth grantees,  the fact remains that Labor could not provide specific criteria used for  selecting these grantees and told us that these criteria changed over time.   Although Labor\u2019s statement that no rules exist for documenting decision  making runs counter to federal principles for internal controls, it indicated  that it is taking steps to address this issue.", "Labor officials also provided technical comments that we incorporated  into the report where appropriate.

We reviewed available solicitations for  grant applications to understand the purpose and goals of the grants and  to identify the kinds of outcome data that Labor expected from grantees\u2014 three for competitive High Growth grants, three Community Based grants,   and two WIRED grants.  In addition, we interviewed the appropriate Labor  officials and also public workforce experts from the Upjohn Institute, the  Council on Competitiveness, the National Governors Association, the  National Network of Sector Partners, the Urban Institute, the National  Association of State Workforce Agencies, and the National Association of  Workforce Boards to obtain their views on the grant initiatives and  workforce system activities. We also obtained a list of all High Growth,  Community Based, and WIRED grants awarded between fiscal year 2001  and 2007 to determine the amounts, the source of funding, and the timing  of the awards. We assessed the reliability of the individual grant data  Labor provided by (1) reviewing the data for obvious errors and  completeness, (2) reviewing related documentation, and (3) interviewing  agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition,  we reviewed the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) and the American  Competitiveness Act (ACWIA), the two primary laws under which the  funding for these grants was authorized.", "We also conducted site visits. Out of a universe of about 340 grantees  provided by Labor at the time of our review, we selected eight for more in- depth study, conducted semi-structured interviews of grantees and state  and local workforce officials, and reviewed grantees\u2019 proposals and recent  quarterly reports. We visited six grantees in five states\u2014Colorado, Florida,  New Hampshire, New York, and Washington and contacted two additional  grantees by telephone in Illinois and Pennsylvania. Four criteria were used  to select these grantees: (1) grant type\u2014we selected an industry/business  representative, a community college, and a representative of the public  workforce system for High Growth grantees;  three community colleges  for the Community Based grantees; and two regional grantees for WIRED;  (2) geographic location\u2014the sites represented different regions of the  country; (3) time period\u2014for the High Growth grantees, we selected two  that received a grant through the noncompetitive process and had been  operating 3 or more years and one grantee that competed for its award and  was 2 years old; all of the Community Based were 2-year-old grants; and  the WIRED grantees represented the first generation, which were only 1  year old; and (4) award amount\u2014we selected grantees with awards that  exceeded $1 million.", "In examining the extent to which the process used competition, was  adequately documented, and included key players, we reviewed  documents regarding the processes used to award both competitive and  noncompetitive grants, and interviewed officials.
