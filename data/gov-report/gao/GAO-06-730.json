The act generally requires the services to develop recovery plans for endangered and threatened species--species facing extinction or likely to face extinction, respectively. Recovery plans identify threats to the species' survival and the actions needed to mitigate those threats. Proposed amendments to the act are under consideration and GAO was asked to provide information to facilitate this effort. In April 2006, GAO issued a report providing high-level information on the extent to which recovery plans contain estimates of when species are expected to be recovered, among other things. This follow-on report provides more detailed information on the factors that affect species recovery and the importance of recovery plans in recovery efforts. For 31 species--selected because they were nearing recovery, or had significant attention devoted to them and thus would be expected to be making progress towards recovery--GAO (1) identifies factors affecting the length of time to recover the species and (2) describes the role recovery plans have played in recovering these species. The Department of the Interior agreed with the facts presented in this report. The Department of Commerce declined to comment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Many factors affect the length of time it takes to recover the 31 species GAO reviewed. Specifically, 19 of these species have been recently delisted (removed from the list of endangered and threatened species) or are likely to be delisted within the next 25 years either because (1) they faced a primary threat that has been or is being mitigated; (2) they were found to be more prevalent than biologists thought at the time they were listed and/or habitats have been secured for the species; or (3) they are expected to respond relatively quickly to recovery efforts because, for example, they reproduce quickly in the presence of good habitat. The remaining 12 species are much farther away from being delisted, and for some, recovery is uncertain. Some of these species are not expected to recover for many decades because they respond relatively slowly to recovery efforts, for example, because they reproduce slowly. Recovery for the remaining species is uncertain either because their habitat is difficult to protect, or because not enough is known about the threats facing the species or how to mitigate those threats. Recovery plans have played an important role in the recovery efforts of nearly all of the species GAO reviewed by identifying many of the actions the services' biologists deemed most important to the species' recovery. The services' biologists report that these actions have contributed, at least in part, to the progress made in recovering these species. For example, recovery of the red-cockaded woodpecker is dependent on having sufficient habitat--the species nests in cavities that they peck out of old pine trees, but logging largely eliminated these trees from the woodpecker's range. The recovery plan identifies measures to protect the habitat, including land acquisition and conservation agreements with landowners, as well as steps to provide artificial nest boxes until pines mature enough to provide natural habitat for the birds. The services' biologists told us that these actions have significantly improved this species' prospects for recovery. However, for about one-half of the species GAO reviewed, actions beyond those in the recovery plans also played an important role in progress toward the species' recovery. For example, the banning of the insecticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1972--a year before the Endangered Species Act was enacted--has been critical to recovery of the bald eagle."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Endangered Species Act of 1973 protects species facing extinction  (endangered species) or likely to face extinction in the foreseeable future  (threatened species), and the ecosystems upon which they depend. The act  has long been a lightning rod for political debate about the extent to which  the nation\u2019s natural resources should be protected, and how best to protect  them. Proponents of the act, and what it seeks to accomplish, believe that it  is important to preserve the unique genetic characteristics of each species  as a practical response to the impact that humans are having on the earth,  and may also believe there is a moral obligation to do so. Some critics of  the act deemphasize the importance of preserving every individual species  and argue that doing so, in many cases, is too costly\u2014especially when  implementation of the act results in restricting uses of public and private  land and resources. Others are critical of the veracity of the data used to  make decisions under the act.", "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries  Service (NMFS), collectively referred to as \u201cthe services,\u201d are the federal  agencies responsible for administration and implementation of the  Endangered Species Act. FWS has primary responsibility for fresh water  and land species, while NMFS has primary responsibility for anadromous  fish and most marine species. The Endangered Species Act outlines criteria  that the services must apply to determine whether a species warrants the  protection of the act, and the process to follow to place the species on the  list of threatened and endangered species. The act also generally requires  the services to develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of  listed species.", "While the act has many provisions that could be evaluated, one of the most  important measures of its success is the number of species that have  \u201crecovered,\u201d or improved to the point that they no longer need the act\u2019s  protection. Since the act\u2019s inception in 1973, about 1,300 domestic species  have been placed on the list of threatened and endangered species, but only a few have been removed (delisted). Supporters of the act claim it is an  indication of success that only nine species protected by the act have  become extinct. Critics, on the other hand, claim it is an indication of  failure that only 17 species protected by the act have recovered.", "Proposed amendments to the Endangered Species Act are under  consideration, and you asked us to provide information on recovery plans  and progress made on their implementation to facilitate this effort.  In an  April 2006 report, we provided high-level information on 107 randomly  selected recovery plans covering about 200 species. We reported on the  extent to which these plans contained estimates of when a species is  expected to have recovered, among other things. In this report, for a  nonprobability sample of 31 species, we provide a more in-depth review of  the efforts undertaken to recover species.  We selected these species  because they are nearing recovery or had significant attention devoted to  them and, thus, would be expected to be making progress towards  recovery. For these 31 species, we (1) identify factors affecting the length  of time to recover the species and (2) describe the role that recovery plans  have played in recovering these species.", "FWS is responsible for 28 of the 31 species we reviewed. NMFS is  responsible for the remaining three species\u2014the northern right whale and  two distinct population segments (DPS) of the Steller sea lion. Our  assessment of the recovery efforts and description of the role of recovery  plans in those efforts is based primarily on species\u2019 recovery plans, Federal  Register notices associated with the species, and information provided by  biologists at the services that are responsible for recovering the species we  reviewed. We obtained, from FWS and NMFS biologists, estimated time  frames for delisting many of the species we reviewed. It is important to  note that these estimates were based on the assumption that needed  actions would take place, even though funding may not be available to  conduct these actions, or the actions may be out of the services\u2019 control.  Consequently, the estimates provided should be considered best-case  scenarios. Salmon, steelhead, and the desert tortoise were excluded from  our analyses because we have issued comprehensive reports on these  species. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is  presented in appendix I. Information on each of the species we reviewed is  presented in appendix II. We performed our work between September 2005  and August 2006, in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 is to conserve  threatened and endangered species, and the ecosystems upon which they  depend. The act defines conservation as the recovery of threatened and  endangered species so that they no longer need the protective measures  afforded by the act. An endangered species is a species facing extinction  throughout all, or a significant portion of, its range; threatened species are  those likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The act  requires the Secretary of the Interior to publish, in the Federal Register, a  list of species determined to be threatened or endangered. Included in the  definition of species are subspecies of animals and plants, and DPSs of  vertebrate species.", "The act generally requires the services to develop recovery plans for the  conservation and survival of threatened and endangered species, unless the  services determine that a plan will not promote their conservation. The act  directs the services, to the maximum extent practicable, to incorporate in  each recovery plan (1) a description of site-specific management actions  necessary to achieve the plan\u2019s goal for the conservation and survival of the  species; (2) objective, measurable criteria that will result in a  determination that the species can be removed from the list of threatened  and endangered species (i.e., delisted); and (3) estimates of the time and  cost required to carry out those measures needed to achieve the plan\u2019s goal.", "The services develop and implement recovery plans, among other actions,  to reverse the decline of each listed species and ensure its long-term  survival. To do this, recovery plans aim to identify threats to the species\u2019  survival and the actions needed to mitigate those threats. A recovery plan  may include a variety of methods and procedures to recover listed species,  such as habitat acquisition and restoration to prevent extinction or further  decline, and other on-the-ground activities for managing and monitoring  endangered and threatened species. The services\u2019 officials also told us that  recovery plans are important for communicating needed actions to other  federal agencies, state and local agencies, researchers, industry, private  landowners, and others, because the services often depend on other  entities to implement recovery actions. For example, in many cases, FWS  does not have jurisdiction to implement recovery actions on lands  occupied by endangered species, which is important because loss of  habitat is often the principal cause of species\u2019 declines. Recovery plans can  take years or decades to fully implement, depending on the needs of the  species covered by the plan. As of May 2006, the services had approved 580  recovery plans covering about 1,080 species (or about 83 percent) of the  1,300 domestic species protected by the act.", "Once a species recovers, it can be delisted. To determine that a species is  recovered and ready to be delisted, the services follow a process similar to  that used to list a species\u2014they propose delisting a species in the Federal  Register and seek public comment on the action before they finalize the  delisting. The act requires the services to use the same criteria to delist  species that are used to list species. Specifically, to delist a species, the  services must determine that the species is no longer threatened or  endangered based on an assessment of five factors:  (1) whether there is a  present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the  species\u2019 habitat or range; (2) whether the species is subject to  overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational  purposes; (3) whether disease or predation is a factor; (4) whether existing  regulatory mechanisms are inadequate; and (5) whether other natural and  manmade factors are affecting the species\u2019 continued existence.", "Besides delisting species because they have recovered, species can also be  delisted if they are found to be extinct, or if the original data used to list the  species is found to be in error. For example, if additional analysis finds the  species is not unique but rather a member of a more prevalent species, its  listing becomes unwarranted. As of May 2006, FWS reports that a total of 41  species have been removed from the list of threatened and endangered  species\u20149 species because they have been declared extinct, 15 species  because original data used to list the species was in error, and 17 species as  a result of recovery efforts.", "In addition, the act requires that the services report biennially to certain  congressional committees on efforts to develop and implement recovery  plans. The services implement this requirement through separate biennial  reports to Congress. FWS\u2019s reports satisfy the act\u2019s reporting requirement  by including a statistic called \u201crecovery achieved.\u201d The recovery achieved  statistic is meant to estimate the extent to which the recovery objectives  for each species have been achieved and reflects the species\u2019 overall  progress towards recovery; it is not the proportion of discrete actions in  the recovery plan that has been completed. It is expressed as a percentage  range\u20140 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100  percent. The FWS report includes this statistic for species under FWS\u2019s  jurisdiction, as well as for those managed jointly with NMFS. NMFS\u2019s  biennial reports to Congress do not include a recovery achieved statistic,  but rather a narrative description of efforts to implement recovery plans.  Additionally, the act requires FWS to submit an annual report to Congress  on federal expenditures for the conservation of all endangered or  threatened species, as well as expenditures by states receiving federal  financial assistance for such conservation activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Factors Affect the Length of Time to Recover Certain Threatened and Endangered Species", "paragraphs": ["Many factors are responsible for the varying length of time it will take to  recover the 31 species we reviewed.

The primary threat to the eagle\u2019s survival  was the widespread use of DDT, an insecticide that caused thin egg shells  and reproductive failure. Thus, although there were other steps that needed  to be taken (primarily addressing loss of important habitat), the banning of  DDT in 1972 was critical to achieving the bald eagle\u2019s recovery. FWS  reports that the eagle is recovered and has recently proposed delisting the  species. Another example is the Magazine Mountain shagreen\u2014a land snail  found only on the north side of Magazine Mountain in Arkansas. The  primary threat to this species was human use of its habitat or areas close to  its habitat. Specifically, the Department of Defense considered using  Magazine Mountain for military exercises, and the state of Arkansas  proposed building a visitor\u2019s center and related facilities on the summit of  the mountain\u2014the highest peak in the state. After the snail was listed,  however, the Department of Defense withdrew its plans for military  exercises in the area, and the visitor\u2019s center and associated facilities were  designed and built so that potential impacts from construction and  operation have been mitigated. FWS biologists told us that the snail\u2019s  population is stable, but that a proposed 3-year study to gather additional  biological information about the species needs to be completed before the  species can be proposed for delisting. Table 1 summarizes some key details  about the eight species.", "Almost all of the eight species nearing recovery due to mitigation of a  primary threat were included in the sample of species we reviewed  because, among other reasons, in FWS\u2019s fiscal year 2001\u20132002 recovery  report to Congres, these species were reported to have achieved 76 to 100  percent of their recovery.

The services\u2019 biologists  expect that all but one of these species will be delisted within the next 10  years. After a species is listed, it typically receives more attention;  sometimes this attention comes in the form of additional funding to survey  for the species, which can lead to finding additional individuals or  populations. The Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly is an example of a  species where the discovery of additional populations, coupled with  management actions to protect those populations, could result in the  species being delisted within the next 6 years. When the butterfly was listed  in 1991, there were only two known colonies and a few individual  butterflies that had been located at two other sites. However, since that  time, monitoring has uncovered nine additional colonies. Habitat  protections, such as prohibitions on collecting all types of butterflies in key  habitat areas, have also helped this species. FWS biologists believe that the  species is nearing recovery but, as some of the colonies were only  discovered between 4 and 5 years ago, additional monitoring is needed.

For example, the Rio Grande silvery minnow, a fish that rarely exceeds 4  inches, was historically found in the Rio Grande and Pecos Rivers.  However, habitat degradation restricted the fish to 5 percent of its historic  range, all in the Rio Grande. To recover the minnow and other endangered  species in the area (including the southwestern willow flycatcher, which is  also reviewed in this report), the river is being restored to a more natural  state. The restoration will transform the deeply channeled river with high  banks that isolate the river from the surrounding floodplain to a more  gently flowing river with broader, lower banks that will provide eddies and  slack water for juvenile minnows. To achieve this, a myriad of property  owners and water-rights interests must be coordinated. Specifically, the  Middle Rio Grande Endangered Species Act Collaborative Program\u2014a  broad coalition of federal, tribal, and local governments; property owners;  and others\u2014is leading efforts to restore the river. Efforts are underway to  physically manipulate the river banks, and the Bureau of Reclamation and  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are manipulating the river\u2019s flow to  create floods that reconnect the river with the surrounding floodplain. FWS  is introducing captively-bred minnows to increase the population size. FWS  biologists report that manipulating the river\u2019s flow regime is an effective  way to create habitat, and that minnow populations increase rapidly when  provided with good habitat.

Although an international agreement has protected the northern  right whale from commercial whaling worldwide since 1935, populations  remain extremely depleted\u2014the current population estimate is about 300  individuals.

However, as of 2005, there is  currently only one population estimated at 76 panthers; its genetic diversity  is being augmented by a closely related subspecies found in Texas. The  habitat this small population currently relies on is at its carrying capacity  and is declining by about one percent per year because of housing and  citrus development. FWS biologists report that, although it is biologically  feasible to recover the panther, they do not believe it is likely this will occur  because of the lack of public support for expanding the current population  and establishing additional populations\u2014actions that rely on additional  suitable habitat being available to the panther.

The bathhouse and the water rights to the spring that feeds the bathhouse  are privately owned. The recovery plan for the isopod calls for an  agreement with the property owner to protect the species\u2014either an  easement, lease, or outright purchase of the property. However, FWS  biologists told us that the property owner has not consented to such an  agreement, although he has taken some actions to protect the species, such  as repairing a fence surrounding the bathhouse that helps protect it from  vandals.

The bats winter in caves or  mines, called hibernacula, that satisfy their highly specific need for cold  (but not freezing) temperatures during hibernation.  The fact that they  hibernate in a relatively small number of caves suggests that very few caves  meet their habitat requirements. FWS biologists originally thought that the  only major threat to the bat was anthropomorphic changes to its  hibernacula. For example, gates installed to control human access to caves  have been documented as major causes of Indiana bat declines because  they prevent bat access or do not allow proper air flow; human  disturbances in caves with hibernating bats have also been found to  adversely affect the species. Yet despite actions to protect the hibernacula  and remove these threats, population levels have not rebounded,  suggesting that the species faces additional threats when not hibernating.

Although not all  of these species are nearing recovery, the success that these species have  had is attributed primarily to the recovery actions identified in the species\u2019  recovery plans. For example, the red-cockaded woodpecker, which is  found in 11 states from Florida to Texas to Virginia, is expected to recover  largely as a result of implementation of actions in its recovery plan. The  species nests in old pine trees and, by creating and maintaining wounds in  the tree that exude resin, exploits the ability of these pines to produce large  amounts of resin. The resin creates an effective barrier against climbing  snakes and prevents nest predation. The woodpecker requires large pine  trees because it excavates a cavity within the heartwood (center) of the  tree. The diameter of the heartwood must be large enough to contain the  entire cavity\u2014otherwise the woodpecker could be entrapped by the resin.  The woodpecker requires pines at least 60 to 80 years old because the  higher incidence of heartwood decay greatly facilitates cavity excavation.  Excavation can take many years, and averages from 6 to 13 years  depending on the type of tree being excavated. The species declined  significantly because logging eliminated much of the woodpecker\u2019s habitat  of old-growth pine. FWS biologists report that, although the woodpecker  was listed in 1970, not enough was known about the species\u2019 biology to  develop the recovery actions necessary to bring about the bird\u2019s recovery  until the mid 1990s. Three of the most significant efforts that have helped  the woodpecker were in the plan\u2014prescribed burns have helped develop  suitable habitat, artificial nesting cavities have provided a stop-gap  measure until existing pine trees mature, and translocation of birds to new  locations with suitable habitat has expanded the population. The plan also  identified measures to protect existing woodpecker habitat on private land,  for example, through conservation agreements. Since the development and  implementation of the recovery plan, woodpecker populations have been  steadily increasing.

In some cases, historic and legal  events have been critical to a species\u2019 recovery. For example, the whooping  crane benefited from protections that occurred before endangered species  legislation was in existence. In the early 1900s, it was recognized that the  crane\u2019s population was decreasing. The major cause of this decline was  thought to be hunting and, as wetlands were drained and turned into  farmland, habitat loss. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1916 prohibited  hunting of the crane (and most other migratory birds in the United States).  The crane also benefited from the creation of two protected areas\u2014one  specifically to protect the crane, the other to protect another species that  shared the crane\u2019s habitat. In 1922, Canada created a national park to  protect a small herd of bison and the crane was later found to summer  there. In 1937, the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas was created to  protect cranes that were currently wintering there. While these actions  were critical to protecting the crane and its habitat, the population  remained low and did not exceed 100 until the winter of 1983\u201384.   Accordingly, the 1980 recovery plan set forth many additional recovery  actions that have greatly helped the species, such as introducing captively- bred cranes into the wild. Perhaps the best-known of these recovery  actions is the use of ultralight aircraft to teach cranes migration routes  between summer and winter habitats.", "Similarly, the Borax Lake chub also benefited from several events not  included in its recovery plan. The chub is a fish, typically less than 2 inches  long, found in Borax Lake and adjacent wetlands in arid southeastern  Oregon.  The lake is fed by several thermal springs that were vulnerable to  geothermal development. The immediate threat was removed when the  energy exploration company speculating in the area abandoned its plans to  pursue development of a hydrogeothermal facility in the Borax Lake area.  These actions were not part of the recovery plan but were critical to  protecting the Borax Lake chub. They were supplemented by  implementation of a key action called for in the recovery plan\u2014purchasing  the privately owned land surrounding the lake.", "For other species, the discovery of new populations has played an  important role in their recovery. For example, Johnston\u2019s frankenia, a small  perennial shrub found in south Texas and an adjacent area in northeastern  Mexico, was listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1984. At the time  of listing, there were only five known populations in Texas\u2014all on  privately-owned lands. However, many private lands had not been surveyed  for the species because of resistance from the landowners. A key action in  the recovery plan was working with landowners to gain access to their  lands to conduct monitoring. Once this was accomplished, the plant was  found to be more prevalent than thought at the time of listing, and FWS  proposed delisting the species in 2003. While the discovery of previously  unknown populations is a fortunate event that cannot be prescribed by a  recovery plan, monitoring and surveying to determine species\u2019 abundance  and distribution can be included in a recovery plan.

However, our in-depth review of these selected species provides  valuable, case-level insights into their progress toward recovery and the  role that recovery plans have played in that progress.", "We used a multi-step process to select the nonprobability sample of species  for review. First, we used three criteria to identify species that were  nearing recovery or had significant attention devoted to them, and thus  would be expected to be making progress towards recovery. These three  criteria were:  (1) species that are nearing recovery as reported by the U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), (2) species with relatively high federal and  state expenditures, and (3) species with at least one full-time staff member  dedicated to recovery. To identify species nearing recovery, we used FWS\u2019s  fiscal year 2001\u20132002 biennial report to Congress on the status of species  recovery. This was the most recent report available at the time we selected  our sample. In this report, FWS provides the percent of recovery objectives  achieved for each species\u2014both for those which it has primary  responsibility, and for those which it shares responsibility with the National  Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). We considered species to be nearing  recovery if they were reported to have achieved 76 to 100 percent of their  recovery objectives. NMFS does not report this measure. To identify  species with relatively high federal and state expenditures, we used the  fiscal year 2003 annual report to Congress of federal and state  expenditures. This was the most recent report available at the time we  selected our species. It provides expenditure data on all listed species,  regardless of which service has primary responsibility. We excluded  salmon, steelhead, and the desert tortoise from this sample, even though  they had relatively high expenditures, because we have issued comprehensive reports on these species.We relied on FWS officials to  identify species that had at least one full-time staff member devoted to  recovery efforts. NMFS officials told us that their staff work in recovery  teams, and that having a full-time staff member dedicated to recovery  efforts would not be a good measure of the resources the agency was  devoting to recovery of the species. We identified 40 species that met these  three criteria.", "Next, because of time and resource constraints, we took several steps to  reduce the 40 species to a more manageable number. We prioritized species  for review by generally selecting all of the species that satisfied at least two  of the three criteria, and species that were nearing recovery and had  relatively low federal and state expenditures (in order to understand how  species can achieve recovery with relatively low expenditures). This  process yielded 20 species for review. As agreed with your offices, we  reviewed all 20 of these species and as many of the remaining 20 species as  time and resources permitted.  To prioritize this second group of 20  species, we excluded certain species from review based on a variety of  factors. For example, we chose to exclude species that were similar, or had  similar habitats, to other species that were already included for review. For  instance, we excluded some populations of the gray wolf from our sample  because we had included the western Great Lakes population of the gray  wolf in our first group of 20 species for review. We also excluded the  Louisiana black bear because of the additional demands that Hurricane  Katrina placed on local FWS staff.
