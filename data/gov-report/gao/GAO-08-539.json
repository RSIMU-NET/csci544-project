GAO was asked to (1) describe how selected states and localities are planning for an influenza pandemic and who they involved, (2) describe the extent to which selected states and localities conducted exercises to test their influenza pandemic planning and incorporated lessons learned as a result, and (3) identify how the federal government can facilitate or help improve state and local efforts to plan and exercise for an influenza pandemic.

In fact, according to officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which administers the federal pandemic funds, all 50 states have developed an influenza pandemic plan, in accordance with federal pandemic funding requirements. At the time of GAO's site visits, officials from the selected states and localities reviewed said that they involved the federal government, other state and local agencies, tribal nations, and nonprofit and private sector organizations in their influenza pandemic planning. Since GAO's site visits, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided feedback to the states, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereafter referred to as states) on whether their plans addressed 22 priority areas, such as policy process for school closure and communication. On average the department found that states' plans had \"many major gaps\" in 16 of the 22 priority areas. In March 2008, HHS, DHS, and other federal agencies issued guidance to states to help them update their pandemic plans, which are due by July 2008, in preparation for another HHS-led review. According to CDC officials, all states and localities that received the federal pandemic funds have met the requirement to conduct an exercise to test their plans. Officials from all of the states and localities reviewed by GAO reported that they had incorporated lessons learned from influenza pandemic exercises into their influenza pandemic planning, such as buying additional medical equipment, providing training, and modifying influenza pandemic plans. For example, as a result of an exercise, officials at the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services (Texas) reported that they developed an appendix to their influenza pandemic plan on school closures during a pandemic. The federal government has provided influenza pandemic guidance on a variety of topics including an influenza pandemic planning checklist for states and localities and draft guidance on allocating an influenza pandemic vaccine. However, officials of the states and localities reviewed by GAO told GAO that they would welcome additional guidance from the federal government in a number of areas to help them to better plan and exercise for an influenza pandemic, in areas such as community containment (community-level interventions designed to reduce the transmission of a pandemic virus). Three of these areas were also identified as having \"many major gaps\" in states' plans nationally in the HHS-led review. In January 2008, HHS and DHS, in coordination with other federal agencies, hosted a series of meetings of states in the five federal influenza pandemic regions to discuss the draft guidance on updating their pandemic plans. Although a senior DHS official reported that there are no plans to conduct further workshops, additional regional meetings could provide a forum for state and federal officials to address gaps in states' planning identified by the HHS-led review and to maintain the momentum of states' pandemic preparedness through this next governmental transition."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic  The Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for Pandemic  Influenza (National Pandemic Implementation Plan) states that in the  Influenza (National Pandemic Implementation Plan) states that in the  event of an influenza pandemic the distributed nature and sheer burden of  event of an influenza pandemic the distributed nature and sheer burden of  disease across the nation would mean that the federal government\u2019s  disease across the nation would mean that the federal government\u2019s  support to any particular community is likely to be limited, with the  support to any particular community is likely to be limited, with the  primary response to a pandemic coming from states and local  primary response to a pandemic coming from states and local  communities.

This structure was formalized in the NRF. The PFO  facilitates federal support to establish incident management and  assistance activities for prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery  efforts while the FCO manages and coordinates federal resource support  activities provided pursuant to the Stafford Act. The PFO is to provide a  primary point of contact and situational awareness for the Secretary of  Homeland Security. In addition, according to an official in HHS\u2019 Office of  the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), HHS has  also predesignated a national Senior Federal Official (SFO) and a regional  SFO for influenza pandemic in each of the five federal influenza pandemic  regions who serve as ambassadors for public health to states, territories,  and the District of Columbia, which aligns with the PFO and FCO  structure. The federal influenza pandemic regions, each of which consists  of two standard federal regions, are shown below.", "In addition, under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of Health  and Human Services has the authority to declare a public health  emergency and to take actions necessary to respond to that emergency  consistent with his/her authorities. These actions may include making  grants, entering into contracts, and conducting and supporting  investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or  disorder that caused the emergency.

The act also prescribes several new preparedness  responsibilities for HHS. Among these, the Secretary must develop and  disseminate criteria for an effective state plan for responding to an  influenza pandemic. Additionally, the Secretary is required to develop and  require the application of evidence-based benchmarks and objective  standards that measure the levels of preparedness for public health  emergencies in consultation with state, local, and tribal officials and  private entities, as appropriate. Application of these benchmarks and  standards is required of entities receiving funds under HHS public health  emergency preparedness grant and cooperative agreement programs.

Unlike Phase I in  which there is no mention of DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Exercise and  Evaluation Program (HSEEP), in Phase II CDC encouraged, but did not  require, recipients to use HSEEP for disaster planning and exercising  efforts. HSEEP guidance defines seven different types of exercises, each  of which is either discussions-based or operations-based. Discussions- based exercises are a starting point in the building block approach of  escalating exercise complexity. These types of exercises typically highlight  existing plans, policies, interagency and interjurisdictional agreements,  and procedures and focus on strategic, policy-oriented issues. An example  of a discussions-based exercise is a tabletop exercise that can be used to  assess plans, policies, and procedures or to assess the systems needed to  guide the prevention of, response to, and recovery from a defined incident.  Operations-based exercises are characterized by an actual reaction to  simulated intelligence; response to emergency conditions; mobilization of  apparatus, resources, and networks; and commitment of personnel,  usually over an extended period. These exercises are used to validate the  plans, policies, agreements, and procedures assessed in discussions-based  exercises. An example of an operations-based exercise is a full-scale  exercise, which is a multiagency, multijurisdictional, multiorganizational  exercise that validates many facets of preparedness. CDC\u2019s federal  pandemic funding guidance for Phase I and II did not explicitly specify the  type of exercises to be conducted; the exception was the mass prophylaxis  exercise for Phase II, which was required to be an operations-based  exercise. In order to be compliant with HSEEP protocols, there are four  distinct performance requirements. They include (1) conducting an annual  training and exercise plan workshop and developing and maintaining a  multiyear training and exercise plan, (2) planning and conducting  exercises in accordance with the guidelines set forth by HSEEP,   (3) developing and submitting an after-action report, and (4) tracking and  implementing corrective actions identified in the after-action report.", "For Phase II, the National Governors Association conducted a series of  nine influenza pandemic regional workshops for states between April 2007  and January 2008 to enhance intergovernmental and interstate  coordination.

For example, officials from the  Florida Department of Health said they used a standardized assessment  tool to assess county influenza pandemic plans on 36 elements such as  surveillance, response and containment, and community-based control  and mitigation interventions. The tool also included a section on strengths  and areas for improvement for each element. Further, New York State  Department of Health officials said that they reviewed all of the county- level influenza pandemic plans and provided feedback. We also found that  in some cases, localities consulted other localities\u2019 influenza pandemic  plans to help them to develop their own plans. For example, officials from  Stanislaus County Health Services Agency (California), Miami-Dade  County Health Department (Florida), and Dallas County Health and  Human Services (Texas) said they reviewed King County\u2019s (Washington)  influenza pandemic plan to help them develop their own plans.", "Officials at all 15 of the states and localities reviewed also said they  assisted other state and local agencies within their jurisdiction in their  influenza pandemic efforts by reviewing each other\u2019s plans or sharing  information. For example, New York State Department of Health officials  said that as the lead agency responsible for influenza pandemic planning  efforts, they participated in and coordinated meetings with other state  agencies such as the Unified Court System and Department of  Correctional Services to discuss areas such as infection control and  community containment, visitation policies during an influenza pandemic,  management of sick inmates, emergency staffing plans, and employee  education and training.", "Officials from 6 of the 15 states and localities we reviewed reported that  they had tribal nations within their jurisdictions. Of these 6, only officials  from California, Florida, New York state, and Miami told us that they had  included tribal nations in their influenza planning efforts, as required by  the federal pandemic funds. For example, officials from the New York  State Department of Health said they provided guidance to the Mohawk  and Seneca tribes in developing influenza pandemic plans. Tribal nation  representatives also had access to the state\u2019s health provider network and  were invited to influenza pandemic training sessions and monthly  influenza pandemic conference calls. Officials from Texas and Taylor  County (Florida) reported that they did not include tribal nations in their  influenza planning efforts. Texas Department of State Health Services  officials reported that there are three tribes within the state with which the  respective counties are coordinating. In Taylor County (Florida), officials  reported that they had not yet involved their local tribe, the Miccosukee  tribe, in their influenza pandemic planning efforts.", "Officials from all five states and four localities also reported that they  provided guidance or technical assistance for continuity planning efforts  to nonprofit organizations, and officials from all five states and seven  localities told us that they provided the same assistance to the private  sector. States and localities that received direct federal pandemic funding  are required to involve nonprofit organizations and the private sector in  planning for an influenza pandemic. For example, Peoria City/County  Health Department (Illinois) officials told us that in addition to contracting  with the Red Cross in providing bulk food distribution services during an  influenza pandemic, they had initial discussions on how to implement  isolation and quarantine. Officials from the New York City Department of  Health and Mental Hygiene (New York) stated that they partnered with the  New York City Department of Small Business Services and conducted six  focus groups with approximately 60 participants from nonprofit and for- profit organizations to provide general information related to influenza  pandemic, and to discuss the continuity strategies from CDC\u2019s Business  Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist and feasibility in adopting them.", "While all five selected states and seven localities have coordinated with  the private sector for influenza pandemic planning, several officials from  state agencies in Florida and Illinois, and local agencies in Los Angeles  County (California), Chicago (Illinois), and Dallas County (Texas) have  focused specifically on critical infrastructure sectors, such as  transportation (highway and motor carriers), food and agriculture, water,  energy (electricity), and telecommunications (communications). Officials  from the Dallas County Department of Health and Human Services (Texas)  said that they assisted a local power company and a grocery chain on  continuity of operations planning for an influenza pandemic. The National  Governors Association reported in its February 2008 issue brief that few  states from its five regional workshops had defined the roles and  responsibilities of private sector entities. Moreover, potential shortages  of critical goods and services\u2014specifically, food, electricity, and  transportation capacity\u2014were cited as key areas of concern across all five  National Governors Association-led workshops. While Idaho, Minnesota,  Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Utah were less concerned  about the food supply due to longstanding practices of stockpiling against  severe weather and other threats, other participating states were  concerned that they did not have agreements in place with the private  sector food distribution and retail systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Has Found Major Gaps in States\u2019 Influenza Pandemic Plans", "paragraphs": ["Since we visited these states and localities, HHS provided feedback to the  states in November 2007 on whether their influenza pandemic plans  addressed certain priority areas, such as fatality management, and found  that there were major gaps nationally in the plans in these priority areas.  In response to an action item in the National Pandemic Implementation  Plan, HHS led a multidepartment effort to review pertinent parts of states\u2019  influenza pandemic plans in 22 priority areas along with other federal  agencies such as the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education,  Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, and State under the auspices of the  Homeland Security Council. For example, DHS was responsible for  reviewing the priority area of how states worked with the private sector to  ensure critical essential services. States were required to submit parts of  their plans that addressed the priority areas to CDC by March 2007. The  participating departments reviewed the pertinent parts of the plans and  HHS compiled the results into individual draft interim assessments, which  included the status of planning for each entity and how they measured  against the national average for the priority areas, and provided this  feedback to the states.", "As shown in table 1, on average, states had major gaps in all areas, with a  ranking of \u201cmany major gaps\u201d in 16 of the 22 priority areas and \u201ca few  major gaps\u201d in the remaining 6 priority areas, as defined by HHS. An  official in HHS ASPR told us that generally, the states fared better in the  public health priority areas such as mass vaccination and antiviral drug  distribution plans than in other areas such as school closures and  sustaining critical infrastructure. As we will discuss in more detail later in  the report, we found that the areas in which state and local officials were  looking for additional federal guidance were often the same areas that  were rated by HHS as having \u201cmany major gaps\u201d in planning.", "Every state received individual comments from CDC on the strengths and  weaknesses of their influenza pandemic plans in six priority areas.  According to HHS officials in ASPR, states also received feedback in some  of the remaining priority areas. In addition, states received general  comments from the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor,  Homeland Security, and Justice. The Departments of Commerce, Labor,  and Homeland Security noted that many state influenza pandemic plans  did not address the effect of social distancing in private workplaces or  state agencies. Nor did they address issues related to loss of jobs and  income for workers, particularly for those needing to stay home to care for  children dismissed from school or to care for themselves or ill relatives.  Further, they concluded that many states needed to develop occupational  safety and health plans that dealt with infection control and other  influenza pandemic issues such as worker behavioral and mental health  concerns.", "HHS, DHS, and other federal agencies issued guidance to states in March  2008 to assist them in updating their current influenza pandemic plans.

Exercises\u2014particularly for the type and magnitude of emergency  incidents such as a severe influenza pandemic for which there is little  actual experience\u2014are essential for developing skills and identifying what  works well and what needs further improvement.", "The first phase of the federal pandemic funds required states and localities  that received this funding to test their influenza pandemic plan. CDC  officials stated that their expectation was that the recipients would  conduct a gap analysis using CDC\u2019s self-assessment tool to identify  objectives to exercise to improve their plans and then exercise the  identified vulnerabilities of their plans, rather than testing their entire  plan. According to CDC officials, all states and localities that received this  funding have met the requirement to conduct a discussions-based or  operations-based exercise to test their influenza pandemic plans and to  prepare an after-action report. The second phase of funding required  states and localities that receive the funding directly to conduct an  exercise that would test an antiviral drug distribution plan and to develop  an influenza pandemic exercise schedule that included medical surge,  mass prophylaxis, and nonpharmaceutical public health interventions  such as closing schools and discouragement of large public gatherings. As  noted earlier, HHS stated that CDC has reviewed whether recipients met  the requirements identified in the Phase II guidance.", "All of the states and localities except for two of the localities in our review  had conducted at least one influenza pandemic exercise to test their  influenza pandemic planning. The two localities that had not conducted  their own exercise had participated in discussions-based exercises in  other jurisdictions. Among the states and localities that had conducted an  exercise, one state and two localities conducted at least one discussions- based and an operations-based exercise, one state and one locality  conducted at least one operations-based exercise, and the remaining three  states and five localities conducted at least one discussions-based  influenza pandemic exercise. For example, the Stanislaus County Health  Services Agency (California) conducted an influenza pandemic  discussions-based exercise and the New York City Department of Health  and Mental Hygiene (New York) conducted both influenza pandemic  discussions-based exercises and operations-based exercises. In addition,  state agencies in New York, Texas, and Illinois conducted or funded  regional influenza pandemic exercises that included multiple jurisdictions  within each state. For example, the Peoria City/County Health Department  (Illinois) participated in an influenza pandemic discussions-based exercise  with nine other counties. According to the National Governors  Association, the states\u2019 influenza pandemic exercises have been almost  exclusively discussions-based exercises and few have held regional or  multistate exercises. In addition, health departments conducted influenza  pandemic exercises at all but one of the states and localities that had  conducted at least one influenza pandemic exercise.

For  example, officials at the New York City Department of Health and Mental  Hygiene (New York) informed us that an influenza pandemic exercise  resulted in identifying a potential shortage of ventilators. In response, they  purchased 70 ventilators that were relatively easy to train staff to use,  which were being used by selected hospitals. Other influenza pandemic  exercises resulted in providing additional training. For example, Stanislaus  County Health Services Agency (California) officials identified the need  for their staff to be trained in the National Incident Management System  (NIMS), which is a consistent nationwide approach to enable all  government, private-sector, and nongovernmental organizations to work  together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents.  All county staff have been subsequently trained in NIMS.", "Furthermore, state and local officials stated that influenza pandemic  exercises led to modifying policies or influenza pandemic plans. Officials  at the Illinois Department of Public Health realized during an exercise that  a judge\u2019s ruling would be needed to quarantine an individual with a  suspected contagious disease. As a result, the department sought and  obtained amendments to its department\u2019s authority that if voluntary  compliance cannot be obtained, then the department can quarantine an  individual with a suspected contagious disease for 2 days before a judge\u2019s  ruling is necessary. In addition, officials at the Dallas County Department  of Health and Human Services (Texas) reported that they identified the  need for, and subsequently developed, an appendix to their influenza  pandemic plan on school closures during a pandemic that included factors  for schools to consider in deciding when to close schools and for how  long."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS and DHS Could Further Assist States in Addressing Gaps Identified in Pandemic Planning", "paragraphs": ["HHS (including CDC), DHS and other federal agencies have provided a  variety of influenza pandemic information and guidance for states and  local governments through Web sites and state and regional meetings.  HHS and CDC have disseminated pandemic preparedness checklists for  workplaces, individuals and families, schools, health care, and community  organizations, with one geared for state and local governments. HHS and  CDC have also provided additional influenza pandemic guidance including  Interim Pre-pandemic Planning Guidance: Community Strategy for  Pandemic Influenza Mitigation in the United States (February 2007).  CDC and other federal agencies are currently considering the Interim  Guidance for the Use of Intervals, Triggers, and Actions in Pandemic  Influenza Planning that was developed by HHS and CDC and provides a  framework and thresholds for implementing student dismissal and school  closure. HHS also issued Interim Public Health Guidance for the Use of  Facemasks and Respirators in Non-Occupational Community Settings  during an Influenza Pandemic, and funded Providing Mass Medical  Care with Scarce Resources: A Community Planning Guide (November  2006). CDC officials stated that the journal CHEST published four papers  on providing mass critical care with scarce resources for all-hazards in  May 2008. In addition, HHS funded guidance on exercising for an influenza  pandemic, including discussions-based exercises for influenza pandemic  preparedness for local public health agencies. Furthermore, the federal  planning guidance for states to update their influenza pandemic plans  provided by HHS, DHS, and other federal agencies includes references to  federal guidance that pertains to the topics on which the states\u2019 plans will  be assessed.

They are also working on guidance on the  prophylactic use of antivirals (administering antivirals to individuals who  had not shown symptoms). However, HHS and DHS officials  acknowledged that the federal government has not provided guidance on  some of the influenza pandemic-specific topics that state and local  officials had told us that they would like guidance on from the federal  government, such as ethical decision making and liability and legal issues.", "There are also two federal Web sites that contain influenza pandemic  information.

Lessons Learned Information Sharing  System (LLIS) officials stated that the best practices are vetted by working  groups of subject matter experts. LLIS has an influenza pandemic topic  area that includes news, upcoming events, plans and guidance, after-action  reports, and best practices. An LLIS representative also informed us that  there is an influenza pandemic forum that acts as a message board for  LLIS users to discuss topics, which have included how to implement  teleworking during an influenza pandemic. In addition, there is an  influenza pandemic channel on the Web site that has a document and  resource library and a message board, including topics such as antiviral  and vaccine planning. HHS officials stated that CDC and LLIS have created  a secure channel for state and local health departments to post and share  influenza pandemic exercise information.

To help coordinate influenza pandemic planning, HHS and  other federal agencies, including DHS, held \u201cState Pandemic Planning  Summits\u201d with the public health and emergency response community in all  states in 2005 and 2006. As part of the summits, the Secretary of Health  and Human Services signed memorandums of understanding (MOU) with  each state that identified shared common goals and shared and  independent responsibilities between HHS and the individual state for  influenza pandemic planning and preparedness. For example, the MOU  between HHS and the state of California noted that states and local  communities are responsible under their own authorities for responding to  an influenza pandemic outbreak within their jurisdictions and having  comprehensive influenza pandemic preparedness plans and measures in  place to protect their citizens. In addition, to further assist states and  localities with their influenza pandemic preparedness efforts, HHS funded  the National Governors Association to conduct a series of influenza  pandemic regional workshops for states, the first five of which are  discussed earlier.

Prior to the meetings, HHS ASPR officials told us  that the workshops would be an opportunity for states to request  additional influenza pandemic guidance from the federal government. We  observed two of the five workshops, and received summaries from HHS of  all five workshops. The discussions at the workshops mainly focused on  the draft guidance and evaluation criteria for the second round of  assessing the state pandemic plans, but the participants also raised  concerns and requested guidance. Some of the common high-level  themes discussed at some of these workshops included a need for more  involvement from federal agencies in communicating with state  counterparts. The March 2008 planning guidance included a list of  contacts and phone numbers in federal agencies for the state officials to  help them to communicate with their federal counterparts as they update  their pandemic plans. Participants also requested guidance on various  topics. Among the five workshops conducted, state officials in three of the  workshops sought guidance on how to handle school closures and ports of  entry issues while state officials in two of the workshops wanted to know  how to plan with CDC quarantine stations. In addition, in three of the  workshops, state officials discussed wanting more critical infrastructure  information or guidance. For example, state officials discussed that there  are challenges for state health departments to work with the critical  infrastructure sectors because they have no authority to influence their  participation in influenza pandemic planning. However, there was not an  opportunity to explore these issues in greater depth during the meetings. A  senior DHS official in the Office of Health Affairs reported that there are  no plans to conduct further regional state workshops on influenza  pandemic.", "HHS, DHS, and the Department of Labor hosted three Web seminars that  provided an overview of the March 2008 planning guidance and included  time for discussion.

Federal agencies could provide  assistance to the states on the priority areas that they rated as having  \u201cmany major gaps\u201d in planning nationally. For example, the Department of  Justice could provide assistance on the coordination of law enforcement,  the Department of Agriculture could provide assistance on the operational  status of state-inspected slaughter and food processing establishments,  and the Department of Education on the policy process for school  closures and communication. With plans due in July 2008 for a second  round of review, states\u2019 plans may still have major gaps that could be  addressed by federal and state governments working together to address  these challenges.", "The meetings could also provide a forum for states to build networks with  one another and federal officials. In our October 2007 report related to  critical infrastructure protection challenges that require federal and  private sector coordination for an influenza pandemic, we found that for  influenza pandemic efforts, DHS has used critical infrastructure  coordinating councils primarily to share influenza pandemic information  across sectors and government levels rather than to address many of the  identified challenges. Thus, we recommended that DHS lead efforts to  encourage the councils to consider and address the range of identified  challenges, such as clarifying roles and responsibilities between federal  and state governments, for a potential influenza pandemic. DHS  concurred with our recommendation and is planning initiatives\u2014with  some underway\u2014to address our recommendation, such as the  development of pandemic contingency plan guidance tailored to each  critical infrastructure sector. Similarly, during the National Governors  Association\u2019s workshops, state officials reported that they would be  interested in the influenza pandemic response activities initiated in  neighboring states, but few, if any mechanisms, exist for states to gain  regional situational awareness. According to the National Governors  Association\u2019s report, the networks that do exist are informal  communications among peers, which are built on personal relationships  and are not integrated into any formal communications capacity or  system. The National Governors Association also reported that states must  coordinate their plans among state, local, and federal agencies and that  this coordination should be tested through exercises with neighboring  states and with relevant federal officials. In addition, the March 2008  planning guidance to help states update their plans notes that among the  keys for successful preparation for an influenza pandemic are  collaborating with other states to share promising practices and lessons  learned and to collaborate with regional PFOs.

Recognizing that we would be limited in our ability to report on all  states in detail, we selected these five states for a number of reasons,  including that these states    comprised over one-third of the United States population;  received over one-third of the total funding from the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) that could be used for planning or exercising for an influenza  pandemic, and each state received the highest amount of total HHS and  DHS funding that could be used for planning and exercising for an  influenza pandemic respectively within each of the five regions established  by DHS for influenza pandemic preparedness and emergency response;  and   were likely entry points for individuals coming from another country given  that the states bordered either Mexico or Canada or contained major  ports, or both, and accounted for over one-third of the total number of  passengers traveling within the United States, and over half of both  inbound and outbound international air passenger traffic to and from the  United States. areas were selected based on having the highest population totals of all  urban areas in the respective states as of July 2006 and high levels of  international airport passenger traffic as of 2005. Three of these urban  areas, Los Angeles County, Chicago, and New York City, also received  federal pandemic funds.", "In addition, we asked the state officials to nominate a rural county for us  to interview in their states based on the following criteria: (1) has  conducted some planning or exercising for an influenza pandemic; and   (2) is representative of challenges and needs that other surrounding rural  counties might also be facing. The state officials in each state nominated  only one rural county. We interviewed officials responsible for health and  emergency management in the nominated counties of Stanislaus County  (California), Taylor County (Florida), Peoria County (Illinois), Washington  County (New York), and Angelina County (Texas). In total we interviewed  officials with 34 different agencies, which included for each state the  health, emergency management, and homeland security agencies, except  for Texas which had a combined emergency management and homeland  security agency, and officials responsible for health and emergency  management for each urban area and rural county in the five states. In  both states and localities we also typically interviewed several officials  from each of the agencies. In addition, in four states and four localities  reviewed, we interviewed the state or local government agencies  individually, and for the remainder we interviewed the state or local  government agencies together. We interviewed both urban and rural  counties in order to obtain the perspectives of officials at both densely  populated urban areas and rural areas. We report the results of our  interviewing as counts at the level of the 15 states and localities. In  general, if any one of the officials we interviewed in a particular state or  locality stated a factor or issue, such as lessons learned from exercises  being applied to pandemic planning, then we considered that statement to  apply to the state or locality as a whole. However, a limitation of our  interview methodology is that we did not comprehensively or  systematically survey all interviewees across the range of interview  questions.", "We did not interview tribal nations, and except in two cases when urban  areas included private and nonprofit officials in our interviews with their  agency, we did not interview private sector entities or nonprofit  organizations. We focused on state and local government officials and  asked these officials about their interaction with tribal nations, private  sector entities, and nonprofit organizations. Finally, we interviewed the  selected state and urban area\u2019s auditors on any current or planned related  audits. While the states and localities selected provided a broad  perspective, we cannot generalize or extrapolate the information gleaned  from the site visits to the nation. In addition, since the states that we  selected were large, the most populous states, and likely entry points for  people coming into the United States, the information we collected may  not be as relevant to smaller, less populated states that are not likely entry  points for people coming into the United States.", "We also reviewed the influenza pandemic planning and exercise  documents from the selected states and localities. We reviewed the state  and local influenza pandemic plans for common topics, however we did  not analyze the quality of the documents systematically amongst those  states and localities. Instead, we relied on the HHS-led assessment of  whether state\u2019s influenza pandemic plans contained 22 priority areas. We  reviewed the reliability of the data reported from that assessment and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  engagement. We also reviewed the states\u2019 and localities\u2019 exercise  documents for commonalities across jurisdictions.", "We also interviewed HHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC), and DHS officials about how they are working with states and  localities in planning and exercising for an influenza pandemic and  reviewed documentation that they provided, including the HHS-led  feedback to states on their influenza pandemic plans and the March 2008  planning guidance to assist them in updating their influenza pandemic  plans. Within HHS, we met with or received information from the Deputy  Director of the Office of Policy and Strategic Planning within the Office of  Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; the Senior Advisor to  the Director, Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and  Emergency Response at CDC; the Regional Inspector General, Office of  Inspector General; and their staff. Within DHS, we met with and or  received information from the Director and Associate Chief Medical  Officer for Medical Readiness, Office of Health Affairs; the Branch Chief,  National Integration Center, Federal Emergency Management Agency; the  National Principal Federal Official for influenza pandemic, United States  Coast Guard; the Program Director, Lessons Learned Information System;  and the Deputy Inspector General, the Office of the Inspector General; and  their staff. In January 2008, we observed two of the five influenza  pandemic regional workshops led by HHS and DHS, in coordination with  other federal agencies. The purpose of the workshops was to obtain state  leaders\u2019 input on guidance to assist their governments in updating their  pandemic plans in preparation for a second HHS-led review of these plans.", "In addition, we reviewed prior GAO work and other relevant literature. We  also interviewed officials from the National Governors Association,  Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, National Association  of County and City Health Officials, and the National Emergency  Management Association who are working on issues related to state and  local influenza pandemic activities. We obtained information on state and  local activities from the state and local auditors in Kansas City, Missouri;  Portland, Oregon; and New York state, who as members of the GAO  Comptroller General\u2019s Domestic Working Group, all participated in a  collaborative effort to assess influenza pandemic planning in their  jurisdictions.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to June 2008, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Emergency Preparedness: States Are Planning for Medical Surge, but  Could Benefit from Shared Guidance for Allocating Scarce Medical  Resources.
