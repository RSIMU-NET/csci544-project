In addition, cyber threats to systems supporting the  federal government and critical infrastructure are evolving and becoming  more sophisticated. These threats come from a variety of sources and  vary in terms of the types and capabilities of the actors, their willingness  to act, and their motives.

These practices include (1) setting the strategic direction for IT workforce  planning, (2) analyzing the workforce to identify skill gaps, (3) developing strategies and implementing activities to address these gaps, and (4)  monitoring and reporting progress in addressing gaps.", "However, over the last several years, we and others have reported on  federal agencies\u2019 challenges to define their cybersecurity workforces and  address their IT skills gaps. For example:  In November 2011, we reported that eight federal agencies had  identified challenges in their workforce planning efforts. For example,  they were not able to determine the size of their cybersecurity  workforce because of variations in how the cyber-related work was  defined and the lack of a cybersecurity specific occupational series. In  addition, we noted that the eight agencies had taken varied steps to  implement workforce planning practices for cybersecurity personnel.  For example, five of the eight agencies had established cybersecurity  workforce plans or other agency-wide activities addressing  cybersecurity workforce planning. However, these plans did not  always include strategies for addressing gaps in critical skills or  competencies, among other things. To address these shortcomings,  we made six recommendations to enhance individual agency  workforce planning activities. Of the six agencies to which we made  individual recommendations, five agreed and one neither agreed nor  disagreed with our recommendations. Since our report was issued,  the agencies have implemented most of these recommendations.", "In January 2015, we reported that the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) and a Chief Human Capital Officers Council  working group had identified skills gaps in government-wide, mission- critical occupations, including cybersecurity. We noted that, although  these initial efforts had created an infrastructure for addressing skills  gaps, overall progress was mixed. At times, goals had targets that  were difficult to measure. Likewise, agency officials chose to track  metrics that often did not allow for an accurate assessment of  progress made toward these goals for closing skills gaps. In addition,  OPM had not established time frames or a process for collecting  government-wide staffing and competency data to help agencies  determine the competencies that are critical to successfully achieving  their mission. We pointed out that OPM and selected agencies could  improve efforts to address skills gaps by strengthening their use of  quarterly data-driven reviews (known as HRstats). Based on these  findings, we recommended that OPM (1) strengthen its methodology  for identifying and addressing skills gaps, (2) establish a schedule and  process for collecting government-wide staffing and competency data,  and (3) develop a set of metrics for agency HRstat reviews. OPM  generally concurred with the first and third recommendations, but did  not concur with the second recommendation, citing funding  constraints. These recommendations have not yet been implemented.", "In an April 2015 report, the Partnership for Public Service noted a  continuing need for the government to develop an understanding of  the size and skills of the current cybersecurity workforce; project the  government\u2019s future cybersecurity human capital needs; assess  qualitative and quantitative gaps between the current workforce and  the workforce needed to address future challenges; and develop  strategies, as well as program and policy goals, designed to close  those gaps. The Partnership attributed these challenges to the lack of  a government-wide master cybersecurity workforce strategy, leaving  agencies to operate largely on their own under a haphazard system.", "In November 2016, we reported that five selected agencies had made  mixed progress in assessing their IT skill gaps. These agencies had  started focusing on identifying cybersecurity staffing gaps, but more  work remained in assessing competency gaps and in broadening the  focus to include the entire IT community. For example, four of the five  agencies had not demonstrated an established IT workforce planning  process, which would assist them in identifying and addressing skill  gaps. In several cases, these shortcomings were due to a lack of  comprehensive policies and procedures for assessing workforce  needs.

To recruit and retain personnel with the  critical skills needed to accomplish their missions, federal agencies can  offer incentives, such as recruitment, relocation, and retention incentive  payments; student loan repayments; annual leave enhancements; and  scholarships. Agencies can also use training and development  opportunities as an incentive to help recruit and retain employees.", "However, we and others have found that agencies have faced persistent  challenges in recruiting and retaining well-qualified cybersecurity talent:  In November 2011, we reported that the quality of cybersecurity  training and development programs varied significantly across the  eight agencies in our review. Additionally, most of the eight agencies  in our review said they used some incentives to support their  cybersecurity workforce; however, they either had not evaluated or  had difficulty evaluating whether incentives effectively support hiring  and retaining highly skilled personnel in hard-to-fill positions. We also  found that, although OPM had planned to develop guidance and tools  to assist agencies in the administration and oversight of their incentive  programs, it had not yet done so. To address this shortcoming, we  recommended that OPM finalize and issue guidance to agencies on  how to track the use and effectiveness of incentives for hard-to-fill  positions, including cybersecurity positions; OPM has since  implemented this recommendation.", "In August 2016, we reported the results of our review of the current  authorities of agency chief information security officers (CISO).

In addition, CISOs stated that they were not able to  offer salaries that were competitive with the private sector for  candidates with high-demand technical skills. Furthermore, CISOs  said that some security personnel lacked security skills or were not  sufficiently trained.", "Others have also noted the challenge of hiring and retaining qualified  cybersecurity professionals. For example, the April 2015 Partnership  for Public Service report highlighted obstacles to federal recruitment  of cybersecurity talent, including the inability of the government to  offer salaries competitive with those in the private sector. In addition,  according to a January 2017 report from the federal CIO Council,  chief information officers (CIO) reported that it is difficult for agencies  to offer well-qualified candidates a salary that is competitive with the  private sector. This salary issue in turn can create problems in  retaining talented government employees.

Although competitive  hiring has been the traditional method of hiring, agencies can use  additional hiring authorities to expedite the hiring process or achieve  certain public policy goals. Among other things, we noted that  agencies rely on a relatively small number of hiring authorities (as  established by law, executive order, or regulation) to fill the vast  majority of hires into the federal civil service. Further, while OPM  collects a variety of data to assess the federal hiring process, neither  it nor agencies used this information to assess the effectiveness of  hiring authorities. Conducting such assessments would be a critical  first step in making more strategic use of the available hiring  authorities to more effectively meet their hiring needs. We  recommended that OPM work with agencies to determine the extent  to which hiring authorities were meeting agency needs and use this  information to refine, eliminate, or expand authorities as needed. OPM  generally concurred with these recommendations but has not yet  implemented them.", "As noted previously, we have identified both information security and  strategic human capital management as government-wide high-risk  areas.
