The Office of Management and Budget noted the growth in the cap has outpaced inflation and the rate of growth of federal salaries. DOD noted that it fully supported the principle of paying only reasonable compensation costs and some DOD officials supported reducing the cap, though DOD cautioned that there are limited data on the potential impacts of doing so and that the impact on the defense industry would need to be carefully monitored and assessed. Industry associations and contractors representatives noted that the compensation they offer to their employees is generally based on market surveys of compensation paid by private sector companies. While acknowledging that a reduced cap would not preclude them from compensating their employees above the cap, contractor representatives noted that doing so would come at the expense of company profits, which in turn may result in challenges in attracting capital from the financial markets. They also noted that reducing the cap may affect companies' ability to attract and retain top talent and, over the long term, lead companies to reassess their business and staffing models and potentially shift work or personnel from government business to their commercial sector."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

For example,  in terms of size, in 2012, the total number of U.S.-based employees at the  30 companies selected for this review ranged between 10 and more than  150,000. Some of these companies provide goods and services primarily  to DOD, and some also provide goods and services to other federal  agencies or the private sector. For example, the percentage of total  revenues received from the government in 2012 among the companies  included in this review ranged between 4 percent and 100 percent, with  24 of the 30 contractors reporting at least half of their revenues were  received from the federal government.", "Contractors can allocate and charge a number of costs to federal  government contracts, including certain types and levels of compensation  costs. The FAR identifies many elements of compensation, including  salaries and wages, bonus and incentive compensation, pension costs,  and fringe benefits such as sick leave, holidays, and employee insurance.  Some compensation costs are considered allowable under government  contracts, while others are considered unallowable. For example,  compensation in the form of bonuses and incentives are allowable under  certain conditions, such as that the basis for the award for a bonus or  incentive payment is supported. Similarly, according to a DCAA official, in  most cases, restricted stock (a form of long-term incentive that includes  actual shares that are earned by continued employment with a company)  is allowable, because the expense is fixed at the time the restricted stock  is awarded. On the other hand, compensation calculated or valued based  on changes in the prices of corporate securities or corporate security  ownership, such as stock options, is unallowable.", "In addition to certain types of compensation costs being unallowable, the  cap set by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy can also limit the  amount of compensation paid to certain contractor employees that can be  charged to federal contracts. For purposes of the cap, the FAR defines  compensation to include the total amount of wages, salary, bonuses,  deferred compensation, and employer contributions to defined  contribution pension plans, for the fiscal year, whether paid, earned, or  otherwise accruing, as recorded in the contractor\u2019s cost accounting  records for the fiscal year. Because of the cap, there are compensation  costs that might be otherwise allowable, but are unallowable because  they exceed the cap.

Executive B\u2019s compensation was $600,000. Because $600,000 was  below the level of the cap, executive B\u2019s compensation was not subject to  the cap. However, if the cap had been reduced to the salary of the  President ($400,000), then both executive A and executive B would have  received compensation that would be unallowable because of the  reduced cap. While the cap limits the compensation costs that contractors  can charge to government contracts, it does not limit what a company can  compensate an employee.", "To be allowable, the FAR requires that compensation costs be  reasonable. In determining reasonableness, contracting officers can  consider the extent to which an employee\u2019s compensation is consistent  with other companies that are similar in size, industry, geographic area,  and/or other factors. It is possible that compensation costs may be lower  than the cap, but not reasonable. For example, in the hypothetical  example provided in figure 1, some of Executive A\u2019s compensation costs  beneath the $763,029 cap may not be considered reasonable, if, for  example, employees performing similar work and in companies with  similar characteristics are compensated at a much lower level.", "As a part of its auditing responsibilities, DCAA may audit compensation  costs for allowability, allocability, and reasonableness.

However, they also stated that  there are certain specialties that are critical to achieving DOD\u2019s missions  and that individuals in those specialties should be compensated  appropriately. At the same time, DPAP officials stated that it is not DOD\u2019s  role to determine how much contractor employees are compensated. In  terms of the administrative impact of a reduced cap on contract audit and  oversight processes, DCAA and DCMA officials stated that they would  expect additional workload associated with a reduced cap. For example, if  the cap were set at the salary of the Vice President, DCAA officials noted  they would need to evaluate whether individuals working on a single  contract might have compensation costs that exceeded the cap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Association and Contractor Views on Reducing the Cap", "paragraphs": ["Industry associations and many contractors questioned the premise of  capping allowable contractor compensation costs at a set amount which  is not based on market competition, emphasizing that standard industry  practice is to benchmark employee compensation levels based on  compensation levels for similar positions at their competitors and other  private sector companies. In addition, an industry association noted that  the FAR states that a cost is considered reasonable if it does not exceed  \u201cthat which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of  competitive business,\u201d and linked this statement to the defense industry  practice of analyzing market trends in compensation.", "According to industry representatives and contractor representatives,  defense companies generally obtain market survey information to aid in  determining the appropriate compensation levels for a range of positions,  not just senior executives. For example, the defense industry competes  for highly specialized engineers, software engineers, and manufacturing  specialists that help design, test, and manufacture DOD weapon systems.  Other company representatives noted that the defense industry also  competes with global industries of all types for highly qualified  management personnel, including finance specialists, program managers,  and other functional experts. Market survey information forms the basis  for offers companies make to prospective new hires as well as changes in  compensation designed to retain existing employees at all levels within  the company. To be competitive for talent and manage total personnel  costs to the company, industry associations and contractor  representatives reported that defense companies typically target  compensation levels at the median amount offered in the market for a  given position, and have established ranges above and below that level  that can be used to address specific circumstances. In that regard, an  industry association provided summary benchmarking information that  indicated the competitive compensation ranges for a variety of disciplines  and positions, including those in engineering, finance, general  management, information technology, general counsel, and  manufacturing and quality assurance, exceeded the salary of the Vice  President, and in some cases, exceeded both the salary of the President  and the current cap. Industry representatives noted that the definition of  compensation used in the summary benchmarking information differs  from the definition of compensation used for the cap. As a result, it is not  possible to directly compare the summary benchmarking information  provided to the potential new cap levels.", "Additionally, industry associations and contractor representatives cited a  number of long-term negative impacts or potential unintended  consequences of reducing the cap. For example, several contractor and  industry representatives stated that even though a cap does not limit what  the company can pay the employee, companies may consider limiting the  compensation paid to their employees over the long term. These  representatives noted that industry relies on capital markets to provide  the capital necessary to operate and invest in future capabilities. To  attract capital, the markets demand that industry match its cost structure  to what its customers, such as the government, are willing to pay. If large  numbers of employees were paid in excess of what is allowable under  government contracts, then the companies\u2019 cash flow would be disrupted  and the potential to generate earnings would be reduced. In turn, this  condition would impair a company\u2019s access to capital markets, and  damage shareholder value. To mitigate the risk posed by this scenario,  these representatives noted that a company may reduce the  compensation levels for employees to reduce or eliminate the gap  between what is paid to the employee and what is reimbursed by the  government.", "Similarly, several contractors stated their view that companies\u2019 ability to  attract and retain the most highly talented individuals may be reduced if  the company limits their compensation, particularly once they become  most valuable in terms of their skills and expertise. Some contractors  further noted that if government contractors are unable to attract and  retain top talent, this may result in a lower quality of products and  services provided to the government. For example, one industry  association representative stated that knowledgeable, practiced, and  compensated talent can more efficiently and effectively address complex  issues as opposed to less experienced talent.", "More generally, companies also noted that reducing the cap might  encourage companies to shift away from defense or other government  contract work to commercial work. For companies with both commercial  and government work, some company representatives stated that  assigning the company\u2019s best talent to the commercial side of the  business may become a more prudent business decision because of the  ability to recover the total costs of an employee\u2019s compensation;  contractor employees who have a choice may also opt not to work on  government contracts to avoid potential constraints on compensation.  They also stated their view that, if this were the case, then the  government may not have access to the skills and capabilities needed to  successfully produce or deliver high-quality, technologically advanced  goods and services to DOD.", "While industry associations and many of the large-tier and mid-tier  contractors expressed concerns should the cap be reduced, most small- tier companies we reviewed generally stated they would either be only  minimally affected or not affected should the cap be reduced because  they generally did not offer compensation above the Vice President\u2019s  salary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s e-mailed response stated that the compensation amounts  identified in the report underscore the need for action to reform the cap.  OMB stated that it has sent a legislative proposal to Congress that would  abolish the current formula for calculating the cap, tie the level of the cap  instead to the President\u2019s salary, and apply it to all employees for both  defense and civilian cost reimbursement contracts. OMB also stated that  savings from lowering the cap would be substantially higher than the  $180 million cited in the report as compensation costs exceeding the  President\u2019s salary, since the contractors included in the sample account  for 7 percent of DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2012 contract obligations.

DOD stated that  the report provides a significant amount of information, but expressed  concern that it is based on a relatively small sample of DOD contractors  and cited a need for additional research to determine what constitutes  reasonable employee compensation costs.

These  insights include (1) how the cap levels would have affected selected  large-tier, mid-tier, and small-tier contractors differently, both in terms of  numbers of employees affected and the amount of compensation costs  considered unallowable, and (2) how, as the cap is lowered, more  employees in non-executive positions would have been affected at these  contractors.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense; the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

This report provides (1) estimates of the number  of employees of a sample of Department of Defense (DOD) contractors  whose compensation would have exceeded a cap set at the salaries of  either the U.S. President or Vice President, and the amount of  compensation that would not have been allowable; (2) the status of  DOD\u2019s efforts to establish an exception for scientists and engineers and  the extent to which scientists and engineers would be affected by  reducing the cap; and (3) the views of government and contractor  representatives on potential effects of a reduction in the cap.

Detailed  information on how we selected the 30 contractors is included below. In  our data request, we asked for data on most questions for fiscal years  2010, 2011, and 2012. To simplify the data request, we collected for fiscal  year 2011 information on some questions where we determined one year  of information was sufficient to provide useful insights, such as questions  related to the number of employees at different management levels and a  question about employee job titles. In these instances, we chose fiscal  year 2011 rather than fiscal year 2012 to ensure that contractors would  have the information available at the time of our request. While we did not  independently verify the contractor reported data, we did take a number  of steps to assess the reliability of the data. Specifically, we reviewed  written responses provided by the contractors on the source of the data,  when that data source was last reviewed or audited, steps taken by the  contractor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data provided,  critical assumptions made, and any known limitations on the reported  data. We also looked for inconsistencies in the data, and followed up as  necessary to resolve these inconsistencies.

We also collected data on the dollar  amounts of compensation costs for these employees that would have  been considered unallowable in 2010, 2011, and 2012 by virtue of  exceeding either the current cap, the salary of the President, or that of  the Vice President. To provide insight into the types of employees  affected, we also collected information on the titles of the individuals  who would have exceeded those three potential cap levels in  contractor fiscal year 2011, as well as on whether the contractor  would have classified affected employees as executives, non- executive management, or non-management.", "To determine the status of DOD\u2019s exception for scientists and  engineers and the extent to which scientists and engineers would be  affected by reducing the cap, we interviewed DOD officials on the  status of and/or plans for establishing an exception and to whom such  an exception might apply. We collected and analyzed data from  selected contractors on the number of employees the contractor  would have classified as scientists and engineers, based either on  function, education, or background, and information on the proportion  of these scientists and engineers considered executives, non- executive management, or non-management for contractor fiscal year  2011.

We based our selection of contractors on data  from USAspending.gov.", "We divided the contractors into four strata: contractors with fiscal year  2012 obligations (1) greater than $25 billion; (2) between $2 billion and  $25 billion; (3) between $15 million and $2 billion with primarily non-small  business dollar obligations; and (4) between $1 million and $15 million  with obligations that were primarily small business dollars. All contractors  in the first stratum were selected (2 total).

This approach allowed us to move to the next  contractor on the list in cases where contractors did not meet criteria for  selection, while still maintaining a random selection process. Reasons for  exclusion included the contractor being a non-profit, imperfections in the  data (e.g., the Department of Energy being listed as a company), or the  contractor not being incorporated in the United States.

However, these contractors did not provide data on the number of  employees with compensation costs greater than the salaries of the U.S.  President or Vice President or on the estimated amount of total  compensation that would no longer be allowable at these cap levels.
