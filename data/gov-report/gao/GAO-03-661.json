Spend analysis answers basic questions about how much is being spent for what services, who are the suppliers, and where are the opportunities for leveraged buying to save money and improve performance. To obtain these answers, companies extract internal financial data, supplement this data with external data, organize the data into categories of services and suppliers, and have the data analyzed by managers or cross-functional teams to plan and schedule what services will be bought on a company wide basis. The results of spend analysis are also used for broader strategic purposes--to develop reports for top management, to track financial and other benefits achieved by the company, and to further improve and centralize corporate procurement processes. DOD is in the early stages of a spend analysis pilot. Although DOD is moving in the right direction, it has not yet adopted best practices to the same extent as the companies we studied. Whether DOD can adopt these practices depends on its ability to make long-term changes necessary to implement a more strategic approach to contracting. DOD also cites a number of challenges, such as its large and complex need for a range of services, the fragmentation of spending data across multiple information systems, and contracting goals for small businesses that may constrain its ability to consolidate smaller requirements into larger contracts. Challenges such as these are difficult and deep-rooted, but companies also faced them. For DOD to change management practices for the contracting of services will require sustained executive leadership at DOD as well as the involvement and support of Congress."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) faces critical challenges in deciding  how best to obtain the services it needs to achieve its mission.

DOD spends  more on services than it does on supplies and equipment, and that  spending is increasing year after year. In spite of this, our work as well as  that of DOD\u2019s Office of Inspector General has found that DOD\u2019s spending  on services is not well managed\u2014the current process is decentralized,  insufficiently rigorous, and unreliable.

These range from learning  much more about their service spending to buying services on an  enterprisewide rather than business unit basis. Pursuing such an approach  clearly pays off. One recent survey of 147 companies in 22 industries  indicated a strategic approach to procurement had resulted in savings of  more than $13 billion in one year. The very same practices employed by  the private sector could serve as a foundation for improving the  acquisition of services in DOD.", "When adopting a strategic, best-practices approach for changing  procurement business processes, companies begin with a \u201cspend analysis\u201d  to examine purchasing patterns to see who is buying what from whom. By  arming themselves with this knowledge, companies can leverage their  buying power, reduce purchasing costs, and better manage their suppliers.  In essence, spend analysis is the road map to procurement cost-savings  and performance improvements.", "To follow up on our earlier work, you asked us to further evaluate (1) the  best practices of leading companies as they relate to conducting and using  spend analysis, and (2) the extent to which DOD can pursue similar  practices.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed the spend analysis practices of  five leading companies that take a strategic approach to managing services  acquisitions: International Business Machines (IBM), ChevronTexaco,  Bausch & Lomb, Delta Air Lines, and Dell Computer. They reported a  combined spending for goods and services between $92 billion and  $94 billion in 2001. We selected these companies for review on the basis of  extensive research and because they have been recognized by their peers  for highly effective procurement and spend analysis processes.

In each of the  past five years, DOD has spent more on services than it has on supply and  equipment goods (that includes contracting for ships, aircraft, and other  military items) (see figure 1).", "Despite this huge investment in buying services, our work\u2014and the work  of the DOD Inspector General\u2014has found that DOD\u2019s spending on  services is inefficient and not being managed effectively. In fact, we have  identified overall DOD contract management as a high-risk area, most  recently in our Performance and Accountability Series issued this past  January. Responsibility for acquiring services is spread among individual  military commands, weapon system program offices, or functional units  in various defense organizations, with limited visibility or control at the  DOD or military-department level. Too often, requirements are not clearly  defined; competition is not adequately pursued; rigorous price analyses  are not performed; and contractors\u2019 performance is not sufficiently  overseen. Information systems that provide reliable data and are capable  of being used as management tools are lacking, and DOD has established  few enterprisewide contracting-related performance metrics. Further,  DOD lacks a strategic plan to identify and prioritize future service  contracting-related efforts for better management.", "Seeking longer-term remedies to bring about sorely needed reform, the  Congress has passed legislation to direct DOD to adopt best practices used  by leading companies and to achieve significant savings through improved  management approaches for services contracts. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 directs DOD to improve its  management structure and oversight process for acquisition of services.  One of the law\u2019s aims is to prompt DOD to undertake a comprehensive  spend analysis of its services contracts. This analysis is intended to  provide DOD the basis for expanding its use of cross-functional  commodity teams to leverage its buying power, improve the performance  of its services contractors, organize its supplier base, and ensure that its  dollars are well spent. Moreover, expecting that DOD could achieve  significant savings without any reduction in services, the legislation also  establishes savings goals that DOD should achieve by employing  commercial best practices and effective management.

Because simplified data may not exist or be  available, companies have frequently been unsure who their buyers are  and have had to contend with databases that include listings of items and  suppliers that in reality are identical to each other but which are all stored  under different names.

As a result, IBM  reports having achieved significant efficiencies and globally leveraged its  spending through strategic sourcing to reduce the number of suppliers and  save hundreds of millions of dollars.", "In the beginning of its transformation, IBM lacked sufficient knowledge on  what it was spending across the enterprise. Company buyers were calling  the same items and suppliers by different names and being charged  different prices for the same product or service. The company had  disparate accounts payable systems, and the procurement organization  was unable to gather easily a consolidated view of spending with IBM  suppliers. Aggregated data were unavailable, and the linkage between  procurement and accounts payable was inadequate for leveraging the  company\u2019s buying power. To launch a comprehensive spend analysis,  IBM had to address four major challenges: (1) linking its disjointed legacy  systems, (2) investing in a single-enterprise resource-planning system,  (3) establishing uniform naming conventions for suppliers, goods, and  services, and (4) creating a single procurement management system to  support a global process.", "To address these challenges, IBM developed an extensive \u201cend-to-end\u201d  procurement system, which includes a paperless process for requisitions  and purchase orders, electronic linkages to suppliers, a worldwide  accounts payable system that receives and processes all suppliers\u2019  invoices, and a centralized spend analysis program built around an  automated business data warehouse for efficiently extracting accounts  payable and other enterprise spending data in a common format. Initially,  IBM\u2019s data management system did not support aggregating all of the  accounts payable and other data to support management decision making.  Recognizing this situation, IBM quickly responded by implementing a  centralized global business data warehouse to facilitate decision making  based on accounts payable and other data covering the entirety of  IBM\u2019s purchases.", "IBM\u2019s global procurement organization has used spend analysis to  establish a substantial level of control by the company\u2019s 31 \u201ccommodity  councils\u201d.

Before 1995, IBM\u2019s decentralized buyers controlled only 45 percent of the  company\u2019s purchasing; centralized councils now control almost  100 percent. Although IBM business units initially found it difficult to give  up decentralized control over buying to the global procurement  organization, IBM\u2019s global procurement organization used spend analysis  presentations to demonstrate the savings that were possible and to  achieve buy-in to the new purchasing process while being responsive to  business units\u2019 needs.", "IBM\u2019s spend analysis approach also supplements information from internal  accounts payable with business intelligence data on suppliers\u2019 businesses  and market status from an outside party.

The council\u2019s analysis revealed that the company was spending billions  annually for temporary technical services, that its hiring process was  taking 10 days on average, and that multiple suppliers were sending in  candidate resumes. As a result of the council\u2019s effort, a centralized  Web-based hiring system was developed internally for sourcing external  technical services. Requesters can go online and select candidates from a  database, conduct interviews, and submit requisitions, while reducing the  process of hiring to less than 3 days.

This knowledge  enabled Bausch & Lomb to negotiate a 17 percent reduction with that  company for temporary services by consolidating the supplier base from  60 companies to 1. The remaining temporary services company agreed to  this reduced rate because it was guaranteed a greater volume of individual  purchase orders and because Bausch & Lomb\u2019s business units were  required to use that preferred company unless they had a need that it  could not meet.

Delta\u2019s supply chain management  organization also uses spend analysis to track and report the company\u2019s  spending with small business and minority- and women-owned businesses  in order to measure the outcome of the teams\u2019 strategic-sourcing projects  in terms of the company\u2019s supplier diversity goals.", "An example of Delta\u2019s successful outcomes with spend analysis is its  information technology commodity team\u2019s strategic sourcing effort in  2001. The team\u2019s analysis revealed the company was using more than  60 different information technology contract services suppliers and  purchasing approximately $16 million in external services. The requisition  processes varied within each of the business units; limited formal metrics  were in place for managing supplier performance; and the existing  contracts\u2019 pricing structures did not facilitate cost reduction efforts.", "An external industry analysis indicated that Delta could benefit by  bidding information technology contract services given that the supplier  market was hard hit by the downturn in the economy and that a surplus of  high quality information technology service suppliers existed. Using this  knowledge, the commodity team, which included representatives from the  company\u2019s human resources and technology business units, developed a  new consolidated-proposal request for external services and used an on- line reverse auction to complete the sourcing effort. The new contracts  resulted in reported annual savings of $3 million and reduced the  number of suppliers from 60 to 6 companies\u20143 of which qualified as  diverse-owned businesses.", "Despite Delta\u2019s accomplishments in spend analysis, challenges  remain in obtaining reliable and complete data, and its supply chain  management organization is working to improve financial system data  integrity and automated reporting to provide the information needed for  real-time business decisions. Last year a team was formed to improve the  quality of information on suppliers, commodity codes, and buyers.  Recommendations on process improvements will be made in 2003,  followed by an effort to clean up Delta\u2019s purchase order and contract files.  A related team is working to improve the availability of automated  reporting from Delta\u2019s off-the-shelf spend analysis reporting tool.

The  company had no spend analysis program to track general procurement of  goods and services needed to support the company\u2019s nonmanufacturing  operations. However, once the company decided that general procurement  merited the same strategic approach as production procurement, the  procurement organization quickly developed a second spend analysis  program.", "Since 2000, Dell\u2019s procurement and finance organizations have worked  together on its internally developed spend analysis system, which provides  automated on-line reporting and cost analysis of the company\u2019s general  procurement purchasing. Every month, the system extracts accounts  payable records from one of the company\u2019s two financial systems for  consolidation into the data warehouse used for spend analysis. The  consolidated spend analysis reports are supplemented with supplier  diversity, business intelligence, and purchase card information obtained  from external sources. For example, Dell obtains business intelligence  information from an outside party about its suppliers\u2019 financial health and  utilizes that independent information to determine percent of revenue  based on sales to Dell. The company also obtains detailed vendor data for  purchases obtained under the corporate purchase card program. However,  the supplemental business intelligence and purchase card information  must be separately analyzed vendor by vendor, item by item, and  compared with the consolidated reports from the accounts payable  information.", "The need to organize the accounts payable and purchase card data for  spend-analysis and strategic-sourcing purposes required the procurement  organization to identify 15 high-level categories, each encompassing many  products and services commodities. This involved research with business  units familiar with Dell\u2019s vendors in order to \u201ctag\u201d each vendor according  to the commodity being supplied. Consulting is one example of a high level  category, and it encompasses consultant services such as information  technology, electronic commerce, financial, legal, and Dell technology.  New suppliers are similarly tagged to keep the spend analysis system  updated. One current limitation to Dell\u2019s tagging methodology is that some  vendors do not fit neatly under a single commodity. Dell\u2019s system  organizes purchase data for those vendors under a miscellaneous  category, and the staff regularly analyze the data to later sort spending  with those suppliers into the appropriate commodity.", "Dell\u2019s procurement organization has four senior managers who are  responsible for several commodity teams in the areas of marketing and  communications, corporate services, and operations. In these teams,  commodity managers partner with the primary business owners to manage  strategic sourcing and other procurement activities in specific spending  areas. Each commodity team uses spend analysis to identify, prioritize,  and leverage the company\u2019s combined buying power with suppliers in  order to reduce costs and improve supplier performance.", "As an example of a successful outcome using spend analysis, one of  the senior managers worked with the customer services team on a  strategic-sourcing project to staff support call centers and provide  certified technicians and related on-site services for Dell computer  hardware repair. The spend analysis revealed that Dell\u2019s business units  were spending more than $200 million annually on an ad-hoc basis with 8  suppliers for the same services. The team discovered that it was difficult  to manage eight suppliers and expensive to have each provide the entire  scope of services on a worldwide basis. The new sourcing strategy cut the  number to four suppliers and provided a volume price discount,  efficiencies in supplier management, and capacity to support Dell\u2019s  growing sales in the U.S. and overseas. Dell required two of those  suppliers to provide a global array of services and two to work only in  the U.S. In taking this action, Dell also successfully met its supplier  diversity objectives by awarding two of the new contracts to diversely- owned companies.", "Dell procurement officials plan continued improvements to the spend  analysis program, such as automating the production of analytic reports  and generating reports that focus on detecting corporate relationships  among suppliers. Enhanced analysis and reporting of relationships can be  used to leverage Dell\u2019s buying power for additional savings with related  suppliers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Launches a Pilot Spend Analysis with an Eye toward Developing a More Strategic Approach", "paragraphs": ["DOD is in the very early stages of setting up a spend analysis program. The  agency\u2019s leaders have made a commitment to improve how DOD acquires  services and to adopt best commercial practices. Although these are the  right first steps, the agency has yet to emulate the best practices of spend  analysis to the same extent as the private sector. DOD also has not yet  pursued more strategic approaches like reorganizing its procurement  processes under a more centrally led management structure.", "DOD\u2019s initial actions include issuing new policy in May 2002\u2014in response  to our work and the 2002 national defense authorization legislation\u2014to  elevate major purchases of services to the same level of importance as  the purchase of major weapon systems. In February 2003, the Deputy  Secretary of Defense tasked a new team to complete, by September 2003,  a pilot spend analysis of services acquisition data across DOD and to  determine if larger scale efficiencies and savings could be achieved over  its current decentralized procurement environment. DOD requested  proposals from interested vendors with commercial spend analysis  experience to provide contract support to the DOD team. Pilot projects  associated with the spend analysis will be completed by September 2004.", "Information we obtained during preproposal discussions with prospective  vendors suggest that the DOD pilot project may not engage the full range  of spend analysis best practices as have the private sector companies we  interviewed. (See table 3.)", "Although DOD does seek to include basic elements of the key private  sector spend analysis best practices in the prospective pilot, its efforts fall  short of the private sector standard. Its efforts at automation involve only  a one-time requirement, not the repeatable process found in private  companies. Efforts to extract data are restricted to those taken from two  centrally available databases on services contract actions (excluding  research and development) in excess of $25,000, a limitation due to the  agency\u2019s self-imposed 90-day time frame for completing the spend  analysis. Although superior data\u2014obtained by the vendor from other  internal and external sources with DOD\u2019s help\u2014may be used to  supplement what has been extracted, DOD cannot guarantee that it will be  able to provide what the vendor may request. The scope of the pilot is  also relatively limited, compared to the more expansive private sector  programs. Ten service category business cases are being considered, and  procurement savings strategies will be tested for at least five categories. If  time permits, DOD\u2019s pilot manager told us that more than five categories  could be tested.", "While DOD expects to learn from this pilot spend analysis, only a small  number of procurement actions will result from it. As DOD moves forward  to adopt commercial best practices for service acquisitions on the basis of  its pilot, the scope of its strategic approach may be limited to smaller  organizational units, rather than a major more centralized reorganization  of DOD\u2019s procurement processes. To justify its \u201cwait and see\u201d approach  with a pilot, DOD cites several factors that set it apart from commercial  companies. These include its much larger and more complex services  supplier base, decentralized acquisition environment with many  procurement offices spread across the military services and defense  agencies, and no single financial data system relative to procurements.  According to DOD, it must also fulfill numerous socioeconomic goals for  contracting with small and diversely-owned suppliers and has more  regulatory and budgetary constraints around the acquisition process. In  citing these factors in advance of the pilot, DOD is being cautious about  viewing procurement as a strategic (i.e., DOD-wide) process that simplifies  acquisitions, saves money, and increases the quality of purchased services,  compared to its current tactical process of numerous individual contract  actions.", "Once the pilot spend analysis is complete, DOD faces the challenge  of making the best use of the results. It needs to decide what long-term  changes are required to bolster the current organizational structure and  processes to foster a more strategic approach to acquiring services.  The extent to which DOD makes these changes will determine its  success in meeting congressional expectations for major management  reform of\u2014and substantial savings from\u2014the procurement of services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spend Analysis Could Guide Development of a Strategic Approach to Meet DOD\u2019s Diverse Needs", "paragraphs": ["As we reported last year, DOD\u2019s size and complex service needs may lead  it to pursue different approaches within the defense agencies, military  departments, and individual commands. In this regard, private sector  experience suggests that DOD must start with spend analysis to identify  and prioritize specific contracted services and then follow through with  organizational and process changes, such as the establishment of full-time  dedicated cross-functional teams or commodity managers, to improve the  coordination and management of key services.", "As DOD attempts to reengineer its approach to purchasing services, it  faces challenges similar to those faced by private sector organizations.  For example, DOD is subject to statutory and regulatory goals for  contracting with small businesses and other socioeconomic categories,  such as woman-owned small businesses and small disadvantaged  businesses, that may constrain it from consolidating numerous smaller  contracts into larger ones. This is an approach often taken by the  companies we studied. Those constraints must be considered in the  business cases to be developed by the spend analysis vendor. The  experience of private sector companies\u2014which also are keenly aware of  the importance of small and diversely-owned business participation as  suppliers\u2014may offer DOD valuable insights into addressing this challenge.", "Companies we studied use spend analysis to carefully and successfully  balance supplier consolidation and cost-savings strategies with corporate  supplier diversity goals of equally high priority. Companies\u2019 commodity  teams often include supplier diversity specialists, who propose concrete  steps for considering small, minority-, and woman-owned businesses  throughout the strategic-sourcing process. Like the companies, DOD can  use spend analysis to understand its current level of supplier diversity on a  commodity-by-commodity basis and to balance cost-saving strategies and  socioeconomic goals. Spend analysis can also support DOD\u2019s efforts to  comply with small business requirements to review potential bundling of  procurement requirements in order to determine if the bundling is  necessary and justified.", "DOD cites its lack of a single financial data system relative to  procurements as another challenge. Because of the pilot\u2019s 90-day time  frame for completing the initial spend analysis, DOD acknowledges that  the data it will use may be less complete than what is used by business,  but it cannot guarantee that it will be able to provide data from other  sources that its vendor may request to perform the first DOD-wide spend  analysis. DOD is instead asking the vendor to make a recommendation on  the feasibility of using other DOD financial systems\u2014such as systems used  to process invoices and pay commercial vendors for goods and services  bought by DOD organizations\u2014that might be considered for use in  the future.", "Although DOD will need to consider how existing problems in its  financial management systems could affect spend analysis and services- contracting initiatives, we believe a more businesslike approach is  possible. The companies we interviewed faced similar challenges in  accumulating accounts payable and other internal data that were highly  fragmented across multiple financial and management systems and not  easily accessible. However, the companies automated the extraction of  accounts payable and other internal data and made the spend analysis  process repeatable and more efficient. To see if DOD could engage in  similar actions, we discussed this matter with DOD sources and others  knowledgeable about DOD and commercial vendor payment systems.  Based on these discussions, DOD\u2019s systems could provide the type of  accounts payable data that companies use and thus could be a data-rich  source for DOD spend analysis. In fact, vendor payment data from  multiple processing locations are already centrally collected by the  Defense Manpower Data Center for auditing and other financial  management purposes. Use of this data could reduce DOD\u2019s need to  extract and organize data for spend analysis efforts by providing a \u201cone- stop shop.\u201d", "DOD is also likely to face resistance to giving up decentralized buying  authority, cultural barriers, and other impediments to implementing broad- based management reforms. The companies we studied found several  ingredients critical to overcoming such challenges. For example, senior  management must provide continued support for common services  acquisitions processes beyond the initial impetus, since the companies are  engaging in long-term efforts. Second, communication has to be seen as  vital in educating and keeping staff on board with changes. To achieve  buy-in, companies used spend analysis to make a compelling case to  business units that reengineering would enhance service delivery and  reduce costs. Companies also involved the business units in a new center- led approach by making extensive use of cross-functional commodity  teams to make sure they had the right mix of knowledge, technical  expertise, and credibility.", "To cut across traditional organizational boundaries that contributed to the  fragmented approach to acquiring services, companies restructured their  procurement organizations, assigning them greater responsibility and  authority for strategic planning and oversight of the companies\u2019 service  spending. Also, companies extensively used metrics\u2014based on spend  analysis\u2014to measure total savings and other financial and non-financial  benefits, to set realistic goals for improvement, and to document results  over time. DOD recently developed new management structures in  response to the 2002 national defense authorization requirements to  improve practices for the acquisition of services, but the changes are not  as far-reaching as those adopted by companies we studied. For example,  although the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics) and each of the military departments now has a process for  reviewing particular large-dollar or sensitive acquisitions for adherence  to competition and other contracting requirements, the reviews are  piecemeal and focused on approving individual acquisitions rather than  achieving a coordinated approach for managing services\u2019 contracts. DOD  could use spend analysis as a basis for tailoring how the new management  structures can adopt the type of organizational tools and metrics employed  in the private sector to foster an enterprisewide strategic approach that  would meet DOD\u2019s unique requirements.", "To implement best practices and manage services effectively, DOD must  have the right skills and capabilities in its acquisition workforce. This is a  challenge given decreased staffing levels, increased workloads, and the  need for new skill sets. DOD is engaging in a long-term strategic planning  effort to identify the competencies needed for its future workforce.  Private sector experience indicates that taking a strategic, integrated,  enterprisewide approach can also help DOD address its acquisition  workforce challenges. In our study, companies\u2019 efforts to reengineer their  procurement operations have often been accompanied by acquisition- staffing reductions. The experience has been that using spend analysis and  coordinated sourcing processes allows for more efficient use of  procurement personnel resources by streamlining the number of  contracting tasks. Reducing duplication and fragmentation in contracting  activities also helps free up limited acquisition workforce resources to  perform more strategic business functions, such as acquiring and using  knowledge of market conditions and industry trends to better manage  fewer suppliers and contracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While seemingly daunting, each of the challenges to be faced by DOD  has been faced and overcome by the private sector companies.

At the  same time, DOD\u2019s management challenges related to contracting for  services will not be resolved overnight. Two common elements that  pervade discussions of ways to address DOD\u2019s challenges are the need for  (1) sustained executive leadership and (2) a strategic, integrated, and  enterprisewide approach. In addition, ensuring that these efforts achieve  the intended results will require the Congress\u2019s continued involvement and  support.
