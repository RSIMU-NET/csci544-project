GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, and regulations; analyzed May 2013 SSA administrative data on SSI recipients that was matched with U.S. Census survey data, the most recent matched data available; and interviewed researchers, disability advocates, and SSA officials in headquarters and five field offices selected for geographic dispersion, a higher concentration of multiple SSI recipient households, and overall population density."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In May 2013, an estimated 15 percent of the 7.2 million households with blind, aged, and disabled individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash benefits included more than one SSI recipient, according to GAO's data analysis. Of the estimated 1.1 million households with multiple SSI recipients, most included two recipients (953,000) and at least one adult recipient between ages 18 and 64 (695,000). Most households with multiple recipients did not have any child recipients, though an estimated 190,000 had one child recipient, 111,000 had two, and 30,000 had three or more. Few households reported having married couple recipients (an estimated 90,000). Most multiple recipient households reported that members of one family\u2014those related by birth, marriage, or adoption\u2014lived in the household (an estimated 941,000). GAO was unable to determine the specific relationships of recipients in these households.", "The Social Security Administration (SSA) provided households with multiple SSI recipients almost 30 percent, or an estimated $1.2 billion, of the total $4.3 billion paid in SSI benefits in May 2013, according to GAO's data analysis. In that month, multiple recipient households received an estimated average of $1,131 in SSI benefits, compared to $507 for single recipient households. Further, consistent with federal law that applies a lower maximum benefit rate to married couple recipients, GAO's analysis found that households with nonmarried multiple recipients received a higher estimated average monthly benefit payment than married recipient households.", "Since the 1990s, several alternative benefit structures for households with multiple SSI recipients have been discussed, but the potential effects of any such change on program costs and recipients are largely unknown. Specifically, reducing the maximum benefit limit for these households would likely decrease benefit costs, according to analyses GAO reviewed; however, the potential effects of such a change on program administrative costs and SSI recipients have not been studied. Further, according to SSA staff, SSA's claims management system lacks the ability to automatically connect and adjust claim records of those living in households with other SSI recipients, as it is structured around providing benefits to individuals. For example, if a mother lives with two of her children who are both SSI recipients, and the mother reports changes to her income, SSA's system does not automatically adjust both children's benefit amounts to account for this change in income. In addition, the system is unable to automatically process claims when two SSI recipients marry or separate, so staff must manually complete forms and calculate benefits outside the claims management system, which is time consuming and error prone, according to staff GAO spoke with in three of five selected field offices. SSA officials said the agency has not assessed the risks associated with the system's limited ability to automatically process claims for multiple recipient households, and has no plans to improve the claims management system to address related issues. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should design their information systems to support the completeness, accuracy, and validity of information needed to achieve objectives. Without assessing risks and making changes to address the issues related to households with multiple SSI recipients, SSA is at increased risk of making improper payments to recipients who live with, marry, or separate from other recipients."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA assess risks associated with the manual process for adjusting claim records for SSI multiple recipient households, and, as appropriate, take steps to make system improvements.

The Social Security  Administration (SSA) administers the program and paid almost $55 billion  in federally funded SSI benefits to about 8.4 million individual recipients in  fiscal year 2015. Maximum monthly SSI benefits are generally adjusted  annually, and an eligible individual\u2019s income from other sources reduces  the individual\u2019s monthly SSI benefit. Generally, SSI recipients are eligible  to receive up to a maximum benefit amount, though the maximum is  lower for married couple recipients. Other households with more than one  SSI recipient, such as those with multiple child recipients or those with  multiple nonmarried adult recipients, are not subject to this benefit  reduction. This benefit structure differs from other programs for low- income people that generally consider household or family size when  determining benefit amounts.", "Since the 1990s, advocacy groups, members of Congress, and SSA  officials have discussed alternative benefit structures for SSI. For  example, some options include eliminating the benefit reduction for  married couple recipients or applying a reduction to all nonmarried  multiple SSI recipient households, and the SSA Office of the Inspector  General has reported that the latter policy change could result in  significant cost savings. To inform consideration of potential changes to  the SSI benefit structure, you asked us to provide information on  households that include multiple SSI recipients.", "This report assessed what is known about 1) households that have  multiple SSI recipients, 2) SSI benefits that those households receive,  and 3) the potential effects of implementing a change in the amount of  benefits received by these households on program administration and  other factors.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws,  regulations, program guidance, and key agency documents, including  SSA\u2019s Program Operations Manual System, 2014-2018 Agency  Strategic Plan, SSA Vision 2025: Innovative Organization, and SSA\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2017 Federal Budget Justification. To describe households  with multiple SSI recipients and their benefits, we analyzed SSA  administrative data on SSI recipients and benefits in May 2013, matched  to U.S. Census Bureau survey data on household characteristics in that  month, the most recent matched data available. We assessed the  reliability of these data through interviews with relevant officials and  reviews of relevant documentation and electronic data testing, and we  determined they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To gather  information for all of the objectives, we interviewed SSA staff at  headquarters and five field offices regarding the characteristics of multiple  recipient households and SSA\u2019s administration of SSI claims for individual  recipients and multiple recipient households. Field offices were selected  to include offices serving substantial numbers of SSI recipients and to  provide variation in geographic location, and the information provided by  staff from these offices is not generalizable to all field offices nationwide.  To understand how changing the amount of benefits received by multiple  recipient households may potentially affect SSA, we compared the  information SSA staff provided to the agency documents noted above and  to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government as they  relate to both program goals and objectives, as well as the agency\u2019s  processes and procedures for managing SSI claims for this population.", "To gather additional information, we also interviewed staff from disability  advocacy organizations and other relevant stakeholder groups, as well as  researchers who have studied the SSI population.

Following SSA\u2019s initial review, state disability determination services  offices assess applicants\u2019 medical eligibility for SSI.

Generally, SSI  recipients are eligible to receive up to a maximum benefit rate, with  married couple recipients eligible for a lower maximum benefit rate  approximately equal to 75 percent of the benefit rate for nonmarried  individuals.

For example, a parent\u2019s  or spouse\u2019s income is generally included as part of the income of a child  or spouse, respectively, living in the same household. Therefore, if the  SSI recipient lives with a spouse who does not receive SSI benefits, SSA  considers the income of that spouse when determining the recipient\u2019s SSI  benefit amount, potentially reducing the benefit payment.", "Similarly, food and shelter that an individual receives from others, referred  to as in-kind support and maintenance (ISM), is also considered by SSA  when determining an individual\u2019s benefit amount. In situations where the  householder is providing both food and shelter to an individual, SSA  decreases the recipient\u2019s SSI benefit by an amount equal to one-third of  the federal benefit rate to account for ISM. In all other situations in  which an individual is receiving ISM, SSA counts the presumed value of  the food or shelter-related items received by the SSI recipient in-kind  (including such assistance provided by individuals who do not live with  the recipient) as unearned income, unless the recipient demonstrates that  the actual value is less than the presumed value, in which case SSA uses  the actual value.

We reported that  financial and nonfinancial eligibility requirements are established for each  program, with financial requirements generally limiting eligibility to  individuals, families, or households with income and assets below defined  levels. In some circumstances, federal law extends automatic eligibility  for one program for low-income people based on an applicant\u2019s  participation in another program. Such provisions can simplify the  application and eligibility determination process for applicants and reduce  the time program administrators spend verifying applicants\u2019 income and  resources. In most states, SSI recipients are automatically eligible for  Medicaid health insurance and, if they live alone or in households in  which all members receive SSI benefits, are automatically eligible for the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).", "Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that finances health insurance  coverage for certain low-income individuals. An estimated 65 million  low-income individuals were covered by Medicaid in fiscal year 2014, and  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report that enrollment  has been growing under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  Medicaid allows significant flexibility for states to design and implement  their programs; however, each state Medicaid program, by federal law,  must cover certain categories of individuals and provide a broad array of  benefits.

SNAP is the largest of 15 domestic  food and nutrition assistance programs overseen by the U.S. Department  of Agriculture\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service. States administer the  program by determining whether households meet the program\u2019s  eligibility requirements, calculating monthly benefits for qualified  households, and issuing benefits to them. A household generally includes  everyone who lives together and purchases and prepares meals  together. An SSI recipient is generally automatically eligible to receive  SNAP benefits, if they live alone or in households in which all members  receive SSI benefits, and an individual\u2019s monthly SSI benefit is counted  as income when determining the individual\u2019s SNAP benefits.

Further, some researchers we spoke with  suggested that shared genetic conditions among parents or siblings could  result in multiple members of the same household having the same  disability, or a disability on the same illness spectrum.", "The potential network effect resulting from individuals living in close  proximity and sharing information was another factor cited by groups we  spoke with that may increase the likelihood of SSI recipients living  together. Network effects potentially reduce perceived barriers to applying  for benefits for individuals who may be eligible, and could increase the  prevalence of multiple recipient households. Specifically, SSA field office  staff and representatives of a disability rights advocate group we spoke  with described word-of-mouth communication among potentially eligible  individuals as one way that applicants learn about the SSI program.  According to one researcher we spoke to, some applicants may hear from  others how to navigate the application and appeals process for SSI  benefits, thus increasing their likelihood of applying.", "The supportive care that comes from living with others may also  contribute to SSI recipients choosing to live together. According to  disability advocates we spoke to, SSI recipients may group themselves  into a community to increase connectedness, decrease isolation, and  receive supportive care when needed. In addition, one researcher told us  that SSI recipients might also need assistance coordinating care or  arranging appointments, and SSI recipients with different impairments  may fulfill complimentary functions for other household members.", "A range of the stakeholders we spoke to, including SSA field office staff,  disability advocates, and researchers, stated that economic factors may  also contribute to the living arrangement decisions of SSI recipients.  Specifically, according to these groups, SSI recipients may choose to live  together in order to pool resources to share rent and other household  expenses such as utilities or food. Additionally, current fair market rent  levels often exceed SSI benefit rates, research shows. For example,  according to one study, the national average fair market rent for one  bedroom rental units was $780 in 2014, and for studio/efficiency rental  units was $674 in 2014, or about 104 percent and 90 percent,  respectively, of the maximum monthly SSI benefit payment in that year.", "In addition, SSA headquarters and field office staff, disability rights  advocates, and researchers, with whom we spoke, stated that the  recession may have exacerbated the economic factors that contribute to  living arrangement decisions for SSI recipients. However, one researcher  we spoke with noted that the effects of the recession varied by state.  According to our analysis of matched administrative and survey data, the  rate of multiple SSI recipient households with two families present  decreased from an estimated 26 percent in 2010 to an estimated 10  percent in 2013. This suggests that the 2007 to 2009 recession may  have played a role in the family composition of households, which is  consistent with other research that has found low-income people tend to  combine households during recessions.", "Other factors related to the location and features of housing may  influence SSI recipients\u2019 living arrangements, according to the groups  with whom we spoke. In particular, these factors may contribute to a  greater prevalence of multiple SSI recipient households in certain  neighborhoods. For example, location-related factors noted by those we  spoke with included proximity to accessible infrastructure and public  systems such as transportation and schools. In addition, SSI recipients  may need to live in housing units with universal accessibility features  such as no-step entry, single-floor living, lever-style door handles,  accessible electrical controls, and extra-wide doors and hallways.

Households with nonmarried multiple recipients received a  higher estimated average monthly benefit payment than married recipient  households (see table 2).

SSA staff we spoke with in 3 of the 5 field offices said  changing benefits for some SSI recipients also could result in an increase  in field office workloads. For example, staff from these three field offices  said a change in the maximum benefit rate for some SSI recipients would  result in more recipients visiting their field offices, and some added that  there would be a need for new training for field office staff and outreach to  inform recipients about the change. However, SSA has not previously  assessed how field offices may be affected by changes in SSI policy, and  therefore the full effects of extending the reduced maximum benefit  beyond married SSI recipients on administrative processes and related  program costs are unknown.", "Potential Effects on SSI Recipients  Concerning the potential effects on recipients of a reduction in the  maximum benefit rate for multiple recipient households, some of the  groups we spoke with discussed how such a change may affect  recipients\u2019 financial situations, though research on these effects is limited.  The reduced maximum benefit rate for married couple SSI recipients is  based on the expectation that these couples realize economies of scale,  according to previous SSA reports. In other words, married SSI recipients  who live together are able to share certain household expenses, thus  reducing the overall cost of housing and living expenses for each  individual. Consistent with this, some SSA officials and researchers we  spoke with told us that some multiple recipient households economize on  living expenses, such as rent and food. However, disability advocacy  officials from two organizations said that while recipients may share a  living space, there may be certain out-of-pocket expenses that cannot be  shared, such as medication or specific dietary requirements. While a  2006 report from SSA found that medical expenses for the majority of  child SSI recipients were covered by health insurance rather than their  SSI benefits, the extent to which multiple recipient households realize  economies of scale, and for what purposes recipients in these  households use their SSI benefits, have not been studied, according to  SSA officials and several researchers.", "A reduction in the maximum benefit rate for multiple recipient households  may lead some SSI recipients to alter their living arrangements, according  to groups with whom we spoke. Although the extent to which a benefit  reduction leads to such changes has not been studied, as mentioned  earlier, SSA field office staff told us that some married SSI recipients  attempt to avoid the benefit reduction by telling SSA staff they have  separated and are no longer living together. If a reduction in the  maximum benefit rate is extended to include other multiple recipient  households, affected SSI recipients may similarly take steps to avoid the  benefit reduction, according to disability advocates, researchers, and SSA  field office staff with whom we spoke. For example, some SSA field office  staff said that families living with multiple SSI children may move their  children to live with relatives to avoid a reduction in SSI benefits.", "Potential Effects on Other Federal Programs for Low-Income  Households and Individuals  Because SSI recipients may be eligible to receive benefits from other  federal programs for low-income households and individuals, these  programs may be affected if a reduced maximum SSI benefit rate were to  be extended to additional multiple recipient households, though the  effects would likely vary by program. Federal programs that these  households may also receive benefits from include, for example,  Medicaid, TANF and SNAP. While the effects of changes in other federal  means-tested programs, such as TANF, on SSI have been studied to  some extent, the reverse effect of SSI benefit changes on other federal  programs has not. However, based on our assessment of relevant laws,  regulations, other reports, and data for selected programs, the effects of a  reduced SSI maximum benefit rate on other programs would likely vary  based on each program\u2019s structure and rules and the extent to which SSI  recipients already receive benefits from these other programs.", "Medicaid, which many SSI recipients concurrently receive, would likely be  minimally affected by the extension of the reduced maximum benefit rate  to other multiple recipient households, based on our review of relevant  program laws, regulations, other reports, and data. In most states, SSI  recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid, and many currently  receive Medicaid benefits. For example, according to one SSA study,  approximately 80 percent of individuals ages 18 to 64 received Medicaid  coverage within a year of being deemed eligible for SSI. Therefore, a  reduction in SSI benefits may result in the small proportion of SSI  recipients who are not currently enrolled in Medicaid applying for the  program and receiving coverage. Further, because Medicaid benefits are  adjusted based on eligibility and not on income level, an SSI recipient\u2019s  Medicaid benefits would not be affected by a reduction in their SSI  benefits so long as the recipient remains eligible for SSI.", "TANF, which SSI recipients generally do not concurrently receive, would  also likely be minimally affected by a reduction in the maximum benefit  rate for additional multiple SSI recipient households, based on our review  of relevant program laws, regulations, other reports, and recipient data.  Although the federal government sets some requirements for TANF,  states have broad flexibility to design their TANF programs, and most  states do not allow individuals who receive SSI to simultaneously receive  TANF monthly cash assistance benefits, according to the Department of  Health and Human Services. However, other family members, living in  households with SSI recipients, may receive TANF cash assistance  benefits. The Department of Health and Human Services reported that  about 267,000 child-only TANF families had a parent or adult caretaker  who received SSI in fiscal year 2013. In contrast with Medicaid, TANF  benefits are generally adjusted based on a family\u2019s income level, and for  child-only TANF cases, the income and assets of the parent or adult  caretaker is factored in when determining the child\u2019s TANF benefit.  Therefore, TANF cash assistance benefits received by family members  living in a household with multiple SSI recipients may increase if a family  member\u2019s SSI benefit was reduced. However, given that federal funding  for TANF is provided through a block grant to states, the amount of  federal spending on TANF is not adjusted for changes in cash assistance  benefits provided to eligible families.", "In comparison with Medicaid and TANF, SNAP is more likely to  experience an increase in program spending if a reduction in the  maximum SSI benefit rate is established for additional multiple recipient  households, based on our review of relevant program laws, regulations,  other reports, and recipient data. Similar to Medicaid, SSI recipients can  be automatically eligible for SNAP. According to a report by USDA, 82  percent of individuals in households with SSI recipients received SNAP  benefits in fiscal year 2013. Further, according to SNAP administrative  data, about 4.5 million households receiving SNAP benefits included at  least one member who also received SSI benefits in fiscal year 2013.  For the group of SSI recipients who do not receive SNAP benefits, a  reduction in SSI benefits may cause them to apply for these benefits. In  addition, because SNAP benefit amounts are adjusted based on  household income, a reduction in SSI benefits would likely increase a  household\u2019s SNAP benefit, unless the SSI recipient\u2019s household already  receives the maximum SNAP benefit amount. According to SNAP  administrative data, the average monthly SNAP benefit received by  households with SSI as a countable income source was $205 in fiscal  year 2013. Further, these data show that 15.4 percent of households  with disabled nonelderly individuals received the maximum SNAP benefit  that year, compared to 40.7 percent of all SNAP households. Although a  reduced maximum SSI benefit rate for additional multiple SSI recipient  households may therefore result in increased federal spending on SNAP,  federal spending may decrease overall. Specifically, due to the way  SNAP benefits are structured, each lost dollar in SSI benefits would  represent less than one additional dollar gained in SNAP benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA Has Limited Ability to Electronically Manage Claims for Multiple Recipient Households", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s claims management system, which is comprised of MSSICS and  the SSR, is not able to automatically update the claim records for  recipients living in multiple recipient households. SSA officials told us  the claims management system was designed to manage the claims of,  and pay benefits to, individual recipients. When SSA conducts periodic  redeterminations of SSI recipient claims, or SSI recipients inform SSA of  changes in their income or living arrangements, field office staff said they  update recipients\u2019 claims to ensure the correct benefits are paid.  However, SSA headquarters and field office staff told us the system does  not have the ability to automatically connect and adjust the claim records  of individuals living in multiple recipient households. Although changes to  one of the SSI recipient\u2019s income or living arrangements in a multiple  recipient household may affect another recipient\u2019s claim in that  household, SSA headquarters officials stated that staff have to go into  each record separately to update each recipient\u2019s benefits. For example,  if a mother lives with two of her children who are both SSI recipients, and  the mother reports a change in her earned income, SSA\u2019s system does  not automatically adjust both children\u2019s benefit amounts to account for the  mother\u2019s change in income. Rather, while the system will add the new  income information into all relevant claims records, staff need to go into  each record separately to process the change. Further, if SSA field office  staff do not go into a claim record to process such a change, the system  does not alert them to do so. Without the ability to automatically connect  and adjust the claim records for individuals living in multiple recipient  households whose benefits are inter-related, SSA is at increased risk for  improper payments because staff may not adjust benefits for all recipients  in a multiple recipient household after a relevant change.", "Furthermore, SSA staff reported that processing claims for SSI recipients  who marry another recipient or separate from another recipient are not  possible in the claims management system. Field office staff must  process these claims manually, outside of the claims management  system, according to SSA headquarters officials and staff from 3 of the 5  field offices with whom we spoke. For these claims, they said field office  staff must manually complete forms to gather recipient information,  calculate benefits outside the claims management system, and then enter  the information into the system. Although SSA officials stated SSA  provides training on how to use the forms, staff from 3 of the 5 field  offices with whom we spoke said they rely on more seasoned field office  employees to demonstrate how to properly complete these forms.  Further, staff from 3 of the 5 field offices we spoke with told us that  manually processing these married and separating recipient household  claims are a common part of their daily work. Although an SSA official  told us that improper payments made in married couple claims in fiscal  year 2014 were attributed to recipient errors, staff from 3 of the 5 SSA  field offices with whom we spoke said processing claims outside of the  claims management system is time consuming and error prone. This  issue may be exacerbated in the near term due to the Supreme Court  ruling recognizing the right of same-sex couples to marry, a concern  specifically noted during one of our interviews with field office officials.", "SSA has no plans to update its claims management system to address  issues with processing claims for multiple recipient households, including  marrying and separating recipients, although the agency has broadly  committed to improving other areas of its technology infrastructure. SSA  officials told us that they have not conducted any specific assessments of  the effects manual payment processing for multiple recipient household  claims has on claim processing errors or improper payments as part of  their payment accuracy reporting. SSA officials explained there is no  program requirement to have the claims management system connect the  records of individuals living in multiple recipient households, and they do  not plan to make changes to do so. Yet, SSA has previously stated its  commitment to investing in the capacity and modern technologies needed  to update its aging and strained IT infrastructure. Furthermore, in its  2017 budget request, SSA stated its data systems are no longer the best  solution to administer the agency\u2019s programs, and added that it plans to  undertake a larger, multiyear reform effort. According to our  Organizational Transformation: A Framework for Assessing and  Improving Enterprise Architecture, improving an agency\u2019s enterprise  architecture is an essential means to having operations and technology  environments maximize institutional mission performance and  outcomes. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that agencies should identify and address risks to  achieving their objectives, including significant changes to both external  and internal conditions, as well as design their information systems to  support the completeness, accuracy, and validity of information needed to  achieve objectives. The increased opportunities for improper payments  resulting from the claims management system\u2019s limitations in updating  and processing benefit claims for those living in multiple SSI recipient  households is a risk to SSA\u2019s overall goal of strengthening the integrity of  SSA\u2019s programs. According to staff at 2 of the 5 field offices with whom  we spoke, fully automating the payment process for all claims and  electronically connecting the records for multiple recipient households  would make processing these claims more efficient and lower the number  of improper payments by reducing errors in claims processing.  However, SSA has not assessed the risks these systems limitations pose,  despite its plans to make changes to its data systems. Absent such an  assessment and without upgrades to the claims management system,  SSA is missing an opportunity to improve its day-to-day work processes.  Further, the agency will likely continue to experience related claim  processing errors and improper payments, both under current program  policies, as well as in the event related policy changes are implemented  in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although SSI provides cash assistance benefits to individuals, it is not  surprising that some SSI recipients live together due to family  relationships or economic and social factors. Any household with more  than one member may potentially experience economies of scale, and  when the SSI program was created, it included a lower maximum benefit  rate for certain married couple recipients. However, despite the fact that  the majority of households with multiple SSI recipients report including  members of only one family, few report that they include married couple  recipients. This raises questions for some about benefit equity and  disincentives to marriage, as well as the ability of program administrators  to effectively determine a recipient\u2019s marital status. Although the potential  effects of various benefit restructuring options have not been fully studied,  our finding that households with multiple SSI recipients receive almost 30  percent of all SSI benefits suggests that changing the benefit structure for  all or some of these households may have a significant effect on benefit  costs. Further, regardless of whether a change to benefits for households  with multiple recipients is made, there are limitations in SSA\u2019s information  systems with managing claims for SSI recipients who live with other  recipients, which puts the agency at risk. However, absent a risk  assessment, SSA lacks information on the impact current systems  limitations may have on improper payments. The recent Court ruling  recognizing the right of same-sex couples to marry also likely increases  opportunities for improper payments to SSI recipients, because of the  expected increase in the number of claims SSA staff must process  manually due to the system\u2019s constraints in converting claims for  individual recipients to married couple recipients. Despite reported plans  to upgrade SSA\u2019s aging technology systems, SSA currently does not  have plans to address issues related to processing claims for SSI  recipients who live with other recipients, leaving the program at risk for  improper payments.

As  such, the agency stated that it could not commit resources to address our  recommendation at this time, but noted if a legislative proposal is put forth  that affects unrelated multiple SSI recipient households, SSA will assess  program policy and systems risks as part of its evaluation and planning.  However, we continue to believe that the manual processing currently  used to connect and adjust claim records of SSI recipients who live in  households with other SSI recipients leaves the agency at risk. SSA has  acknowledged that it has not assessed the extent to which manual  processing leads to payment errors, and the data they provided us on  fiscal year 2014 improper payments to married couple recipients does not  address the full scope of the issues we identified. Specifically, field office  staff reported several instances in which manual processing is used to  connect and adjust claims records for multiple recipient households due  to system limitations, and indicated that these manual adjustments  increase the likelihood of erroneous payments. These manually  processed claims are for households with multiple related recipients  whose SSI benefits are currently inter-related under program rules, such  as multiple child recipients who are siblings or individual recipients who  marry another recipient.
