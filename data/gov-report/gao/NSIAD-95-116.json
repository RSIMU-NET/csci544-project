A total of 323 cruise missiles were fired against a variety of Iraqi targets in the conflict\u2019s early stages. The missile attacks were part of a multiphase air campaign designed to decapitate the Iraqi leadership, gain air superiority, and reduce Iraqi combat power in preparation for the ground offensive to restore Kuwait\u2019s border. Tomahawk missiles have subsequently struck two Iraqi facilities in the Baghdad area. U.S. ships launched 42 missiles against the Zafraniyah Nuclear Fabrication Facility on January 17, 1993, and 23 missiles against Iraqi Intelligence Service headquarters on June 26, 1993. These attacks demonstrated that cruise missiles could play an important role in both major conflicts and more limited engagements by allowing U.S. forces to strike an adversary with a high degree of accuracy at long ranges and without risking the loss of aircraft or aircrew."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Tomahawk Weapon System", "paragraphs": ["The Tomahawk cruise missile is a long-range, unmanned subsonic missile with both land attack and antiship capability that can be employed under a variety of weather conditions. It is launched from a variety of Navy surface ships and attack submarines. There are four Tomahawk variants: the nuclear land attack missile (TLAM-N), the antiship missile (TASM), the conventional land attack missile with a unitary warhead (TLAM-C), and the conventional land attack missile with a submunition warhead (TLAM-D). Each variant employs a common body and propulsion system but is equipped with different warheads and guidance systems. The four variants are shown in figure 1.1.", "Navy ships and submarines currently deploy predominantly with TLAM-Cs and TLAM-Ds. The TLAM-Ns were removed from the vessels as the Cold War was ending. Navy officials said that the TASM\u2019s mission has been reduced because this variant is not particularly suited to warfare in littoral waters that may be crowded with both combatant and noncombatant ships. The TASM was originally intended as an over-the-horizon, open ocean, antiship weapon to be employed against ships in a battle group.", "The TLAM-Cs and -Ds employed during Operation Desert Storm and the subsequent strikes were Block II missiles, which make up the majority of the current inventory. All Tomahawks delivered to the Navy since April 1993 have been improved Block III models. The Navy plans production of a Block IV variant by the end of this decade. The improvements incorporated in the Block III missile and those planned for Block IV are discussed in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Block II Missile", "paragraphs": ["The principal difference between the Block II TLAM-C and TLAM-D is the warhead. The TLAM-C carries a 1,000-pound-class unitary warhead, and the TLAM-D carries a submunitions payload consisting of 166 bomblets. The TLAM-C is employed against a single fixed target, such as a specific point on a building, whereas the TLAM-D is designed to attack area-type targets, such as aircraft parked on a ramp. A single TLAM-D missile can dispense its submunitions payload over as many as three separate targets.", "The Block II TLAM-C and TLAM-D ranges equal or exceed the unrefueled combat radius of most U.S. manned tactical strike aircraft. However, those missiles that are launched from a submarine torpedo tube have a range about 30 percent less than surface ship-launched missiles. The submarine-launched Tomahawk has a booster rocket that propels the missile to the surface after it leaves the torpedo tube. The missile is partially de-fueled to compensate for the booster\u2019s added weight, which decreases its range. However, the Navy has begun procuring an improved booster that allows submarines to launch fully fueled missiles.", "The Tomahawk missile follows a pre-programmed route over specific terrain features to its target using a combination of terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and digital scene matching and area correlation (DSMAC). The Tomahawk\u2019s flight profile is illustrated in figure 1.2.", "During the initial portion of its flight, the missile navigates by TERCOM. A radar altimeter aboard the missile periodically scans the terrain over which the missile is flying. The on-board computer then compares the resulting terrain elevation profile to its profile of the predicted route to the target, which was stored in the computer before the missile\u2019s launch. The computer then adjusts the missile\u2019s course so that it is following the planned route to the target.", "The Tomahawk navigates by DSMAC during the terminal leg of its flight to the target. The DSMAC process uses an optical sensor in the missile that scans the ground over which the missile is flying. The on-board computer converts the scanned image of the ground features into an image of black and white contrasts. The computer then compares that image to its stored DSMAC black and white images of the selected sites along the route. As with TERCOM, the missile\u2019s computer then adjusts the missile\u2019s course so it is following the preplanned route. The Block II missile uses inertial navigation between TERCOM and DSMAC update points.", "Currently, 60 surface ships and 75 submarines are capable of launching Tomahawk missiles. The Navy projects that by 1999 the Tomahawk-capable force will consist of 82 ships and 55 submarines. Table 1.1 shows the projected Tomahawk platform force.", "The planned wartime loads of TLAM-C and TLAM-D missiles vary for surface ships and submarines. Navy officials said that notional missile loads are used for planning purposes; actual loads could vary depending on the specific mission assigned by the operational commander.", "The Tomahawks share launcher space with other missiles on several ship classes. Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Ticonderoga class cruisers are predominantly loaded with standard surface-to-air missiles. Because attack submarines have limited weapon storage space, all TTL Tomahawks carried displace an equal number of torpedoes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tomahawk Procurement", "paragraphs": ["The Navy plans to continue procuring Block III TLAM-C missiles until fiscal year 1998. It plans to procure 216 missiles in fiscal year 1994 at a cost of about $1.2 million per missile and 217 missiles per year from fiscal years 1995 to 1998. The Navy currently plans to begin production of the Block IV missile through the remanufacture of existing Block II missiles and TASMs after fiscal year 1998.", "The Air Force\u2019s CALCM was the other U.S. cruise missile used in the Gulf War. The CALCM is a modification of the nuclear-armed Air Launched Cruise Missile, which is a subsonic, all-weather cruise missile. During the modification process, certain components are removed, and a conventional warhead is installed. A Global Positioning System navigation capability is also added. The resulting weapon has a circular error probable (CEP) roughly twice that of the Block III TLAM-C.", "The CALCM is carried by B-52 bombers and is launched within range of the target. After launch, CALCM follows a preplanned route to its target, using inertial navigation with Global Positioning System updates. The missile\u2019s mission can be changed or updated by the flight crew while the B-52 is airborne. New or updated missions can be transmitted to the aircraft from the air base and then loaded into the missile\u2019s computer. This process allows CALCM missions to be changed or updated any number of times before launch. However, once launched, no communications with the missile are possible. The Air Force\u2019s current inventory of CALCM\u2019s includes missiles authorized to replace those used in Desert Storm.", "Mission planning for the CALCM is performed at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The average mission planning time for a new target for CALCM is comparable to the planning time for a Block II Tomahawk mission. The completed missions are transmitted to a U.S. air base from which the B-52 CALCM flight will be launched. Bomber preparation and loading can take an average of 24 hours but can be done concurrently with mission planning. Flight times to Iraq during Desert Storm averaged 16 hours.

During Desert Storm, U.S. Navy ships and submarines launched 288 Tomahawk missiles, and Air Force B-52 bombers launched 35 CALCMs, all against targets in Iraq. The missiles were used against a wide range of targets that included predominately electrical production facilities; Scud missile facilities; command, control, and communications facilities; and leadership targets. Many of these targets were similar to those attacked by manned aircraft. Cruise missiles struck fixed, heavily defended strategic targets that if attacked by manned aircraft\u2014particularly non-stealth aircraft\u2014could have resulted in the unacceptable loss of aircrews and aircraft. The cruise missiles also struck targets at ranges that would have required manned strike aircraft to refuel.", "According to studies conducted by the Center for Naval Analyses and the Defense Intelligence Agency, Tomahawk missiles and CALCMs hit their intended aim points with success rates approaching those of manned precision-strike aircraft, such as the F-117A stealth fighter. The Tomahawk\u2019s performance improved in the 1993 raids on the Zafraniyah nuclear facility and Iraqi intelligence headquarters. The success rate was about 26 to 35 percent higher for the Zafraniyah raid, and 20 to 29 percent higher for the raid on Iraqi Intelligence Headquarters, than the Tomahawk\u2019s success rate during Desert Storm.", "Desert Storm also demonstrated several limitations in the design and employment of both missiles. Tomahawk operations were hampered by the stringent geographic information requirements to support the missile\u2019s navigation systems and the lengthy mission planning process. The Tomahawk also demonstrated limitations in its range and lethality. The limited ability of the CALCM\u2019s warhead and its guidance system\u2019s lower accuracy (compared with the Tomahawk\u2019s) restricted the types of targets that the CALCM could successfully attack.", "Improvements have already been incorporated into the Block III Tomahawk variant currently in production and address many of the limitations noted during Operation Desert Storm.

The commanders also began developing a four-phase plan to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The first phase was for a strategic air campaign focused initially on decapitating Iraqi military and civilian command and control by a series of attacks against strategically vital targets, followed by attacks against fielded military forces. Five basic categories of targets\u2014command and control, industrial production, infrastructure, population will, and fielded forces\u2014were encompassed in the plan.", "The most important targets were command, control, and communications targets, which were to be struck forcefully to incapacitate Saddam Hussein\u2019s ability to control his nation, disrupt the Iraqi forces, and induce the Iraqis to withdrawal from Kuwait. Attacks on key production and infrastructure targets would follow to further fracture the country and degrade Iraq\u2019s ability to replenish its forces. Attacks on targets such as television and radio stations and electrical power generation and distribution facilities, would degrade the will of the civilian population. Finally, in preparation for a coalition ground assault, Iraqi forces in the field would be struck.", "Three other phases were to follow.

Most cruise missiles were fired early in the campaign. Navy ships attempted to launch a total of 297 Tomahawk missiles. Of the 288 that were launched, 282 (95 percent) achieved cruise flight and proceeded toward their target. Of the 39 CALCMs carried to launch points by B-52s, 35 (90 percent) were launched and proceeded toward their target.", "According to data in studies conducted by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and our analysis of Gulf War Air Power Survey data, both missiles achieved results approaching those of manned aircraft, such as the F-117A, during Desert Storm.", "DOD and Navy officials said that multiple weapon strikes on many of the aim points and a lack of timely battle damage assessment during Desert Storm made it very difficult to determine the effectiveness of the Tomahawk and the CALCM. Target analysts were unable to obtain damage assessments for each aim point after each attack. Since many targets were attacked more than once by both aircraft and cruise missiles, it was an arduous task to determine which attack caused the observed damage in those cases. Additionally, since many aim points were also targeted by multiple missiles, it was difficult for the analysts to determine how many weapons caused the resulting damage.", "DOD officials said that the missiles\u2019 mission objectives must be taken into account when measuring the missiles\u2019 success. Even if intended targets are not destroyed, a military objective can be met if the targets are rendered unusable or damaged as a result of being struck by some of several missiles targeted against it.", "Tomahawk missiles struck targets in 8 of the 12 overall target categories.The emphasis placed on the categories changed between the first 2 days and the remainder of the conflict. However, over the course of the campaign, the majority of the Tomahawks that were fired were launched against targets in four specific strategic target categories.", "According to Navy officials, the 38 target complexes that Tomahawks attacked were all heavily defended and lent themselves to attack by an accurate, unmanned weapon such as the Tomahawk. Many of these targets were similar to those struck by manned aircraft. In many cases, the Tomahawk and manned aircraft not only struck the same categories of targets but also the same complexes. For example, Air Force aircraft launched 355 strikes\u2014239 by the F-117A\u2014against complexes that were also struck by the Tomahawk. Navy aircraft launched 185 strikes against complexes that were also struck by Tomahawk.", "The Tomahawk\u2019s geographic reach equaled or exceeded that of manned aircraft. Many of the targets the Tomahawk and manned aircraft attacked were located in the same areas of Iraq. The Tomahawk\u2019s range allowed it to strike its targets flying from launch points in the Mediterranean and the Red Seas, and the Persian Gulf. The F-117As, flying from bases in southern Saudi Arabia (see fig. 2.1), were refueled on all missions. In addition, Tomahawk missiles were the only weapons that struck targets in the downtown Baghdad area during daylight for most of the campaign. Even though the Air Force\u2019s F-117As attacked Baghdad-area targets at night throughout the campaign, attacks by other aircraft were stopped after Iraqi ground defenses shot down two F-16s on the second day of the conflict. Thus, the Tomahawk\u2019s use had the added benefit of maintaining psychological pressure on the Iraqis in and around Baghdad.", "Navy officials believe that some Tomahawks may have been shot down by Iraqi ground-based antiaircraft artillery. However, there appears to be no evidence that surface-to-air missiles contributed to Tomahawk kills. These officials also said that Tomahawk\u2019s flight profile made it difficult for surface-to-air missile systems to successfully identify and attack Tomahawks.", "The limited number of routes used by Tomahawks to approach Iraqi targets and the tactics employed to ensure coordination with tactical aircraft missions may have contributed to missile losses. Because the usable routes into Iraq were so limited, multiple Tomahawks were launched along the same route. Thus, Iraqi gunners might have come to expect that, once a Tomahawk was sighted, others would soon follow along the same path. As a result, it would have been much easier to identify and engage the missiles that followed. According to a CNA study, the success rate for Tomahawks fired within the first 2 days of the air war was much higher than for those fired later, indicating that the Iraqi gunners might have become accustomed to seeing the missiles using certain routes and flying in stream raids.", "Despite its limitations, Navy officials said that the Tomahawk\u2019s use provided a clear view of the missile\u2019s performance under arduous conditions. The flat, featureless terrain gave mission planners perhaps the most difficult task possible in creating the TERCOM and DSMAC scenes needed. The hot Middle East climate meant that the Tomahawk\u2019s engine was operating under the harshest possible conditions as well. Officials assert that the conditions under which the Tomahawk operated had to be considered when assessing the system\u2019s performance.", "As with the Tomahawk, the CALCM contributed to the success of Operation Desert Storm but also demonstrated some limitations. On the first day of the conflict, seven B-52Gs carrying AGM-86C CALCMs took off from Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, on a 35-hour, 14,000-mile round trip. All targets that the CALCMs attacked were in 2 of the 12 categories and consisted of 5 military communications sites and 3 electrical power stations. DIA\u2019s assessment of CALCM\u2019s damage to Iraqi targets concluded mission objectives were achieved against the majority of targets.", "The cruise missiles were not the only systems that demonstrated limitations during Operation Desert Storm. Not all manned aircraft struck their intended targets. For example, as stated earlier, our analysis of Gulf War Air Power Survey data showed that the percent of the weapons carried aboard the F-117As that took off during the conflict and struck their intended targets was similar to the success rate achieved by the cruise missiles. The F-117As carried munitions on about 1,300 sorties, but they released only about 79 percent of the weapons against their targets.Of those released, a high percentage struck their intended aim points. Poor visibility (overcast, fog, and smoke) limited the F-117A\u2019s ability to use its laser targeting and bomb guidance system. Almost 350 strikes were aborted after takeoff due to bad weather conditions alone. For example, more than half of the F-117A flights were unsuccessful on days two and three of the air campaign because of low clouds. In addition, bad weather halted operations for 2 consecutive nights during the later stage of the air campaign and during the final 2 days of the war. Another 76 strikes were aborted because the pilots had problems identifying the targets.", "Other aircraft were also affected by various problems. For example, about 780, or 33 percent, of the 2,310 F-111F sorties were aborted before striking their targets because of mechanical and other problems and poor weather. Mechanical problems with various aircraft components, such as inertial navigation systems, air refueling systems, and digital computer complexes, caused nearly 45 percent of the aborts. Poor weather restricted the aircraft\u2019s ability to launch laser-guided bombs and caused nearly 25 percent of the aborts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tomahawk Performance Since Desert Storm", "paragraphs": ["Since Desert Storm, U.S. forces used the Tomahawk to strike Iraq in two punitive raids.

We believe the number of weapons the F-117As carried from the airfields compares most directly with the number of cruise missiles that were launched from the ships and B-52s; therefore, we based our analysis on that number.", "The success rate of the Tomahawk missiles that arrived in their target areas was much higher than the success rate of all missiles launched. Our analysis of data in CNA\u2019s final Tomahawk study shows that more than 75 percent of the TLAM-Cs programmed for a terminal dive maneuver that arrived in their target area struck their intended aim point.", "We agree with DOD\u2019s comment that aircraft are frequently refueled to enhance flight safety. However, as the Gulf War Air Power Survey points out, aircraft (including the F-117A) were frequently refueled during Desert Storm because the distance to the targets from their bases exceeded their unrefueled combat radius. Even though all future conflicts may not involve the ranges encountered during Desert Storm, the cruise missiles\u2019 range is an advantage.", "DOD said that, even though our report implied that cruise missiles could be used interchangeably with manned aircraft, the Tomahawk\u2019s current capabilities restricted its use to fixed, nonhardened targets.

Employing cruise missiles can also avoid possible political constraints, such as obtaining host nation permission to use U.S. aircraft from forward deployed bases or fly through a third nation\u2019s airspace. Currently, 135 ships and submarines are equipped to launch Tomahawk missiles, which significantly expands the U.S. ability to conduct forward presence operations or respond to an adversary without the presence of an aircraft carrier battle group or conventional air forces. CALCM attacks can also be launched from U.S. bases, which allows the United States to attack an adversary without necessarily having forces nearby or risking the loss of U.S. aircrews. Reductions in mission planning times and other planned improvements could make the Tomahawk as responsive for strike missions as manned aircraft attacks.", "Tactical aircraft systems have some advantages over cruise missiles and will therefore continue to play a key role in offensive strike operations. For example, aircraft-launched munitions can successfully attack a wider spectrum of targets than cruise missiles, such as those that are mobile, relocatable, or more hardened.

However, we believe that the extensive support requirements of manned aircraft strikes must be taken into account when comparing the various systems. The 1993 Tomahawk strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters is a clear illustration of this point. Extensive intelligence and target data would have been required to plan both a manned aircraft strike and a Tomahawk strike. However, after the Tomahawk mission data was prepared and transmitted to the ships, the launch vessels that were already operating in the area required no external support to launch the strike. On the other hand, all of the aircraft we discussed as making up a strike package would have been required to support a manned aircraft strike.

Even though the risk of collateral damage may be relatively low in attacks by aircraft employing precision munitions such as the F-117A, it can be a significant factor for other aircraft/weapon combinations. For example, the Gulf War Air Power Survey report notes that aircraft employing nonprecision munitions were not used to strike targets in urban areas because of the high risk of causing politically unacceptable collateral damage to civilian targets. Conversely, Navy officials told us that the Tomahawk was chosen to strike targets in several instances during Desert Storm because U.S. commanders believed the targets were too close to sensitive civilian targets to risk the collateral damage that could have resulted from manned aircraft strikes.

As pointed out in chapter 3, the F-117As were refueled for all their strikes during Desert Storm. Configuring most future Navy strike aircraft to conduct unrefueled strikes at ranges greater than those of current-generation strike aircraft may be unnecessary. Therefore, most future aircraft could be optimized to conduct attacks at shorter ranges, potentially resulting in procurement savings. Longer range targets could be attacked by, and would be vulnerable to, long-range bombers, Tomahawks, other cruise missiles, and refueled strike aircraft, when necessary.", "Cruise missiles\u2019 ability to attack heavily defended targets without placing aircraft or aircrews at risk could also affect stealth requirements for most future aircraft and result in more affordable aircraft designs. Desert Storm demonstrated that the majority of U.S. aircraft can operate effectively without stealth technology. According to DOD officials, in the first days of the air campaign, cruise missiles acting with a limited number of F-117A and nonstealth defense suppression aircraft, such as the F-4G and EA-6B, effectively incapacitated the Iraqi air defense system and rendered it largely ineffective after day 3. This created a relatively benign environment in which nonstealth aircraft operated with near impunity for the remainder of the conflict. As a result, Air Force officials said that, once the air defense system was degraded, the F-117A was valued more in many cases for its precision bomb dropping capability than for its stealth characteristics. These officials also said that the degradation of enemy air defenses is likely to be a top priority in any future conflict, as it was during Desert Storm.

If, as DOD said, cruise missiles are especially useful in the early stages of an air campaign to create more favorable conditions for the large-scale employment of manned aircraft, manned aircraft can be employed in a more survivable environment. As a result, the design of most strike aircraft could include a less costly, though still adequate, stealth capability. Therefore, a less costly overall mix of aircraft could be employed.

Additionally, as one Pacific Command official pointed out, potential adversaries cannot discount the possibility of the presence of Tomahawk-equipped submarines, even though the submarines are not visible. Furthermore, the July 1993 strike\u2019s effect was not tempered by U.S. losses, as were the strikes in Lebanon and Libya.
