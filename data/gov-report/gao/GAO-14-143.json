In 2013, CMS had 75 PDP and 555 MA-PD contracts with  Part D plan sponsors that together offered 2,660 plans.

Under the standard benefit, beneficiaries pay  monthly premiums and cost-sharing for drug purchases. Cost-sharing  varies over the course of the year as beneficiaries move through the  phases of the benefit. The standard benefit features a deductible and an  initial coverage period during which beneficiaries pay coinsurance for  prescription drugs until they reach the initial coverage limit. After the initial  coverage period, beneficiaries enter the coverage gap, which is followed  by the catastrophic coverage period in which beneficiaries pay a small  share of total drug costs (see fig. 1).", "In addition to the standard Part D benefit, plan sponsors can offer a range  of plans with different benefit structures that are actuarially equivalent to,  or exceed the standard benefit. Under these plans, monthly premiums  and cost-sharing arrangements can vary. For example, plans with  enhanced benefits may charge higher monthly premiums than standard  benefit plans, but may offer lower cost-sharing arrangements, such as a  reduction or elimination of a deductible. Under Part D, certain individuals  are also entitled to a low-income subsidy (LIS), through which they get  reduced premiums and generally have zero or nominal cost-sharing.", "Subject to certain rules, the prescription drugs covered by Part D plans  and the cost-sharing arrangements for covered drugs may differ between  plans. Each Part D plan has a formulary\u2014a list of the prescription drugs  that it covers and the terms under which they are covered. While each  plan may vary in the specific drugs it covers, plans must adhere to a  minimum set of formulary requirements established in statute and  regulation. In addition, a plan\u2019s formulary may assign drugs to tiers that  correspond to different levels of cost-sharing. For example, plans often  assign generic drugs to the tier that requires the lowest cost-sharing level.  Plans have flexibility in how they structure tiers, and different plans may  place the same drug in different tiers. Plans may also subject drugs to  utilization management practices, such as a limit on the amount of a drug  that is covered.", "Part D cost-sharing for beneficiaries may also vary based on the  pharmacies they use. Plan sponsors contract with retail and mail order  pharmacies to dispense the drugs that plans cover.
