GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the extent to which federal agencies have assigned work roles for positions performing IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions and (2) describe the steps federal agencies took to identify work roles of critical need. GAO administered a questionnaire to 24 agencies, analyzed coding data from personnel systems, and examined preliminary reports on critical needs.

However, six of the 24 agencies reported that they had not completed assigning the associated work role codes to their vacant positions, although they were required to do so by April 2018. In addition, most agencies had likely miscategorized the work roles of many positions. Specifically, 22 of the 24 agencies assigned a \u201cnon-IT\u201d work role code to 15,779 (about 19 percent) of their IT positions within the 2210 occupational series. Further, the six agencies that GAO selected for additional review had assigned work role codes that were not consistent with the work roles and duties described in corresponding position descriptions for 63 of 120 positions within the 2210 occupational series that GAO examined (see figure).", "Human resource and IT officials from the 24 agencies generally reported that they had not completely or accurately categorized work roles for IT positions within the 2210 occupational series, in part, because they may have assigned the associated codes in error or had not completed validating the accuracy of the assigned codes. By assigning work roles that are inconsistent with the IT, cybersecurity, and cyber-related positions, the agencies are diminishing the reliability of the information they need to improve workforce planning.", "The act also required agencies to identify work roles of critical need by April 2019. To aid agencies with identifying their critical needs, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed guidance and required agencies to provide a preliminary report by August 2018. The 24 agencies have begun to identify critical needs and submitted a preliminary report to OPM that identified information systems security manager, IT project manager, and systems security analyst as the top three work roles of critical need.

Work roles provide a more detailed  description of the roles and responsibilities of IT, cybersecurity, and  cyber-related job functions than do the category and specialty area  components of the framework. The framework defines one or more work  roles within each specialty area. For example, as depicted in figure 2, the  framework defines 11 work roles within the seven specialty areas of the  \u201cSecurely Provision\u201d category.

We pre-tested the questionnaire with OPM and the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials to ensure that the  questions were clear, comprehensive, and unbiased, and to minimize the  burden the questionnaire placed on respondents. We also asked the chief  information officer and the chief human capital officer of each agency to  certify that they reviewed and validated the responses to the  questionnaires.", "We administered the questionnaire between June and October 2018. We  received completed questionnaires from each of the 24 agencies, for a  response rate of 100 percent. We examined the questionnaire results and  performed computer analyses to identify missing data, inconsistencies,  and other indications of error, and addressed such issues as necessary,  including through follow-up communications with the 24 agencies. We  reviewed and analyzed the agencies\u2019 responses to the questionnaire in  comparison to the act\u2019s requirements and OPM\u2019s and NICE\u2019s guidance.  We also obtained, reviewed, and analyzed supporting documentation of  questionnaire responses, such as reports of cybersecurity employment  code data, to assess whether agencies assigned work role codes in  accordance with the activities in OPM\u2019s coding guidance, by April 2018.", "Further, to analyze how federal agencies assigned work role codes to  positions performing IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions, we  obtained IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related workforce coding data for the  24 agencies from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration  system. To assess the reliability of coding data from OPM\u2019s system, we  reviewed these data to determine its completeness, and asked officials  responsible for entering and reviewing the work role coding data a series  of questions about the accuracy and reliability of the data. In addition, we  examined the Enterprise Human Resources Integration IT, cybersecurity,  or cyber-related coding data to determine the number of positions the 24  agencies had assigned the \u201c000\u201d code to positions in the 2210 IT  management occupational series as of May 2018. We reviewed  positions from the 2210 IT management occupational series because  those positions are likely to perform IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related  functions. In the report, we note some challenges with the reliability of  these data and are careful to present our data in line with these  limitations.", "We then identified a subset of the 24 agencies and performed an  additional review of these agencies\u2019 work role coding efforts. We selected  these agencies based on their total cybersecurity spending for fiscal year  2016, as reported by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in its  Federal Information Security Modernization Act annual report. We sorted  the 24 agencies\u2019 IT cybersecurity spending from highest to lowest and  then divided them into three equal groups of high, medium, and low. We  then selected the top two agencies from each group. Based on these  factors, we selected six agencies: the (1) Department of Defense (DOD),  (2) DHS, (3) Department of State (State), (4) National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), (5) Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), and (6) General Services Administration (GSA).We performed an  additional review of the agencies\u2019 work role coding efforts. We did this by  evaluating the six selected agencies\u2019 coding processes against their  established procedures and OPM requirements. We also obtained and  reviewed coding data that included the assigned work role codes for  civilian employees from each agency\u2019s human resources system.", "To assess the reliability of coding data from the selected six agencies\u2019  systems, we reviewed related documentation such as the agencies\u2019  coding procedures, processing guides, personnel bulletins, and system  screen shots. We also conducted electronic testing for missing data,  duplicate data, or obvious errors. In addition, we asked officials  responsible for entering and reviewing the work role coding data a series  of questions about the accuracy and reliability of the data. For any  anomalies in the data, we followed up with the six selected agencies\u2019  offices of the chief information officer and chief human capital officer to  either understand or correct those anomalies. Further, we assessed the  reliability of data in terms of the extent to which codes were completely  assigned and reasonably accurate. In the report, we note some  challenges with the reliability of these data and are careful to present our  data in line with these limitations.", "We randomly selected a sample of 20 positions from each of the six  selected agencies (120 total positions) within the 2210 IT management  occupational series. We reviewed positions from the IT management  2210 series because those positions are likely to perform IT,  cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions. For the selected positions, we  requested position descriptions and reviewed whether the position work  role codes in the coding data were consistent with the corresponding  position description text. We also selected a second nonstatistical sample  of 12 positions for each of the six agencies (72 total positions) from the  2210 IT management occupational series based on pairs of positions that  had identical position titles, occupational series, and sub-agencies, but for  which the agencies had assigned different work role codes for the  positions. An analyst reviewed the work role coding data and compared  them to the duties described by the position descriptions to determine  whether they were consistent with the position duties. A second analyst  verified whether or not the position\u2019s work role code was consistent with  the position description. A third analyst adjudicated cases in which the  first and second analysts\u2019 evaluations did not match.", "Lastly, to evaluate agencies\u2019 actions to address the last three activities of  the act related to the identification of cybersecurity work roles of critical  need, we obtained, reviewed, and analyzed OPM\u2019s guidance for  identifying critical needs and its progress report to Congress by  comparing it to the act\u2019s requirements. We reviewed agencies\u2019  responses to our questionnaire regarding whether they had developed  methodologies or project plans for identifying critical needs. We also  reviewed any available documentation on the 24 agencies\u2019 progress in  identifying critical needs, such as project plans, timelines, and preliminary  reports. In addition, OPM required agencies to submit a preliminary report  on work roles of critical need by August 31, 2018. We obtained copies  of the preliminary reports from the 24 agencies. We evaluated agencies\u2019  efforts to meet the deadline, as well as for meeting OPM\u2019s requirements  for documenting work roles of critical need and determining root causes  of those needs.", "To supplement our analysis, we interviewed agency officials from human  resources and chief information officer offices at the 24 agencies  regarding their progress in coding and identifying cybersecurity work roles  of critical need.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to March 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Office of Personnel Management Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Cyber-related Work Role Codes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Summary of 24 Chief Financial Officers Act Agencies\u2019 Implementation of the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015, as of Nov. 2018", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Top 12 Work Roles of Critical Need as Identified by the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act Agencies in Their Preliminary Reports of Critical Need", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Energy", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XI: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XII: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIII: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIV: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XV: Comments from the Environmental Protection Agency", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVI: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVII: Comments from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XVIII: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XIX: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XX: Comments from the Social Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XXI: Comments from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XXII: Comments from the United States Agency for International Development", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix XXIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Tammi Kalugdan (Assistant  Director), Merry Woo (Analyst-in-Charge), Carlos (Steven) Aguilar,  Alexander Anderegg, Christina Bixby, Carl Barden, Chris Businsky,  Virginia Chanley, Cynthia Grant, Paris Hawkins, Lee Hinga, James  (Andrew) Howard, Assia Khadri, David Plocher, Steven Putansu, and  Priscilla Smith made significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["The federal government needs a qualified, well-trained cybersecurity workforce to protect vital IT systems.
