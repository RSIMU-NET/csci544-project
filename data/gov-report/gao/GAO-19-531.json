BOEM is required to seek a fair return from offshore leasing and production activities in federal waters. Companies generally pay (1) bids for leases for the right to develop tracts, (2) rents on leased but undeveloped tracts, and (3) royalties on revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced from leases. BOEM holds auctions to award leases to the company offering the highest bid so long as the bureau determines the bid represents fair market value.", "GAO was asked to examine issues related to offshore federal oil and gas leasing.

Specifically, between May 1985 and June 2018, peaks in industry bidding coincided with higher oil prices. Additionally, when the Department of the Interior's (Interior) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) offered leases at lower royalty rates, industry bid somewhat higher amounts per acre. For example, certain leases were sold from 1996 through 2000 with no royalties on initial volumes of production, which GAO estimates resulted in BOEM collecting, at most, nearly $2 billion in additional bid revenue. However, bureau estimates indicate these leases resulted in about $18 billion in foregone royalties through 2018.", "BOEM's valuation process might not fully assure receipt of fair market value, based on GAO's analysis of BOEM data. BOEM develops valuations for offshore tracts it assesses to be economically viable\u2014assessments of their fair market value\u2014and awards leases so long as the bid is greater than or equal to BOEM's valuation. BOEM's valuations for tracts were generally low relative to industry bids because, according to BOEM officials, they conservatively forecast to account for inherent uncertainties in, among other things, the quantity of oil and gas present as well as exploration and development costs. In addition, GAO identified two ways BOEM's valuation process results in lowering its already conservative valuations that might not fully assure receipt of fair market value:", "Unreasonably high depreciation . BOEM forecast that tracts would lose a median of 23 percent of their value in between sales, leading the bureau to accept lower bids because it determined the tracts might be worth even less in the future. Bureau officials told GAO that lower future values are generally due to BOEM discounting the delayed collection of revenue. However, BOEM's forecasted depreciation increased even though tracts are now available twice as frequently as they were prior to August 2017, reducing the time for discounting. Officials said they were unaware of the high rates and the issue warrants further examination. Enlisting a third party to examine the extent to which the bureau's use of delayed valuations assures the receipt of fair market value, and making changes as appropriate, would help BOEM mitigate risks of continuing to accept bids based on poor information on tracts' future values.", "Lowered valuations . BOEM officials told GAO that they lower some initial valuations that are \u201cslightly above\u201d industry's bids and which would therefore be rejected per procedures to assure fair market value. Officials said they prefer to accept bids unless there is high certainty that the bids are inadequate. However, GAO identified bias, or statistical anomalies, where BOEM lowered many valuations that were initially higher than industry's bids. Specifically, from March 2000 through June 2018, BOEM rejected 27 bids for tracts that it ultimately valued at up to double industry's bid whereas it accepted 359 bids in which industry's bid was up to double BOEM's valuation. Tracts for rejected bids are, on average, subsequently sold for more than twice the initial rejected amount, suggesting that BOEM could be forgoing hundreds of millions of dollars in bid revenue by accepting bids that are too low."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that BOEM (1) enlist an independent third party to examine whether the use of delayed valuations assures the receipt of fair market value and (2) take steps to ensure its bid valuation process is not biased toward lowering valuations.

It is  also a significant source of revenue for the federal government. From  2006 through 2018, the federal government collected almost $90 billion in  revenue from the management of offshore oil and gas resources. These  revenues were generated primarily through (1) upfront cash payments  (bonus bids) for leasing rights to explore, develop, and sell oil and gas  resources; and (2) royalty payments as a percent of the value of oil and  gas produced.", "An objective of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) is that the  Outer Continental Shelf be made available for expeditious and orderly  development, subject to environmental safeguards while maintaining  competition for offshore resources.

BOEM regularly holds auctions\u2014called  lease sales\u2014at which companies bid on a specific geographic area, or  tract, of unleased land made available for oil and gas development. Prior  to these lease sales, BOEM determines the fiscal terms that are applied  to the life of any lease sold as well as the duration of the leases. BOEM  has authority to change any of these fiscal terms, within the parameters  set by statute and in the bureau\u2019s implementing regulations, and the  bureau has periodically done so. For example, between 2006 and 2008,  BOEM increased royalty rates from the statutory minimum 12.5 percent  for most depths to 18.75 percent for all depths, and in 2011 BOEM  increased minimum bids for tracts in waters greater than 400 meters from  $37.50 per acre to $100 per acre. According to bureau procedures, after  each lease sale, BOEM is to evaluate the adequacy of the highest bid  received for each tract, and award the lease to the highest bidder so long  as BOEM determines that the bid meets certain criteria, including that the  bid is greater than or equal to BOEM\u2019s assessment of the fair market  value of the tract.", "We added Interior\u2019s management of federal oil and gas resources to our  High-Risk List in February 2011 based on challenges we identified with  several aspects of Interior\u2019s oversight responsibilities, including that  Interior lacked reasonable assurance it was collecting a fair return in  revenue from oil and gas produced on federal lands and waters. In a  December 2013 report, we found that Interior had taken some steps to  better ensure a fair return but did not have documented procedures for  periodically conducting assessments of the offshore fiscal system\u2014the  terms and conditions under which the federal government collects  revenues from oil and gas development\u2014including for determining  whether and how to change new offshore lease terms. Among other  things, we recommended that Interior establish documented procedures  for determining whether and how to adjust lease terms for new offshore  leases, and BOEM developed such procedures in 2015.

To identify existing studies from peer- reviewed journals, we conducted database searches. We reviewed and  assessed factors affecting bidding activity from the nine studies published  between 2010 and 2017 that we identified through our literature search.  We also analyzed BOEM data on lease sales from May 1983 (when  BOEM started using competitive bids to award leases) through March  2018, the most recent data available for our analysis. Using these data,  we developed an econometric model to analyze the effect of royalty rates  and other key variables, such as the price of oil, on bonus bids for  offshore leases between 1985 and 2018 (we did not include data from the  first two years of competitive bidding because both BOEM and companies  in the offshore oil and gas industry were adjusting to the new bidding  system). Specifically, we analyzed how changes in royalty rates affected  the winning bids for offshore leases. (See appendix I for additional  information on our econometric model.) To assess the reliability of  BOEM\u2019s lease sale data, we interviewed knowledgeable bureau officials,  reviewed documentation describing the data set, and electronically tested  the data to identify obvious errors with completeness or accuracy. We  found these data sufficiently reliable for assessing the factors that have  affected industry bidding activity. In addition, we used existing data  analysis from Interior to ascertain the effect of royalty relief on offshore oil  and gas revenues. We also interviewed BOEM officials, representatives  from a key industry organization, representatives from two private oil and  gas companies that agreed to be interviewed, and five academic  researchers to obtain their perspectives on the effect of royalty rate  changes on bonus bids. We identified these academic researchers based  on the results of our literature review and selected them because of their  relevant and recent work on this topic.

Specifically, our econometric model suggests a strong positive  correspondence between higher oil prices and higher bonus bids; that is,  when oil prices are higher, bonus bids tend be higher and, conversely,  when oil prices are lower, bonus bids tend to be lower. For example,  from 2006 through 2008, oil prices rapidly rose to historic highs. This  period corresponded with an increase in average bonus bids in deep  water from an average of about $275 per acre in 2006 to an average of  about $800 per acre in 2008. Figure 3 shows the relationship between oil  prices and per acre average bonus bids.", "The results of our analysis are consistent with input from BOEM officials  and industry representatives who told us that the price of oil is a key  factor in industry bidding decisions. Specifically, these officials and  representatives explained that they use the current price of oil as a  baseline for expectations regarding future prices of oil\u2014that is, the price  at which industry can sell the oil it produces. Therefore, high current oil  prices lead to higher projections of future oil prices, thereby driving up  bids. Likewise, they told us that industry bidding activity increases in high- price environments because production from existing wells provides  financial resources companies can use to invest in acquiring additional  leases. Moreover, according to these officials and representatives, higher  oil prices make some tracts economically viable to develop that had been  viewed as unprofitable at lower prices.", "According to our analysis of BOEM data, changes in federal royalty rates  also drive changes in the amount industry bids on offshore leases. Our  econometric model indicates that increases in royalty rates lead to  decreased bonus bids and, conversely, decreases in royalty rates lead to  increased bonus bids. According to our model, during the royalty relief  period from 1996 through 2000, when royalty rates were effectively  zero, bonus bids increased between 34 percent and 60 percent over  what bonus bids would have been expected to be had the royalty rate  remained at the pre-1996 rate of 12.5 percent. Specifically, we found that  industry bid approximately 34 percent higher for leases sold in 1996,  1997, and 2000, when leases contained no royalty obligation until oil  prices rose above a certain threshold. Similarly, industry bid  approximately 60 percent higher for leases sold in 1998 and 1999, when  leases carried no royalties for the life of the lease. However, changes in  oil prices can work to counter the effect of royalty rate changes on bonus  bids. For example, between 2006 and 2008, royalty rates in water depths  greater than 400 meters increased from 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent.  Based on our model, this royalty rate increase would have a significant  downward effect on bonus bids. However, the rapid increase in oil  prices during this period resulted in the net effect of an increase in bonus  bids for these tracts by more than 150 percent.", "Our findings are consistent with the views of BOEM officials and industry  representatives, who told us that lower royalty rates increase industry  bidding because lower royalties result in higher industry tract valuations.  Specifically, the smaller financial commitments to the government  associated with lower royalty rates increases the projected value of any  oil or gas produced. BOEM officials and industry representatives told us  that, in turn, the increased projected value of these tracts would lead to  increases in the dollar value of individual bids as well as the number of  bids submitted. For example, they cited the royalty relief period of 1996  through 2000 as responsible for a significant increase in bidding activity  during that time.", "However, while decreases in royalty rates lead to higher bonus bids, they  may still lead to lower overall federal offshore oil and gas revenues.  Specifically, our model estimates and BOEM data show that eliminating  royalties for tracts leased between 1996 and 2000 would have increased  overall bonus bids for those tracts by at most about $1.98 billion over  what they would have been had royalty rates remained at their pre-1996  rate of 12.5 percent. However, forgone royalty revenue was more than  nine times greater. Specifically, Interior data show approximately $18.0  billion in forgone royalty payments on these leases through the end of  2018.

BOEM evaluated the effect of lowering the royalty rate  to 12.5 percent for two scenarios: (1) tracts with water depths  between 200 and 400 meters and (2) all tracts. BOEM recommended  leaving the royalty rate at 18.75 percent for all tracts deeper than 200  meters. In doing so, the bureau cited little effect for lowering the rate  for tracts with water depths between 200 to 400 meters\u2014it projected  less than a 0.1 percent increase in production and less than 0.1  percent decrease in revenue. BOEM also cited more substantial  projected drops in overall revenue of 17 to 19 percent, paired with  modest increases in production (1 to 2 percent increase in oil  production and 2 to 5 percent increase in gas production) for lowering  the royalty rate for all tracts. BOEM also found that these losses to  the federal government could be even more substantial if oil prices  rise in the future.", "BOEM officials told us that, in general, they prefer to make minor iterative  changes to fiscal terms in order to better gauge their effects\u2014that is, they  find it easier to measure the effects of a change to one term at a time rather than the effects of reconfiguring multiple terms\u2014as well as provide  predictability for industry. In keeping with this approach, BOEM has made  one change to its royalty rate since 2012 (see table 1 for details on the  recent history of lease terms in the Gulf of Mexico). Specifically, in  advance of its August 2017 lease sale, BOEM announced a reduction in  royalty rate for tracts with water depths of less than 200 meters from  18.75 percent to the statutory minimum of 12.5 percent. According to  BOEM documentation, the driving factor for this decision was that shallow  water in the Gulf of Mexico has been largely explored, leaving generally  marginal tracts that either are largely depleted of resources or more gas  prone. In turn, the goal in reducing the royalty rate was to incentivize  additional industry interest in these more marginal shallow water tracts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BOEM Has Made Little Headway in Developing a Progressive Royalty System", "paragraphs": ["BOEM has publicized the development of a progressive royalty system  since 2013 but has made little demonstrable headway toward developing  such a system.

Among these proposed reforms was a price-based tiered  royalty rate to replace the fixed royalty rate structure that BOEM has used  since 1983. Under a price-based royalty system, the royalty rate would  depend on prevailing commodity prices, with lower prices having lower  royalty rates. According to BOEM documents, the current flat-rate royalty  system is regressive\u2014that is, a fixed rate that does not adapt to market  conditions or the relative success of a lease\u2014but a price-based royalty  would share more revenue risk with the lessee and reduce the regressive  nature of the system. A more progressive system would provide an  increased incentive to lessees to develop resources during times of low  oil and gas prices through lower royalty rates, while also ensuring that the  federal government receives a greater return for offshore resources when  prices are high. BOEM officials we interviewed told us that this type of  adaptive system could be more efficient and provide higher returns  relative to the existing fixed-rate system.

We reported  in September 2008 that the regressive nature of the offshore fiscal  system, among other factors, caused it to be unstable over time and  added risk to oil and gas investments that may reduce the total amount  industry is willing to pay for the rights to explore and develop federal  leases. BOEM officials told us such a system that automatically adjusts  could reduce the need for frequent revisiting and continual annual and  lease sale-specific evaluations because it would automatically adapt to  certain market conditions. According to these officials, a stable, long-lived  system would also reduce political pressure to restructure it or rely on  legislation\u2014such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act\u2014in the future.", "Additionally, long-term stability in the royalty system could benefit  industry, according to a 2007 study.

As discussed previously, BOEM\u2019s acceptable bid threshold is  generally determined by the lesser of BOEM\u2019s present valuation and its  delayed valuation. For the 1,412 tracts with a positive present valuation  assessed from March 2000 through June 2018, BOEM forecast a median  loss in value on these tracts would be about 23 percent (about $494,000)  by the time of the next sale opportunity for those tracts.", "BOEM officials told us that expected lower future values are generally  due to discounting the eventual collection of revenue. Specifically, BOEM  officials explained that the bureau\u2019s model considers the delayed  collection of revenue\u2014bonus bids and royalties\u2014when developing its  delayed values. However, because tracts that received a rejected bid  would be available for sale during the next year\u2014or, more recently, 6  months on average\u2014the period of discounting is very short. Discounting  seems an unreasonable explanation of BOEM\u2019s forecasted depreciation  rates for two additional reasons. First, BOEM\u2019s forecasted depreciation  rates do not align with industry bidding patterns for tracts that were leased  more than once\u2014where the lease for a tract either expired or the  leaseholder relinquished it and the tract was therefore available at a  subsequent lease sale. Specifically, for the 61 tracts that were leased  more than once from March 2000 through June 2018, bids actually  increased slightly over time (bids increased at a real average annual rate  of 0.2 percent, or about $6,700). Second, since oil prices are generally  forecast to rise, the underlying oil and gas resource values would be  expected to increase over time rather than decrease, suggesting a  smaller difference between present and delayed values should be  observed than is reflected in BOEM\u2019s tract valuations.", "Additionally, BOEM\u2019s forecasted depreciation has increased even though  tracts are now available twice as frequently. Until August 2017, BOEM  held annual lease sales for each of two lease areas so that tracts were  available once per year. On average during this time, BOEM forecast that  the median loss in value for tracts with positive present valuations would  be approximately 23 percent (about $481,000) of their value in the year  between lease sales (see table 3). BOEM has since made tracts available  twice per year. Having less time between lease sales should decrease  the amount of forecasted depreciation, as there is less time for  discounting. Yet the average difference between present and delayed  value increased for biannual lease sales to about 27 percent (or about  $1.03 million per tract) for tracts with a positive present valuation.  BOEM\u2019s depreciation for biannual lease sales is equivalent to an annual  rate of approximately 47 percent (or about $1.78 million annually per  tract), which is nearly seven times the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s annual recommended discount rate of 7 percent. That BOEM\u2019s  forecasted depreciation has increased since moving to biannual lease  sales is also at odds with the concept of how discounting should affect  tract valuations, as shorter periods of time are generally associated with  lower depreciation than longer periods of time.", "Under federal standards for internal control, management should use  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objective. Yet, according to  our analysis of BOEM data, the bureau\u2019s unreasonably large forecasts of  depreciation have increasingly been the deciding factor in decisions to  accept bids. Cumulatively, BOEM\u2019s high forecasted level of depreciation  resulted in the bureau accepting 205 bids for about $672 million that it  would have rejected if its present valuations had been used as the  acceptable bid threshold. Based on the return BOEM has realized on  rejected bids, had BOEM rejected these 205 bids, it might have  subsequently collected more than $873 million in additional bid revenue  for these tracts, which would represent an increase in overall bid revenue  of about 6.8 percent for tracts BOEM determined to be viable.", "BOEM officials told us that they were unaware that their model forecasts  such high rates of depreciation and that the issue warrants further  examination.

As BOEM developed and has used  its delayed valuations for at least 20 years, outside perspectives and  expertise could be beneficial. Enlisting an independent third party to  examine the extent to which the bureau\u2019s use of delayed valuations  assures receipt of fair market value, and making changes\u2014such as  terminating the use of delayed valuations as acceptable bid threshold  criteria or amending its model\u2019s assumptions to develop more justifiable  depreciation rates\u2014as appropriate, would help BOEM mitigate risks of  continuing to accept bids based on poor information on tracts\u2019 future  values."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOEM Further Lowered Many Valuations to Justify Bid Acceptance", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of BOEM data as well as BOEM testimony indicate that the  bureau changed its forecasting parameters, thereby lowering many  valuations and acceptable bid thresholds\u2014which were already  systematically low due to its conservative forecasting and excessive  depreciation\u2014in order to justify accepting bids.

In contrast,  BOEM valued tracts at slightly less than the industry high bid (that is,  instances in which the high bid is between 100 and 125 percent of  BOEM\u2019s valuation) about 10 percent of the time (117 of the 1,198 bids  subjected to valuation for which the acceptable bid threshold was above  the minimum bid level). This anomalous absence of any instances in  which BOEM valued tracts slightly more than industry is consistent with  BOEM officials\u2019 statements that the bureau further lowered its initial  valuations when these valuations were only slightly higher than bids.", "BOEM officials suggested that any pattern of adjusting valuations would  be limited to lower-value bids whereby smaller dollar-value changes  would represent greater percentage changes. However, the data do not  support this, as we found that BOEM\u2019s bias toward lowering valuations  does not appear to be limited to those slightly above industry\u2019s high bid,  but is nearly systematic for valuations up to double industry\u2019s high bid  across all bid levels. Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of BOEM\u2019s  valuations compared with industry\u2019s high bids, with green data points  reflecting accepted bids and blue data points reflecting rejected bids.

Within this range, BOEM\u2019s  tendency to lower bid valuations to justify acceptance is clear due to the  relative abundance of acceptances (359) and the relative scarcity of  rejections (27)\u2014a pattern of more than 13 acceptances for every rejection  that is anomalous within the data. This disparity would be even greater if  we had included in our analysis the 802 bids BOEM accepted because its  valuations were below the minimum bid level which is then used as the  acceptable bid threshold.", "BOEM officials told us that they occasionally change valuations to  address the uncertainty inherent in the factors that comprise BOEM\u2019s  tract valuation process, though doing so in order to justify bid acceptance  is inconsistent with BOEM\u2019s fair market value procedures. Specifically,  officials told us that the point valuation developed by its discounted cash  flow model is not representative of the broadness of the distribution of  potential values\u2014though it does represent the average of the distribution.  Additionally, these officials told us that the process is iterative\u2014the  bureau adjusts its forecasts multiple times before deciding on final  valuations. Furthermore, officials said that valuations that are above, but  near, the high bids are subject to more iterations. Moreover, BOEM  officials told us that all forecasting parameters and valuations, including  those that are revisited more frequently, are evaluated and approved  through its Fair Market Value Review Committee, which is broadly  responsible for ensuring consistency in the application of the bureau\u2019s  tract valuation process. Adjusting valuations comports with what BOEM  officials told us is their conservative approach and promotes accepting  bids unless the bureau has a high level of certainty that the tract is worth  more than the high bid. However, BOEM officials told us they were not  aware that their adjustments had effectively reduced the acceptable bid  thresholds of nearly all valuations that were initially up to double  industry\u2019s high bid.", "Given that BOEM already starts with a conservative approach to  valuation, which is compounded by its model generally forecasting high  levels of depreciation, this practice of introducing more conservative  assumptions in cases when initial valuations are above bids is not  consistent with the bureau\u2019s fair market value procedures prescribed in  federal regulations, BOEM\u2019s Bureau Manual for ensuring fair market  value, and in BOEM\u2019s bid adequacy procedures. These procedures call  for BOEM to use the outputs of its discounted cash flow model as the  thresholds for determining whether to accept bids. In situations where  BOEM determines that its valuation results are not consistent with  programmatic goals, BOEM\u2019s procedures allow for the bureau to develop  alternative bid evaluation protocols for a given lease sale, but BOEM has  not done so. BOEM\u2019s procedures do not explicitly allow for valuations to  be adjusted based on how close they are to industry bids, nor is there an  allowance for adjusting valuations in an ad hoc fashion for uncertainty.  The practice of adjusting valuations this way undermines receipt of fair  market value by holding industry to a lower and potentially inconsistent  standard for purchasing leasing rights than those outlined in BOEM\u2019s  valuation procedures.", "The practice of lowering valuations also results in the potential loss of  hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. We do not know how many  accepted bids would have been rejected based on their initial valuations  because BOEM\u2019s data do not indicate which valuations were further  lowered. However, if BOEM had rejected 26 percent of the bids that were  up to double its valuations\u2014which appears reasonable to interpolate  based on the distribution of the other bid-to-valuation relationships\u2014the  bureau potentially could have subsequently collected approximately $567  million additional dollars in bid revenue for tracts it determined to be  viable (an increase of about 3.9 percent).

BOEM\u2019s ability to measure the  accuracy of its tract valuation process\u2014both its forecasting and the  performance of its model\u2014is hindered because some of its data do  not reflect the bureau\u2019s initial valuations but rather the adjusted  valuations it used to justify bid acceptance. Specifically, BOEM is  unable to observe the effect on revenues and sales bids when its  initial valuations\u2014which were already low due to conservative  forecasting and generally high depreciation\u2014indicated that bids  should be rejected when bids are only slightly less than BOEM\u2019s  valuation.

We found that BOEM does  so by using a conservative approach to estimating tract values,  forecasting unreasonably high levels of depreciation in its delayed  valuations, and further lowering valuations in order to justify accepting  bids it otherwise would have rejected. Enlisting an independent third party  to examine the tradeoffs and benefits of the bureau\u2019s continued use of  delayed valuations, and making changes\u2014such as terminating the use of  delayed valuations as acceptable bid threshold criteria or amending its  model\u2019s assumptions to develop more justifiable depreciation rates\u2014as  appropriate, would help BOEM mitigate risks of continuing to accept bids  based on poor information on tracts\u2019 future values. Furthermore, BOEM  generally lowers its valuations and thereby accepts bids as long as the  bid is at least half of BOEM\u2019s initial valuation, which is inconsistent with  bureau procedures for ensuring receipt of fair market value. Without  taking steps to ensure that BOEM\u2019s bid valuation process is not biased  toward adjusting valuations downward based on their proximity to bids,  the bureau risks continuing to undermine the receipt of fair market value  for the sale of public resources. Cumulatively, we calculate that taking  these steps could result in BOEM collecting approximately 10.7 percent  more in bid revenue for offshore tracts it determines to be economically  viable, which would reflect hundreds of millions of dollars in additional bid  revenue over the next decade.", "BOEM\u2019s ability to assure receipt of fair market value is further hindered  because it does not systematically assess its own performance and take  steps to improve it. For example, BOEM does not (1) assess how its  forecasts of key factors (e.g., reserves discovered, likelihood of success,  and oil prices) compared to actual results, (2) assess the assumptions  and accuracy of its discounted cash flow model results, such as how well  the model accounts for depreciation, and (3) collect information about  deviations between BOEM\u2019s initial and final valuations that could provide  management insights into the frequency and implication of lowering  valuations. Without implementing a systematic process for  comprehensively evaluating its tract valuations, such as by expanding the  scope of the bureau\u2019s lookback studies effort and remediating any  identified deficiencies, the bureau does not have reasonable assurance  that its tract valuation process is working as intended, and that  opportunities to refine or improve the bureau\u2019s valuation process are  identified and pursued to better assure the receipt of fair market value for  the federal government for offshore oil and gas leases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations to BOEM:  The BOEM director should develop a documented plan for determining  whether and how to develop a progressive royalty structure that clearly  defines what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be  achieved, and the time frames for achievement.

Interior also stated that it is concerned that certain  aspects of the draft report do not paint a representative picture of BOEM\u2019s  valuation process and efforts to ensure receipt of fair market value.", "Regarding the recommendation that BOEM should develop a  documented plan for determining whether and how to develop a  progressive royalty structure, the agency agreed and indicated that  BOEM will develop such a plan. Specifically, the agency stated that  BOEM would develop a plan to identify the theoretical and practical  benefits and drawbacks of a progressive royalty structure based on  existing research and prepare materials for management to determine  whether implementation of a price-based royalty would be beneficial.", "Regarding the recommendation that BOEM enlist an independent  third party to examine the extent to which the bureau\u2019s use of delayed  valuations assures the receipt of fair market value, the agency  disagreed. The agency stated it did not agree with our  characterization of BOEM\u2019s delayed valuations and stated that BOEM  believes it is neither necessary nor cost effective to enlist an  independent third party.  However, BOEM agreed to (1) examine its  delayed value calculation, particularly as it relates to the impact of  biannual lease sales, (2) develop a plan to perform a comprehensive  internal review of delayed value calculations and make appropriate  changes, and (3) institute a peer-review process for all potential  changes. These actions may address some of the deficiencies we  identified, but our concerns regarding BOEM\u2019s use of delayed  valuations are not limited to the move to biannual lease sales and the  agency has not provided any reasonable explanations for its high  levels of forecasted depreciation. BOEM forecast a median  depreciation of about 23 percent. This implies we should observe  significant declines in the actual value of tracts over long periods of  time, which is impossible to reconcile with actual trends in bonus bids.  The real average bonus bid per acre in 2018 was about the same as it  was thirty years earlier in 1988. Alternatively, such a high forecast of  depreciation implies either a long time frame between lease sales or a  high discount rate. But the time between lease sales has been one  year or 6 months, on average, and in our view, and the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s annual recommended discount rate of 7  percent would be more appropriate. Recognizing that Interior\u2019s view  differs from ours in this regard, we continue to believe that enlisting an  independent third party to examine all aspects of the bureau\u2019s use of  delayed valuations\u2014not just proposed changes to address the move  to biannual lease sales\u2014would better assure the receipt of fair market  value.", "Regarding the recommendation that BOEM take steps to ensure that  its bid valuation process is not biased toward adjusting valuations  downward based on their proximity to bids, Interior partially agreed.  Specifically, Interior stated it agreed with the recommendation, but did  not agree with our characterization of BOEM\u2019s bid valuation process.  Interior stated that the apparent anomaly\u2014the lack of instances when  BOEM valued tracts up to double industry\u2019s bid\u2014is skewed because a  very large percentage of the data set comprise relatively low bids, and  BOEM-generated valuations relative to the bids are constrained by  the minimum bid amount. That is, Interior stated that the minimum bid  level created an artificial floor for BOEM\u2019s acceptable bid threshold  even in instances in which BOEM\u2019s valuation is substantially lower,  resulting in more bids being up to double BOEM\u2019s valuation than  would be the case if BOEM\u2019s acceptable bid thresholds were not  constrained by the minimum bid amount. However, as discussed  above, we removed all valuations for which BOEM used the minimum  bid level as its acceptable bid threshold from our analysis (that is, we  did not include instances when BOEM\u2019s actual valuation was below  the minimum bid level). Had we included these valuations, the  asymmetry in the relationship between bids representing 100 to 200  percent of BOEM\u2019s acceptable bid threshold (acceptances) and  BOEM\u2019s acceptable bid threshold representing 100 to 200 percent of  industry\u2019s bid (rejections) would have nearly doubled (see figure 6).  Moreover, even though we did not include these instances, the  minimum bid level only affects the distribution of instances when  BOEM\u2019s valuation was less than industry\u2019s high bid. As such, it does  not explain why there are so few instances when BOEM valued tracts  slightly more than industry. We continue to believe that taking steps to  ensure that its bid valuation process is not biased toward adjusting  valuations downward based on their proximity to bids would be  beneficial and will monitor BOEM\u2019s efforts as part of our regular  recommendation follow-up.", "Regarding the recommendation that BOEM implement a systematic  process for comprehensively evaluating its tract valuations, such as  by expanding the scope of the bureau\u2019s lookback studies effort, and  remediating any identified deficiencies, Interior partially agreed.  Specifically, Interior stated it agreed with the recommendation, but did  not agree with our characterization of BOEM\u2019s bid tract evaluation  process and review procedures. The agency identified two areas  where they did not agree with our characterization.  First, the agency  stated that our statement that \u201cresource discoveries are not updated\u201d  is inaccurate. According to its comments, BOEM develops  independent estimates of recoverable oil and gas contained within  discovered fields by conducting field reserve studies. However, any  updated estimates are not reflected in the lookback studies, which  represent BOEM\u2019s formal mechanism for self-evaluation. For the  lookback studies, as noted above, BOEM compares their forecast  against the results of only the first exploratory well and does not  update its studies with the results of further exploration. Second, the  agency stated that we were incorrect to state that BOEM does not use  the studies to improve processes because it uses its lookback studies  to improve its valuations. However, BOEM did not provide  documentation to support this claim. We continue to believe that  implementing a systematic process for comprehensively evaluating its  tract valuations would be beneficial and will monitor BOEM\u2019s efforts as  part of our regular recommendation follow-up.", "In addition, Interior stated in its letter that it appeared that we did not  account for industry assumptions regarding the applicability of price  thresholds in comparing estimated increased bonus bid revenue and  forgone royalties for leases subject to deep water royalty relief sold from  1996 through 2000. However, as stated above, we based our  econometric modeling on the lease terms provided in Interior\u2019s final notice  of sale documents for those leases, which reflect the expectations for  royalty relief that industry bid on at the time of sale. In addition, as  described in appendix I, we used several alternative model specifications  to test the sensitivity of our results to the possibility that industry had  different understandings of royalty relief than those contained in the sale  documents. Our results are robust across these alternative specifications.", "As noted above, leases sold in 1996, 1997, and 2000 included provisions  for royalty relief subject to price thresholds (that is, lease terms indicated  that royalties would only be owed if the price of oil exceeded certain  thresholds). Leases sold in 1998 and 1999 did not contain price  thresholds (that is, lease terms indicated that no royalties would be owed  regardless of the price of oil). As evidenced by our econometric modeling  results, during the 1996 through 2000 period, we observed higher bidding  when no price threshold provisions were included in lease terms,  suggesting that industry accounted for the expectation of no royalties  when developing bids.", "As noted above, in 2007, a federal court ruled that Interior\u2019s attempt to  collect royalties through the application of price thresholds on production  under leases subject to the 1996 through 2000 royalty suspension was  unlawful. In its comments, Interior stated that industry bidding would have  been different had companies known at the time of sale that the price  thresholds would not apply, and as a result, the net amount of forgone  revenue\u2014the difference between collected bonus bids and forgone  royalties\u2014would have been lower. To account for this, we adjusted our  calculation of estimated additional bonus bid revenues so that it is more  comparable to BOEM estimated foregone revenues. This adjustment  increased our estimate of additional bonus bid revenues to $1.98 billion  (an increase of approximately $530 million), which is still subsumed by  the $18 billion in foregone royalties collected through the end of 2018.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
