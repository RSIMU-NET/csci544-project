This report examines (1) how businesses are certified as eligible for the WOSB program, (2) SBA's oversight of certifications, and (3) the effect the program has had on federal contracting opportunities available to WOSBs or EDWOSBs. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and program documents; analyzed federal contracting data from April 2011 through May 2014; and interviewed SBA, officials from contracting agencies selected to obtain a range of experience with the WOSB program, third-party certifiers, WOSBs, and organizations that represent their interests."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Businesses have two options to certify their eligibility for the women-owned small business (WOSB) program. Whether self-certifying at no cost or using the fee-based services of an approved third-party certifier, businesses must attest that they are a WOSB or an economically disadvantaged WOSB (EDWOSB). Businesses also must submit documents supporting their attestation to a repository the Small Business Administration (SBA) maintains (required documents vary depending on certification type), and, if they obtain a third-party certification, to the certifier.", "SBA performs minimal oversight of third-party certifiers and has yet to develop procedures that provide reasonable assurance that only eligible businesses obtain WOSB set-aside contracts. For example,", "SBA generally has not reviewed certifier performance or developed or implemented procedures for such reviews, including determining whether certifiers inform businesses of the no-cost self-certification option, a requirement in the agency's agreement with certifiers.", "SBA also has not completed or implemented procedures to review the monthly reports that third-party certifiers must submit.", "Without ongoing monitoring and oversight of the activities and performance of third-party certifiers, SBA cannot reasonably assure that certifiers fulfill the requirements of the agreement. Moreover, in 2012 and 2013, SBA found that more than 40 percent of businesses (that previously received contracts) it examined for program eligibility should not have attested they were WOSBs or EDWOSBs at the time of SBA's review. SBA officials speculated about possible reasons for the results, including businesses not providing adequate documentation or becoming ineligible after contracts were awarded, but SBA has not assessed the results of the examinations to determine the actual reasons for the high numbers of businesses found ineligible. SBA also has not completed or implemented procedures to conduct eligibility examinations. According to federal standards for internal control, agencies should have documented procedures, conduct monitoring, and ensure that any review findings and deficiencies are resolved promptly. As a result of inadequate monitoring and controls, potentially ineligible businesses may continue to incorrectly certify themselves as WOSBs, increasing the risk that they may receive contracts for which they are not eligible.", "The WOSB program has had a limited effect on federal contracting opportunities available to WOSBs. Set-aside contracts under the program represent less than 1 percent of all federal contract obligations to women-owned small businesses. The Departments of Defense and Homeland Security and the General Services Administration collectively accounted for the majority of the $228.9 million in set-aside obligations awarded under the program between April 2011 and May 2014. Contracting officers, business owners, and industry advocates with whom GAO spoke identified challenges to program use and suggested potential changes that might increase program use, including allowing sole-source contracts rather than requiring at least two businesses to compete and expanding the list of 330 industries in which WOSBs and EDWOSBs were eligible for a set-aside."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SBA, among other things, establish and implement procedures to monitor certifiers and improve annual eligibility examinations, including by analyzing examination results.

According to the most recent Census Survey of Business Owners, 28.7  percent, or 7.8 million, of all U.S. businesses in 2007 were women- owned. Between 1997 and 2007, the number of women-owned  businesses grew by 44 percent (or twice as fast as businesses owned by  men) adding roughly 500,000 jobs nationwide, according to the U.S.  Department of Commerce. However, the federal government has yet to  meet its annual goal of awarding 5 percent of its procurement to women- owned small businesses (WOSB).", "Over the years, Congress has taken a number of actions to increase  opportunities for small business (including minority-owned and  economically disadvantaged) participation in federal contracting. In 1978,  Congress amended the Small Business Act to require federal agencies to  negotiate with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish prime  and subcontracting goals for certain businesses, which did not specifically  include WOSBs until 1994. In 2000, Congress authorized a contracting  program to reserve contracts for WOSBs in industries where the  businesses were historically underrepresented. Its purpose is to enable  federal contracting officers to identify and establish a sheltered market, or  set-aside, for competition among only WOSBs or economically  disadvantaged WOSBs (EDWOSB) to provide goods and services  through contracts in designated industries. On October 7, 2010, SBA  issued a final rule to implement the WOSB Federal Contract Program and  the program started operating in 2011. To establish WOSB program set- asides, SBA conducted studies to identify industries in which WOSBs  were underrepresented and substantially underrepresented and  published a list of specific industries in which these businesses needed  greater access to federal contracts. EDWOSBs may receive contracts in  any industry SBA identified as eligible for the program, and WOSBs may  receive contracts in industries in which SBA deemed WOSBs to be  substantially underrepresented. According to SBA officials, program staff  have been planning a new study of underrepresented EDWOSBs and  substantially underrepresented WOSBs, which the agency expects to  complete by 2015.", "You asked us to examine the WOSB program, including any effects it has  had on increasing contracting opportunities for WOSBs. This report (1)  describes how WOSBs and EDWOSBs are certified as eligible for the  program; (2) examines the extent to which SBA has implemented internal  control and oversight procedures of WOSB program certifications; and (3)  discusses the effect the program has had on federal contracting  opportunities available to WOSBs or EDWOSBs.", "To describe how businesses are certified as eligible for the WOSB  program, we reviewed SBA\u2019s policies and procedures to establish  program eligibility, including the responsibilities of businesses, third-party  certifiers, contracting officers, and SBA. To evaluate how certification  procedures may affect program participation, we obtained data from SBA  and the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG)  to determine the number of WOSBs that used third-party certifiers from  August 2011 through May 2014. Using electronic edit checks and a  review of data system documentation, we deemed these data sufficiently  reliable for this purpose. We interviewed SBA officials, contracting  officials at the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security  (DHS), and the General Services Administration (GSA); and interviewed  selected WOSBs for perspectives on the program. The agencies were  selected to reflect varying levels of program participation (based on  contracts issued and program obligations from 2011 through 2013). To  evaluate SBA\u2019s internal controls and oversight of certification methods,  we reviewed the program regulation and program documents,  agreements with third-party certifiers, and monthly reports submitted by  third-party certifiers to SBA, among other documents. We interviewed  three of the four certifiers: El Paso Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the  National Women Business Owners Corporation, and the U.S. Women\u2019s  Chamber of Commerce. We were not able to interview the fourth certifier,  the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC). To  evaluate the effect the program has had on federal contracting  opportunities for WOSBs, we analyzed FPDS-NG data from April 2011  through May 2014 and identified trends in program participation by  agencies. Finally, we interviewed SBA officials and contracting agency  officials about the extent to which the program has met its regulatory  purpose of increasing contracting opportunities for WOSBs.

Additionally, only  certain businesses are eligible to participate in the WOSB program. The  business must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or  more women.

Both certification processes require signed representations by  businesses about their WOSB or EDWOSB eligibility. For this reason,  SBA has described all participants in the program as self-certified. When  using the self-certification option, businesses must provide documents  supporting their status to the online document repository for the WOSB  program that SBA maintains. Required submissions include copies of  citizenship papers (birth or naturalization certificates or passports) and,  depending on business type, items including copies of partnership  agreements or articles of incorporation. Businesses must submit a signed  certification on which the owners attest that the documents and  information provided are true and accurate. Moreover, businesses must  register and attest to being a WOSB in the System for Award  Management (SAM), the primary database of vendors doing business  with the federal government. Businesses also must make  representations about their status in SAM before submitting an offer on a  WOSB or EDWOSB solicitation.", "For third-party certification, businesses submit documentation to  approved certifiers. According to third-party certifiers we interviewed, they  review documents (and some may conduct site visits to businesses) and  make determinations of eligibility. If approved, businesses will receive a  document showing receipt of third-party certification. Business then can  upload the certificate to the WOSB program repository along with  documents supporting their EDWOSB or WOSB status. SBA does not  track the number of businesses that self certify and could not provide  information on how many self-certified businesses obtained contracts  under the WOSB program. While SBA can look at an individual business  profile\u2014which lists the documents the business has uploaded to support  its eligibility\u2014in the repository to determine if a certificate from a third- party certifier is present, it has no corresponding mechanism to determine  if a business lacking such a certificate was self-certified. That is, there  are no data fields for certification type in any of the systems used in the  program and SBA cannot generate reports to isolate information on  certification type by business. According to SBA officials, such information  on certification type is not needed because both certification options are  treated equally under the program and, because all businesses make an  attestation of status as a WOSB whether or not the business uses a third- party certifier. Therefore, SBA considers this a self-certification program.", "Contracting officers obtain a solicitation and conduct market research to  identify businesses potentially capable of filling contract requirements.  Once a contracting officer has determined that a solicitation can be set  aside under the WOSB program, the officer obtains bids and selects an  awardee for the contract. Only after selecting an awardee, does the  agency obtain access to the business\u2019s profile in the WOSB program  repository, which lists the documents the business has uploaded to  support its eligibility (the business must grant the contracting agency  access). SBA\u2019s Contracting Officer\u2019s Guide to the WOSB Program states  that contracting officers must determine that specified documents have  been uploaded by the business to the program repository, but the guide  does not require contracting officers to assess the validity of those  documents. Only after viewing the uploaded documents would the  contracting officer be able to determine if the business was likely self- certified or had a certificate from a third-party certifier. Two groups we  interviewed that represent the interests of WOSBs said that contracting  officers prefer third-party over self-certified businesses when selecting an  awardee. A representative of one organization thought that contracting  officers tended to select businesses with third-party certifications because  they did not have to review as many documents in the program repository  as for self-certified businesses. However, the certification method does  not appear to influence contract awards.

Certifiers, a WOSB  advocacy group, and WOSBs had perspectives on fees for third-party  certification. Representatives of all three certifiers with whom we spoke  stated that fees their organization charged for certifications were  reasonable and affordable for a small business. Staff from one WOSB  advocacy organization told us that such fees could deter some  businesses from participating in the program, but owners of WOSBs with  which we spoke generally did not concur with this view. Certifiers with  whom we spoke told us that they inform businesses about their option to  self certify, but SBA does not have a method in place to help ensure that  certifiers are providing this information to businesses and agency officials  told us that they do not monitor whether certifiers fulfilled the requirement.  SBA officials said that they believe that the no-cost option ameliorates the  risk of excessive fees charged to businesses or the risk that fees would  deter program participation and that because all certifiers must provide  national coverage, businesses can seek lower fees. Officials also told us  that they believed that businesses and advocacy groups would inform the  agency if certifiers were not providing this information.

Thus, businesses may not know of this  requirement without being informed by the certifier or know to inform SBA  if the certifier had not fulfilled the requirement.", "The largest certifier, WBENC, has delegated the majority of certification  activity to other entities that SBA also has not reviewed. WBENC has  conducted about 76 percent of third-party certifications through May  2014. However, WBENC delegates WOSB certification responsibilities to  14 regional partner organizations. SBA neither maintains nor reviews  information about standards and procedures at WBENC, including a  compliance review process for each of its 14 partner organizations that  WBENC told SBA it uses. SBA officials told us that they rely on  information available on public websites to determine the fee structures  set by WBENC\u2019s partner organizations. SBA also does not have copies of  compliance reviews that WBENC told SBA it annually conducts for each  partner organization. SBA requested documents from WBENC, which  included information about WBENC\u2019s oversight of its 14 partner  organizations. WBENC\u2019s response was incomplete; WBENC referenced  but did not provide its standards and procedures to oversee partner  organizations. SBA told us it recognized that WBENC\u2019s response was  incomplete, and indicated it had not followed up on WBENC\u2019s response.  Without this information SBA cannot determine how WBENC has been  overseeing the 14 entities to which it has delegated certification  responsibilities.", "Although SBA has not developed or conducted formal performance  reviews of certifiers, officials described activities they consider to be  certifier oversight. For example, when a business is denied third-party  certification but wishes to self-certify, it must subject itself to an eligibility  examination by SBA before doing so. In this case, or during a bid protest,  SBA conducts its own review of documentation the business submitted to  the certifier. SBA officials stated that these reviews were not intended as  a form of certifier oversight but described them as de facto reviews of  third-party certifier performance. However, such reviews do not involve a  comprehensive assessment of certifiers\u2019 activity or performance over  time. An SBA official acknowledged that the agency could do more to  oversee certifiers.

This certifier provided detailed  narrative information in its reports to SBA about its concerns. The  reporting format and level of detail reported also varied among certifiers.  One certifier listed detailed information on its activities in a spreadsheet.  Another described its activities using narrative text and an attached list of  applicants for certification. One certifier included dates for certification,  recertification, and the expiration of a certification, while other certifiers  did not include this information.", "According to SBA officials, the agency did not have consistent procedures  for reviewing monthly reports, including procedures to identify and resolve  discrepancies in reports or oversee how certifiers collect and compile  information transmitted to the agency. SBA officials said that one official,  who recently retired, was responsible for reviewing all certifier monthly  reports. Current officials and staff were not able to tell us what process  this official used to assess the reports.", "Finally, with one person responsible for reviewing monthly reports until  recently, SBA generally has not followed up on issues raised in reports.  Agency officials told us that early in the program they found problems with  the monthly report of one of the certifiers that indicated that the certifier  did not understand program requirements and they contacted the certifier  to address the issue. We found additional issues that would appear to  warrant follow up from SBA. For example, two businesses were denied  certification by one third-party certifier and approved shortly after by  another. SBA stated that it had not identified these potential  discrepancies but that it was possible for businesses to be deemed  ineligible, resolve the issue preventing certification, and become eligible  soon after. However, according to the program regulation, if a business  was denied third-party certification and the owner believed the business  eligible, the owner would have to request that SBA conduct an  examination to verify its eligibility to represent the business as a WOSB.

Although SBA officials did not know whether businesses  examined were eligible at the time of award, the high rate of ineligibility it  found raises questions about whether contracts may have been awarded  to ineligible businesses. According to SBA officials, information in its  repository constantly changes and SBA has yet to determine how or if a  business was eligible when it received a WOSB set-aside contract. SBA  officials told us that they believe they may be able to make such a  determination but could not describe exactly how they would conduct the  review or confirm that the business was an eligible WOSB or EDWOSB at  the time of award. As part of its annual examination, SBA only examines  businesses at some time after the business received a contract and,  therefore, SBA\u2019s examination is limited in its ability to identify potentially  ineligible businesses prior to a contract award.", "SBA officials said that after the annual examinations they did not institute  new controls to guard against ineligible businesses receiving program  contracts because they described the examinations and the results as a  method to gain insight about the program\u2014specifically, that WOSBs may  lack understanding of program eligibility requirements\u2014and not a basis  for change in oversight procedures. According to SBA officials, the levels  of ineligibility found during the examinations were similar to those found in  examinations of its other socioeconomic programs. SBA officials said  businesses were deemed ineligible because they did not understand the  documentation requirements for establishing eligibility and also attributed  the ineligibility of third-party certified businesses to improper uploading of  documents by the businesses themselves. SBA officials said they needed  to make additional efforts to train businesses to properly document their  eligibility. However, SBA officials could not explain how they had  determined lack of understanding was the cause of ineligibility among  businesses and have not made efforts to confirm that this was the cause.  As a result, they have missed opportunities to obtain meaningful insights  into the program.", "SBA regarded the bid protest as means of identifying ineligibility. SBA  officials referred to the program as a self-policing program, because of  the bid protest function through which competing businesses, contracting  officers, or SBA can protest a business\u2019s claim to be a WOSB or  EDWOSB and eligible for contract awards under the program. In addition,  an SBA official stated that business owners affirm their status when  awarded a contract and are subject to prosecution if they had done so  and later were found to have been ineligible at the time of contract  award\u2014which the official considered a program safeguard.", "However, without (1) developing program eligibility controls that include  procedures for conducting annual eligibility examinations; (2) analyzing  the results of the examinations to understand the underlying causes of  ineligibility; (3) developing new procedures for examinations, including  expanding the sample of businesses to be examined to include those that  did not receive contracts; and (4) investigating businesses based on  examination results, SBA may continue to find high rates of ineligibility  among businesses registered in the WOSB program repository. In turn,  this would continue to expose the program to the risk that ineligible  businesses may receive set-aside contracts. Also, by reviewing the  eligibility of businesses that have not received program contracts, SBA  may improve the quality of the pool of potential program award recipients."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Program Set-Asides Have Had Minimal Effect on WOSB Contracting", "paragraphs": ["Set-asides under the WOSB program to date have had a minimal effect  on overall contracting obligations to WOSBs and attainment of WOSB  contracting goals.

For example, if eligible, a WOSB could receive a contracting  award under the 8(a), HUBZone, or SDVOSBC programs, or through a  general small business set-aside. WOSBs also can obtain federal  contracts without set-asides (through open competition).", "Based on our analysis of FPDS-NG data of federal contracting agencies,  contract obligations awarded through the WOSB set-aside totaled $228.9  million, or 0.44 percent, of the $52.6 billion in contract obligations  awarded to WOSBs from April 2011 through May 2014.", "Additionally, the WOSB set-aside has had relatively little impact on  federal agency achievement of goals for contracting to WOSBs, because  the program set-asides represent a very small percentage of all  contracting awards to WOSBs.

Goal achievement by the three contracting agencies with  the highest amount of obligations through the set-aside program varied.  For example, DOD did not meet its 5 percent goal for contracting  obligations to WOSBs in any of the 3 years. DHS and GSA met their  goals in all 3 years. Excluding obligations made by DOD, about 5.7  percent of total federal contracting obligations to small businesses  included in SBA\u2019s fiscal year 2013 Small Business Goaling Report were  awarded to WOSBs.

Contracting officers  described challenges to using the WOSB set-aside. Some contracting  officers noted that generally, all contracts awarded to WOSBs count for  the purposes of meeting agencies\u2019 5 percent goal and that from their  perspective it does not matter whether a contract is awarded to a WOSB  using the WOSB program, another set-aside program, or open  competition. Some contracting officers said that WOSB program  requirements were burdensome or complex relative to other SBA  programs with set-asides. Unlike the other programs, the WOSB program  requires the use of a separate electronic repository, maintained by SBA,  to collect and store certification documents. One contracting officer noted  that the contracting process slowed when officials had to seek information  from the repository. Another contracting officer told us the role of the  contracting officer included confirming that businesses had uploaded  required documents in the SBA repository based on a list of required  documents in the program regulation\u2014but noted this task was not  required under other contracting programs.", "Lack of awareness and agency commitment. Representatives from  advocacy groups also identified awareness of and commitment to the  program as another area for improvement. An advocacy group  representative told us that some of their member WOSBs had  encountered confusion and reluctance on the part of contracting officers  to use the program. Another advocacy group said that SBA should  engender more commitment to the program among contracting officers  and agencies. Another representative noted that there are no  consequences for agency leaders for failure to meet contracting goals for  WOSBs or use the set-aside program. SBA officials described to us  consequences that included a low rating in the publicly available SBA  contracting scorecard, which may draw negative attention to the agency.  Also, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013  includes the extent to which agencies meet contracting goals as a  competency by which members of the senior executive service are rated.  All of the businesses we interviewed that received WOSB program  contracts cited the need for increased agency outreach or awareness of  the program. For example, one participant advocated increasing  contracting officer awareness and understanding of how an agency could  benefit from using the WOSB set-aside program.", "Changes to increase use of program. Contracting officers also  identified changes they believe could increase use of the WOSB set- aside. For example, some noted that allowing sole-source contracts could  increase program use. Currently, contract officers can establish a set- aside only if there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible  WOSBs will submit a bid for the contract. Some contracting officers  suggested expanding the list of North American Industry Association  Classification System (NAICS) codes eligible for use under the WOSB  set-aside. For example, one contracting office said that the designated  NAICS for the set-aside program did not meet their procurement needs.  One representative pointed out that SBA had designated some NAICS  codes just for EDWOSB and others for WOSBs. SBA officials told us the  agency does not have the authority to change the list of industry sectors  eligible for program set-asides without conducting a study of industries in  which WOSBs were underrepresented or substantially underrepresented.  Representatives from all of the WOSB advocacy groups, three of which  are also third-party certifiers, said that expanding the NAICS codes would  improve the program. For example, one advocacy group said that certain  WOSBs would like to obtain WOSB or EDWOSB set-asides but did not  have NAICS codes that were listed as eligible. Another said that they  would not limit the number of eligible industries under the program.  Finally, the businesses we interviewed also believed that allowing sole- source awards or adding more NAICS codes would increase program  use. Six participants commented on the limitations for awarding sole- source contracts through the WOSB set-aside. Five participants felt that  the NAICS codes under the program were limited. One program  participant mentioned that she felt that limiting set-asides for the WOSB  program to certain NAICS codes was inconsistent with other SBA  programs with set-asides, such as 8(a), HUBZone, and SDVOSBC. She  gave an example of an agency that issued a draft solicitation that sought  to award two contracts each to WOSB set-asides, HUBZone, and  SDVOSBC businesses. However when it became clear that the contract  was not in an eligible NAICS code for the WOSB program, the agency  converted the two contracts intended for WOSB set-aside to a general  small business category.", "Some program participants also mentioned positive aspects of the  program. Five participants believed that the program provided greater  opportunities for their businesses and WOSBs in general. Furthermore,  five of the six businesses with whom we spoke that received only one or  two contracts felt that the program improved their ability to compete for a  federal contract. For example, one participant noted that while she has  not seen many set-aside solicitations for the NAICS code under which her  business primarily operates, the existence of the program prompted her  to bid on set-asides under other NAICS codes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the only federal procurement set-aside specifically for women-owned  businesses, the WOSB program could play an important role in limiting  competition to certain federal contracts for WOSBs and EDWOSBs that  are underrepresented in their industries. However, weaknesses in  multiple areas of SBA\u2019s management of the program hinder effective  oversight of the WOSB program. Specifically, SBA has limited information  about the performance of its certifiers and does not use what information  is available to help ensure certifiers adhere to program requirements, a  deficiency exacerbated by the highest-volume certifier\u2019s\u2014about 76  percent of third-party certifications\u2014delegation of duties to 14 partner  organizations. An incomplete response to SBA\u2019s request for information  on WBENC\u2019s certification process demonstrates the need for an oversight  framework to ensure that certifiers adhere to agreements with SBA. SBA  did not follow up on the incomplete response from WBENC, which raises  questions about SBA\u2019s commitment to oversight of the certifiers.  Furthermore, the lack of procedures for review and analysis of monthly  certifier reports means that SBA has forgone opportunities to oversee  certifiers and pursue concerns about fraud of individual businesses  identified by one certifier. According to federal standards for internal  control, agencies should conduct control activities such as performance  reviews and clearly document internal controls. Formalizing existing ad  hoc processes (by developing procedures) will help SBA obtain the  information necessary to better ensure that third-party certifiers fulfill the  requirements of their agreements with SBA\u2014an effort SBA said it plans to  undertake, although it has not estimated a completion date. Additionally,  SBA could use results and insights from reviews of certifier reports\u2014 which are to include concerns about businesses\u2014to inform its processes  for eligibility verification, particularly examinations.", "Weaknesses related to SBA\u2019s examination of program participants and  approach to enforcement mean that the agency cannot offer reasonable  assurance that only eligible businesses participate in the program.  Although the agency\u2019s examinations found high rates of ineligibility, SBA  has not yet formalized examination guidance for staff or followed up on  examination results to determine the status of ineligible businesses at the  time of contract award. SBA also has not focused on identifying factors  that may be causing businesses to be found ineligible; rather, the agency  appears to have determined that more training for businesses about  eligibility requirements could address the issue. However, training alone  would be a limited response to examination results, and SBA officials  could not say what analysis determined training to be the relevant  response. Additionally, the sample of businesses that SBA examines  includes only those businesses that received WOSB set-aside contracts.  All these factors limit SBA\u2019s ability to better understand the eligibility of  businesses before applying for and being awarded contracts. Rather than  gather and regularly analyze information related to program eligibility,  SBA relies on other parties to identify potential misrepresentation of  WOSB status (through bid-protest filings and less formal mechanisms)\u2014a  reactive and limited approach to oversight. Federal standards for internal  control state that agencies should have documented procedures, conduct  monitoring, and ensure that any review findings and deficiencies are  brought to the attention of management and are resolved promptly.  Additionally, the standards state that management needs to  comprehensively identify risks the agency faces from both internal and  external sources.
