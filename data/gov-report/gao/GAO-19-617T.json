GAO found that federal and local efforts to improve resilience can reduce the effects and costs of future disasters. FEMA has made progress in this area, but in July 2015, GAO found that states and localities faced challenges using federal funds to maximize resilient rebuilding following a disaster. GAO recommended that the Mitigation Framework Leadership Group\u2014an interagency body chaired by FEMA\u2014create a national strategy to better plan for and invest in disaster resilience. FEMA is working to address this recommendation and plans to publish the strategy by July 2019.", "Response and Recovery. In September 2018, GAO reported that the response to the 2017 disasters in Texas, Florida, and California showed progress since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Specifically, FEMA and state officials' pre-existing relationships and exercises aided the response and helped address various challenges. However, GAO and FEMA identified challenges that slowed and complicated FEMA's response to Hurricane Maria, particularly in Puerto Rico. GAO's issued and ongoing work also identified challenges in implementing FEMA Public Assistance grants. For example, FEMA and Puerto Rico officials identified challenges with Public Assistance policies and guidance that have complicated and slowed the recovery. GAO did not make recommendations, but continues to evaluate recovery efforts and will report its findings later this year.", "FEMA Workforce Management. GAO has previously reported on long-standing workforce management challenges, such as ensuring an adequately-staffed and trained workforce. For example, GAO reported in September 2018 that the 2017 disasters overwhelmed FEMA's workforce and a lack of trained personnel with program expertise led to complications in its response efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria. While FEMA has taken actions to address several of GAO's workforce management-related recommendations since 2016, a number of recommendations remain open as the 2019 hurricane season begins. Also, GAO is currently reviewing FEMA's workforce management efforts and lessons learned from the 2017 disasters and will report its findings early next year."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made numerous recommendations in its prior reports to FEMA designed to address the challenges discussed in this statement.

According to FEMA\u2019s  2017 after action report, the 2017 hurricanes and wildfires collectively  affected 47 million people, and hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria all  rank among the top five costliest hurricanes on record. The 2018  hurricane season followed with hurricanes Florence and Michael, causing  nearly $50 billion of damage, according to the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration. Furthermore, the deadly and destructive  wildfires continued into 2018, including the Camp Fire in northern  California, which destroyed more than 18,500 buildings and was the  costliest and deadliest wildfire in the state\u2019s history. In March 2019, the  Midwest experienced historic flooding that affected millions of acres of  agriculture, numerous cities and towns, and caused widespread damage  to public infrastructure.

Since 2005, federal  funding for disaster assistance is at least $450 billion, most recently for  catastrophic hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, and other losses in 2017 and  2018. Disaster costs are projected to increase as extreme weather  events become more frequent and intense due to climate change\u2014as  observed and projected by the U.S. Global Change Research Program  and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.", "One way to save lives, reduce future risk to people and property, and  minimize federal fiscal exposure from natural hazards is to enhance  disaster resilience. For example, in September 2018, we reported that  elevated homes and strengthened building codes in Texas and Florida  prevented greater damages during the 2017 hurricane season.  Furthermore, in October 2018, the DRRA was enacted, which focuses on  improving preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery.

For example, for 2020 through 2039,  one study estimated between $4 billion and $6 billion in annual coastal  property damages from sea level rise and more frequent and intense  storms. We found that the federal government has not undertaken  strategic government-wide planning on the potential economic effects of  climate change to identify significant risks and craft appropriate federal  responses. As a result, we recommended the Executive Office of the  President, among others, should use information on the potential  economic effects of climate change to help identify significant climate  risks facing the federal government and craft appropriate federal  responses, such as establishing a strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide  federal investments to enhance resilience against future disasters;  however, as of June 2019, officials have not taken action to address this  recommendation.", "In November 2017, we found that FEMA had taken some actions to better  promote hazard mitigation as part of its Public Assistance grant  program. However, we also reported that more consistent planning for,  and more specific performance measures related to, hazard mitigation  could help ensure that mitigation is incorporated into recovery efforts.  We recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) standardize  planning efforts for hazard mitigation after a disaster and (2) develop  performance measures for the Public Assistance grant program to better  align with FEMA\u2019s strategic goal for hazard mitigation in the recovery  process. FEMA concurred with our recommendations, and as of March  2019, officials have reported taking steps to increase coordination across  its Public Assistance, mitigation, and field operations to ensure hazard  mitigation efforts are standardized and integrated into the recovery  process. Additionally, FEMA officials reported taking actions to begin  developing disaster-specific mitigation performance measures.

Developing such an assessment would  help FEMA to identify what capability gaps exist and what level of  resources are needed to close such gaps. Accordingly, we suggested that  FEMA complete a national preparedness assessment to evaluate  capability requirements and gaps at each level of government to enable  FEMA to prioritize grant funding. As of December 2018, FEMA had  efforts underway to assess urban area, state, territory, and tribal  preparedness capabilities to inform the prioritization of grant funding;  however, the agency had not yet completed a national preparedness  assessment with clear, objective, and quantifiable capability requirements  against which to assess preparedness. We are continuing to monitor  FEMA\u2019s efforts to complete such an assessment.", "Furthermore, in March 2015, we reviewed selected states\u2019 approaches to  budgeting for disaster costs to help inform congressional consideration of  the balance between federal and state roles in funding disaster  assistance. Specifically, we reported that none of the 10 states in our  review maintained reserves dedicated solely for future disasters, and  some state officials reported that they could cover disaster costs without  dedicated disaster reserves because they generally relied on the federal  government to fund most of the costs associated with disaster response  and recovery.", "In response to the 2017 disasters, we also have ongoing work to review  national preparedness capabilities to assist communities in responding to  and recovering from disasters. Based on our preliminary observations,  some states and localities we interviewed reported that while they are  prepared to deal with immediate response issues in the aftermath of a  disaster, gaps exist in their capacity to support longer term recovery. One  reason for this, according to these state and local officials, is because  federal preparedness grant funds are largely dedicated to maintaining  response capabilities and sustaining personnel costs for local emergency  management officials. While these preparedness grants fund critical  elements of the national preparedness system, there are some limitations  to using them. Specifically, some state and local officials told us that the  preparedness grant activities are generally focused on terrorism issues  rather than all-hazards. In addition, they reported that the preparedness  grants are generally spent on maintaining response capabilities rather  than to enhance their capacity for disaster recovery\u2014such as additional  training and exercises. In addition to the state, territory, and urban region  assessments that FEMA is conducting, FEMA is currently in the process  of developing the first national Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk  Assessment. This national assessment may help FEMA and  policymakers better understand how to target federal resources in a way  that enhances the nation\u2019s capacity to respond and recover from future  catastrophic or sequential disasters.

Many of the challenges we identified  are also described in FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane Season FEMA After-Action  Report, including:  the sequential and overlapping timing of the three hurricanes\u2014with  Maria being the last of the three\u2014caused staffing shortages and  required FEMA to shift staff to the territories that were already  deployed to other disasters;  the far distance of both territories from the U.S. mainland complicated  efforts to deploy federal resources and personnel quickly; and  the incapacitation of local response functions due to widespread  devastation and loss of power and communications, and limited  preparedness by Puerto Rico and the USVI for a category 5 hurricane  resulted in FEMA having to assume response functions that territories  would usually perform themselves.", "We also reported that FEMA\u2019s 2017 Hurricane Season FEMA After-Action  Report noted that FEMA could have better leveraged information from  preparedness exercises in the Caribbean, including a 2011 exercise after- action report for Puerto Rico which indicated that the territory would  require extensive federal support during a large scale disaster in moving  commodities from the mainland to the territory and to distribution points  throughout.", "In our September 2018 report, we also found that FEMA\u2019s efforts in  Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria were the largest and longest single  response in the agency\u2019s history. According to FEMA, the agency\u2019s  response included, among other things, bringing in approximately $1  billion in food and supplies; and distributing food, commodities, and  medicine via approximately 1,400 flights, which constituted the longest  sustained air operations in U.S. disaster history. FEMA officials  explained that the agency essentially served as the first responder in the  early response efforts in Puerto Rico, and many of services FEMA  provided\u2014such as power restoration, debris removal, and commodity  distribution\u2014were typically provided by territorial or local governments.", "We also reported in September 2018, that in the USVI, recent disaster  training and the pre-positioning of supplies due to the anticipated impact  of Hurricane Irma facilitated the response efforts for Hurricane Maria,  which made landfall less than two weeks later. According to FEMA\u2019s  federal coordinating officer, the lead federal official in charge of response  for the USVI, the federal government deployed assets, including urban  search and rescue teams and medical assistance teams. In addition, due  to the sequence of Hurricane Irma hitting the USVI immediately before  Hurricane Maria, the Department of Defense (DOD) already had  personnel and resources (i.e., ships) deployed to the area, which enabled  DOD to respond to Hurricane Maria faster than it otherwise would have.", "Additional challenges we have reported on regarding response operations  have included providing short-term housing and sheltering for disaster  survivors. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) 2017 National  Preparedness Report states that providing effective and affordable short- term housing for disaster survivors has been a longstanding and  continuing challenge. For example, following the California wildfires,  local officials faced challenges identifying shelter for displaced survivors,  in part due to a housing shortage that existed before the wildfires.  Federal, state, and local officials formed housing task forces which  facilitated a joint decision-making approach to address these challenges.", "While this approach has enabled the state to meet its most pressing  short-term housing needs, according to FEMA officials, the state faces  other challenges in the long term. For example, FEMA officials in the  region covering California told us that because of the nature of damage  following a wildfire and because of housing shortages in California, some  of FEMA\u2019s forms of housing assistance have been less relevant in the  wake of the California wildfires than for other disasters. We will continue  to evaluate these and other challenges and plan to report in fall 2019.", "We also have ongoing work to review efforts to provide mass care\u2014 which includes sheltering, feeding and providing emergency supplies\u2014 following the 2017 hurricanes. Our preliminary observations indicate that  during and immediately following the hurricanes, the number of people  seeking public shelters outpaced the capacity. In Texas and Florida,  emergency managers we spoke with described having unprecedented  numbers of residents needing shelters but not always enough staff initially  to operate the shelters. In Texas, Puerto Rico, and the USVI, hurricanes  Harvey, Irma, and Maria flooded or destroyed many buildings planned for  use as shelters, according to emergency management and local  government officials in these areas. As a result, some remaining shelters  were at maximum capacity. In the USVI, residents of some public housing  units that had sustained significant damages sought help at the territory\u2019s  Department of Human Services because there was no more space in the  shelters, according to local government officials.

Our analysis of actual  and projected obligations for 508 disaster declarations in which Public  Assistance was awarded during fiscal years 2004 through 2011 showed  that fewer disasters would have met either the personal income-adjusted  or the inflation-adjusted Public Assistance per capita indicators for the  years in which the disaster was declared. Thus, had the indicator been  adjusted annually since 1986 for personal income or inflation, fewer  jurisdictions would have met the eligibility criteria that FEMA primarily  used to determine whether federal assistance should be provided, which  would have likely resulted in fewer disaster declarations and lower federal  costs.", "We recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop and  implement a methodology that more comprehensively assesses a  jurisdiction\u2019s capacity to respond to and recover from a disaster without  federal assistance, including fiscal capacity and consideration of  response and recovery capabilities. DHS concurred with our  recommendation and, in January 2016, FEMA was considering  establishing a disaster deductible, which would have required a  predetermined level of financial or other commitment before FEMA would  have provided assistance under the Public Assistance program. In August  2018, FEMA told us that it was no longer pursuing its proposed disaster  deductible due to concerns about the complexity of the proposal. FEMA is  considering options that leverage similar approaches, but does not have  an estimated completion date for implementation. In addition, the DRRA  requires FEMA to initiate rulemaking to (1) update the factors considered  when evaluating requests for major disaster declarations, including  reviewing how FEMA estimates the cost of major disaster assistance, and  (2) consider other impacts on the capacity of a jurisdiction to respond to  disasters, by October 2020.

Further, these officials stated that since the territory is  financially responsible for any costs that exceed these fixed-cost  estimates, the USVI plans to pursue projects that do not include high  levels of complexity or uncertainty to reduce the risk of cost overruns.", "From our ongoing work on Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery efforts, we have  learned that, in March 2019, Puerto Rico\u2019s central recovery office  released the Disaster Recovery Federal Funds Management Guide,  including an internal controls plan for the operation of the recovery office.  On April 1, 2019, FEMA removed the manual reimbursement process and  began a transition to allow the central recovery office to take responsibility  for review and reimbursement approval of federal recovery funds. We will  review this transition process as a part of our ongoing work. Our  preliminary observations also indicate that some of the challenges we  reported in our March 2019 report continue. For example, officials from  Puerto Rico\u2019s central government agencies told us they did not feel they  had sufficient guidance on the FEMA Public Assistance program and  where they did, written and verbal FEMA guidance was inconsistent or  conflicting. For example, officials from one agency expressed their desire  for more FEMA guidance communicated in writing as it frequently  happened that different FEMA officials would interpret existing guidance  differently. Similarly, officials from two agencies described situations  where they had initially been directed to follow one interpretation of a  policy, only to be directed to follow a different, conflicting interpretation in  the subsequent months. Puerto Rico agency officials also stated that the  lack of sufficient instruction led to a \u201cback and forth\u201d with FEMA for  clarifications, which led to delays in the phases of project development.  FEMA officials in Puerto Rico stated that the agency has developed  specific guidance for disaster recovery in Puerto Rico and that there are  various ways, such as in-person meetings, where officials from Puerto  Rico can obtain clarification. We are continuing to examine this issue as  part of our ongoing review of Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery.", "In addition, our preliminary observations from our ongoing work for both  the USVI and Puerto Rico indicate that FEMA, USVI and Puerto Rico  officials have reported challenges with the implementation of the  flexibilities authorized by section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act. This  section of the Act allows for the provision of assistance under the Public  Assistance alternative procedures to restore disaster-damaged facilities  or systems that provide critical services to an industry standard without  regard to pre-disaster condition. Officials from Puerto Rico\u2019s central  government stated that they disagreed with FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the  types of damages covered by section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act  of 2018. In response, FEMA officials in Puerto Rico stated they held  several briefings with Puerto Rico\u2019s central recovery office to explain  FEMA\u2019s interpretation of the section. Further, FEMA officials in the USVI  told us that initially, they had difficulty obtaining clarification from FEMA  headquarters regarding how to implement key components of section  20601 of the Act. As of May 2019, FEMA officials in the USVI stated that  they continue to move forward with developing alternative procedures  projects. USVI officials also told us that FEMA had been responsive and  helpful in identifying its options for using the new authorities the Act  provides. We will continue to evaluate these identified challenges and any  efforts to address them, as well as other aspects of recovery efforts in the  USVI and Puerto Rico, and plan to report our findings in late 2019 and  early 2020, respectively."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Individual Assistance", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s Individuals and Households Program  provides individuals with financial assistance,  such as grants to help repair or replace  damaged homes, and temporary direct  housing assistance, such as recreational  vehicles.", "The Individual Assistance program provides financial and direct  assistance to disaster victims for expenses and needs that cannot be met  through other means, such as insurance. In May 2019, we reported on  FEMA\u2019s effort to provide disaster assistance under the Individual  Assistance program to older adults and people with disabilities following  the 2017 hurricanes. We found that aspects of the application process  for FEMA assistance were challenging for older individuals and those with  disabilities. Further, according to stakeholders and FEMA officials,  disability-related questions in the Individual Assistance registration  materials were confusing and easily misinterpreted. While FEMA had  made some efforts to help registrants interpret the questions, we  recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) implement new  registration-intake questions that improve FEMA\u2019s ability to identify and  address survivors\u2019 disability-related needs, and (2) improve  communication of registrants\u2019 disability-related information across FEMA  programs. DHS concurred with the first recommendation and described  steps FEMA plans to take, or is in the process of taking, to address it.  However, DHS did not concur with the second recommendation, noting  that it lacks specific funding to augment its legacy data systems. FEMA  officials stated that they began a long-term data management  improvement initiative in April 2017, which they expect will ease efforts to  share and flag specific disability-related data. While we acknowledge  FEMA\u2019s concerns about changing legacy systems when it has existing  plans to replace those systems, we continue to believe there are other  cost-effective ways that are likely to improve communication of  registrants\u2019 disability-related information prior to implementing the system  upgrades. For example, FEMA could revise its guidance to remind  program officials to review the survivor case file notes to identify whether  there is a record of any disability-related needs.", "We also have work underway to assess FEMA\u2019s Individuals and  Households Program, a component program of Individual Assistance.  Through this program, as of April 2019, FEMA had awarded roughly $4.7  billion in assistance to almost 1.8 million individuals and households for  federally-declared disasters occurring in 2017 and 2018. Specifically, we  are analyzing Individuals and Households Program expenditures and  registration data for recent years; reviewing FEMA\u2019s processes, policies,  and procedures for making eligibility and award determinations; and  examining survivors\u2019 reported experiences with this program, including  any challenges, for major disaster declarations occurring in recent years.  We plan to report our findings in early 2020."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Longstanding Workforce Management and Information Technology Challenges Exacerbate Key Issues with Response and Recovery Operations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Workforce Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s experiences during the 2017 disasters highlight the importance of  continuing to make progress on addressing the long-standing workforce  management challenges we have previously reported on and continue to  observe in our ongoing work. In September 2018, we reported that the  2017 disasters\u2014hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the  California wildfires\u2014resulted in unprecedented FEMA workforce  management challenges, including recruiting, maintaining, and deploying  a sufficient and adequately-trained FEMA disaster workforce. FEMA\u2019s  available workforce was overwhelmed by the response needs caused by  the sequential and overlapping timing of the three hurricanes. For  example, at the height of FEMA workforce deployments in October 2017,  54 percent of staff were serving in a capacity in which they did not hold  the title of \u201cQualified\u201d\u2014according to FEMA\u2019s qualification system  standards\u2014a past challenge we identified. FEMA officials noted that staff  shortages, and lack of trained personnel with program expertise led to  complications in its response efforts, particularly after Hurricane Maria.", "In February 2016, we reported on, among other things, FEMA\u2019s efforts to  implement, assess, and improve its Incident Management Assistance  Team program. We found that while FEMA used some leading practices  in managing the program, it lacked a standardized plan to ensure that all  national and regional Incident Management Assistance Team members  received required training. Further, we found that the program had  experienced high attrition since its implementation in fiscal year 2013. We  recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop (1) a plan to  ensure that Incident Management Assistance Teams receive required  training, and (2) a workforce strategy for retaining Incident Management  Assistance Team staff. DHS concurred with the recommendations. FEMA  fully implemented our first recommendation by developing an Incident  Management Assistance Team Training and Readiness Manual and  providing a training schedule for fiscal year 2017. In response to the  second recommendation, FEMA officials stated in July 2018 that they  plan to develop policies that will provide guidance on a new workforce  structure, incentives for Incident Management Assistance Team  personnel, and pay-for-performance and all other human resource  actions. We are continuing to monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts to address this  recommendation.", "In November and December 2017, we reported on staffing challenges in  FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program. In November 2017, we reported on  FEMA\u2019s efforts to address past workforce management challenges  through its redesigned Public Assistance delivery model. As part of the  redesign effort, FEMA created consolidated resource centers to  standardize and centralize Public Assistance staff responsible for  managing grant applications, and new specialized positions to ensure  more consistent guidance to applicants. However, we found that FEMA  had not assessed the workforce needed to fully implement the redesigned  model, such as the number of staff needed to fill certain new positions, or  to achieve staffing goals. Further, in December 2017, we reported on  FEMA\u2019s management of its Public Assistance appeals process, including  that FEMA increased staffing levels for the appeals process from 2015 to  2017. However, we found that FEMA continued to face a number of  workforce challenges, such as staff vacancies, turnover, and delays in  training, which contributed to processing delays.", "Based on our findings from our November and December 2017 reports,  we recommended, among other things, that FEMA (1) complete  workforce staffing assessments that identify the appropriate number of  staff needed to implement the redesigned Public Assistance delivery  model, and (2) document steps for hiring, training, and retaining key  appeals staff, and address staff transitions resulting from deployments to  disasters. FEMA concurred with our recommendations to address  workforce management challenges in the Public Assistance program and  have reported taking some actions in response. For example, to address  the first recommendation, FEMA officials have developed preliminary  models and estimates of staffing needs across various programs,  including Public Assistance, and plan to reevaluate the appropriate  number of staff needed and present recommendations to senior  leadership by the end of June 2019. To address the second  recommendation, FEMA has collected information on the amount of time  regional appeals analysts spend on appeals, and the inventory and  timeliness of different types of appeals. FEMA officials stated in  September 2018 that they plan to assess this information to prepare a  detailed regional workforce plan. As of June 2019, we are evaluating  plans and documents provided by FEMA to determine whether they have  fully addressed this recommendation.", "In our March 2019 report on the status of recovery efforts in Puerto Rico,  we also reported Puerto Rico officials\u2019 concerns about FEMA staff  turnover and lack of knowledge among FEMA staff about how the Public  Assistance alternative procedures are to be applied in Puerto Rico. As  part of our ongoing work, we are continuing to examine recovery efforts in  Puerto Rico. Our preliminary observations indicate that the concerns we  reported on in our March 2019 report continue. For example, Puerto Rico  agency officials said that the lack of continuity in FEMA personnel has  been a challenge for communication and project development. Further,  officials from all seven Puerto Rico government agencies we interviewed  felt that the FEMA staff they interacted with did not have a complete  understanding of FEMA processes and policies. We are continuing to  evaluate FEMA\u2019s recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and plan to issue our  findings in late 2019.", "In April 2019, we reported on the federal government\u2019s contracting efforts  for preparedness, response, and recovery efforts related to the 2017  hurricanes and California wildfires. We found, among other things, that  contracting workforce shortages continue to be a challenge for disaster  response and recovery. Further, although FEMA\u2019s 2017 after-action  report recommended increasing contract support capacities, it did not  provide a specific plan to do so. We also found that while FEMA  evaluated its contracting workforce needs in a 2014 workforce analysis, it  did not specifically consider contracting workforce needs in the regional  offices or address Disaster Acquisition Response Team employees. In  our April 2019 report, we recommended, among other things, that FEMA  assess its workforce needs\u2014including staffing levels, mission needs, and  skill gaps\u2014for contracting staff, to include regional offices and Disaster  Acquisition Response Teams, and develop a plan, including timelines, to  address any gaps. FEMA concurred with this recommendation and  estimates that it will implement it in September 2019.", "In our May 2019 report on FEMA disaster assistance to older adults and  people with disabilities following the 2017 hurricanes, we found that  FEMA began implementing a new approach to assist individuals with  disabilities in June 2018, which shifted the responsibility for directly  assisting individuals with disabilities from Disability Integration Advisors\u2014 which are staff FEMA deploys specifically to identify and recommend  actions needed to support survivors with disabilities\u2014to all FEMA staff.  To implement this new approach, FEMA planned to train all of the  agency\u2019s deployable staff and staff in programmatic offices on disability issues during response and recovery deployments. According to FEMA, a  number of Disability Integration Advisors would also deploy to advise  FEMA leadership in the field during disaster response and recovery. We  found that while FEMA has taken some initial steps to provide training on  the changes, it has not established a plan for delivering comprehensive  disability-related training to all staff who will be directly interacting with  individuals with disabilities. We recommended, among other things, that  FEMA develop a plan for delivering training to FEMA staff that promotes  competency in disability awareness and includes milestones and  performance measures, and outlines how performance will be monitored.  DHS concurred with this recommendation; however, officials stated that  FEMA is developing a plan to include a disability integration competency  in the guidance provided for all deployable staff, rather than through  training. We will monitor FEMA\u2019s efforts to develop this plan and fully  address our recommendation.", "In addition to our prior work on FEMA\u2019s workforce management  challenges related to specific programs and functions, we are continuing  to evaluate FEMA\u2019s workforce capacity and training efforts during the  2017 and 2018 disaster seasons. Our preliminary observations indicate  that there were challenges in FEMA\u2019s ability to deploy staff with the right  kinds of skills and training at the right time to best meet the needs of  various disaster events. For example, according to FEMA field leadership  we interviewed, for some of the functions FEMA performs in the field,  FEMA had too few staff with the right technical skills to perform their  missions\u2014such as inspections of damaged properties\u2014efficiently and  effectively. For other functions, these managers also reported that they  had too many staff in the early stages of the disaster, which created  challenges with assigning duties and providing on-the-job training. For  example, some managers reported that they were allocated more staff  than needed in the initial phases of the disaster, but many lacked  experience and were without someone to provide direction and mentoring  to ensure they used their time efficiently and gained competence more  quickly. Groups of FEMA field managers we interviewed told us that  difficulties deploying the right mix of staff with the right skills led to  challenges such as making purchases to support FEMA operations,  problems with properly registering applicants for FEMA programs, or poor  communication with nonfederal partners. Nonetheless, FEMA staff have  noted that, despite any suboptimal circumstances during disaster  response, they aimed to and have been able to find a way to deliver the  mission.", "As part of this ongoing work, FEMA field leadership and managers also  reported challenges using agency systems to ensure the availability of the  right staff with the right skills in the right place and time. FEMA uses a  system called the Deployment Tracking System to, among other things,  help identify staff available to be deployed and activate and track  deployments. To help gauge the experience level and training needs of its  staff, the agency established the FEMA Qualification System (FQS),  which is a set of processes and criteria to monitor staff experience in  competently performing tasks and completing training that correspond to  their job titles. According to the FQS guidance, staff who have been able  to demonstrate proficient performance of all the relevant tasks and  complete required training receive the designation \u201cqualified,\u201d and are  expected to be ready and able to competently fulfill their responsibilities.  Those who have not, receive the designation \u201ctrainee,\u201d and can be  expected to need additional guidance and on-the-job training. FQS  designations feed into the Deployment Tracking System as one key  variable in how the tracking system deploys staff. Among other  challenges with FEMA\u2019s Deployment Tracking System and Qualification  System, FEMA managers and staff in the field told us an employee\u2019s  recorded qualification status was not a reliable indicator of the level at  which deployed personnel would be capable of performing specific duties  and responsibilities or their general proficiency in their positions, making it  more difficult for managers to know the specialized skills or experience of  staff and effectively build teams. We are continuing to assess these and  other reported workforce challenges and plan to report our findings in  January 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Information Technology Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In April 2019, we reported on FEMA\u2019s Grants Management Modernization  program, which is intended to replace the agency\u2019s 10 legacy grants  management systems and modernize and streamline the grants  management environment. We found that, of six important leading  practices for effective business process reengineering and information  technology requirements management, FEMA fully implemented four and  partially implemented two for the Grants Management Modernization  program. The two partially implemented leading practices were (1)  establishing plans for implementing new business processes and (2)  establishing complete traceability of information technology requirements.  In addition, we found that the program\u2019s initial May 2017 cost estimate of  about $251 million was generally consistent with leading practices for a  reliable, high-quality estimate; however, it no longer reflected the current  assumptions about the program at the time of our review. Moreover, the  program\u2019s schedule\u2013specifically its final delivery date of September  2020\u2014did not reflect leading practices for project schedules, as the date  was not informed by a realistic assessment of development activities.  Lastly, we found that FEMA fully addressed three and partially addressed  two of five key cybersecurity practices. The two partially addressed  practices were (1) assessing security controls, and (2) obtaining an  authorization to operate the system. We made 8 recommendations to  FEMA to implement leading practices related to reengineering processes,  managing information technology requirements, scheduling system  development activities, and implementing cybersecurity.
