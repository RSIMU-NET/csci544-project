While the federal-state structure of the UI program places primary responsibility for its administration on the states, Labor provides potential strategies for IT modernization activities through supplemental budget funds.", "Federal funds for UI modernization efforts come primarily from two sources: (1) supplemental budget funds that are designated by Labor for state IT modernization efforts and (2) general UI administration funding. General administration funding primarily consists of State UI and Employment Service Operations funds (an administrative grant issued by Labor at the beginning of each fiscal year); Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 funds, (distributed under the Reed Act, a mechanism by which the federal government transfers surplus UI funds to states); and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act funds (an economic stimulus package enacted in February 2009). However, federal funds can be used for multiple UI purposes, and states are not required to report costs for UI modernization projects.", "The status of the nine states\u0092 UI IT modernization efforts that GAO reviewed range from planning to deployment. Of the nine states, three are part of a consortium (multiple states that develop a single common system) and are all in the initial planning phase; two individual state efforts are in the development phase; two are in a combination of different phases; and two are in operations and maintenance. For example, Virginia is in the development phase whereas Minnesota has a deployed system and is in operations and maintenance.", "States and Labor have challenges specific to (1) individual states and (2) consortiums\u0092 modernization efforts. The challenges for individual states that GAO reviewed relate to having sufficient technical expertise and limited funding, among others, and challenges faced by consortiums relate to differences in state laws and business processes among member states. It is widely recognized that analyzing and prioritizing challenges and then documenting lessons learned can help mitigate risk and track successful ideas for more effectively managing IT in the future. A committee was tasked to assess lessons learned from consortium efforts which may serve as a valuable first step toward helping the states mitigate challenges. However, the effort is not complete and does not represent an independent survey of all the states\u0092 lessons learned. As such, Labor has not yet comprehensively evaluated and prioritized challenges and lessons learned, disseminated them to each state, or facilitated an appropriate information sharing mechanism. Until it does, Labor may miss opportunities to help support future consortium and state modernization efforts.", "All nine states reviewed have established selected management controls for modernizing IT which, if properly implemented, could help reduce the risks of modernization challenges.

For their part, UI agencies must identify recipients who are likely to  exhaust their benefits and refer them to reemployment services, such as  those available through state-run employment centers known as  \u201cAmerican Job Centers.\u201d At these centers, states and localities provide  services for many federally funded employment and training programs,  and they have the option of including additional programs, such as the  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (one of the nation\u2019s  primary income support programs for low-income families).", "Typically, eligible unemployed workers can receive UI benefits for up to  26 weeks in most states (though individuals may be eligible for fewer  weeks). During periods of high unemployment, the states may provide up  to 20 additional weeks of benefits through the Extended Benefits  program.

In 2009, Congress temporarily authorized based on unemployment rates in each state and, has since, amended the  rate and time frame several times, most recently in 2012. As of January  2012, eligible unemployed workers could potentially receive the maximum  99 weeks of benefits in 17 states, according to Labor data, though some  individuals may be eligible for fewer weeks in these states.

For example, Labor is  responsible for monitoring state operations and procedures, providing  technical assistance and training, as well as analyzing UI program data to  diagnose potential problems. The federal-state structure of the UI  program places primary responsibility for its administration on the states,  and gives them wide latitude to administer their programs in a manner  that best suits their needs within the guidelines established by federal  law. In addition, an administrative decision made by Labor in 1986  provided states \u201cbottom line authority\u201d in administering their UI programs,  giving them greater control over their expenditures and reducing federal  monitoring of administrative expenditures. In particular, bottom-line  authority permits states to move resources among cost categories\u2014such  as from benefit payment control activities to claims processing\u2014and  across quarters within a fiscal year.

Because unemployment can vary  substantially during a business cycle, it is important that states build  sufficient trust funds to remain solvent during recessionary times. Toward  this end, the program is financed primarily by taxes levied on  employers, with each state setting tax rates and a tax base which must  be at least equal to the federal wage base (currently set at $7,000) to  automatically finance regular UI benefits. In addition, in accordance with  the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, employers pay a federal tax. This tax  is used to fund: (1) federal and state UI administration costs; (2) the  federal share of extended benefits; (3) Title XII loans to state trust funds  when they cannot pay benefits; (4) benefits under federal supplemental  and emergency programs; (5) labor exchange services, employment,  and training for veterans; and (6) some labor market information  programs.", "The Unemployment Trust Fund in the U.S. Treasury consists of 53 state  accounts, including one each for the District of Columbia, the Virgin  Islands, and Puerto Rico; plus six federal accounts that are dedicated  for special purposes.

The project included  upgrading to a modern programming language and converting from a  legacy database to a database that would allow the state to use web- based programs. In this regard, the state completed a database  modernization project in November 2011 that replaced the outdated  database management system which supported multiple programs,  including UI and disability programs. As a part of its benefits system  modernization effort, the state modernized its (1) electronic benefit  payment system and (2) continued claim web certification system. The  electronic benefit payment project converted the payment of UI benefits  from paper check to a debit card or direct deposit in an attempt to  eliminate the delays associated with processing and mailing checks.  According to a state UI official, the continued claim web certification  project enabled UI customers to use a web-based system to certify for  benefits, eliminating the need to certify by paper. Specifically, they noted  that the system authenticates the customer\u2019s identity through an identity  management component to help ensure customers are eligible for  benefits, and allows customers to enter their claim information on the  form in English or Spanish.

The modernization effort initially began as a separate tax  system in 2006, and this individual system was completed in 2008. The  effort for the benefits and appeals system and the effort to integrate it with  the tax system began in 2010. This modernization effort includes  increased automated system interfaces using web-based architecture and  new business requirements. Florida engaged a contractor to help the  state reengineer the UI benefits process for the modernization effort, and  has dedicated subject matter experts to support the system  modernization redesign.

All nine of the states,  as well as Labor and ITSC, said that limited funding and/or the  increasing cost of UI systems is a major challenge. In addition, the  current economic environment has resulted in smaller state budgets,  which has further limited state funds for IT modernization. Moreover,  once funds are identified or obtained there is often a considerable  amount of time between identifying the funds and when the IT project  is completed. Specifically, state IT officials said that the development  of large state or multistate systems may span many years, and that  states\u2019 priorities and competing demands on resources can delay  project implementation. As such, states often have to fund one phase  of a project with the hope that funds will be available in the future  when they are ready to move to the next project phase. The states  also noted that the lack of a steady stream of funding potentially  hinders effective IT project planning. For example, when Labor first  provided consortium funding in 2009, department officials said that it  was uncertain if there would be additional money available to  complete the implementation of these projects. While Labor was able  to provide additional grant funds for implementation to the first two  consortiums in 2011, state officials said that there is still uncertainty if  the modernization funding will be sufficient to implement and operate  over the life cycle of a project, including the initial planning, design,  development, and operation of their UI systems.", "Ensuring staff have necessary technical and project management  expertise to manage modernization efforts is difficult. Further, seven  of the nine states cited as a challenge the lack of workers in their UI  offices with the necessary expertise to manage IT modernization  efforts. For example,", "Several states said that they had insufficient subject matter  experts that are knowledgeable of the extensive rules and  requirements of the UI program. However, such experts are  essential to helping computer designers and programmers  understand the program\u2019s business process, supporting an  effective transition to the re-engineered process, and identifying  systems requirements and needs.", "States also said that if they had a system developed by vendors  they would have been challenged with operating and maintaining  the modernized system because the state staff may not have the  needed expertise to maintain the new system once the vendor  staff leave.", "The states said they may have staff that implement larger scale  systems only once every 10 to 15 years and, as a result, a large  amount of time usually passes between modernization efforts.  This causes voids in required knowledge and skills, process  maturity and discipline, and executive oversight.", "Because the states\u2019 staff typically has expertise in an outdated  computer language, such as COBOL, they now must learn new  skills and modern languages in order to support the modernized  systems.  In 2011, a workforce survey found that over 78 percent of state  CIOs confirmed that state salary rates and pay grade structures  presented a challenge in attracting and retaining skilled IT talent.  In this regard, the top five skills and disciplines presenting the  greatest challenge were security, project management,  architecture, application and mobile application development and  support, and analysis and design.", "According to Labor, the limited staff resources facing states  requires that subject matter experts address the workload demands of daily operations.", "Subject matter experts are experts in the processes being automated. For example, a  team member representing financial customers must be fully familiar with the needs of  those customers. supporting the development effort, which they said could  potentially delay the development efforts.", "Another state noted that modernization planning efforts took  longer because the IT staff had to maintain the existing system,  code new federally mandated changes to the legacy system, and  create the plans for the modernization project, all using the same  finite resources. According to this IT official, this type of situation  leads to increased risk as legacy resources become less readily  available in the marketplace, driving up the costs for hardware and  software support services.", "There are a limited number of vendors to develop UI IT systems.", "Officials in four of the nine states we reviewed, as well as the ITSC,  noted that the limited number of state modernization systems that  have been developed over the last decade, and the declining amounts  of funding, has resulted in there being only a small number of vendors  that have the knowledge and experience to build UI IT systems.  According to an ITSC official, only a limited number of vendors have  successfully implemented UI modernized systems on time and within  budget with major functionality delivered. Further, one state UI official  noted that, understanding the intricacies of the UI program and the  number of legislative changes that impact IT systems programming to  accommodate the changes require vendors to invest extensive time  and resources. Consequently, the vendors often distribute their  knowledgeable staff among several different states\u2019 modernization  efforts simultaneously, resulting in system development delays. In  addition, three of the nine states said there is significant competition  for IT staff from the private sector. For example, three states are using  the same vendor and, according to the states\u2019 IT managers, their  individual schedules for modernization have been impacted by the  limited vendor resources being divided among the multiple states.  One IT project manager told us his state is experiencing project  delays because its vendor has diverted resources to address issues  with another state\u2019s project.", "There are restrictions on certain funding that is available. Four states  said the restrictions tied to federal funding created a hindrance to  accepting those funds. For example, one state chose to not accept  federal funds for its IT modernization efforts because the funds came  with the requirement to increase UI benefits, which the state opposed.  Other federal restrictions include a prohibition on the commingling of  funds, such as using the federal funds for other projects. One official  said this impaired his state\u2019s ability to leverage funds and projects and  potentially could hinder a state\u2019s ability to, for example, consolidate its  computer operations into one facility because this would involve using  for other projects those resources designated for UI. Another state  said the short time frame in which to apply for federal supplemental  budget funds is not adequate to sufficiently explore the funding  conditions.

Designing and developing a common  system that will work for all states is impacted because each  state\u2019s requirements and processes may differ. For example,  because of these differences and the need to modify a UI  technology framework, state officials told us that they see a  consortium as not practical; another state official questioned  whether a common platform for a system can be successfully built  and made transferable between states in an economically viable  manner.", "Software development approaches may differ. There are multiple  approaches to developing and modernizing systems, and states  within a consortium have often had different opinions on the best  approach. State officials said that having different software  development approaches is not practical when developing a  common system, and that it is difficult to reach consensus on an  overall approach that satisfies all the states in the consortium. A  state in one consortium effort had a preference for one type of  system development approach and withdrew from the consortium  to develop its own UI project because it did not agree with the  development approach the consortium was taking. Specifically,  instead of contracting out for systems development, the state  preferred developing the system in house with its own state staff  and resources, and further noted that joining the consortium would  have required a \u201cwaterfall\u201d project development method, such as  defining all requirements initially before designing the system  instead of taking an agile approach and incrementally defining and  changing system requirements during segmented development,  which is the approach that state preferred to use.", "Potential liabilities that exist in providing services to another state  cause concerns. IT representatives from one consortium\u2019s lead  state noted that taking leadership and managerial direction of a  multistate consortium effort created concerns because officials  from one state were taking responsibility for another state\u2019s  management duties in modernizing its systems to support the UI  program. The official explained that if the lead state makes a  decision that affects other states and the outcome is not desirable,  blame may be placed on the lead state. In addition, there is a  possibility that the lead state\u2019s decision making could place other  states\u2019 funds at risk. In one case, a state withdrew from its  leadership position due to concerns about liability, and it allowed  another state to take this role and assume the responsibilities.", "Location of system resources causes concern. IT managers in  one of the three consortiums pointed to difficulties identifying  where the joint data center that would support the multiple states  should be located, and that there were challenges with reaching  agreement on the resources that should be designated to operate  and manage the facility while complying with individual state  requirements. For example, according to a UI state official, one  state required the data center to be in-state. In July 2012,  according to consortium officials, the state\u2019s UI program received  an exception and was allowed the flexibility to choose the hosting  location outside of its state. Without exceptions such as these,  state-specific requirements that data centers be in-state potentially  could inhibit the number of states willing to participate within the  consortium efforts.", "Independent qualified leadership may be insufficient. All three  consortium representatives noted that obtaining an independent and  qualified leader for a multistate modernization effort was challenging.  The state IT project managers and CIOs elaborated that, while each  state desires to successfully reach a shared goal, doing so requires  strong leadership and commitment that crosses independent and  diverse cultures in multiple states. The leadership of the consortium  must keep the interests of each state in balance. The leader of a  consortium needs to have extensive IT experience, that goes beyond  his or her own state\u2019s technology environment, to effectively  understand and support other states in the joint effort. Moreover, the  consortium\u2019s leader has to mitigate the appearance of partiality, which  may be difficult given the priorities and demands within his or her own  state.
