However, the Army significantly shifted its prepositioning strategy in the latter part of 2006, since that report was issued. According to the Army, this shift was based on insights gained from the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, but Army officials told us that budget reprogramming decisions and worsening Army-wide equipment shortfalls also influenced the expedited strategy revision. The Army's revised strategy proposes less reliance on heavy combat equipment afloat and the expansion of heavy equipment in Kuwait and Italy. As a result, the Army's April 2006 report to Congress is outdated, and neither Congress nor DOD should base funding decisions on it. The Army faces several major strategic and management challenges as it revises and implements its prepositioning program. From a strategic perspective, the Army cannot gauge how well its emerging strategy will align with DOD plans currently under development. The Army plans to begin implementing its revised strategy by the end of 2006. DOD has a departmentwide prepositioning study underway intended to set strategy and joint doctrine, but this will not be completed for several months and it anticipates that the Army will have to modify its prepositioning strategy when the DOD-wide strategy is issued. As a result, the Army is at risk of resourcing requirements that may be superseded by the DOD strategy. Moreover, because prepositioning is linked to airlift, sealift, and basing, the Army's decisions will have an as-yet undetermined effect on these areas. In addition to these strategic concerns, the Army faces three key management challenges. First, the Army has yet to determine sound secondary item and operational project stock requirements, and to systematically measure and report readiness. While the Army has been taking steps to address long-standing requirements-determination problems in certain parts of its program, the effort was not finished when GAO completed its work. Without accurate requirements and systematic readiness reporting, Army managers are not able to determine the extent to which the existing inventory reflects what the Army needs. Second, the Army lacks a comprehensive plan for maintenance and storage facilities for prepositioned stocks, resulting in uncertain future facility requirements. In the interim, prepositioned stocks are being stored outside, resulting in higher maintenance costs. Finally, inadequate maintenance oversight of the Army's prepositioning program has raised concerns about the true condition of the equipment at some locations. Until these strategic and management challenges are addressed, the Army will face uncertain risks should new conflicts occur."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With fewer troops permanently stationed overseas, the prepositioning of  With fewer troops permanently stationed overseas, the prepositioning of  stocks of equipment and supplies has become integral to the ability of the  stocks of equipment and supplies has become integral to the ability of the  Department of Defense (DOD) to project forces into conflict areas faster.

The U.S. military can deliver equipment and supplies in three  ways: by air, by sea, or by prepositioning. While airlift is fast, it is  expensive to use and impractical for moving all of the material needed for  a large-scale deployment. Although ships can carry large loads, they are  slower than airlift. Prepositioning lessens the strain of using expensive  airlift and reduces the reliance on slower sealift deliveries. The value of  prepositioned stocks was demonstrated during operations in Iraq. The  military used equipment and supplies stored at land sites in the region and  offloaded much of the stocks from its prepositioning ships.

In its efforts to reassess secondary item requirements, the  Army ran its requirements-determination model, called the Army War  Reserve Automated Process, in 2005. It had not previously run the model  since 1999, even though Army guidance at that time called for  requirements to be updated every 2 years. Because the model yielded  questionable outputs, Army officials told us they were conducting a  management review to scrub the requirements and help to determine  investment priorities. Army officials said they expect requirements to be  significantly adjusted as a result of their reviews. For example, the Army  has already lowered the U.S. Army Europe meals-ready-to-eat stockage  levels to match the smaller force structure there. This action resulted in  over 1 million meals being made available to fill other high-priority  requirements. In addition, the Army War Reserve Automated Process that  is used for computing secondary item requirements will now be updated  annually instead of biennially.", "Addressing these problems is critical for ensuring Army readiness in future  conflicts. Experiences in Iraq showed that prepositioned secondary item  stocks did not adequately support the troops in combat operations.  Secondary items encompass a wide range of inventory, including critical  readiness-enabling spare parts. In 2005, we reported that inaccurate  requirements and insufficient funding led to shortages in critical items  during Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example, demand for  nonrechargeable lithium batteries and track shoes for armored vehicles  were more than three times greater than the stated requirements for those  items. We concluded that these shortfalls were directly traceable to  problems in requirements computation.", "In addition to critical shortfalls, lessons learned also show considerable  mismatches between what was available in prepositioned stocks and what  units actually needed. In retrospect, the Army did a poor job in forecasting  what it would need. As a result, it had to use scarce and expensive airlift to  get needed stocks to the troops in the field, essentially defeating the  purpose of prepositioning such items in the first place. Subsequent  analyses have detailed the extent of the mismatches between stock levels,  requirements, and actual usage. For example, most of the 16,000 different  spare parts that were actually positioned in Kuwait were ultimately  shipped back from the theater because they were not needed by the forces  there, according to a RAND study commissioned by the Army. Most spare  parts had to be airlifted to the theater, according to RAND. In addition,  RAND compared the Army\u2019s requirements for prepositioned spare parts to  the actual demands during 2003 in Kuwait and found considerable  mismatches. Only about half of the spare parts the Army thought would be  required for prepositioned stocks were actually demanded in theater by  Army units during 2003.", "According to Army officials, secondary items have historically not been  fully funded at least partially because of concerns over the accuracy of the  requirements. As shown in Operation Iraqi Freedom, inaccurate  requirements resulted in limited demand for some items and excessive  demand for others, greatly surpassing the on-hand inventory. The Army  had to employ high-cost air transportation to bring needed items to the  warfighter.", "As with secondary item requirements, long-standing issues exist within the  operational project program\u2014which includes important items like  chemical defense equipment, pipeline systems, mortuary units, and bare  base sets for housing soldiers in austere environments, among other items  not typically part of unit equipment. These sets are typically kept to meet  the specific needs of regional combatant commanders, and Army  regulations require that they be revalidated every 5 years to ensure that the  sets are still needed for an operational plan. Despite this requirement, the  most recent revalidation for many of the projects was conducted in 1998.  However, in response to our recommendation in 2005 that this long- standing problem be addressed, the Army initiated a revalidation of its  Operational Project Stocks in April 2006.", "By October 2006, when we completed our work, the Army had queried  Army commands worldwide to revalidate the needs for the various sets  and had obtained validations for most of the sets. However, Army officials  told us that they have already taken actions to eliminate projects that are  no longer needed and are planning to conduct a management review of  this program to further refine the requirements. To date, the Army has  consolidated some projects and has cancelled other projects that were no  longer needed. For example, three projects to support aerial delivery  operations were cancelled because they were no longer required to  support current operational plans. In addition, United States Army, Europe  has cancelled two projects for bridging and aircraft matting because they  no longer meet current operational requirements.", "One of the most significant consequences of having questionable  requirements underpinning the programs is that it makes it difficult to  assess their overall readiness, and the risk associated with shortfalls.  Typically, the Army measures readiness of prepositioned equipment  programs by assessing the inventory levels against requirements as well as  the maintenance condition of on-hand equipment. However, the Army  does not routinely measure or report readiness for the secondary item and  operational project programs. According to Army and DOD officials,  shortfalls in secondary items and some operational projects are identified  in combatant command priority lists and through joint quarterly readiness  reports to the Joint Staff, but not as part of the Army\u2019s readiness reporting  system. This situation is largely unchanged since 1998, when we  recommended that the Army fix requirements problems and develop  readiness-reporting mechanisms for these programs.", "Despite their lower priority relative to combat equipment programs,  secondary item and operational project programs can be critical during a  war. They contain items such as spare parts that are essential to keep the  combat equipment operational, as well as chemical defense equipment and  other items likely to be needed during the early stages of a conflict. The  budgetary stakes are high: according to the April 2006 report to Congress,  the Army estimated that it had a shortfall of about $1.7 billion in secondary  items alone. Without sound requirements, the Army cannot reliably assess  the readiness of its programs. Once sound requirements are set, the Army  will need reporting mechanisms to assess their readiness and the impact  of any shortfalls.

Previously, significant  issues and problems were found with the mission capability of stocks in  South Korea. We stated that despite reports of high mission capability, the  majority of the stocks in South Korea were not mission capable. During  our May 2006 visit to South Korea, we observed that the Army had hired  additional personnel to bring the equipment up to full mission capability  and ensure that the equipment was properly maintained. A new  organizational structure was established that created clear lines of  responsibility and standard operational procedures for each aspect of the  cyclic maintenance program. A training program for production control  was established for both U.S. and South Korean employees, and there was  a continued emphasis on the need for oversight.", "While the problems we identified in 2005 in South Korea have been  corrected, recent inspections of contractor-maintained equipment in  Kuwait revealed a high percentage of equipment failure, indicating that  maintenance oversight is a continuing problem. Analyzing data available at  the site, we found that 28 percent of the prepositioned equipment in  Kuwait submitted for government acceptance had failed quality assurance  testing between June 2005 and June 2006. However, the maintenance  battalion had not routinely tracked this information or monitored this  important performance measure.", "Additionally, much of the equipment recently certified by the contractor  during preventative maintenance inspections failed random governmental  checks. Beginning in May 2006, the quality assurance team began  performing random preventative maintenance checks on equipment items  inspected and certified by the contractor within the previous 10 to 14 days.  Nearly half of the 49 pieces of equipment sampled during May and June  2006 by the quality assurance inspectors had nonmission-capable faults  needing repair. We accompanied inspectors on three random inspections.  The nonmission-capable faults we observed included inoperable lights,  fluid leaks, lack of battery power, and an inoperable rear door on a  Bradley Fighting Vehicle. Army officials told us this failure rate was not  acceptable and that they had informed the contractor it needed to improve  performance. Yet Army officials recently reported successful issuance in  August 2006 of some of the prepositioned equipment for units heading to  Iraq. This inspection failure rate raises questions about the true mission  capability of the prepositioned equipment, and it demonstrates the need  for rigorous management oversight of the maintenance contractor in  Kuwait. Without improved oversight of maintenance, prepositioned  equipment and supplies could be less than mission capable when needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While prepositioning is considered critical to DOD\u2019s ability to meet its  mobility needs, the department does not yet have a clear strategy laid out  that identifies the role that prepositioning will play in the 21st century. The  Army took steps to revise its prepositioning strategy in the latter part of  2006; however, its efforts are not fully synchronized with the evolving  DOD-wide strategy. The Army\u2019s decisions today have profound future  implications for the entire department and potentially affect our ability to  respond to conflict. The primary risk of having the Army develop its  strategy in advance of a DOD-wide strategy is that the Army could develop  plans without an understanding of how the Army and other services\u2019  programs will fit together or, alternatively, limit the options of the  department because it must incorporate the Army\u2019s plans into the overall  strategy. The importance that prepositioned stocks are envisioned to have  in the future underscores the need for DOD-wide consensus on the  direction and priority for the programs, and the necessity of strong  leadership and direction from the top levels of DOD. The choices may well  be difficult. Unlike the period following the end of the Cold War, the Army  no longer has an excess of relatively modern combat and support  equipment. Depending on the strategy that is eventually chosen, billions of  investment dollars could be required to recapitalize prepositioning  programs and build an infrastructure to support them. Alternatively,  should the Army and DOD decide to focus less on prepositioned stocks,  this decision will likely have a ripple effect on airlift and sealift needs. A  DOD-wide strategy would become the foundation for an investment plan  that balances costs and risks and would guide the department as it  chooses where it will invest in an environment that is increasingly  becoming resource constrained.", "Setting and aligning broad strategies, however, will not be enough to  ensure success in the Army\u2019s program over the longer term. Once the  DOD-wide strategy is set and the Army\u2019s efforts are aligned with it, the  Army must turn its attention to the fundamentals of program management.  Dozens of reports from GAO and other organizations point to pervasive  management problems in determining requirements and ensuring program  readiness, as well as in providing adequate storage and maintenance for  prepositioned equipment. To its credit, the Army recognizes this and has  taken critical first steps toward redefining its prepositioning program and  building a plan for its implementation. However, focused and sustained  attention will be required to overcome these long-standing issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to take steps to synchronize the Army\u2019s prepositioning strategy with  the DOD-wide strategy to ensure that future investments made for the  Army\u2019s prepositioning program align with the anticipated DOD-wide  prepositioning strategy.", "Once the strategic direction is aligned with the DOD strategy, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Army develop an implementation  plan that    completes ongoing reevaluation of the secondary item and operational  project stock requirements as well as establishes systematic readiness  measurement and reporting of secondary items and operational project  stock programs,  identifies the optimal mix of storage and maintenance facilities at each  location to support the emerging strategy, and    prescribes oversight requirements for the maintenance of prepositioned  equipment to ensure that equipment is ready for combat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD generally concurred  with our recommendations but stated that it had already taken steps to  address the recommendations and that further actions are not needed. We  acknowledge that the Army and the department have taken some initial  steps; however, we continue to believe that our recommendations have  merit and that additional actions and sustained management attention will  be needed to ensure the viability of the Army\u2019s prepositioning program as  part of the overall departmentwide effort to meet mobility needs. DOD  also commented that our report contained misleading information and  provided technical comments to improve the accuracy and clarity of the  report. We disagree that the facts in our report are misleading and have  addressed each of the department\u2019s technical comments in appendix III.", "DOD partially concurred with our first recommendation that the Secretary  of Defense take steps to synchronize the Army\u2019s prepositioning strategy  with the emerging DOD-wide strategy, and stated that the Army had  developed a service-specific strategy that is being incorporated into  ongoing mobility studies and the emerging DOD-wide effort. The  department stated that, since the Army is participating in ongoing studies,  further direction is not required. Some of the technical comments DOD  provided also addressed the strategy-setting issue, but seemed to  contradict the overall response. For example, DOD stated that the timing  of the two strategies could cause \u201cdisconnects\u201d and that the Army will  have to modify its strategy when the DOD-wide strategy is issued. Since  DOD\u2019s comments lack internal consistency, it is not clear to us what the  department intends to do to address the recommendation. As our report  points out, successful management practices dictate that strategy setting  should begin at the top, and that strong leadership will be needed from the  department to ensure that the programs of the Army\u2014as well as other  military services\u2014are aligned with the overall departmentwide strategy,  not the reverse. Moreover, taking a service-centric approach to  prepositioning may preclude opportunities for innovation, or lead to  duplication across the department. Prepositioning should be viewed in a  joint context, as part of broader mobility objectives. The ultimate  departmentwide strategy should not just cobble together the plans of the  individual services into a departmentwide strategy. In our view, as it  develops the DOD-wide strategy, the department should take advantage of  the opportunity to reexamine its approach to prepositioning as part of  broader mobility considerations including its interrelationship with airlift  and sealift.", "In the technical comments, the department also stated that the Army  should not be criticized for its timing and lack of synchronization with a  DOD strategy that had not yet been issued. The Army did expedite its  strategy revision during the course of our review, completing it from start  to finish in the latter half of 2006. The Army completed this revision while  a broader strategy effort\u2014specifically, a follow-on to the Mobility  Capabilities Study focused on the future of prepositioning\u2014was ongoing  but had an unclear completion date. In a September 2005 report, we  recommended that DOD develop a departmentwide strategy to set  direction for and underpin the prepositioning programs of the services but  this has still not been completed. Underscoring its interest in  prepositioning\u2014and consistent with our previous recommendation\u2014the  John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  required the department to finalize a departmentwide prepositioning  strategy by April 2007. Had the department implemented our  recommendation in a more timely fashion, this synchronization concern  would be moot and DOD may not have been called upon to establish a  strategy for the department\u2019s prepositioning programs.", "The department concurred with our second recommendation that, once  the Army\u2019s strategy is aligned with the DOD-wide strategy, the Secretary of  the Army should develop an implementation plan to address the  requirements, readiness reporting, facilities, and maintenance oversight  issues that we identified in our report. The department stated that the  Army had included an implementation plan in its revised prepositioning  strategy that addressed these issues and that the implementation plan had  been aligned with a joint staff instruction published in November 2006 that  provides logistics planning guidance for prepositioning and a department  directive dated December 2003 that provides war reserve materiel policy.  As a result, the department stated that no additional direction is required.  We disagree. The Army\u2019s implementation plan was to have been completed  in December 2006, but was still unavailable as of the end of January 2007.  As a result, GAO could not determine whether the elements of our  recommendation have been addressed. However, we reviewed the recent  logistics planning guidance and while the instruction provides general  logistics planning guidance for prepositioned stocks, there are few  specifics about requirements setting and readiness reporting for secondary  items and operational project stocks, facilities, or maintenance oversight.  We also reviewed the identified department guidance. While it does  require the determination of war reserve materiel requirements, and  annual reports of the existing levels of these items, we do not believe this  is a systematic reporting of readiness. In fact, our 2005 report found that  the department was not enforcing the readiness-reporting provision, and  planned to rescind it. Neither Instruction addresses the optimum mix of  storage and maintenance facilities or prescribes oversight requirements  for the maintenance of prepositioned equipment to ensure that it is  combat ready. Moreover, since these issues have been long-standing,  recognized both in prior GAO reports and assessments made by the  Army\u2019s own audit organizations, we continue to believe that additional  direction is needed.", "We will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and the  Secretary of the Army.

DOD comments indicate that the reason the Army shifted its  prepositioning strategy in 2006 was not due to budget reprogramming  decisions; instead it was due to the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review.  We interviewed Army officials during the summer of 2006 who told us  that the budget reprogramming decision and equipment shortfalls  throughout the Army were the main impetus of the strategy review. We  have added the Army\u2019s assertion that the quadrennial review  influenced the decision to the text.  2.  DOD indicates that the DOD policy under development \u201cwill result in  the Army creating/modifying its strategy in accordance with the  guidance in the DOD policy\u201d when issued. We have added the  department\u2019s assertion to the text. We agree that having an Army  implementation plan in place before the DOD policy is issued will  result in the need to modify the Army\u2019s strategy. However this is an  apparent inconsistency with the main text of the department\u2019s  comments stipulating that the Army\u2019s completed strategy will be  incorporated into the DOD-wide strategy. As a result, we continue to  believe that additional department-level direction is needed to ensure  that future investments made by the Army are aligned with DOD  policy.  3.  We believe that strategy is a better description as it provides linkage to  the recommendation in our 2005 report calling for a DOD-wide  prepositioning strategy.  4.  The department stated that the Army should not be criticized for  creating an implementation strategy before the DOD policy is issued.  Our intent was not to criticize but to demonstrate the potential risks  associated with individual service strategies being implemented before  the department\u2019s strategy is issued. In a September 2005 report GAO  recommended that DOD develop a departmentwide strategy to set  direction for and underpin the prepositioning programs of the services  but this has still not been completed. The Army can ill afford to invest  scarce resources to meet requirements that will not be aligned with the  DOD policy when issued.  5.  The department disagreed with several aspects of our description of  the operational project and secondary item programs. We have  included additional information to the report that, in response to a past  GAO recommendation, the Army has conducted revalidations of most  operational project stocks. Further, the Army asserted that it tracks  the funding of the prepositioned secondary items and operational  project stocks as part of the Army\u2019s Strategic Management System and  that this constitutes readiness reporting. We disagree. The  requirements underpinning these programs are questionable, and  funding information is inadequate for determining readiness.  6.  We have changed the text to reflect the department\u2019s definition of war  reserve sustainment stocks.  7.  Since the Army strategy evolved during our review, we continue to  believe our caption better reflects the substance.  8.  See comment 1.  9.  We have changed the text to delete \u201creset\u201d.  10. We have changed the text to insert \u201cDOD\u201d.  11. We have made changes to the text to reflect the role of Combatant  Commanders in operational planning.  12. The department\u2019s suggested language indicated that the shift in  strategy was the result of the 2006 Quadrennial Review. We have  reflected this throughout the report. The department also suggested  deleting language in the draft report concerning the lack of mission in  Italy in the previous Army strategy but offered no reason why this  information should be deleted. When initially approved, the $55 million  construction project in Italy was intended to support the storage of a  prepositioned combat brigade team equipment set there, but this  requirement had been eliminated in the 2012 strategy leaving the  facility with no mission. The Army decided to complete the  construction as it was more costly to cancel than complete, and the  Army\u2019s 2013 strategy indicates placing a combat brigade team  equipment set at that location even though existing operational and  contingency plans for the area do not require this type of equipment.  We have retained this information in the report because we believe this  information illustrates the need for better facilities planning by the  Army.  13.
