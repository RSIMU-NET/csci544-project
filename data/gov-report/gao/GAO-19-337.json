However, EXIM is missing additional opportunities to use readily available data containing delinquent federal debt indicators from the General Services Administration's (GSA) System for Award Management (SAM) to detect applicants and participants that may have delinquent federal debt. Federal law states that applicants who are delinquent on federal nontax debts may not receive federal direct loans, loan guarantees, or loan insurance until the delinquent debt is satisfactorily resolved. Using data from SAM, GAO found that, from calendar years 2014 through 2016, EXIM authorized transactions that had an aggregate authorization value of about $1.7 billion and were associated with 32 U.S.-based companies that had a delinquent federal debt indicator in SAM in the same month EXIM authorized these transactions . While these results alone do not mean EXIM should have suspended these transactions, they do indicate that there is a practical opportunity to use SAM data to help determine applicants' eligibility.

As part of its 2015 reauthorization, Congress included a provision  in statute for us to review the adequacy of the design and effectiveness of  EXIM\u2019s antifraud controls, and review a sample of EXIM transactions,  within 4 years of reauthorization. This review is the second of two that  we conducted to meet this congressional mandate prior to the expiration  of EXIM\u2019s current authorization in September 2019.", "In our first report, issued in July 2018, we assessed EXIM\u2019s fraud risk  management practices against leading practices of GAO\u2019s A Framework  for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework).  We found that EXIM, in managing its vulnerability to fraud, had adopted  some of the leading practices called for in the Fraud Risk Framework. For  example, EXIM had identified a dedicated entity within the agency to lead  fraud risk management, which is one of the leading practices of the  framework. However, we found that EXIM was not planning and  conducting regular fraud risk assessments as called for in the Fraud Risk  Framework. At the time, EXIM officials told us they planned to implement  the framework, but did not provide us documentation describing in detail  how they would ensure that their planned fraud risk assessment was  consistent with leading practices of the framework. As a result, we  recommended, among other things, that EXIM should ensure that its fraud risk assessments and fraud risk profile address known methods of  fraud and other inherent fraud risks. EXIM agreed with this  recommendation. In February 2019, EXIM provided documentation  reflecting its efforts to implement the recommendations from our July  2018 report.

Specifically, according to the assess component of the Fraud Risk  Framework, managers who effectively assess fraud risks attempt to fully  consider the specific fraud risks the agency or program faces, analyze the  potential likelihood and impact of fraud schemes, and then ultimately  document prioritized fraud risks. Moreover, managers can use the fraud  risk assessment process to determine the extent to which controls may  no longer be relevant or cost-effective. Leading practices that are  consistent with this component include  conducting quantitative or qualitative fraud risk assessments at  regular intervals, or both, of the likelihood and impact of inherent risks  on the program\u2019s objectives, and determining the agency\u2019s risk  tolerance for the inherent fraud risks;  identifying specific sources for gathering information about fraud risks,  including information on fraud schemes that are reflected in  adjudicated cases of fraud; examining the suitability of existing fraud controls for preventing fraud  and mitigating fraud risks identified; and documenting in the program\u2019s fraud risk profile the analysis of the  types of inherent fraud risks assessed, their perceived likelihood and  impact, managers\u2019 risk tolerance, and the prioritization of the inherent  fraud risks and any residual fraud risks.", "As we reported in July 2018, the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act  of 2015 requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  establish guidelines that incorporate the leading practices of GAO\u2019s Fraud  Risk Framework.

Because the Debt Subject to Offset  flag may indicate either nontax debts or tax debts, it is possible that  some of these entities owed delinquent federal nontax debts that are  applicable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720B, indicating EXIM should have  considered suspending these transactions. However, it is also  possible that some of these entities owed delinquent federal tax debts  that are not applicable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720B, but that may pose a  fraud risk or repayment risk nonetheless. By using the Debt Subject to  Offset flag as an indicator of these delinquent federal debts and  gathering additional information on the specific facts and  circumstances of each case, EXIM would be better positioned to  assess the relevant compliance, fraud, and repayment risks an  applicant\u2019s or participant\u2019s delinquent federal debt may pose.", "An aggregate authorization value of about $4.1 billion was associated  with 97 U.S.-based companies that had a delinquent federal debt  indicator in SAM during the transaction maturity period (i.e., after the  month they were approved, but before the transactions\u2019 maturity  date).

As mentioned above, associated parties we reviewed  included not only the applicant, but also participants involved,  including the borrower, buyer, and exporter, which may or may not be  the applicant. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720B may prevent applicants with federal  financial debts from obtaining loans, guarantees, and insurance; thus,  it does not apply to any delinquent federal debt accrued after loan  approval. However, we looked at potential delinquent debt accrued  after approval because delinquent debt accrued after approval and  during the transaction maturity period might affect EXIM\u2019s view of a  financing product\u2019s repayment risk. Further, EXIM already conducts  similar postauthorization monitoring to identify such risks through its  use of World Check as part of its CRTI process described above.  Thus, these results nonetheless illustrate that EXIM can use SAM  data during EXIM\u2019s postauthorization CRTI reviews to identify  transaction participants with potential delinquent federal debt and  determine the extent to which they may pose a repayment fraud risk.", "Prior to sharing our results with EXIM, EXIM officials told us that they  have access to SAM entity registration records, but they believe  searching the SAM registration database is a time-consuming process  that should be reserved for rare circumstances. Further, EXIM officials  also told us that using the SAM registration database to identify  applicants or participants that have the Debt Subject to Offset flag in SAM  would yield few results because the vast majority of their financing  program participants are foreign-based entities, and thus would not also  be contractors for the U.S. government and registered in SAM.  However, we identified many U.S.-based entities that had a delinquent  federal debt indicator either in the month a transaction was approved, or  during the transaction\u2019s maturity period, by searching in the SAM  database and analyzing SAM data for EXIM applicant and participants, as  described above. Further, it is not clear whether performing manual  searches or batch matches with SAM data to identify delinquent federal  debtors would be any more time-consuming than EXIM\u2019s current  procedures for doing so, which include manual searches of World Check  and obtaining and reviewing credit reports, as described above.", "When we met with EXIM officials to communicate our batch-matching  results above, they expressed concern that these results could imply that  EXIM is doing business with applicants or participants with delinquent  federal debt. They then indicated that they were interested in obtaining  SAM registration data so that they could determine whether it would be  feasible for them to perform the same type of analysis that we performed.  In a subsequent meeting, EXIM officials informed us that they were also  able to obtain current SAM registration data, analyze the SAM data  against active EXIM participant data, and find dozens of active EXIM  participants with the Debt Subject to Offset flag in SAM.", "The results of our analyses, as well as EXIM\u2019s own experience with the  SAM data, suggest EXIM also has an additional and practical opportunity  to incorporate searches of SAM entity registration data as part of its  postapproval monitoring of transactions to enhance its monitoring of and  response to risks in ongoing transactions. Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government state that management should use quality  data to achieve agency objectives. For example, this could include  agencies obtaining relevant operational, financial, or compliance-related  data from reliable internal and external sources in a timely manner based  on identified information requirements, and then using such data to make  informed decisions and evaluate performance in achieving program  objectives and addressing risks.", "Without also pursuing available debt data in SAM\u2019s registration database,  as an additional layer of due diligence, to identify applicants with  delinquent federal debt during underwriting and compliance reviews,  EXIM is potentially forgoing practical opportunities to use such data when  determining applicants\u2019 program eligibility and to adopt leading practices  for managing repayment fraud risks across EXIM\u2019s financing programs. In  particular, such available SAM data can provide opportunities to  verify independently the applicants\u2019 self-certification of delinquent  federal debts they owe and assess whether the applicants may have  misrepresented their delinquent federal debt status on their  applications, which is a fraud risk in the application process; detect potential delinquent federal debts that are not apparent in credit make informed eligibility decisions during preauthorization CRTI  reviews and assess repayment fraud risk during postauthorization  CRTI reviews."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EXIM assumes the credit and country risks that the private sector is  unable or unwilling to accept, including the risk of losses due to fraud.  EXIM\u2019s financing products face various fraud risks, and EXIM has begun  to take steps to consider these fraud risks as part of a full fraud risk  assessment, as we recommended in July 2018. However, because it  remains unclear whether EXIM\u2019s actions fully respond to the  recommendations of our July 2018 report, we will continue to monitor  EXIM\u2019s progress in fully assessing its fraud risks. EXIM also employs  procedures to detect delinquent federal debt owed by EXIM applicants  and participants. However, EXIM is missing opportunities to use readily  available SAM data to identify applicants or participants that may  misrepresent their delinquent federal debt status and pose a repayment  fraud risk to EXIM financing programs. Applicants or participants with  delinquent federal debt could be one of many repayment fraud risks that  could indicate an increased risk of nonrepayment and incentives to  commit fraud against EXIM. EXIM officials believe searching SAM is a  time-consuming process that would yield few results. However, manually  searching SAM\u2019s online registration database for the purpose of  determining whether an applicant or participant may have a Debt Subject  to Offset flag may not be any more time-consuming than what EXIM  currently performs through its preauthorization or postauthorization CRTI  reviews. Nevertheless, we demonstrate in this report the practicality and  illustrate results of using such data through multiple approaches, such as  batch matching, without incurring any external costs charged by GSA. By  assessing the practicality of searching SAM data, EXIM may determine  that this source of data provides an additional tool for combating fraud.  Implementing these antifraud activities could further help EXIM verify  program eligibility, identify repayment fraud risk, and provide EXIM with  reasonable assurance that it is effectively and efficiently carrying out its  mission of supporting U.S. jobs and the export of U.S. goods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to EXIM:  EXIM\u2019s chief operating officer should direct EXIM\u2019s Credit Review and  Compliance Division to assess and document the practicality of  incorporating into its preauthorization CRTI reviews searches of data  elements in SAM that indicate delinquent federal debts owed by  applicants, and, if practical, implement relevant approaches\u2014such as  manual searches or batch matching.
