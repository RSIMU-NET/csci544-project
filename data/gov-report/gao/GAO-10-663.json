The act also directs GAO to review each report. As agreed, GAO focused on the fiscal year 2010 report's compliance with, among other things, these provisions of the act.

Specifically, (1) The report includes milestones, performance against milestones, and milestone revisions for specific investments. However, other important performance measures, such as measures of progress against program cost, capability, and benefit commitments are not included in the report. DOD officials attributed the missing performance-related information to various factors, including that most of the investments addressed in the report have not progressed far enough in their life cycles to measure cost, capability, and benefit performance. However, the report also cites a number of investments that have produced business improvements and cost savings, and thus it follows that performance-related information about investment costs incurred, capabilities delivered, and benefits realized is available and can be reported relative to program expectations. Moreover, programs that have not yet delivered capabilities or realized benefits have nevertheless incurred costs, which DOD can report relative to expected costs. (2) The report identifies certification actions associated with 116 business system modernization investments. However, the report omits certification actions for 40 other investments. According to DOD officials, the omitted actions are not new certifications, but rather are recertifications that were intentionally excluded from the report. However, certification memoranda show this is not the case for four of the actions and DOD guidance defines a recertification as a type of certification action. Further, the underlying bases for a number of reported actions are limited because program weaknesses that GAO's prior work has raised, such as the reliability of the systems' economic analyses and the sufficiency of business enterprise architecture compliance determinations, are not reflected in the reported certification actions. DOD's guidance does not require that certification submissions disclose program weaknesses that GAO has raised, and DOD officials stated that reviews are limited to the information that is submitted. As a result, DOD's annual report does not provide the full range of information that is needed to permit meaningful and informed congressional oversight of the department's business systems modernization efforts. Moreover, the bases for some certification actions exclude relevant information about known investment weaknesses, and thus these actions may not be sufficiently justified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been challenged in  modernizing its timeworn business systems.

For example,    We reported in September 2009 that the Defense Readiness Reporting  System (DRRS) program was not being effectively managed and made  recommendations to address a number of acquisition management  weaknesses including the absence of a reliable integrated master schedule  and well defined and managed requirements, and adequate testing. As  stated in our report, we briefed the DRRS program office on the results of  our work prior to its DOD Human Resources Management IRB  certification review. However, these results were not disclosed to the IRB.  Rather, the certification package that the precertification authority  submitted to the IRB stated that DRRS was on track for meeting its cost,  schedule, and performance measures and highlighted no program risks.  Based on this submission, DRRS was certified by the IRB and approved by  the DBSMC to obligate $24.625 million in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  According to the chair of the IRB, the board did not validate the  information in the submissions it received, and the results of our review  were not disclosed to the IRB.", "We reported in July 2008 that the Global Combat Support System-Marine  Corps (GCSS-MC) program had not been economically justified on the  basis of reliable estimates of both benefits and costs and that key program  management controls, such as the use of earned value management and  risk management had not been properly implemented. Accordingly, we  made recommendations to address these weaknesses. GCSS-MC was  certified with conditions and recertified during fiscal year 2009. Neither  the weaknesses that we previously reported nor the status of our  recommendations to address them were evident in the conditions  accompanying the certification, even though our recommendations had  yet to be implemented at the time of these certification actions.", "We reported in September 2008 that the Navy ERP program did not use  important cost estimating practices when economically justifying the  program, did not implement key aspects of earned value management, and  did not have risk mitigation strategies in place to address the risks  described in our report, including risks associated with these issues.  Accordingly, we made recommendations to address these weaknesses.  However, when Navy ERP was recertified during fiscal year 2009,  conditions relative to any of these weaknesses did not accompany the  recertification, although our recommendations had yet to be implemented  at the time of recertification.", "Officials representing each of the IRBs stated that the boards depend on  the component precertification authorities to provide them with complete  and reliable information about each system investment. Among other  things, IRB officials stated that such information should include the results  of reviews by us and others. However, DOD guidance does not state that  GAO-related information, such as open recommendations or the focus and  results of our ongoing reviews, is to be included in the certification  packages provided to the IRBs. Further, the Special Assistant to the  Deputy Chief Management Officer told us it is each program\u2019s milestone  decision authority that is ultimately responsible for addressing known  program management issues, including those raised by GAO.", "By not having and considering relevant information about the state of each  system modernization investment certified and approved, such as the  results of our reviews and the status of actions to implement our  recommendations that pertain to the investment, DOD\u2019s certification and  approval decisions are based on limited information, and thus may not be  justified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Report States That Certification Waivers Were Not Granted", "paragraphs": ["The act requires DOD to identify in its annual report any defense business  system modernization with an obligation in excess of $1 million during the  preceding fiscal year that was not certified and approved according to the  act\u2019s provisions, along with any reasons for these requirements being  waived.

Similarly, each of DOD\u2019s  annual reports since March of 2006 has stated that no systems were  approved on the basis of a certification waiver. According to officials  representing each of the IRBs, while program officials sometimes seek to  be certified on the basis of a waiver, their practice is to ensure that the  program office addresses any issues underlying a waiver request before  the investment is placed on an IRB\u2019s certification review agenda.

Reagan  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 (the act). To  address this, we focused on the extent to which DOD\u2019s annual report to  Congress addressed the following provisions of the act: (1) describe  milestones and actual performance against specified measures and any  revisions, (2) discuss specific improvements in business operations and  cost savings resulting from successful business system modernization  efforts, (3) describe specific actions on each business system investment  submitted for certification, and (4) identify any business system  investment with an obligation in excess of $1 million that was not certified  during the preceding fiscal year and reasons for the waiver. Our  methodology relative to each of the four requirements is as follows:    To determine whether the DOD annual report described milestones and  actual performance against specified measures and any revisions, we  compared information contained in the annual report to what the act  required. Further, we compared the types of measures included in the  annual report to those commonly associated with program performance,  such as those described in prior GAO work related to performance  measures. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Business  Transformation Agency (BTA) and each of DOD\u2019s investment review  boards (IRB) to understand the process used to identify and track  milestones and other performance measures. We did not independently  validate the accuracy of the milestone dates included in the report.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s annual report discussed specific  improvements in business operations and cost savings, we reviewed each  of the 18 case-in-point narratives included in the annual report that  described examples of business improvements and other benefits.

We did not validate the accuracy of the  improvements or benefits discussed in the case-in-point narratives.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s annual report identified specific  actions on each business systems investment submitted for certification,  we reviewed and analyzed all Defense Business Systems Management  Committee (DBSMC) certification approval memoranda as well as IRB  certification memoranda and IRB meeting minutes issued prior to the  DBSMC\u2019s final approval decisions for fiscal year 2009 and compared the  results to those certification actions described in the annual report to  identify differences.
