In the United States, 8 research reactors, including 6 university research reactors, have not converted because DOE has not provided the necessary funding. Of the 20 foreign research reactors that use U.S.-origin HEU fuel, 14 do not have plans to convert because they have a sufficient supply of HEU fuel and either do not want to incur the additional cost of conversion or do not have the necessary funding. Finally, only 1 of 7 Russian-supplied research reactors that could use LEU fuel is scheduled to convert. Conversion to LEU fuel is not technically feasible for 31 research reactors worldwide that still use HEU fuel. DOE has experienced technical setbacks in fuel development that have postponed the conversion of the 31 reactors until 2010 at the earliest. One fuel failed unexpectedly in testing, and DOE may cancel further development, depending on the results of additional tests. Initial testing of another LEU fuel produced positive results, but additional testing is required and the fuel will not be developed until 2010 at the earliest. Separately from the development of LEU fuel, DOE is developing LEU to replace HEU in the production of medical isotopes. DOE has not yet completed the work that would enable conversion of large-scale medical isotope production to LEU. One reactor has converted to LEU for smallscale production. However, large-scale producers are concerned that the cost of converting to LEU could be prohibitive. DOE and NRC have taken steps to improve security at foreign and U.S. research reactors. While operators at most research reactors we visited said that security had been upgraded through DOE or NRC efforts, we observed areas where further improvements could be made. Recognizing the possible need for further improvements, DOE and NRC are engaged in separate efforts to assess and improve security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear research reactors located throughout the world play a vital role in  medicine, agriculture, industry, and basic scientific research. Many of the  research reactors use highly enriched uranium (HEU) in one of two ways,  either as fuel or as an ingredient for the production of medical isotopes  used to treat cancer or conduct medical diagnoses. HEU is also a key  component in the construction of nuclear weapons\u2014it takes as little as 25  kilograms of HEU to build a nuclear weapon. The amount of HEU located  at research reactors worldwide ranges from several kilograms to in excess  of 20 kilograms.", "The United States has a long-standing policy of reducing and, to the extent  possible, eliminating the use of HEU in civilian research reactors. To  support this policy, the Department of Energy (DOE) initiated the Reduced  Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program in 1978 to  develop the technology to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of HEU  in civilian research reactors worldwide. DOE\u2019s Argonne National  Laboratory (Argonne) is the technical lead for the program and conducts  research and development to find alternatives to the two uses of HEU in  research reactors. The program\u2019s goal is to replace HEU with low enriched  uranium (LEU), which would be very difficult to use in nuclear weapons.    The Secretary of Energy reiterated DOE\u2019s support for the reactor  conversion program and committed to the conversion of all U.S. civilian  research reactors by 2013 in a speech on May 26, 2004.", "To achieve the program\u2019s objectives, Argonne conducts extensive tests on  new LEU fuels and materials for isotope production to find suitable  alternatives that do not negatively affect research reactors\u2019 performance,  operating costs, or operational safety. Part of Argonne\u2019s strategy is to have  multiple fuels under development to address the unique fuel needs of the  different types of research reactors included in DOE\u2019s reactor conversion  program. Research reactors are designed for different purposes and have  operating characteristics that affect their ability to convert to LEU. As a  result, an LEU fuel that can be used in one research reactor may not be  suitable for another.", "The scope of DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program includes LEU fuel  development for 105 research reactors located in the United States and 40  other countries. Since the inception of the program through July 2004, 39 of  the 105 reactors have either converted or are in the process of converting  to LEU. Argonne officials estimate that prior to converting to LEU, these 39  research reactors used over 240 kilograms of HEU fuel per year, enough to  build about 10 nuclear weapons. In contrast, they estimate that the  remaining 66 research reactors, which have not converted to LEU, continue  to use over 800 kilograms of HEU fuel per year. Thirty-five of these reactors  could convert using currently available LEU fuels, and Argonne is  developing new LEU fuels for 31 research reactors that cannot convert  using any of the fuels already developed. In particular, after screening a  large number of potential LEU fuels, Argonne has identified two fuels,  dispersion fuel and monolithic fuel, for further testing and development.  Both of these fuels use an alloy of uranium and another metal called  molybdenum and differ in how the fuel is manufactured. Dispersion fuel  consists of spherical particles of uranium-molybdenum alloy that are  randomly dispersed in a thin layer of aluminum. In contrast, monolithic fuel  consists of a thin sheet of solid uranium-molybdenum alloy.", "The reactor conversion program also develops LEU alternatives for six  medical isotope producers, all located outside the United States, that use  an estimated 85 kilograms of HEU per year in their production processes.  The use of HEU for medical isotope production is separate from the type of  fuel used in research reactors. Developing the technology to convert to  LEU for medical isotope production requires a technical effort that is  separate from the development of new LEU fuels.", "Concerned about the potential theft or diversion of HEU from research  reactors, DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are engaged  in efforts to monitor and improve security at research reactors, many of  which are located on university campuses or other facilities used by  students and researchers. Since 1974, DOE has engaged in efforts to  improve nuclear material security in over 50 countries, including security  over nuclear material at research reactors. In the United States, NRC  regulates research reactors to ensure an acceptable level of safety and  security and conducts regular inspections to ensure compliance with  regulations on safety and security.", "In response to your request concerning the use of HEU at civilian research  reactors, we examined (1) the status of research reactors worldwide in  converting to LEU fuels developed by DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program,  (2) the program\u2019s progress in developing new LEU fuels for use in research  reactors that cannot convert to currently available LEU fuels, and (3) the  program\u2019s progress in developing LEU for use in the production of medical  isotopes. In addition, because HEU continues to be used and stored at  research reactors worldwide, we gathered information on the status of  DOE and NRC efforts to improve the security of research reactors in the  United States and other countries.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed documentation on the reactor  conversion program from DOE and Argonne, including information on the  status of reactors in converting to LEU, development of LEU fuels, and  development of LEU for medical isotope production. We visited research  reactors in the United States, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Russia, and Ukraine; attended an annual international  conference on DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program; and obtained  information on the status of developing LEU fuels and LEU for the  production of medical isotopes from reactor conversion program officials  at Argonne. We also discussed the status of the program and security of  HEU at foreign and domestic research reactors with foreign officials in the  countries we visited and with DOE and NRC officials. However, we did not  evaluate the effectiveness of the security at research reactors or DOE and  NRC efforts to improve security. We conducted our review from July 2003  to July 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "You also asked that we examine two other DOE programs closely related to  the reactor conversion program: the Foreign Research Reactor Spent  Nuclear Fuel Acceptance program and the Russian Research Reactor Fuel  Return program. The Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel  Acceptance program is intended to recover and store U.S.-origin research  reactor fuel, including both HEU and LEU, from 41 eligible countries  throughout the world. The Russian Research Reactor Fuel Return program  assists in the return of Russian-origin research reactor fuel to Russia,  mostly from countries of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern  Europe. Together with DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program, these programs  support the objective of reducing and eventually eliminating the use of  HEU for civilian applications. As agreed with your office, we will address  these two programs in a follow-on report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear research reactors are used for training and research purposes  throughout the world. Research reactors are generally smaller than nuclear  power reactors, ranging in size from less than 1 to 250 megawatts  compared with 3,000 megawatts generated by a typical power reactor. In  addition, unlike power reactors, many research reactors use HEU fuel  instead of LEU in order to produce the appropriate conditions in the  reactor cores for conducting a wide variety of research. DOE has identified  161 operating research reactors that were designed to use HEU fuel and  has included 105 of them in the reactor conversion program. The research  reactors included in the program are spread out among the United States  and 40 other countries, including Canada, France, Germany, and Russia  (see fig. 1).", "In addition to the 105 research reactors covered under the reactor  conversion program, DOE has targeted six medical isotope producers that  use HEU as an ingredient in their production processes, including four  large medical isotope producers located in Belgium, Canada, the  Netherlands, and South Africa.", "For a variety of reasons, DOE has excluded from its reactor conversion  program 56 research reactors that use HEU fuel, including 9 in the United  States. Some of the reactors are used for military or other purposes, such  as space propulsion, that require HEU. Others are located in countries such  as China that so far have not cooperated with the United States on  converting their reactors to LEU. Finally, the time and costs associated  with developing LEU fuel for some of the reactors may exceed their  expected lifetime and usefulness.", "The United States has historically provided nuclear technology to foreign  countries in exchange for a commitment not to develop nuclear weapons.  Starting in 1953, the Atoms for Peace program supplied research reactors  and the fuel needed to operate them to countries around the world. The  research reactors supplied by the Atoms for Peace program initially used  LEU fuel, but many countries gradually switched from LEU to HEU in  order to conduct more advanced research. In addition, HEU fuel could  remain in the reactor core longer and was less expensive than LEU fuel. By  the late 1970s, most research reactors were using HEU fuel and the United  States was exporting about 700 kilograms of HEU a year to foreign  research reactors. Like the United States, the Soviet Union also exported  research reactors and the HEU fuel to operate them to other countries.", "In order to achieve the program\u2019s objective of reducing the use of HEU in  civilian research reactors, Argonne is developing new LEU fuels in  cooperation with counterparts in other countries, including Argentina,  France, and Russia. Developing LEU fuels involves testing fuel samples in  research reactors to determine how the fuels behave under normal  operating conditions. Fuel manufacturers and reactor operators around the  world participate in the program by manufacturing and testing LEU fuels.  Owners of foreign research reactors fund conversion of their reactors from  HEU to LEU. In 1993, Argonne expanded the reactor conversion program  to include cooperation with Russia on the conversion of Russian-supplied  research reactors to LEU fuel. The Soviet Union had independently  initiated a program in 1978 to reduce the enrichment of HEU fuel in  research reactors but suspended the program in 1989 due to lack of  funding. Russian-supplied research reactors use fuels manufactured in  Russia that are not interchangeable with fuels used by U.S.-supplied  research reactors. Therefore, DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program  differentiates between U.S.-supplied and Russian-supplied research  reactors.", "Since the reactor conversion program\u2019s inception in 1978, 39 of the 105  research reactors included in the program have either converted or are in  the process of converting to LEU fuel.

Of the remaining 66 research reactors that still use  HEU fuel, 35 can convert using currently available LEU fuels but have not  done so, and 31 cannot convert to any currently available LEU fuels and  still require HEU in order to conduct the research for which they were  designed (see fig. 2).", "A research reactor can begin the conversion process after a suitable LEU  fuel is developed and available commercially. The decision to convert from  HEU to LEU also depends on research reactor owners having the necessary  financial resources, including for the purchase of new fuel. In the United  States, NRC regulations require that research reactors under its  jurisdiction, including reactors operated by universities, convert to LEU  fuel when an LEU fuel that can be used to replace HEU fuel has been  developed and when federal funding is made available for the conversion.   The conversion process begins with analyses to determine whether the  reactor can safely convert and the impact of conversion on the reactor\u2019s  performance. After the analyses are completed and regulatory approval for  conversion is obtained, the operator can remove the HEU from the reactor  and replace it with the new LEU fuel. The HEU fuel can be disposed of  once it has been removed from the reactor core and has cooled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Domestic and Foreign Research Reactors Are Still Using Weapons-Usable Uranium Even Though They Could Operate on Low Enriched Uranium", "paragraphs": ["According to Argonne\u2019s analysis, conversion to LEU fuel is technically  feasible for 35 of the 66 research reactors worldwide that still use HEU  fuel.

DOE officials said  DOE has not provided the funding to convert the 6 remaining U.S.  university reactors. DOE recently added 2 other domestic reactors to the  reactor conversion program, and neither of these reactors currently has  plans to convert to LEU, also because DOE has not provided the necessary  funding.

Because the reactor  now uses LEU fuel and has no need for HEU, the reactor operator told us  that he is eager to return the HEU to DOE for long-term storage and  disposal. DOE has a separate program that supports university research  reactors, including provision of DOE-owned fuel, and funds their  conversion to LEU and removal of spent fuel. According to the DOE  official in charge of the university reactor support program, the program  has limited funding, and requests for additional funding to support  conversion have not been approved by the Office of Management and  Budget. Furthermore, the university reactor support program did not  receive additional funding to remove HEU fuel from the research reactor  that converted to LEU in 2000 until fiscal year 2004, after a group of  domestic research reactor operators successfully lobbied Congress to add  $2.5 million to the program\u2019s budget to pay for the removal of spent fuel  from the reactors.", "Officials at NRC, which regulates the 6 university reactors, told us that they  consider the conversion of the reactors to LEU, the timely removal of HEU  fuel after conversion, and the removal of HEU from the reactor that  converted to LEU in 2000 as a security enhancement and one of their  priorities. NRC officials said that converting the 6 reactors is technically  feasible and that the delay in converting the reactors is purely a matter of  funding and should be expedited by DOE. However, DOE officials said that  DOE had not made the conversion of these reactors a priority.  Furthermore, while operators at all 6 universities told us they are willing to  convert to LEU fuel, they said it is not a high priority because they do not  consider their HEU fuel to be a likely target for theft. For example, one  reactor operator explained that the reactor is structured in such a way that  the HEU is located inside a concrete enclosure that even experienced  reactor staff need almost 2 days to access. These 6 reactors use only a  small amount of HEU fuel\u2014less than a kilogram per year, which is not  enough to make a nuclear weapon. In contrast, there are other research  reactors included in DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program that are larger than  the 6 university reactors and use tens of kilograms per year.", "Nevertheless, operators of the 6 university research reactors said they  would convert to LEU when DOE provides funding. Furthermore, the DOE  official in charge of the university reactor support program said that  converting domestic university reactors is an issue of U.S. nonproliferation  policy. He said that converting domestic reactors to LEU would support  U.S. efforts to influence foreign reactors to convert to LEU in accordance  with the U.S. nonproliferation policy to reduce the use of HEU in civilian  research reactors worldwide. Although they did not consider conversion a  priority from a security perspective, two of the university reactor directors  we spoke with recognized the importance of converting university reactors  to LEU as part of U.S. nonproliferation policy.", "According to DOE officials, conversion for each reactor is projected to cost  between $5 million and $10 million. However, a project engineer at DOE\u2019s  Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory who tracks  DOE expenditures on conversions of U.S. university reactors had originally  told us that conversion would cost between $2 million and $4 million per  reactor, depending on the type of reactor. DOE could not provide  documentation to support either of the estimates. DOE officials said that  conversion costs for 4 of the university reactors are higher because their  fuel is no longer manufactured in the United States and must be purchased  in France.", "Other than funding, there are no significant obstacles to converting the 6  university reactors to LEU. Based on our visits to 3 converted university  research reactors and interviews with Argonne officials and the operators  of the 6 remaining university reactors, converting to LEU does not reduce  the performance of the reactors to the point that they cannot be used to  conduct research and train students effectively. Operators at 5 of the 6  university reactors still using HEU fuel told us they expected performance  to be adequate after conversion. In addition, operators of converted  reactors told us that using LEU instead of HEU reduced security concerns  and had a minimal impact on the cost of operating the reactors. Argonne  officials said that one of their objectives when providing technical  assistance to convert reactors to LEU is to complete the process with only  minimal effects on performance and operating costs. In fact, two reactor  operators (one in Rhode Island and one in Massachusetts) told us that  performance at their reactors had improved as a result of conversion.", "According to Argonne officials, 2 other reactors in the United States (the  DOE NRAD and General Electric NTR reactors) could convert to LEU but  are not currently planning to do so. The officials said they recently added  these 2 reactors to the scope of the reactor conversion program so that the  program would be comprehensive in its coverage of civilian research  reactors that use HEU. The NRAD research reactor is a DOE reactor, and  DOE would have to fund the purchase of new LEU fuel if a decision were  made to convert the reactor. According to a DOE official responsible for  the reactor, the budget for the NRAD reactor is limited, and purchasing new  LEU fuel to convert the reactor would take funding away from other  activities at the facility where the reactor is located. The DOE official  considers the conversion of this reactor a lower priority because it has a  sufficient supply of HEU fuel to last for the life of the reactor and because  the facility has other nuclear material that would be more attractive to  terrorists than the HEU fuel in the reactor. The General Electric NTR is a  privately owned reactor and is also not required to convert until DOE  provides funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Twenty Foreign Research Reactors Continue to Use Weapons-Usable Uranium Fuel", "paragraphs": ["Fourteen of the 20 foreign research reactors that currently use U.S.-origin  HEU fuel do not have plans to convert to LEU.

Three of the reactors are planning to convert to LEU,  and 3 others currently plan to shut down (or, in the case of 2 reactors,  convert to LEU fuel if they do not shut down). See table 2 for a list of the 20  reactors.", "Some of the foreign research reactors would like to convert but do not have  the necessary funding. For example, the operator of a research reactor in  Jamaica told us that converting to LEU would improve the reactor  performance but that purchasing LEU fuel for the reactor would cost $1.5  million, which is more than the reactor operator can afford. Therefore, the  reactor operator is planning to continue using its current supply of HEU,  which will last possibly 20 years. Similarly, according to Argonne officials,  the reactor operator in Mexico would be willing to convert to LEU but does  not have the necessary funding. While funding may not be an issue for  other foreign reactors, many of them are designed to operate on a small  amount of fuel meant to last for the life of the reactor. Converting to LEU  would require the disposal of the fuel that the reactor operator had already  purchased and is still usable. According to Argonne officials, operators of  certain reactors in France, Japan, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom  do not have plans to convert because the reactors have lifetime cores that  do not need to be replaced.", "To support the objective of the reactor conversion program to reduce and  eventually eliminate the use of HEU in research reactors, the United States  has implemented policies designed to influence foreign research reactors  to convert to LEU. For example, DOE\u2019s Foreign Research Reactor Spent  Nuclear Fuel Acceptance program provides foreign reactors that use HEU  fuel of U.S.-origin the opportunity to return their spent fuel to the United  States if they agree to convert their reactors to LEU fuel. In addition, the  Energy Policy Act of 1992 authorizes NRC to approve the export of HEU to  foreign research reactors only if the recipients agree to convert the  reactors once a suitable LEU fuel is developed. Since there are limited  suppliers of HEU fuel and few options for disposing of spent fuel, the U.S.  policies in support of the reactor conversion program have been effective  in influencing some research reactors to convert to LEU. In particular, of  the 20 foreign reactors that can convert to LEU but are still using HEU, the  2 that use the greatest amount of HEU per year are planning to convert by  2006. One research reactor in the Netherlands (HFR Petten) formally  agreed with the United States to convert to LEU in order to continue  receiving U.S.-origin HEU fuel until conversion could take place and to ship  spent fuel back to the United States. The U.S. policies in support of  conversion were effective in influencing the reactor operator because the  reactor uses 38 kilograms of HEU fuel per year and regularly needs to  obtain new HEU fuel and dispose of spent fuel. Similarly, the FRJ-2 reactor  in Germany has an agreement with DOE to convert to LEU fuel as a  condition of returning spent fuel to the United States.", "However, U.S. policies in support of the reactor conversion program do not  influence foreign reactors using so little HEU that they can operate for  many years without replacing their fuel or disposing of spent fuel. While  Argonne provides technical assistance for conversion, current DOE policy  precludes purchasing new LEU fuel for foreign reactors that use U.S.-origin  HEU fuel. Under this policy, purchasing new LEU fuel\u2014which, according  to a DOE project engineer, is the main cost of conversion\u2014is the  responsibility of the reactor operator. According to a DOE official, DOE has  paid for new LEU fuel only once, in Romania, in exchange for the return of  Russian-origin HEU fuel to Russia. DOE spent $4 million to purchase LEU  fuel for the Romanian reactor, which is still only partially converted and  requires more LEU fuel before conversion is complete. DOE officials said  that current DOE policy allows purchasing LEU fuel for research reactors  that use Russian-origin HEU fuel in exchange for returning the HEU to  Russia. However, DOE does not have a similar policy for research reactors  that use U.S.-origin HEU fuel.

Unlike many of the U.S.-supplied  research reactors that are not planning to convert because they have an  adequate supply of HEU, the Ukrainian reactor is running out of HEU fuel  and will have to place an order for new fuel by the end of 2004. The reactor  operators told us they support conversion to LEU fuel because the negative  impact on the reactor\u2019s performance will be tolerable, the operating costs  will be about the same after conversion to LEU, and converting to LEU  would eliminate the threat that HEU could be stolen from the facility. The  reactor operators are scheduled to complete the safety analysis in  November 2004 and then submit an application to obtain approval for  conversion from the Ukrainian nuclear regulatory authority. However,  Argonne officials said the schedule for converting the Ukrainian reactor is  ambitious and conversion of the reactor could be delayed. According to  Argonne officials, if the Ukrainian reactor does not get regulatory approval  for conversion to LEU before it runs out of fuel, it may decide to place an  order with the Russian supplier for more HEU fuel instead.", "According to DOE officials, 5 other Russian-supplied reactors that can use  LEU fuel are likely to convert. Conversion of the reactors in Bulgaria and  Libya depends on the commercialization of the Russian-origin LEU fuel,  which DOE expects to take place in 2004. DOE has also engaged in  discussions on conversion with the operators of the research reactor in  Vietnam. According to Argonne officials, conversion of the research  reactor in Hungary requires at least several more years of analysis. In  particular, the reactor must test an LEU fuel sample before the Hungarian  government approves conversion, and this process will take several years.

First, according to Argonne officials, the same problems  have been encountered in separate tests and under different operating  conditions in reactors in the United States, Belgium, France, and Russia.  Second, the problems were unexpected and worse than encountered in  previous LEU fuel development efforts.

Argonne officials said they began developing  monolithic fuel relatively recently, in 2000, and to date have conducted only  one test. Additional testing could reveal problems that have not yet  surfaced. Furthermore, this fuel requires development of a new  manufacturing method because the methods used to manufacture other  research reactor fuels are not suitable for monolithic fuel. Argonne is  conducting research on different manufacturing options but has not yet  demonstrated that monolithic fuel can be manufactured on a large scale.  Three reactor operators hoping to convert to this fuel told us it is  impossible to predict whether the new LEU fuel will be successfully  developed and that creating a reliable LEU fuel could take many years  more than expected.", "Development of monolithic fuel may be delayed if Argonne encounters any  problems in the fuel development process.

In contrast, a new German reactor at the Technical University Munich  designed to use HEU (the FRM-II reactor) may still not be able to convert  to LEU even if Argonne is successful in developing monolithic fuel. The  reactor operator has agreed to convert to a lower enrichment of HEU that  is less usable in nuclear weapons.

With assistance from the reactor conversion program, one reactor in  Argentina used for the production of medical isotopes converted from HEU  to LEU in 2003. However, Argonne officials said the conversion was  feasible only because the reactor produces medical isotopes on a small  scale, using a relatively small amount of material in the production process.  (Prior to converting to LEU, the Argentine reactor used less than a  kilogram of HEU per year. In contrast, four large medical isotope producers  targeted by the reactor conversion program, located in Belgium, Canada,  the Netherlands, and South Africa, each use as much as 25 kilograms of  HEU per year.)  Argonne is still working to overcome problems with using  LEU that limit the ability of the Argentine reactor to increase its production  capacity.", "Argonne officials said they are 2 to 3 years away from completing work that  would allow the large medical isotope producers to convert from HEU to  LEU. Argonne officials said they have developed LEU materials that can be  used by all medical isotope producers and only the adaptation of the  production processes from using HEU to LEU remains. They said that  adapting the medical isotope producers\u2019 processes, each of which is unique  in some aspect, is technically feasible and is just a matter of time. One  reason why the production processes must be modified is that almost five  times more LEU than HEU is required to produce the same amount of  medical isotopes. The increased amount of nuclear material creates  obstacles to conversion. For example, using LEU would produce more  waste, which in turn could increase the burden of treating and storing the  waste.  In addition, the facilities, chemical processes, and waste  management systems for producing medical isotopes are customized to use  HEU and would require modifications to accommodate LEU.", "In discussions with the two large medical isotope producers in Belgium and  Canada, both cited a number of factors that would make conversion to LEU  costly and difficult, including the fivefold increase in the amount of LEU  that would be required to achieve the same level of output when using  HEU. As part of its technical analysis, the Canadian producer is currently  conducting an assessment of converting to LEU to determine whether  conversion would be economically feasible. The Canadian producer  currently uses U.S.-origin HEU and, under U.S. law, must agree to convert  to LEU when a suitable LEU alternative is developed. (The other three  large medical isotope producers currently receive their HEU from  countries other than the United States and are therefore not subject to U.S.  requirements to convert to LEU.)  U.S. law also allows for an exception to  the requirement to convert to LEU if conversion would result in a large  percentage increase in operating costs. Officials at DOE and NRC, which  implements the law governing U.S. HEU exports, acknowledge that  medical isotope producers operate on small profit margins, and as a result,  the cost of converting to LEU may be prohibitive.

Many of the research reactors that could use currently available  LEU fuels have not converted because they lack incentives, funding, or  both. Until recently, the policy of DOE\u2019s reactor conversion program has  been to provide technical assistance to support conversion of research  reactors to LEU but not to pay for conversion or, in particular, purchase  new LEU fuel. In the case of six U.S. university reactors, DOE has not made  purchasing LEU fuel for conversion (and completing the conversion  process at another reactor by removing HEU fuel and shipping it to a DOE  facility for disposal) a high priority. While many of the U.S. reactors that  could convert to LEU use only a small amount of HEU per year, converting  them would demonstrate DOE\u2019s commitment to the nonproliferation  objective of the reactor conversion program.", "DOE has generally expected the operators of foreign research reactors that  use U.S.-origin HEU fuel to purchase new LEU fuel with their own funds.

Without funding for conversion, it is possible  these reactors could continue using HEU for years. DOE may need to  consider offering additional incentives to foreign reactors, including  purchasing new LEU fuel, to influence them to convert to LEU.", "Regardless of progress in converting domestic and foreign research  reactors to LEU in the near term, delays in completing the development of  new LEU fuels mean that other research reactors will continue to use HEU  until at least 2010. If the reactor conversion program experiences  additional problems in one or both of the two LEU fuels currently under  development, some research reactors could be left without a viable option  for conversion to LEU.
