GAO selected states that had various levels of experience with these strategies. Specifically, as a condition of receiving funding, federal agencies require state plans under WIOA to include career pathways strategies, which align education, job training, and support services to help job seekers obtain employment. These plans must also include sector partnership strategies, which help employers in an industry address shared goals and hiring needs. In addition, states are required to establish regions, which may be made up of multiple local workforce areas. According to the Department of Labor (DOL), these regions are intended in part to align workforce activities with regional economies. To address these requirements, officials in each of the five states reported:", "Building on prior experience to enhance career pathways, sector partnerships, or both strategies . For example, Pennsylvania's state plan proposes building on over 10 years of experience with sector partnerships by increasing technical assistance for them and exploring the development of a certification program for these partnerships.", "Increasing the involvement of stakeholders, which uncovered ways to enhance services in most selected states . For example, Ohio officials said they involved the state agency that oversees employment services for individuals with disabilities and advocates for these individuals in planning efforts for the first time, which led them to provide training on disability awareness for staff at all local workforce centers.", "Using multiple sources of labor market information, which helped better align career pathways strategies with employer needs in some selected states . For example, Colorado officials said they asked employers to review projected worker shortages in the medical industry over the next 10 years, and employers said they would need more workers over a shorter period of time. Officials used this information to focus their career pathways strategies on preparing individuals to eventually fill the jobs that were projected to have worker shortages.", "Officials in four of the states GAO selected reported facing challenges establishing regions due to local areas' concerns, which they addressed by revising regional boundaries or increasing the number of regions and by providing incentives for regional collaboration or innovation. In three states, officials said they revised their regions in response to local concerns. For example, California officials said they redrew regional boundaries after a local area requested that it be assigned to a different region based on commuting patterns, among other factors. In addition, to encourage regional collaboration or innovation, officials in four states reported providing financial incentives. For example, a Kentucky official said the state is using a private grant to fund regional efforts to develop career pathways and sector partnership strategies.

This is a change  from WIA, which permitted but did not require regional planning. Under  WIOA, states must designate local workforce areas, draw regional  boundaries, and assign local areas to these regions. In practice, states  need to designate local areas before they can assign them to regions. If  local areas dispute their local area designations, they may appeal them to  the state board, and if the state board denies the appeal, they may appeal  to DOL. In assigning local areas to regions, states are required to consult  local officials and consider labor market and economic development  areas.

In contrast, each of the states had  less prior experience with regional planning. Colorado officials said they  began implementing sector partnerships in 2005 and have incorporated  lessons learned over time, including ensuring that these partnerships are  led by the business community. Under WIOA, Colorado officials plan to  expand and enhance their network of business-led sector partnerships.  They also plan to use these partnerships to help design career pathways  programs by identifying the knowledge, skills, and abilities that employers  are seeking for in-demand jobs. Similarly, Pennsylvania\u2019s state plan  proposes building on over 10 years of experience with sector partnerships  by increasing technical assistance and seeking additional funding for  these partnerships, and exploring the development of a certification  program for such partnerships. In Ohio, officials also said they plan to  further develop their existing sector partnership efforts, including  identifying and disseminating best practices from six pilot partnerships  that they funded with grants in 2014. They also plan to implement two  new career pathways initiatives: an initiative to encourage greater  enrollment of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)  participants in employment and training services, and a new wage  pathway model that provides an alternative to the traditional career  pathway model. According to Ohio officials, this wage pathway model  provides low-income, low-skill youth who are not yet ready to enter a  career pathway program with on-the-job skills training and supportive  services to help them make a successful transition to a career pathway  program and obtain an in-demand occupation.", "Officials in four of the five states said their previous state plans under WIA  served as the foundation for their WIOA plans because the new law  supported their existing strategies. For example, California officials said  that WIOA\u2019s shift in emphasis from matching job seekers with open  positions to helping job seekers increase their skills and education aligns  with the state board\u2019s efforts to promote these goals in California over the last five years. Similarly, Ohio officials told us that some of their efforts to  reform their workforce system over the last several years have  emphasized the development and expansion of career pathways and  sector partnerships, which aligns with WIOA\u2019s emphasis on these  strategies.", "In contrast to career pathways and sector partnerships, officials in only  three of the five states reported they had some prior experience with  regional planning. In California, Colorado, and Ohio, officials said they  had some type of regional structure in place prior to the enactment of  WIOA, while officials in Kentucky and Pennsylvania said they were  relatively new to regional planning. Overall, officials in each of the five  states said they had less prior experience with regional planning than with  career pathways or sector partnership strategies, and told us that they  have made or will make major changes to implement new regional  requirements under WIOA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Selected States Reported That Greater Stakeholder Involvement Increased Awareness across Programs or Uncovered Opportunities to Enhance Services", "paragraphs": ["In each of the five selected states, officials reported involving a wide  range of stakeholders in enhancing or developing career pathways,  sector partnerships, or regional planning strategies, and sought their input  in various ways. For example, officials said they included stakeholders  such as state agencies overseeing core programs, state agencies  overseeing other partner programs, local workforce boards, community  colleges, business and industry representatives, labor organizations, and  community-based organizations. According to officials, state workforce  boards sought input from stakeholders in various ways, such as  organizing cross-program or issue area planning committees or  discussion groups, holding statewide or regional meetings, and  conducting focus groups or surveys.", "Compared to past planning efforts, each of the five states reported that  they have increased stakeholder involvement in WIOA planning by  engaging existing stakeholders to a greater extent, and four of the five  states also reported involving new stakeholders. Each of the five states  included the six core programs in their plans, as required by WIOA, and  four states developed combined plans that also included other partner  programs (see table 2). According to state officials, some of these core  or other partner programs were involved in previous workforce planning efforts but had greater involvement in the WIOA planning process, while  others were new stakeholders under WIOA. For example, officials in two  states said they involved the state agency overseeing the Vocational  Rehabilitation program to a greater extent under WIOA, and officials in  the other three states said that the WIOA planning process was the first  time they involved this agency in workforce planning efforts.", "Beyond the core and other partner programs included in the state plan,  officials in four of the five states reported involving other new  stakeholders in WIOA planning. While they varied by state, these new  stakeholders included state agencies such as Kentucky Adult Education  and the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in California, as  well as organizations representing particular interests, such as a local  chapter of the National Skills Coalition in Colorado and an initiative  supporting better jobs for individuals with disabilities in Ohio. In addition,  these new stakeholders included new members of the state workforce  development board. For example, in Colorado, officials said they sought  new board members with expertise in a variety of areas, including youth  and disability issues. In Kentucky, officials told us they focused on  identifying new members who could represent the interests of the  business community, and that these new members have helped to design  career pathways by sharing their knowledge about the skills and  certifications needed for in-demand jobs.", "Officials in two of the five states reported that this increased involvement  from stakeholders enhanced awareness about the roles and services of  other related programs. For example, California officials said that through  the WIOA planning process, state agencies have exchanged detailed  information about their programs, including eligibility requirements, the  types of services they provide, and how they deliver these services. In  Colorado, officials similarly reported that greater stakeholder involvement  led to increased awareness across programs and cross-training of staff.  Specifically, officials said they cross-trained more than 1,000 staff from a  variety of programs on the eligibility requirements for and services  provided by other programs to which they refer job seekers, including the  core and other partner programs in the state plan, as well as the  unemployment insurance program and career and technical education  programs, among others.", "In addition, officials in four of the five states\u2014California, Colorado,  Kentucky, and Ohio\u2014reported that involving new stakeholders in the  planning process uncovered opportunities to better serve individuals with  barriers to employment. In Ohio, officials said they involved the state  agency that oversees the Vocational Rehabilitation program and  advocates for individuals with disabilities in planning efforts for the first  time, which helped identify opportunities to better serve these individuals  through the workforce system. For example, these officials said that  including these stakeholders led them to train staff at all of their one-stop  centers on disability awareness. In addition, a Colorado official told us  that involving new stakeholders in the planning process led workforce  programs to assess their efforts to conduct outreach and provide services  to homeless individuals.", "Overall, officials in each of the five states reported that the WIOA  planning process reinforced important lessons from past planning efforts  about when and how to obtain stakeholder input. For example, Kentucky  officials noted the importance of having all stakeholders\u2014including the  business community\u2014provide input into the planning process from the  very beginning. Similarly, Colorado officials said they used a transparent  planning process that involved county commissioners, local workforce  boards, and the business community to ensure buy-in and support for the  state plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Selected States Reported That Supplementing Traditional Labor Market Information Better Aligned Strategies with Employer Needs and Helped Define Regions", "paragraphs": ["Each of the five selected states consulted multiple sources of labor  market information (LMI), which helped officials in some states better  align career pathways strategies with employer needs, and helped  officials in all five states draw regional boundaries and assign local  workforce areas to those proposed regions. Specifically, each of the five  states reported they supplemented the traditional LMI provided by the  state LMI office with real-time LMI, and three of them\u2014Colorado,  Kentucky, and Ohio\u2014reported validating this information with employers  to confirm its accuracy as they developed their state plans. In these  three states, officials said that validating this information with employers  helped better align their career pathways strategies with employers\u2019  needs. In Colorado, officials said one example is that when they asked  employers to review projections that the state would experience a  shortage of workers in the medical industry over the next 10 years,  employers said they actually would need more workers over a shorter  time period. Officials then used this information to focus their career  pathways strategies on preparing individuals to fill the jobs projected to  have worker shortages by identifying entry-level jobs that could eventually  lead to these higher-level jobs. In Ohio, officials said they surveyed  employers to identify their most urgent workforce needs and incorporated  this information into a searchable online database of in-demand jobs that  guided their planning. According to officials, this information from  employers helped better align career pathways strategies with employers\u2019  needs for workers with certain credentials or certificates.", "In each of the five selected states, officials told us they also used multiple  sources of LMI to help draw the proposed boundaries of the new regions  required under WIOA. Specifically, officials in each of the states said they  considered labor market and economic development areas, as required  by WIOA, in addition to a variety of other factors. These factors included  the locations of key industries, commuting patterns, local workforce areas\u2019  existing partnerships across local area boundaries, and where population  centers were located."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Five States Reported They Intend Their State Plans to Provide a High- Level Vision that Allows Flexibility in Responding to Regional and Local Needs", "paragraphs": ["Officials in each of the five states told us that they intend their state plans  to provide a high-level vision that allows regions and local areas the  flexibility to develop workforce strategies that respond to specific regional  and local needs. For example, Colorado officials said they intend their  state plan to provide a framework for regional and local entities as they  develop career pathways strategies that are driven by the needs of  regional industries. The state plan references Colorado\u2019s step-by-step  guide for building regional career pathways systems, including goals,  outcomes, and the roles of different partners. Similarly, California officials  described their plan as a broad conceptual framework for building  regional and local partnerships rather than an operations manual. The  plan requires regions to develop customized \u201cregional sector pathway\u201d  programs, which are career pathways programs that help job seekers  attain postsecondary credentials that are valued by employers and  aligned with regional workforce needs.", "To implement their state plans, officials in each of the five states said they  have developed, are developing, or plan to develop guidance for regional  and local planning, including guidance on implementing career pathways  and sector partnerships. For example, in September 2016, California  issued guidance for developing regional and local plans which sets the  state\u2019s policy direction for these plans and clarifies the purpose of the  regional plan as compared to the local plan. According to the guidance,  the primary purpose of regional plans is to develop regional sector  pathway programs, while the primary purpose of local plans is to facilitate  job seekers\u2019 access to local services that lead to regional sector pathway  programs. The state plans to provide additional guidance and technical  assistance materials about model regional and local partnerships,  including best practices, as local officials develop and implement these  plans. In two states, officials told us that regional and local plans were  due by June 2016, and in the other three states, officials said they expect  regions and local areas to submit these plans by spring 2017.  Furthermore, officials in all five states said they expect regional or local  plans to address how funding could be shared across programs to  implement career pathways and sector partnership strategies, although  they acknowledged that these decisions will involve further discussions  between state and local partners. Officials in three states said they did not  address cost-sharing issues in their state plans because they believed  that the state plan was not the right vehicle for addressing these issues or  because they did not have sufficient time to make these decisions prior to  the submission deadline."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Reported Addressing Challenges in Designating Regions and Creating Incentives for Regional Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Officials in the selected states reported facing challenges establishing  regions, which they addressed by revising their regional boundaries or  increasing the number of regions and by providing incentives for future  regional collaboration or innovation. As previously noted, a change under  WIOA is that states are required to establish regions, which may be made  up of multiple local workforce areas that are to work together to develop  regional workforce plans. According to DOL, the purpose of these  regions is to align workforce development activities and resources with  larger regional economic development areas and available resources in  order to provide coordinated and efficient services to both job seekers  and employers. In addition, DOL stated that regional partnerships better  support the implementation of sector partnership and career pathways  strategies, and may also lower costs and increase the effectiveness of  service delivery through greater coordination. As previously noted,  officials in each of the five selected states reported that they have made  or will make major changes to implement these new regional  requirements under WIOA, even though three of the states had some  prior experience with regional planning.", "To draw proposed regional boundaries and assign local workforce areas  to these regions, officials in the five selected states said they reviewed  multiple sources of LMI and also consulted with local officials. For  example, California officials told us that they developed a draft regional  map in consultation with local workforce boards and state workforce  associations. Officials in Colorado and Ohio said they considered dividing  some local workforce areas into multiple regions in order to reflect  regional labor markets or existing economic development regions.  Colorado proposed this approach in its initial state plan. Specifically,  Colorado officials told us they proposed dividing a large local area that  covers most of the state into four different regions to align with regional  economies. However, state officials said that when DOL conducted an  early review of their state plan during the public comment period before  they officially submitted it, DOL officials advised them that they could not  divide a single local area into multiple regions. (For Colorado\u2019s initial and  final regional maps, see appendix II.) DOL\u2019s final regulations also reflect  this interpretation of WIOA in that they require regions to consist of one or  more local areas. DOL officials explained that if local areas were divided  into multiple regions, they would be required to participate in multiple  regional planning efforts, which could be burdensome. Given that local  areas cannot be split between regions, officials noted the importance of  drawing local area boundaries in order to align them with regional  economies, although they acknowledged that this can be challenging due  to historical and political factors. For example, some local officials may be  reluctant to change local area boundaries that have been in place for  many years.", "Despite their efforts to consult local officials when developing proposed  regions, officials in four states said they faced challenges due to local  workforce areas\u2019 concerns about becoming part of a region, including  questions about funding and the possibility that regional priorities could  differ from local priorities. As a result, in three states officials told us they  revised regional boundaries or increased the number of regions in  response to feedback or appeals from local areas. For example, in  California, after the state board received and granted appeals from two  local areas, officials told us they made minor changes to regional  boundaries. Officials said that one local area requested it be assigned to  a different region due to commuting patterns and its existing relationships  with community colleges. Similarly, Colorado officials said that successful  state-level appeals from two local areas led them to revise regional  boundaries and create two new regions. In addition, Ohio officials told  us their initial draft plan included five regions but they ultimately  designated 10 regions after a local area successfully appealed its local  area designation to DOL, and the federal agencies issued final  regulations, both of which affected the overall regional configuration.", "In three of the five states, the next step in their regional planning process  is for regions and local areas to develop workforce plans. DOL and  Education officials said they are aware that states have faced challenges  designating regions, and plan to provide states with technical assistance  on implementing other WIOA regional planning requirements. In  addition, the agencies have developed the Innovation and Opportunity  Network, an online community of practice through which they can  facilitate technical assistance, information sharing, and training to help  states, regions, and local areas implement WIOA.", "To help ensure that regional planning efforts continue to progress,  officials in four of the five states reported that their states are providing  incentives for collaboration or innovation at the regional level. For  example, California officials said the state is using a portion of the  governor\u2019s discretionary WIOA funding to support the SlingShot initiative,  which aims to build the regional coordination and leadership necessary  for effective regional planning. This initiative supports collaborative  efforts by a broad range of stakeholders within a region to identify and  then work to solve employment challenges. California is also using  discretionary funding to support the Workforce Accelerator Fund initiative,  which aims to better align existing programs to accelerate employment  outcomes for populations with barriers to employment. In Kentucky,  officials said the state is supporting regional collaboration and innovation  by using the governor\u2019s discretionary funding to encourage the  development of regional sector partnerships.

In addition, we reviewed information  from two National Skills Coalition reports on sector partnerships and state  plans. All five selected states were mentioned in at least one of these  reports.", "In the selected states, we interviewed officials including the executive  leadership of the state workforce development board, state board  members, and state agency officials\u2014such as officials from the state  workforce, human services, or education agency\u2014who were involved in  developing the state plan. The information we obtained from state officials  provides in-depth examples but is not generalizable to all states.", "In order to gather further information on their planned strategies and  corroborate information from interviews, we reviewed the plans submitted  by these five states to DOL and Education and other relevant  documentation, such as documents summarizing the state planning  process, state board meeting minutes and agendas, state guidance for  local workforce areas, and other reports or materials produced by the  state board. After reviewing and analyzing information from the states, we  asked the state officials we interviewed to review relevant portions of the  draft report for accuracy.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2015 to November  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
