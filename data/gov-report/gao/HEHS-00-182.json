A Medicare-certified hospice provides physician services, nursing care, physical and occupational therapy, home health aide services, medical supplies and equipment, and short-term inpatient hospital care for pain control and symptom management. In addition, the hospice benefit provides coverage for several services not generally available under the regular fee-for-service Medicare benefit. These include outpatient prescription drugs for treating pain and other symptoms of the terminal illness, homemaker services, short-term inpatient respite care, and bereavement counseling for the patient\u2019s family.", "Patients may receive services from freestanding hospice providers or from a hospice program based in a home health agency, hospital, or skilled nursing facility. For each day a beneficiary is enrolled, the hospice provider is paid an all-inclusive, prospectively determined rate, depending on the level of hospice care provided (routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite, or general inpatient care).Initial payment rates were based on cost data reported by 26 hospice programs that participated in Medicare\u2019s hospice demonstration project from 1980 to 1982.Since 1993, these rates have been updated by an annual statutory adjustment factor tied to inflation in the hospital market basket (a measure of the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals nationwide).", "Eligibility for hospice services requires that the beneficiary\u2019s physician and the hospice medical director (or other physician affiliated with the hospice) certify that the individual\u2019s prognosis is for a life expectancy of 6 months or less, if the terminal illness runs its normal course. Beneficiaries who elect hospice must waive all other Medicare coverage of care related to their terminal illness, although they retain coverage for services unrelated to their terminal illness. A beneficiary can cancel his or her election of hospice benefits at any time and return to regular Medicare, and beneficiaries are free to reselect hospice coverage at a later date. While there are currently no limits on the number of days an individual can receive hospice care, a beneficiary\u2019s prognosis must be reaffirmed at 90 days, at 180 days, and every 60 days thereafter.", "The hospice eligibility requirement that a beneficiary be certified as having a prognosis of 6 months or less has been an ongoing concern expressed by advocates and providers. The requirement has been challenged as difficult to implement and a deterrent to hospice referrals, especially for beneficiaries with noncancer diagnoses. Research suggests that it can be difficult for physicians to accurately predict whether a patient is likely to die within 6 months.It is particularly difficult to estimate life expectancy for persons with noncancer diagnoses because the course of their disease is likely to be erratic.For example, patients with heart disease are more likely to die suddenly than persons with cancer, who commonly have a period of steady decline before death. Similarly, very elderly people in frail health or with certain chronic illnesses may experience long periods of declining health punctuated by several medical crises\u2014any one of which can be fatal. In such cases, physicians may find it difficult to justify a hospice referral for beneficiaries who appear to be relatively stable, and, as a result, the physicians may delay initiation of hospice services until a medical crisis occurs shortly before death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Number of Beneficiaries Using Hospice Has Grown as Average Days Used Have Declined", "paragraphs": ["From 1992 to 1998, the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolling in hospice more than doubled, with growth in all population subgroups and in all states.

Thus, hospice users today are similar to users in 1992; the distribution of enrollees by race has not changed (89 percent are white), and the proportion of enrollees who are women has climbed only slightly (from 50 to 54 percent).

For example, 20 percent of white Medicare beneficiaries who died in 1998 elected hospice services, compared with 15 percent of black beneficiaries who died that year.

However, the use of hospice services is even more common among persons with other types of cancer; roughly 75 percent of people age 65 and older who died from brain or liver cancer in 1997 used hospice services before death.

However, research has shown that many physicians are poorly trained in the care of the dying and are often uncomfortable discussing options for end-of-life care or the cessation of curative treatment.A recent review of 50 top-selling textbooks from several medical specialties found that most provided inadequate information on end-of-life issues, with oncology textbooks among those particularly likely to provide no information about key aspects of end-of-life care.Physician referral to hospice may be limited by other factors, as well. For example, experts in the area of palliative care, as well as the research literature, suggest that some physicians may not be aware that they can continue to provide services after a beneficiary has entered hospice and may delay referral out of concern about losing control of the patient\u2019s care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patient Choice and Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["The use of hospice services by Medicare beneficiaries requires not just awareness of the benefit and a physician\u2019s certification of prognosis but also acceptance that death is the outcome of their illness and the choice by beneficiaries to give up a portion of their standard Medicare benefits in order to receive hospice care. Once enrolled, no other services related to a patient\u2019s terminal condition are covered under Medicare. HCFA officials and others also noted that improvements in cancer care and the addition of new treatment options may be prompting some beneficiaries to pursue new curative options until very shortly before death, thus contributing to the trend of shorter hospice stays. Other beneficiaries may favor continuing aggressive, life-extending treatments up until the time of death and not enter hospice at all. According to HCFA officials, it may be that some terminal patients do not want hospice care, and that should be their right.", "Research suggests that beneficiaries who do not consider hospice care may be unwilling to confront the terminal nature of their illness, may not know that the alternative exists, or may misunderstand the services available through hospice care. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) noted that patients are influenced by the general unwillingness to accept limits of all types, including those of aging and death.A Gallup poll in 1996 found that although a majority of people expressed interest in hospice care, most also said that they would still seek curative care.", "In some cases, a beneficiary\u2019s circumstances may complicate hospice enrollment. Hospice is designed to allow the beneficiary to remain at home during his or her last few weeks of life, where family and friends are expected to deliver most of the routine day-to-day care. Hospice staff offer more specialized care and respite care to give family members a break when they need one.

Furthermore, the use of hospice services has increased most rapidly among beneficiaries with diagnoses other than cancer\u2014those for whom arriving at a 6-month prognosis may be more difficult.", "In 1995 and 1996, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigated the eligibility status of Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services as part of a larger investigation of fraud and abuse in Medicare. Specifically, OIG reviewed the admission decisions made for hospice patients with very long stays at 12 hospices in four states; it found that many of these patients did not meet eligibility criteria upon admission to hospice. OIG followed this effort with other reviews of beneficiary eligibility, encompassing a larger sample of hospices, and found that the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services were eligible for such services.", "Patient advocacy groups and the hospice industry assert that this federal scrutiny of compliance with the 6-month eligibility rule has had a chilling effect on entry into hospice for noncancer beneficiaries, for whom it may be more difficult to establish a 6-month prognosis with confidence. They contend that hospice providers are more cautious about admitting beneficiaries with noncancer diagnoses as a result, leading to delays in hospice entry for persons wishing to use the benefit. Although the percentage increase in beneficiaries electing hospice slowed somewhat from 1995 through 1998 compared with the prior period, it is difficult to know what portion of this slower growth is attributable to the effect of federal scrutiny and what portion is attributable to other factors, such as the larger base of beneficiaries already using hospice.", "The OIG scrutiny of beneficiary eligibility may have contributed to later hospice entry for some beneficiaries, to the extent that hospice providers responded to the oversight with greater caution about beneficiary eligibility. However, the trend toward fewer days of hospice use began before the period of federal scrutiny. As shown in figure 4, the average length of service for both cancer and noncancer hospice users peaked by 1994, before scrutiny of the hospice benefit increased. Furthermore, physician groups we spoke with did not cite caution among hospice providers about beneficiary eligibility as a primary barrier to the initiation of hospice services for their patients. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, barriers to timely hospice care for cancer patients include the attitudes of physicians and patients toward death and reluctance to talk about death until the very end of life.", "While the OIG reviews were under way, the National Hospice Organization developed guidelines to assist physicians and hospices in determining a 6- month prognosis for patients with selected noncancer diagnoses. These included amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), heart disease, pulmonary disease, liver disease, stroke and coma, and kidney disease. In order to enhance accuracy and uniformity in the claims review process, HCFA distributed these guidelines to the intermediaries that process hospice claims for Medicare to use in assessing compliance with benefit requirements.The intermediaries have since adopted these guidelines as formal local medical review policies.", "Concerns have been raised that using these guidelines as a standardized basis for determining Medicare hospice eligibility limits access to hospice, particularly for patients with noncancer diagnoses. Industry representatives assert that the guidelines require further development to improve prognostic confidence and accuracy before they would be appropriate as formal medical review policies.", "However, intermediaries point out that while medical review policies specify clinical criteria for establishing a patient\u2019s 6-month prognosis, they allow for variation in individual cases. For example, one intermediary\u2019s medical review policy for heart disease notes that \u201csome patients may not meet the criteria, yet still be appropriate for hospice care, because of other comorbidities or rapid decline.\u201d According to Medicare program guidance to all hospices, the fact that a hospice patient lives beyond 6 months does not, by itself, constitute grounds for a determination that the patient was never eligible for hospice care or that Medicare does not cover services provided to the patient. Typically, if a question is raised as to whether a patient is terminally ill, the intermediary asks the hospice to furnish information necessary to affirm the patient\u2019s prognosis. The rates of medical reviews of claims began increasing in 1995, at HCFA\u2019s direction.Four of the five intermediaries reported that, by 1999, review rates ranged from 0.8 to 4.2 percent of all hospice claims processed.", "Nearly all the hospice providers we spoke with said they consult their intermediaries\u2019 medical review policies as part of the admission screening process.

We excluded beneficiaries from our analysis if total payment for a beneficiary was less than $75 or was $1 million or more, if a beneficiary at the time of a first hospice claim was younger than 20 or older than 110, or if a beneficiary\u2019s residence was not in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia.", "Our analysis of beneficiary use includes information on age at the time of entry into hospice (younger than 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, 85 and older), gender, race and ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, and other), state of residence, enrollment in managed care or fee-for-service Medicare (based on status in the month of death, from the HCFA denominator file), and primary diagnosis (three-digit International Classification of Disease code).", "Analysis of the beneficiary claims data showed that 98 percent of beneficiaries had only one hospice provider, and 97 percent had only one diagnosis code. Therefore, we conducted all further analysis on the basis of the provider and diagnosis listed in the first hospice claim for each beneficiary. We calculated the period of enrollment by summing the number of days covered by each claim, even if they covered discontinuous periods of service, and excluded duplicate claims.Because records of hospice use are not complete for beneficiaries who entered hospice during the later years of our study period, we adjusted the claimed days of hospice service for 1996 to 1998 to better account for beneficiaries with very long stays.Our adjustment factor was calculated from 1992-95 data on the proportion of total beneficiary claim days accounted for within the first 2 calendar years of hospice use.", "We also described hospice use rates among different groups of Medicare decedents. To calculate the rate of hospice use, we identified the number of Medicare decedents each calendar year who had used hospice before death. We used the HCFA Denominator File to identify all Medicare decedents belonging to each demographic group in our analysis.Because the HCFA Denominator File does not contain information about beneficiary diagnosis, we used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mortality data to determine the number of deaths among people aged 65 and older.", "We used annual Medicare Provider of Service Files to identify hospice characteristics. These files contain data on provider certification and status, such as facility and service characteristics, provider type, and location. We included hospices that received total Medicare payments of $75 or more during our study period. The provider identification number from the first hospice claim for each beneficiary was matched with the Provider of Service file data available for that provider. We characterized providers by type of control (profit, not-for-profit, or government), affiliation (freestanding, hospital-based, home health agency, and skilled state, urban or rural location, and number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving services from each hospice each year (small defined as fewer than 100 beneficiaries, medium defined as 100 to 499 beneficiaries, and large defined as 500 or more beneficiaries)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Health Care Financing Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
