However, VAMCs experienced problems\u2014such as lack of data resources and difficulties with training\u2014in both the development and execution of their staffing plans. Some VAMC staff reported improvements in the adequacy and qualifications of their units' nursing staff when nurse staffing plan initiatives were executed. For example, at two VAMCs where the number of nurses was increased or where support services for nurses were put in place, such as a designated group of staff to assist in transporting patients to and from appointments off the unit, unit staff said the adequacy of the nursing staff had improved. However, some VAMC unit staff reported that unit nurse staffing continued to be inadequate and that nurse unit assignments and job duties were not always appropriate for their qualifications.", "VHA's oversight is limited for ensuring its nurse staffing methodology is implemented and administered appropriately.

The need for a new  nurse staffing policy was highlighted in 2004 when VA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General (OIG) issued a report raising concerns about the  adequacy of nurse staffing levels in VAMCs\u2019 inpatient units. By 2008,  however, no national policy on nurse staffing had been implemented. In  October 2008, we issued a report raising concerns about the adequacy of  nurse staffing, specifically for registered nurses (RN) in inpatient units,  and the need to expeditiously proceed with developing and implementing  a new nurse staffing system, among other issues. We recommended  that VHA develop a detailed plan for implementing a new nurse staffing  system and ensure it provided accurate nurse staffing estimates. In part  to address these concerns, in 2010, VHA issued a directive requiring  each VAMC to implement a nationally standardized methodology for  determining an adequate and qualified nurse workforce, which includes  the development and execution of nurse staffing plans. The staffing plans  outline initiatives needed to ensure appropriate nurse staffing levels and  skill mix in units to support high-quality patient care in the most effective  manner possible.

Some VAMCs\u2019 staffing methodology coordinators developed  specific processes designed to decrease the burden on nursing staff  and improve efficiency.

The staff said  sitters were able to monitor patients more closely, and as a result,  patients were less likely to fall during walks to the bathroom, for example.  Similarly, nursing staff in a mental health unit at another VAMC said that  by having more staff they had decreased their restraint use because there  were more staff available to meet veterans\u2019 needs.

For six of the  VAMCs in our review, staff from at least one unit interviewed said their  unit staffing levels were inadequate. Staff said ensuring adequate staffing  was particularly challenging when there were unplanned staff absences  and they had to \u201cscramble\u201d to provide coverage. Some unit staff noted  that this situation often resulted in units forcing nurses to work overtime or  nurses floating to other units where they did not always have the  qualifications to provide care. At some VAMCs, staff said there were  increased staff injuries due to inadequate staffing. Furthermore, staff at  one VAMC reported that where there had not been any changes made  based on the unit staffing plans, their units continued to be understaffed  to the detriment of both patient care and their job satisfaction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA\u2019s Oversight to Ensure Its Nurse Staffing Methodology Is Implemented, Administered Appropriately, and Contributes to an Adequate and Qualified Nurse Workforce Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Our review of VHA\u2019s oversight of its nurse staffing methodology found  that some internal controls\u2014those related to environmental assessment,  a plan for monitoring compliance, evaluation, timeliness of  communication, and organizational accountability\u2014are limited. The  implementation of internal controls is necessary for ensuring initiatives  achieve intended outcomes and for minimizing operational problems.  Without these internal controls in place, VHA cannot ensure that its  methodology meets department goals, such as establishing a  standardized methodology for determining adequate and qualified nurse  staffing at all VAMCs, and ultimately, having nurse staffing that is  adequate to meet veterans\u2019 health care needs.", "Environmental Assessment. VHA did not comprehensively assess each  VAMC to ensure preparedness for implementing its methodology,  including having the necessary technical support and resources, prior to  the issuance of the methodology directive in 2010. Furthermore, as of  August 2014, VHA did not have a plan for assessing whether VAMCs  have the necessary resources to execute their approved nurse staffing  plans. Under federal internal control standards, successful organizations  monitor their internal and external environments continuously and  systematically, and by building environmental assessments into the  strategic planning process, are able to stay focused on long-term goals  even as they make changes to achieve them.", "VHA did not assess VAMCs\u2019 technical resources to determine if all  VAMCs would be able to successfully implement the methodology. For  example, the directive recommended that VAMCs use comparative data  from external sources, such as the National Database of Nursing Quality  Indicators (NDNQI) when analyzing unit-level staffing data. According to  some VAMC officials, due to the costs and complexity of contracting,  not all VAMCs had access to this data source. Each VAMC was  responsible for establishing its own contract to purchase access to  NDNQI data, which some VAMC officials said was expensive and time- consuming to set up, noting that it would have been helpful to have  assistance in coordinating the contracting process. Officials from ONS  reported that they are discussing the possibility of having a VHA-wide  contract so that all VAMCs would have access to NDNQI data. In addition  to access to comparative data, according to the directive, VAMCs need  appropriate data system capabilities\u2014in particular an automated staffing  system for information such as patient admission, transfer and discharge  data, and human resources data\u2014to facilitate implementation of the data- driven methodology and calculation of NHPPD. However, not all VAMCs  in our review had an automated staffing system in place even 3 years  after the release of the directive. Officials at a VAMC without an  automated staffing system told us staff were collecting and inputting data,  in many cases manually, into a spreadsheet to calculate NHPPD, and  that this process was extremely time-consuming and potentially error- prone. ONS officials said they knew VAMCs needed automated staffing  systems when the directive was published in 2010. However, they  thought Phase III\u2014a national automated staffing system\u2014would be  forthcoming, and did not fully review whether VAMCs had alternative data  capabilities to assist them in the interim.", "When we asked how they assessed the readiness of VAMCs for  implementation of the methodology, ONS officials told us that they did not  do this as well as they should have for Phase I implementation in  inpatient units, despite its 2009 Phase I pilot evaluation to better  understand the potential capabilities and weaknesses of VAMCs.  According to ONS, it still has not conducted such an assessment of all  VAMCs even though it has moved forward with planning the national  rollout of Phase II in operating room, emergency department, and spinal  cord injury units. ONS, however, has assessed some of the available  resources of the sites that have participated in the pilots for Phase II in  spinal cord injury units. For example, ONS officials told us that they asked  these participating sites questions about their access to data and nurse  turnover within the pilot units to determine their ability to fully and  successfully participate in the pilot. According to ONS officials, all sites  reported that they were able to fully participate in the pilot. By not  comprehensively assessing the VAMCs\u2019 technical support and resources  to determine if they were prepared to implement the methodology, VHA  had no assurance that the VAMCs would be successful.", "Plan for Monitoring Compliance. ONS did not develop a plan for  monitoring VAMCs to ensure they were in compliance with the  implementation and ongoing administration of Phase I of the  methodology. Under federal internal control standards, plans should be  designed to ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of  normal program operations, and managers should identify performance  gaps in compliance with program policies and procedures.", "ONS reported implementing two mechanisms for obtaining information  from VAMCs\u2014a 2013 questionnaire sent to all VAMCs and monthly  methodology conference calls with VAMCs\u2014but neither was an adequate  mechanism for comprehensively assessing the compliance of each  VAMC. The questionnaire, sent nearly 2 years after the deadline for  implementation of Phase I of the methodology, asked VAMCs to report  their status of staffing plan development, but because of lack of clarity in  the questions asked, inconsistency in medical center responses, and lack  of validation of the self-reported responses, it was not reliable for  determining the extent to which VAMCs had developed staffing plans.  ONS officials reported that they have no plans to survey VAMCs again on  their status of developing staffing plans. Furthermore, the monthly  methodology conference calls that started when the directive was  published in 2010 did not provide an adequate mechanism for monitoring  compliance because they too relied on VAMCs to self-report problems. A  VAMC official told us that participants were reluctant to raise problems,  such as not developing staffing plans on time, during these monthly calls.", "In addition, the directive requires VAMCs to evaluate their staffing plans  for Phase I annually, or more frequently if needed, but ONS officials told  us that they did not have a systematic plan for monitoring compliance with  this evaluation beyond the 2013 questionnaire and the monthly  methodology conference calls. Moving forward, ONS officials said they  plan to review whether all VAMCs implemented both the unit and facility  expert panels, but, as of August 2014, had no detailed plan or timeline for  conducting this review or for monitoring VAMCs\u2019 ongoing evaluation of  their staffing plans. The lack of a plan for monitoring VAMCs\u2019 compliance  with the implementation and ongoing administration of the methodology  hinders VHA from being able to ensure that all VAMCs are staffing their  nurses using the same, standardized methodology.", "Evaluation. There have been limited evaluations of the methodology, and  one of these evaluations has been significantly delayed. Under federal  internal control standards, measuring performance allows organizations  to track the progress they are making towards program goals and  objectives, and provides managers important information on which to  make management decisions and resolve any problems or program  weaknesses.", "Evaluation of Phase I pilot (conducted in September 2009)\u2014ONS  identified VAMC challenges with implementing the methodology\u2014 such as difficulties accessing data, and staff nurses having an overall  lack of knowledge of the methodology process. The evaluation  contained recommendations, such as developing a training guidebook  and providing guidelines on the role of the expert panels, to improve  the methodology process. According to ONS, most of the  recommendations from this 2009 evaluation have been addressed;  however, we found that weaknesses identified in the 2009 evaluation  still existed for all of the seven VAMCs included in our review.", "Evaluations of Phase I national implementation and training (began  early 2014, preliminary results were expected August 2014). Similarly,  ONS did not begin an evaluation of the national implementation of the  methodology until January 2014, more than 2 years after VAMCs  were required to have implemented it, and, as of August 2014, had  still not been completed. According to ONS officials, the Phase I  national evaluation was to review VAMCs\u2019 experiences during  implementation, including a review of the training provided to VAMCs  during that phase. The lengthy delay in the evaluation of Phase I was  potentially problematic because the ongoing difficulties that VAMCs  have experienced during implementation may have been avoided or  resolved more quickly if the evaluation results had been available and  corrective actions put into place. VAMC staff we interviewed told us  they have been struggling with components of the methodology since  the directive was issued. For example, some VAMC staff expressed  difficulty completing and understanding the data analysis process for  calculating NHPPD. An earlier evaluation of the methodology could  have helped identify this problem, as well as potential solutions to  address it. Furthermore, the delay limited ONS\u2019s time to apply lessons  learned from Phase I evaluations to the implementation of Phase II,  portions of which are already nearly complete.", "Phase II pilot training evaluation (began in early 2014 with results  expected November 2014)\u2014ONS is conducting an evaluation of the  training that was provided to the VAMCs involved in the Phase II pilots  in operating room, emergency department, and spinal cord injury units  to determine if the training provided to these units needs to be  changed in preparation for the national rollout. ONS officials told us  that they have completed the operating room pilot; the national rollout  of the methodology in operating room units in all VAMCs began in  February 2014 and is expected to be completed by October 1, 2014.  ONS officials said that it has completed the pilot for the emergency  department units, but has not completed the pilot for spinal cord injury  units; ONS has not scheduled deadlines for their national  implementation.", "VHA\u2019s delays in completing evaluations of the methodology limit its ability  to identify and resolve VAMC implementation and administration  problems, and thus help to ensure successful rollouts of subsequent  phases of the methodology.", "Timeliness of Implementation and Communication. The long timeline  for implementing the pilots and national rollouts of Phases I and II, as well  as evaluating Phase I of the staffing methodology\u2014more than 7 years\u2014 and for communicating methodology-related information to VAMCs may  have hindered the ability of VAMCs to develop their staffing plans and to  execute the initiatives contained in those plans. Under federal internal  control standards, timeliness in the development of a program or  implementation of a policy is needed to maintain relevance and value in  managing operations and making decisions. When information regarding  a policy or program is not provided in a timely manner, there can be a  loss of stakeholder support, which can affect how stakeholders make  decisions. For example, staff from some VAMCs involved in the Phase II  pilot stated that they believed the data and reports generated from the  methodology were only a paper exercise because they had not gotten  any feedback from ONS on next steps. ONS officials told us they have  communicated information on the Phase II pilot, such as the status of the  pilot and feedback obtained from the training sessions, through their  monthly conference calls with VAMCs; however, based on our interviews,  this information did not reach many staff at the VAMCs in our review that  participated in the Phase II pilot.", "Furthermore, ONS officials have not adequately communicated to VAMCs  the status of Phase III of the methodology\u2014development of a national  automated staffing system. According to the directive, a national  automated staffing system was to be developed to support VAMCs in the  implementation of the methodology. Because this automated staffing  system has yet to be developed as per the directive, officials from two  VAMCs told us they bought their own systems, which helped to effectively  administer the methodology. ONS officials told us at the time the directive  was published in 2010, Phase III implementation was an aspirational  goal. ONS officials said they had expected VHA data system teams to  begin the process of developing a national automated system; however, it  was not made a department goal, and is not currently on the list of  projects under consideration for funding. Having a variety of staffing  systems, and thus inconsistent data variables across VAMCs, inhibits  ONS\u2019s ability to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of the staffing  methodology. If an automated staffing system is eventually developed  under Phase III, VAMCs likely will have to dismantle the staffing systems  they have created and restructure their data analysis processes, which  likely will be time-consuming and costly. VHA\u2019s long timelines for the  implementation and communication of methodology-related information  put stakeholder support of the methodology at risk and increase the  potential for duplication of efforts.", "Organizational Accountability. VHA did not define areas of  responsibility or establish the appropriate line of reporting within the  framework of VA\u2019s management structure for the ongoing administration  and oversight of the methodology. Under federal internal control  standards, an agency\u2019s organizational structure should provide  management with a framework for planning, directing, and controlling  operations to achieve agency objectives; a good internal control  environment requires that the agency clearly defines key areas of  authority and responsibility. VHA does not require VAMCs to submit any  information or reports on the implementation and ongoing administration  of the methodology to ONS or the VISNs. Such information, if it were  shared, may have been used to inform ONS of any systematic problems  that necessitate changes to help ensure the continued viability of its  methodology, as well as identify any best practices that have been  implemented by VAMCs across the country. ONS officials told us that  they did not require the VAMCs to submit any such documentation to  ONS, because they made a conscious decision to not \u201cmicro-manage\u201d  the local process of nurse staffing.", "Furthermore, VHA has not sufficiently utilized the VISN-level  management structure in the implementation or ongoing administration of  the methodology. While the methodology directive described a role for the  VISNs, that role was limited to ensuring that resources are available to  VAMCs as they try to staff their units; the directive did not mention a role  in the implementation or ongoing administration of the actual  methodology. As a result, VISNs have not been consistently aware of  problems experienced by VAMCs in their region, and have not provided  support or education. In our interviews with VISN officials representing  each of the seven VAMCs in our review, we found that three of the VISNs  were not substantively involved in the implementation and ongoing  administration of the methodology. According to ONS, in many VISNs,  discussions of staffing methodology implementation were minimal, and  rather than VISN leadership, the nurse executives, in addition to their  responsibilities within their individual VAMCs, had the responsibility of  disseminating staffing methodology-related information to the VAMCs  within the VISN.", "Staff from three VISNs that were more substantially involved in the  implementation of the methodology provided oversight for the nurse  staffing methodology and acted as liaisons for VAMC nurse executives for  network-level issues. One VISN official we interviewed was developing  oversight mechanisms for VAMCs in the region, including a requirement  for nurse executives to submit a quarterly staffing report. According to the  official, having such a reporting requirement at the VISN level would give  the right amount of emphasis to the process and provide support to nurse  executives implementing the methodology in the VAMCs. The quarterly  report could also help inform VISN officials about issues with the  methodology. This official was developing these mechanisms  independently of ONS, but they could be considered potential best  practices to be shared across all VISNs.", "ONS officials told us they thought ideas or problems across VAMCs  related to the methodology would be shared through the VAMC nurse  executives. They also hoped that VISN leadership would be interested in  the methodology and, as a result, schedule VISN-level briefings to aid in  its implementation. VHA, however, did not specify either of these roles in  the directive or take steps to ensure that they were occurring. Moving  forward, ONS officials said they are considering developing a VISN-level  staff position that would specifically focus on educating VAMCs within the  region about the methodology, and assisting them with implementing it.  Without clearly defined roles and responsibilities within VA\u2019s  organizational structure, VHA\u2019s ability to improve its oversight of the  implementation and administration of the staffing methodology and  provide VAMCs with additional resources to assist with problems is  compromised."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the number of veterans requiring care in VAMCs and the complexity of  services needed by many of these veterans increase, the need for an  adequate and qualified nurse workforce is increasingly critical. Although  VHA\u2019s nurse staffing methodology was intended to provide a nationally  standardized methodology for determining and ensuring adequate and  qualified nurse staffing at VAMCs, its ability to do so across all 151  VAMCs is not likely to be realized unless existing weaknesses are  addressed. Although some improvements in nurse staffing were reported  with the implementation of the staffing methodology, the seven VAMCs in  our review experienced problems developing and executing the related  staffing plans, including problems pertaining to data resources, training,  and communication. Many of these problems persist as the seven  VAMCs continue to administer the methodology.", "We also found that VHA\u2019s oversight of the staffing methodology is limited  and in many cases lacks sufficient internal controls, which could diminish  VHA\u2019s ability to ensure an adequate and qualified nurse workforce. In  particular, VHA has not adequately assessed the needs or preparedness  of VAMCs to effectively implement the methodology, does not have a  formal mechanism to ensure VAMCs\u2019 ongoing compliance with the  methodology, has not clearly defined a role in oversight for VISNs, and  does not regularly communicate with VAMCs or VISNs to cull and share  best practices system-wide. Furthermore, delays in VHA\u2019s evaluations of  early phases of the staffing methodology have made them too late to be  useful in designing future phases or helping VAMCs with implementation.
