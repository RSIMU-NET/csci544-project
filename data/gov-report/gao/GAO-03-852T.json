Among these benefits are several actions taken and planned to address governmentwide information security weaknesses and challenges, such as lack of senior management attention. Nevertheless, as indicated by selected quantitative performance measures for the largest federal agencies, progress has been limited. Specifically, excluding data for one agency that were not comparable for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, improvements for 23 agencies ranged from 3 to 10 percentage points for the selected measures. GAO's analyses of agencies' reports and evaluations confirmed that many agencies have not implemented security requirements for most of their systems, such as performing risk assessments and testing controls. Further, the usefulness of agency corrective action plans may be limited when they do not identify all weaknesses or contain realistic completion dates. Agencies also continue to face challenges in effectively implementing and managing their overall information security programs. FISMA provisions establish additional requirements that, among other things, can assist agencies in implementing effective information security programs. However, attaining significant and sustainable results in implementing such requirements will also likely require processes that prioritize and routinely monitor and manage agency efforts, as well as continued congressional and administration oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss efforts by federal departments  and agencies and the administration to implement statutory information  security requirements.

Further, we have identified  information security as a governmentwide high-risk issue in reports to the  Congress since 1997\u2014most recently in January 2003. Concerned with  accounts of attacks on commercial systems via the Internet and reports of  significant weaknesses in federal computer systems that make them  vulnerable to attack, in October 2000 the Congress passed and the  President signed into law Government Information Security Reform  provisions (commonly known as GISRA) to strengthen information  security practices throughout the federal government. GISRA established  information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements for  federal agencies, which are now permanently authorized and strengthened  through the recently enacted Federal Information Security Management  Act of 2002 (FISMA).", "In my testimony today, I will first summarize the federal government\u2019s  overall information security weaknesses and challenges, as well as the  status of the administration\u2019s efforts to address them as discussed in the  May 2003 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) report to the Congress  on fiscal year 2002 GISRA implementation. I will also discuss the results  of our evaluation of efforts by OMB and 24 of the largest federal agencies  to implement federal information security requirements and correct  identified weaknesses. Finally, I will describe new information security  requirements contained in FISMA that can assist agencies in implementing  effective information security.", "In conducting this review, we analyzed OMB\u2019s May 2003 report to the  Congress on GISRA implementation. We also compared the results of  OMB\u2019s report with the results of our analyses of fiscal year 2002 GISRA  reporting by 24 of the largest federal agencies and their inspectors general  (IGs), which we had previously reported in testimony before your  subcommittee in April 2003. We did not validate the accuracy of the data  reported by OMB or by the agencies. We also analyzed the provisions of  FISMA. We performed our work in June 2003, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["On October 30, 2000, the Congress enacted GISRA, which became  effective November 29, 2000, for a period of 2 years. GISRA supplemented  information security requirements established in the Computer Security  Act of 1987, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen  Act of 1996, and was consistent with existing information security  guidance issued by OMB and NIST, as well as audit and best practice  guidance issued by us.", "GISRA consolidated these separate requirements and guidance into an  overall framework for managing information security and established new  annual review, independent evaluation, and reporting requirements to help  ensure agency implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight.  GISRA assigned specific responsibilities to OMB, agency heads and chief  information officers (CIOs), and IGs. OMB was responsible for  establishing and overseeing policies, standards, and guidelines for  information security. This included the authority to approve agency  information security programs, but delegated OMB\u2019s responsibilities  regarding national security systems to national security agencies. OMB  was also required to submit an annual report to the Congress summarizing  results of agencies\u2019 evaluations of their information security programs.", "OMB released its fiscal year 2001 report in February 2002 and its fiscal  year 2002 report in May 2003.", "GISRA required each agency, including national security agencies, to  establish an agencywide risk-based information security program to be  overseen by the agency CIO and ensure that information security is  practiced throughout the life cycle of each agency system. Specifically,  this program was to include    periodic risk assessments that consider internal and external threats to the  integrity, confidentiality, and availability of systems, and to data  supporting critical operations and assets; the development and implementation of risk-based, cost-effective policies  and procedures to provide security protections for information collected  or maintained by or for the agency; training on security responsibilities for information security personnel and  on security awareness for agency personnel;   periodic management testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of  policies, procedures, controls, and techniques;   a process for identifying and remediating any significant deficiencies;    procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    an annual program review by agency program officials.", "In addition to the responsibilities listed above, GISRA required each  agency to have an annual independent evaluation of its information  security program and practices, including control testing and compliance  assessment. The evaluations of non-national-security systems were to be  performed by the agency IG or an independent evaluator, and the results  of these evaluations were to be reported to OMB. For the evaluation of  national security systems, special provisions included having national  security agencies designate evaluators, restricting the reporting of  evaluation results, and having the IG or an independent evaluator perform  an audit of the independent evaluation. For national security systems, only  the results of each audit of an evaluation were to be reported to OMB.", "For first-year GISRA implementation, OMB provided guidance to the  agencies in January 2001, and in June issued final instructions on reporting  results of annual agency security program reviews and inspector general  independent evaluations to OMB to provide a basis for its annual report to  the Congress. These instructions listed specific topics that the agencies  were to address in their reporting, many of which were referenced back to  corresponding GISRA requirements. Agencies were to report their results  to OMB in September 2001\u2014the same time they were to submit their fiscal  year 2003 budget materials. In October 2001, OMB also issued detailed  guidance to the agencies on reporting their strategies for correcting the  security weaknesses identified through their reviews, evaluations, and  other reviews or audits performed throughout the reporting period. This  information was to include a \u201cplan of action and milestones\u201d (corrective  action plan) that, among other things, listed the weaknesses; showed  required resources, milestones, and completion dates; and described how  the agency planned to address those weaknesses. The guidance also  required agencies to submit quarterly status updates of their corrective  action plans to OMB. Corrective action plans were due to OMB by the end  of October, and the first quarterly updates were due January 31, 2002.", "For fiscal year 2002, OMB provided the agencies with updated reporting  instructions and guidance on preparing and submitting corrective action  plans. Agencies were again to report their GISRA review and evaluation  results to OMB in September with corrective action plans due October 1,  2002, and the next quarterly update due on January 1, 2003. Although  similar to its previous guidance, in response to agency requests and  recommendations we made to OMB as a result of our review of fiscal year  2001 GISRA implementation, this guidance also incorporated several  significant changes to help improve the consistency and quality of  information being reported for oversight by OMB and the Congress. These  changes included the following:    Reporting instructions provided new high-level management performance  measures that the agencies and IGs were required to use to report on  agency officials\u2019 performance. These included, for example, the number  and percentage of systems assessed for risk, the number and percentage of  systems certified and accredited, the number of contractor operations or  facilities reviewed, and the number of employees with significant security  responsibilities that received specialized training.", "OMB confirmed that agencies were expected to review all systems  annually. It explained that GISRA requires senior agency program officials  to review each security program for effectiveness at least annually, and  that the purpose of the security programs discussed in GISRA is to ensure  the protection of the systems and data covered by the program. Thus, a  review of each system is essential to determine the program\u2019s  effectiveness, and only the depth and breadth of such system reviews are  flexible.", "Agencies were generally required to use all elements of NIST\u2019s Security  Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems to review  their systems unless an agency and its IG confirmed that any agency- developed methodology captured all elements of the guide. The guide  uses an extensive questionnaire containing specific control objectives and  techniques against which an unclassified system or group of  interconnected systems can be tested and measured.", "OMB requested that IGs verify that agency corrective action plans identify  all known security weaknesses within an agency, including components,  and are used by the IG and the agency, major components, and program  officials within them, as the authoritative agency management mechanism  to prioritize, track, and manage all agency efforts to close security  performance gaps.", "OMB authorized agencies to release certain information from their  corrective action plans to assist the Congress in its oversight  responsibilities.

Also, as  discussed in a later section, OMB reported significant progress in agencies\u2019  IT security performance, primarily as indicated by the quantitative  governmentwide performance measures that OMB required agencies to  disclose beginning with their fiscal year 2002 reports.", "OMB previously reported six common security weaknesses for the federal  government. Actions and progress for these weaknesses reported by OMB  in its fiscal year 2002 report were as follows:  Lack of senior management attention to information security. OMB  reports that based on agencies\u2019 security reviews, remediation efforts, and  IT budget materials, it either conditionally approves or disapproves agency  security programs, and the OMB Director communicates this decision  directly to each agency head. Further, OMB used the President\u2019s  Management Agenda Scorecard to focus attention on serious IT security  weaknesses and, along with senior agency officials, to monitor agency  progress on a quarterly basis. As a result, OMB concluded that senior  executives at most agencies are paying greater attention to IT security.", "Inadequate accountability for job and program performance related to  IT security. OMB\u2019s instructions to federal agencies for fiscal year 2002  GISRA reporting included high-level management performance measures  to assist agencies in evaluating their IT security status and the  performance of officials charged with implementing specific security  requirements.", "Limited security training for general users, IT professionals, and  security professionals. OMB stated that through the administration\u2019s  \u201cGoLearn\u201d e-government initiative on establishing and delivering  electronic training, IT security courses were available to all federal  agencies in late 2002. Initial courses are targeted to CIOs and program  managers, with additional courses to be added for IT security managers  and the general workforce.", "Inadequate integration of security into the capital planning and  investment control process. OMB continues to address this issue through  the budget process to ensure that adequate security is incorporated  directly into and funded over the life cycle of all systems and programs  before funding is approved. Further, OMB stated that through this process,  agencies could demonstrate explicitly how much they are spending on  security and associate that spending with a given level of performance.  OMB also provided agencies with guidance in determining the security  costs of their IT investments.", "Poor security for contractor-provided services. Through the  administration\u2019s Committee on Executive Branch Information Systems  Security of the President\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board (since  eliminated), an issue group was created to review this problem and  develop recommendations for its resolution, to include addressing how  security is handled in contracts themselves. This issue is currently under  review by the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to develop, for  governmentwide use, a clause to ensure that security is appropriately  addressed in contracts.", "Limited capability to detect, report, and share information on  vulnerabilities or to detect intrusions, suspected intrusions, or virus  infections. OMB stated that addressing this weakness begins through  incident detection and reporting by individual agencies to incident  response centers at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the FBI,  the Department of Defense, or elsewhere. OMB also noted that agencies  must actively install corrective patches for known vulnerabilities and  reported that the Federal Computer Incident Response Center (FedCIRC)  awarded a contract on patch management to disseminate patches to all  agencies more effectively. Among other actions, OMB and the CIO  Council have developed and deployed a process to rapidly identify and  respond to cyber threats and critical vulnerabilities.", "Although not highlighted in OMB\u2019s report, in our April 2003 testimony  before this subcommittee, we identified other activities undertaken to  address these common weaknesses. In particular, during the past year,  NIST has issued related security guidance, including    draft guidelines on designing, developing, implementing, and maintaining  an awareness and training program within an agency\u2019s IT security  program;   a draft guide on security considerations in federal IT procurements,  including specifications, clauses, and tasks for areas such as IT security   training and awareness, personnel security, physical security, and security  features in systems; and   procedures for handling security patches that provided principles and  methodologies for establishing an explicit and documented patching and  vulnerability policy and a systematic, accountable, and documented  process for handling patches.", "In addition to these identified weaknesses, in its fiscal year 2001 report,  OMB stated that it would direct all large agencies to undertake a Project  Matrix review to more clearly identify and prioritize the security needs for  government assets. Project Matrix is a methodology developed by the  Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) (recently transferred to  the Department of Homeland Security) that identifies the critical assets  within an agency, prioritizes them, and then identifies interrelationships  with other agencies or the private sector. OMB reported that once  reviews have been completed at each large agency, it would identify cross- government activities and lines of business for Project Matrix reviews so  that it will have identified both vertically and horizontally the critical  operations and assets of the federal government\u2019s critical enterprise  architecture and their relationship beyond government. In its fiscal year  2002 report, OMB acknowledged this requirement, but did not assess  agencies\u2019 overall progress or indicate a goal for when this process will be  complete. As we testified in April 2003, 14 agencies reported they had  identified their critical assets and operations\u201410 using Project Matrix and  4 using other methodologies. Five more agencies reported that they were  in some stage of identifying their critical assets and operations, and three  more planned to do so in fiscal year 2003. However, this process may take  several more years to complete because OMB has not established any  deadlines for the completion of Project Matrix reviews.", "OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2002 report also identifies several additional  governmentwide issues and trends as concerns. These are as follows:    Agencies identify the same security weaknesses year after year, such as a  lack of system-level security plans. OMB reports that it will assist agencies  in prioritizing and reallocating funds to address these problems.", "Some IGs and CIOs have vastly different views of the state of the agency\u2019s  security programs, and OMB reports that it will highlight such  discrepancies to agency heads.", "Many agencies are not adequately prioritizing their IT investments and are  seeking funding to develop new systems while significant security  weaknesses exist in their legacy systems. OMB reports that it will assist  agencies in reprioritizing their resources through the budget process.", "Based on the information in the reports, not all agencies are successfully  reviewing all programs and systems each year, as required by information  security law.", "More agency program officials must engage and be held accountable for  ensuring that the systems that support their programs and operations are  secure, rather than thinking of IT security as the responsibility of a single  agency official or the agency\u2019s IT security office.", "As part of its fiscal year 2002 report, OMB listed five areas in which it will  continue to work with agencies to ensure progress in safeguarding the  federal government\u2019s information and systems: (1) the plan of action and  milestones process, (2) IT security performance measures, (3) the  President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard, (4) governmentwide  milestones for IT security, and (5) the threat and vulnerability response  process. Key actions identified for these areas include the following:    To ensure that remediation plans continue to be developed, implemented,  and corrective actions prioritized and tracked, OMB guidance will instruct  IGs, as part of their fiscal year 2003 FISMA work, to assess whether each  agency has in place a robust agencywide plan of action and milestone  process. A robust process, verified by agency IGs, is one of three criteria  agencies must meet to \u201cget to green\u201d for security on the Expanding E- Government Scorecard.", "To assist agencies and OMB in better tracking progress, along with their  plan of action and milestone updates, agencies will also be required to  begin quarterly reporting of their status against the OMB-prescribed IT  security performance measures.", "OMB set targeted milestones for improvement for some of the critical IT  security weaknesses in the President\u2019s FY 2004 budget. Targets for  improvement include that by the end of 2003   all agencies are to have an adequate agencywide process in place for  developing and implementing program- and system-level plans,   80 percent of federal IT systems shall be certified and accredited, and    80 percent of the federal government\u2019s fiscal year 2004 major IT  investments shall appropriately integrate security into the life cycle of  the investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Show Limited Progress in Implementing Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Our analyses of agency performance measure data and individual  agencies\u2019 efforts to implement information security requirements showed  limited progress in many cases.

Summarizing these data for 24 large federal  agencies and comparing results between fiscal years 2001 and 2002, OMB  reported in its fiscal year 2002 report that these data indicated that  agencies had made significant progress. Table 1 shows the  governmentwide results of this analysis reported by OMB for selected  performance measures, which indicates improvements for these measures  ranging from 18 to 27 percentage points.", "However, our analyses showed that most agencies experienced more  limited progress than the OMB analysis indicates. Specifically, excluding  data for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), our  analysis showed that increases for these same measures only ranged from  3 to 10 percent. NASA\u2019s performance measure data were excluded because  fiscal year 2001 data were based on a sample of 221 of its most critical  systems, but were compared with data for its total of 1,641 systems for  fiscal year 2002. As a result, including NASA data significantly affected the  overall levels of governmentwide progress shown. Figure 1 shows the  percentage change in performance measures based on our analysis,  excluding data for NASA.", "In addition to the impact of the NASA data, the performance data reported  by the Department of Defense (DOD) also represents only a small sample  of the thousands of systems DOD identified in total for the department,  and could significantly affect overall governmentwide results if data on all  systems were available. DOD reported that because of its size and  complexity, the collection of specific metrics required sizable lead time to  allow for the collection and approval process by each military service and  agency. For this reason, DOD focused its fiscal year 2002 GISRA efforts on  (1) a sample of 366 of its networks and (2) a sample of 155 systems that  were selected from the sample of systems used for DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2001  GISRA review. It is these 155 systems for which DOD reported  performance measure data.", "In addition to the our analysis of these overall performance measures, we  analyzed fiscal year 2002 GISRA reports by the 24 agencies and focused on  the status of individual agencies in implementing federal information  security requirements related to these and other measures.

Our  reviews of federal agencies, however, frequently show deficiencies related  to assessing risk, such as security plans for major systems that are not  developed on the basis of risk. As a result, the agencies had accepted an  unknown level of risk by default rather than consciously deciding what  level of risk was tolerable.", "OMB\u2019s performance measure for this requirement mandated that agencies  report the number and percentage of their systems that have been  assessed for risk during fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002.

For example,  of the 24 agencies, 13 reported an increase in the percentage of systems  assessed for fiscal year 2002 compared with fiscal year 2001. In addition,  as illustrated in figure 2, for fiscal year 2002, 11 agencies reported that they  had assessed risk for 90 to 100 percent of their systems.

Agencies also had to report the  number and percentage of systems that had an up-to-date security plan.  Our analyses showed that although most agencies reported that they had  taken such actions, IG reports disagreed for a number of agencies, and  many systems do not have up-to-date security plans.

Such weaknesses provide  little assurance that unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information  will be identified and appropriate actions taken in time to prevent or  minimize damage.", "OMB included a number of performance measures in agency reporting  instructions that were related to detecting, reporting, and responding to  security incidents. These included the number of agency components with  an incident-handling and response capability, whether the agency and its  major components share incident information with FedCIRC in a timely  manner, and the numbers of incidents reported. OMB also required that  agencies report on how they confirmed that patches have been tested and  installed in a timely manner.", "Our analyses of agencies\u2019 reports showed that although most agencies  reported that they have established incident-response capabilities,  implementation of these capabilities is still not complete. For example, 12  agencies reported that for fiscal year 2002, 90 percent or more of their  components had incident handling and response capabilities and 8 others  reported that they provided these capabilities to components through a  central point within the agency. However, although most agencies report  having these capabilities for most components, in at least two cases, the  IGs\u2019 evaluations identified instances in which incident-response  capabilities were not always implemented. For example, one IG reported  that the agency established and implemented its computer security  incident-response capability on August 1, 2002, but had not enforced  procedures to ensure that components comply with a consistent  methodology to identify, document, and report computer security  incidents. Another IG reported that the agency had released incident- handling procedures and established a computer incident-response team,  but had not formally assigned members to the team or effectively  communicated procedures to employees.", "Our analyses also showed that for fiscal year 2002, 13 agencies reported  that they had oversight procedures to verify that patches had been tested  and installed in a timely manner, and 10 reported that they did not.

Further, a  centralized process for monitoring and managing remedial actions enables  the agency to identify trends, root causes, and entitywide solutions. OMB  has required agency heads to work with CIOs and program officials to  provide a strategy to correct security weaknesses identified through  annual program reviews and independent evaluations, as well as other  reviews or audits performed throughout the reporting period by the IG or  us. Agencies are also required to submit corrective action plans for all  programs and systems where a security weakness has been identified.  OMB guidance requires that these plans list the identified weaknesses and,  for each, identify a point of contact, the resources required to resolve the  weakness, the scheduled completion date, key milestones with completion  dates for the milestones, milestone changes, the source of the weakness  (such as a program review, IG audit, or GAO audit), and the status  (ongoing or completed). Agencies are also required to submit quarterly  updates of these plans that list the total number of weaknesses identified  at the program and system levels, as well as the numbers of weaknesses  for which corrective actions were completed on time, ongoing and on  schedule, or delayed. Updates are also to include the number of new  weaknesses discovered subsequent to the last corrective action plan or  quarterly update.", "As reported in its fiscal year 2002 report to the Congress, OMB requires  that agencies establish and maintain an agencywide process for  developing and implementing program- and system-level corrective action  plans and that these plans serve as an agency\u2019s authoritative management  tool to ensure that program- and system-level IT security weaknesses are  remediated.

For example, of 14 agency IGs that reported on  whether or not their agency\u2019s corrective action plan addressed all  identified significant weaknesses, only 5 reported that their agency\u2019s plan  did so, and 9 specifically reported that their agency\u2019s plan did not. Further,  in several instances, corrective action plans did not indicate the current  status of weaknesses identified or include information regarding whether  actions were on track as originally scheduled.", "In addition, most agencies did not indicate the relative priority of  weaknesses for corrective action. As a result, it was difficult to determine  whether an agency\u2019s actions are focused on achieving results for its most  significant weaknesses. Further, three IGs reported that their agencies did  not have a centralized tracking system to monitor the status of corrective  actions, and one IG specifically questioned the accuracy of unverified, self- reported corrective actions reported in the agency\u2019s plan.", "In its report, OMB highlighted several actions that may help to address  such concerns. For example, OMB reported that since completion of their  fiscal year 2002 reviews, agencies have been working to prioritize their IT  security weaknesses.

In particular, our analyses in both 2001 and 2002 found that all  24 had weaknesses in security program management, which is  fundamental to the appropriate selection and effectiveness of the other  categories of controls. Security program management covers a range of  activities related to understanding information security risks; selecting and  implementing controls commensurate with risk; and ensuring that  controls, once implemented, continue to operate effectively.", "Establishing a strong security management program requires that agencies  take a comprehensive approach that involves both (1) senior agency  program managers who understand which aspects of their missions are  the most critical and sensitive and (2) technical experts who know the  agencies\u2019 systems and can suggest appropriate technical security control  techniques. We studied the practices of organizations with superior  security programs and summarized our findings in a May 1998 executive  guide entitled Information Security Management: Learning From  Leading Organizations. Our study found that these organizations  managed their information security risks through a cycle of risk  management activities. These activities, which are now among the federal  government\u2019s statutory information security requirements, included    assessing risks and determining protection needs,    selecting and implementing cost-effective policies and controls to meet    promoting awareness of policies and controls and of the risks that  prompted their adoption among those responsible for complying with  them, and implementing a program of routine tests and examinations for evaluating  the effectiveness of policies and related controls and reporting the  resulting conclusions to those who can take appropriate corrective action.", "Although GISRA reporting provides performance information on these  areas, it is important for agencies to ensure that they have the appropriate  management structures and processes in place to strategically manage  information security, as well as ensure the reliability of performance  information.
