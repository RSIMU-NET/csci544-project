This increase largely reflects the efforts of 12 states. However, almost half of all states increased the number of mental health records they made available by fewer than 100 over this same time period. Technological, legal, and other challenges limited the states\u2019 ability to share mental health records. To help address these challenges, the Department of Justice (DOJ) provides assistance to states, such as grants and training, which the 6 states GAO reviewed reported as helpful. DOJ has begun to have states share their promising practices at conferences, but has not distributed such practices nationally. By disseminating practices that states used to overcome barriers to sharing mental health records, DOJ could further assist states efforts.", "The states\u2019 overall progress in making unlawful drug use records available to NICS is generally unknown because of how these records are maintained. The vast majority of records made available are criminal records\u2014such as those containing arrests or convictions for possession of a controlled substance\u2014which cannot readily be disaggregated from other records in the databases checked by NICS. Most states are not providing noncriminal records, such as those related to positive drug test results for persons on probation. On May 1, 2012, DOJ data showed that 30 states were not making any noncriminal records available. Four of the 6 states GAO reviewed raised concerns about providing records outside an official court decision. Two states also noted that they did not have centralized databases that would be needed to collect these records. DOJ has issued guidance for providing noncriminal records to NICS.", "DOJ has not administered the reward and penalty provisions of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 because of limitations in state estimates of the number of records they possess that could be made available to NICS. DOJ officials were unsure if the estimates, as currently collected, could reach the level of precision needed to serve as the basis for implementing the provisions. The 6 states GAO reviewed had mixed views on the extent to which the reward and penalty provisions\u2014if implemented as currently structured\u2014would provide incentives for them to make more records available. DOJ had not obtained the states\u2019 views. Until DOJ establishes a basis for administering these provisions\u2014which could include revising its current methodology for collecting estimates or developing a new basis\u2014and determining the extent to which the current provisions provide incentives to states, the department cannot provide the incentives to states that were envisioned by the act.", "Nineteen states have received federal certification of their programs that allow individuals with a precluding mental health adjudication or commitment to seek relief from the associated firearms prohibition.

Further, we interviewed officials  from a nonprobability sample of 6 states (Idaho, Minnesota, New Mexico,  New York, Texas, and Washington) to discuss challenges they faced in  sharing mental health and unlawful drug use records. We selected these  states to represent a range of factors, including the number of mental  health records and unlawful drug use records made available for NICS  checks and whether the state received a NARIP grant.

DOJ officials  noted that technological challenges are particularly salient for mental  health records because these records originate from numerous sources  within the state\u2014such as courts, private hospitals, and state offices of  mental health\u2014and are not typically captured by any single state agency.  For example, records that involve involuntary commitments to a mental  institution typically originate in entities located throughout a state and  outside the scope of law enforcement, and therefore a state may lack  processes to automatically make these records available to the FBI.", "In addition, 6 of the 16 states that applied for NARIP grant funding in  2011 cited technology barriers as a reason for requesting funding in their  grant applications. For example, Virginia received a NARIP grant to,  among other things, equip district courts with an automated means to  transmit mental health records to the FBI and replace its previous manual  and labor-intensive process. Five of the 6 states we reviewed also noted  that technological challenges impaired their ability to identify, collect, and  provide mental health records to NICS. Minnesota officials said that it is  difficult to share historical records involving involuntary commitments to a  mental institution since they are paper records that cannot be  automatically transmitted. The 1 state in our sample that did not cite  technology as a challenge, Texas, already had an automated system in  place that to facilitate the transmission of mental health records. DOJ  officials were aware that states faced technological barriers to making  mental health records available and cited that NARIP grants help states  address these challenges. Additionally, BJS has made improving the  submission of mental health records, including efforts to automate the  reporting of such information, a funding priority of the NARIP grant  program for 2011 and 2012.", "Addressing state privacy laws is a legal challenge that some states  reported facing in making mental health records available to NICS.  Specifically, officials from 3 of the 6 states we reviewed said that the  absence of explicit state-level statutory authority to share mental health  records was an impediment to making such records available to NICS.  For example, Idaho officials reported deferring to the protection of  individual privacy until clear state statutory authority was established to  allow state agencies to make mental health records available. Idaho  enacted a law in 2010 requiring, among other things, that the state\u2019s  Bureau of Criminal Identification obtain and transmit information relating  to eligibility to receive or possess a firearm to NICS, and the state was  preparing to submit its first set of mental health records to the NICS Index  in the first quarter of 2012. Overall, 20 states have been identified by the  FBI as having enacted statutes that require or permit agencies to share  their mental health records, and some of these states in our sample  reported an increase in record availability as a result. For example, Texas  enacted a law in 2009 requiring court clerks to prepare and forward  certain types of mental health records to the state record repository within  30 days of specified court determinations.law, Texas officials said that the number of mental health records  provided to NICS increased by about 190,000 records.", "45 C.F.R.

According to a senior HHS health information privacy policy specialist,  HHS is in the process of reviewing this issue and has not yet made a  decision to pursue a proposed change to the Privacy Rule.", "DOJ and state officials we met with said that states often faced  challenges in getting relevant state agencies to collaborate, particularly  because many mental health records reside in entities\u2014such as hospitals  and departments of mental health\u2014that are typically not connected to the  law enforcement agencies that make the majority of records available to  NICS. For example, according to the State of Illinois\u2019 Office of the Auditor  General, approximately 114,000 mental health records were maintained  in state nursing homes, private hospitals, state mental health facilities,  and circuit courts in 2010. However, because of coordination and other  challenges, only about 5,000 records (or 4.4 percent) were made  available to the FBI. In addition, 2 of the 6 states in our sample reported  that deciding which state agency would act as the liaison to the FBI was  challenging because of limited staff resources and technological  requirements needed to make records available. New Mexico, for  instance, has not yet assigned responsibility to an agency to be the  primary entity for making mental health records available to the FBI,  despite discussions surrounding this issue over the past 4 years. New  Mexico\u2019s Administrative Office of the Courts has recently provided  records on approximately 6,000 individuals who were committed to a  mental institution directly to the FBI for NICS checks, but state officials  have not yet coordinated their efforts and decided collectively on what  entity will be responsible for providing such records in the future because  of the resources needed to do so.", "DOJ acknowledged that complete reporting of state records to national  databases can best be achieved through the cooperative efforts of all  entities that create the records. Underscoring the importance of  collaboration, BJS has recommended that NARIP grant recipients use a  portion of grant funds to establish NICS Record Improvement Task  Forces, to include representatives from the central record repository and  other agencies. According to DOJ, task forces with wide representation  can provide a forum for exploring possible options for improving the  quality, completeness, and availability of NICS records. Idaho officials, for  example, noted that forming such a multijurisdictional working group was  extremely helpful for learning which state entities housed relevant mental  health records.", "DOJ officials also said that several states overcame coordination  challenges by conducting outreach to entities involved with providing  mental health records and educating them about the importance of  making such records available to NICS. Texas Department of Public  Safety officials reported collaborating closely with courts by distributing  training and guidance documents to ensure that the courts understood  the types of mental health records that should be made available to NICS.  The guidance materials also include an outline of the importance of  mental health records for background checks, the types of cases to  report, instructions on how to input relevant records into Texas\u2019s record  system, and a frequently asked questions document for reference."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States Generally Found DOJ Assistance with Providing Mental Health Records Helpful", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grants", "paragraphs": ["NARIP grants were established to improve the completeness,  automation, and transmittal of records used during NICS background  checks. Since its inception 3 years ago, the grant program has awarded  approximately $40 million to 14 states. DOJ has placed an emphasis on  increasing the submission of mental health records as part of the 2011  and 2012 grant solicitations. Of the 16 NARIP grant applicants in 2011,  11 applicants requested funding for mental health record-related  activities. In addition, 6 of the 16 NARIP grant applicants in 2011  requested funds for technology-related improvements to increase the  submission of mental health records, including updating information  system hardware and automating the record submission process.", "Officials from 2 of the 3 states in our sample that received NARIP grants  reported using a portion of the funds to address technological barriers to  submitting mental health records. For example, Idaho officials reported  using NARIP grant funds it received in 2010 to create a new transmission  protocol to provide relevant data related to state mental health records.  State officials said these grants were instrumental in funding the  programming, testing, and software upgrades needed to create the  database. State officials have also reported using NARIP grants to  research which state agencies house mental health records that could be  used during NICS background checks. Specifically, 6 of the 16 NARIP  grant applicants in 2011 requested funding to conduct assessments to  identify where relevant mental health records reside within the state in  order to improve their efforts to provide such records for a NICS check.", "In addition to NARIP grants, DOJ administers the National Criminal  History Improvement Program and JAG Program, which can also be used  to support state efforts to improve mental health records, among other  things. For example, in 2008, we reported that from fiscal years 2000  through 2007, almost $940,000 in NCHIP grants were specifically  targeted to improve the availability of mental health record for use during  NICS background checks. All 6 states in our sample have received  NCHIP grants, but officials in all of these states said they did not use the  funding to improve the submission of mental health records. Rather,  these states used NCHIP funds for activities regarding criminal history  records in state repositories. For example, 1 state in our sample used  2011 NCHIP funds to reconcile approximately 60,000 open arrest records  with their corresponding dispositions. The JAG Program also supports  information-sharing programs in criminal justice entities. For example, in  2009, states spent $89.6 million (7 percent of total funds for that year) on  information-sharing projects, such as initiatives to increase records  provided to NICS. An additional $33 million (3 percent) was spent on  criminal records management upgrades and other technology for  information sharing.", "DOJ also offers in-state training sessions to educate state agencies about  NIAA-related topics, including issues related to the submission of mental  health records. For example, since enactment of NIAA, the NICS Section  has reported conducting presentations to law enforcement officials  responsible for providing records to NICS. Specifically, DOJ reported  conducting in-state trainings and presentations in 7 states. These  presentations covered the definition of the mental health prohibitor and  how to enhance state plans regarding the submission of mental health  records. Further, 3 of the 6 states in our sample reported using these  training presentations to provide information about the mental health  prohibitor. For instance, at Texas\u2019s request, the NICS Section held  presentations for judges, clerks, and other relevant parties to answer  questions about the types of mental health records requested under  NIAA. Additionally, Washington state officials were complimentary of the  NICS Section personnel that travel once a year to eight different locations  within the state to provide training on the federal prohibitors to their law  enforcement agencies.", "DOJ also hosts and sponsors conferences in which relevant DOJ  components present information on numerous topics, including those  related to making more mental health records available. For example,  DOJ\u2019s first conference regarding NIAA provisions\u2014the NIAA  Implementation Conference\u2014was held in 2009, and DOJ officials  reported that officials from almost every state attended. The NICS Section  also sponsors annual Report, Educate, Associate Criminal Histories  (R.E.A.C.H.) conferences, which focus on improving information sharing  between the NICS Section and external agencies. The NICS Section also  sponsors annual NICS User Conferences for states that conduct their  own NICS checks, which covers topics such as the federal firearm  prohibitors and how to submit records to the NICS Index. Officials from all  6 states in our sample had attended at least one DOJ-sponsored  conference and generally found these events to be helpful for learning  about various aspects of the NIAA, such as how to make certain mental  health records available to the FBI. Additionally, an official from 1 of the 6  states in our sample said that the documents distributed by DOJ were  particularly useful and officials in their state referenced them regularly.", "Beginning in 2011, DOJ began sponsoring annual regional NIAA  conferences, in conjunction with the National Center for State Courts and  SEARCH. These events are intended to provide a forum for states to  share their experiences in identifying, collecting, automating, and  submitting records. For example, at the December 2011 regional NIAA  meeting, Oregon officials shared their state\u2019s experience in developing a  system to share mental health records, including an explanation of which  state agencies collaborated to share such records and how the state used  NARIP grant funds to automate and transmit records. Two of the 6 states  in our sample also reported benefiting from learning about other states\u2019  experiences in collecting and submitting mental health records.

We analyzed grant applications  from 2009, 2010, and 2011\u2014funded and unfunded\u2014submitted by states,  territories, and tribal entities. From this, we were able to identify areas of  need for which 28 states, territories, and tribal entities requested funding.", "To assess the accuracy of mental health and unlawful drug use records  made available for NICS checks, we analyzed the most recent round of  triennial audits conducted by the FBI\u2019s Criminal Justice Information  Services (CJIS) Audit Unit and the most recent set of proactive validation  processes completed by the states. The most recent set of proactive  validation processes involved 23 states and occurred from October 2010  through September 2011, and the audits were conducted in 42 states  from 2008 through 2011.", "Further, we interviewed officials from a nonprobability sample of 6 states  to discuss any challenges they faced in sharing mental health and  unlawful drug use records and their experiences with DOJ assistance  received to address those challenges. The states selected were Idaho,  Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Texas, and Washington. We selected  these states to reflect a range of factors, including the number of mental  health records and unlawful drug use records made available for NICS  checks, trends in making mental health records available to NICS over  the past 3 years, whether the state received a grant under the NIAA, and  whether the state has provided a state record estimate to the Bureau of  Justice Statistics. While the results of these interviews cannot be  generalized to all states, they provided insight into state challenges and  state experience addressing those challenges. We also interviewed  officials from various DOJ components with responsibility for managing  and maintaining NICS records, which included the Bureau of Justice  Statistics and the FBI\u2019s CJIS division and NICS Section. We interviewed  these officials to determine, among other things, the progress states  made submitting mental health and unlawful drug use records, challenges  states face in doing so, and the forms of assistance DOJ is providing to  help states address these challenges.", "To determine the extent to which DOJ has administered the reward and  penalty provisions of the act and whether these provisions provide  incentives for state efforts to share records, we reviewed copies of state  record estimates for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and analyzed two reports from  the National Center for State Courts evaluating these estimates. We  interviewed center officials about, among other things, the scope,  methodology, and findings of the reports. We determined that the scope  and methodology were sufficient for us to rely on the results. We also  interviewed officials from the 6 states in our sample regarding (1) their  incentives to make the requested records available to the FBI; (2) the  extent to which the reward and penalty provisions of the act have  incentivized their efforts; (3) their thoughts on whether the reward and  penalty provisions would change their actions if they were carried out by  DOJ; (4) if the current reward and penalty provisions do not provide  incentives, what would; and (5) the impact, if any, of DOJ not carrying out  the reward and penalty provisions. We also interviewed the Bureau of  Justice Statistics about its efforts to administer the reward and penalty  provisions provided for in the act and the basis for its decisions.  Additionally, we discussed the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 position on the  process for completing the state record estimates, challenges therein,  and the effect of the act\u2019s reward and penalty provisions on record  sharing. Further, we interviewed officials with the National Center for  State Courts and the National Consortium for Justice Information and  Statistics (SEARCH) who were responsible for collecting state record  estimates and evaluating their reasonableness. From these interviews,  we learned more about the reasonableness of the estimates, changes to  the estimate methodology over time, and next steps for the estimates.", "To determine the extent to which states are providing a means for  individuals with a precluding mental health adjudication or commitment to  seek relief from the associated federal firearms prohibition, we reviewed  documentation on the minimum criteria for certification of a relief from  disabilities program and the relief program requirements detailed in the  NIAA. We also reviewed examples of state statutes that established relief  from disability programs. Further, we interviewed officials in each of the  16 states with approved relief from disability programs as of May 2012 to  learn about the challenges they faced developing their programs,  motivation for developing the program, federal assistance they received,  and information on the number of relief applicants to date, including how many applications had been received, approved, denied, or dismissed.We also relied on data collected through interviews with the previously  mentioned 6 sample states, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives (ATF), and other DOJ components to learn about, among  other things, the motivation to establish relief programs, barriers to doing  so, and DOJ resources available to help states. Three of the 6 states in  our sample did not have certified relief from disability programs, and we  asked officials in these states why they had not pursued developing a  relief program; what barriers there were to establishing a relief program;  and what, if any, federal assistance they would like for establishing a  relief program. Additionally, we interviewed groups with an interest in  relief from disability programs and NICS data more broadly, including the  Brady Campaign, Gun Owners of America, Mayors Against Illegal Guns,  and the National Rifle Association.

For example, Oregon has five statutorily prohibiting  categories of misdemeanor convictions in addition to domestic violence\u2014 which is the only prohibiting misdemeanor required under federal law.  Additionally, there may be an economic incentive for states to elect non- POC status, since implementing and operating a POC may cost a state  more money than it can collect in fees charged to Federal Firearm  Licensees for conducting background checks.

Further, validity is ensured by  determining if there is proper documentation to support the entry of the  record into the NICS Index. CJIS officials cited that the completeness  review is used by the Audit Unit to notify states if there is additional  information that could be captured in their records to increase the  likelihood of finding records of individuals prohibited from receiving or  possessing a firearm within the database. According to CJIS officials,  CJIS Audit Unit auditors make a determination of compliance in the areas  of validity and accuracy based on a percentage of total records reviewed.
