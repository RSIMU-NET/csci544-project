The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) mandated that GAO assess the effectiveness of CPSC's authorities over imported products. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine what is known about CPSC's effectiveness in using these authorities, (2) compare CPSC's authorities with those of selected U.S. agencies and international entities, and (3) evaluate CPSC's plans to prevent the entry of unsafe consumer products. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed CPSC and other agencies' and entities' authorities, reviewed literature on consumer product safety, and compared CPSC's planning efforts with criteria for effective planning practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found broad consensus that CPSC's authorities over imported consumer products have the potential to be effective. However, CPSC has made limited progress in measuring the effectiveness of its authorities, and CPSC's ability to implement these authorities has been constrained by competing priorities and limited resources, as well as by delays in implementing key provisions of CPSIA. CPSC's presence at U.S. ports is limited and, in order to identify potentially unsafe products, it must work closely with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which faces pressure to quickly move shipments into commerce. CPSC does not have access to key CBP import data it could use to target incoming shipments for inspection, and it has not updated its agreements with CBP to clarify each agency's roles and responsibilities. CPSC's activities at U.S. ports could be strengthened by better targeting incoming shipments for inspection and by improving CPSC's coordination with CBP. Otherwise, CPSC may not be able to carry out key inspection activities efficiently or to effectively leverage its enforcement priorities with CBP. Select federal agencies and foreign governments provide lessons for strengthening CPSC's implementation of its authorities, particularly with respect to border surveillance and information sharing among countries. Both USDA and FDA have more robust border surveillance activities than CPSC because they obtain more data on incoming shipments, have more staff working at U.S. ports, use more developed programs to target risks, and use information technology systems that are integrated with other agency-based and CBP systems to effectively leverage their enforcement priorities with CBP. Other agencies have found that timely CBP import data integrated with other agency surveillance data is useful in screening incoming shipments for potential safety violations. In addition, officials at FDA and USDA have found that efforts to educate overseas industries and governments on U.S. safety standards could reduce the number of unsafe products that reach U.S. consumers. GAO also found broad consensus that continued coordination and information sharing among governments and multilateral organizations can improve the effectiveness of product safety frameworks. CPSC has increased its efforts to coordinate with these other entities, particularly China, but lacks a comprehensive plan for international engagement. CPSC has established annual plans, but lacks a long-term plan with key goals to prevent the entry of unsafe products. CPSC has not yet updated its agencywide Strategic Plan to reflect new authorities granted in CPSIA. This may inhibit CPSC's ability to appropriately allocate any potential increases in agency resources or to address the safety of imported products through international means. An updated Strategic Plan may also help to ensure that CPSC has the requisite compliance and analytical staff to support the full range of CPSC's international efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The growing volume of consumer products\u2014such as toys, household  appliances, and children\u2019s apparel\u2014imported into the United States has  strained the resources of the Consumer Product Safety Commission  (CPSC) and is challenging the agency to find new ways to ensure the  safety of these products. From 1998 to 2007, the value of consumer  products imported into the United States increased about 101 percent,  with products from China (which includes Hong Kong) nearly quadrupling  over that same period to constitute about 42 percent of all imported  consumer goods. In addition to the growing value of imports, the number  and variety of consumer products have been increasing. Consumer  products are becoming more technically complex and sophisticated, and  they increasingly are not \u201cfrom\u201d any one place but rather consist of parts  and components from any number of countries.", "Increasing imports of consumer products gained national attention in  2007. During that year, CPSC announced 473 recalls, the most in 10 years,  and 389 of the recalls (or about 82 percent) involved products imported  into the country. As a result, 2007 became known to some as \u201cthe year of  the recall.\u201d The number of product recalls in fiscal year 2008 was even  higher. These record numbers of recalls have raised the issue of whether  CPSC can ensure the safety of products that are increasingly  manufactured overseas.", "While the number of consumer products imported into the United States  has been increasing, CPSC has become progressively smaller in terms of  staff and resources. The commission has not had a full slate of five  commissioners since 1986 and has not been authorized to fund more than  three commissioner positions since 1993. In fiscal year 2008, CPSC had 396  full-time employees, compared with 480 full-time employees in fiscal year  1997. CPSC\u2019s fiscal year 2008 appropriation totaled about $80 million, and  CPSC\u2019s fiscal year 2009 appropriation was not passed until March 2009\u2014 about 6 months into the fiscal year 2008\u2014due to a congressional  continuing budget resolution.", "In response to the high-profile recalls of imported products in 2007, as well  as concerns that CPSC was inadequately staffed and funded to enforce  existing product safety laws, Congress passed the Consumer Product  Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), which became law on August 14, 2008.  CPSIA was intended to update and strengthen CPSC by authorizing  expanded funding, mandating increased staffing subject to available  appropriations, and enhancing existing CPSC authorities, including those  regarding product safety standards, recalls, reporting, and administrative  penalties. In addition, CPSIA introduced several new statutory tools to  address the safety of imported products. Because Congress was concerned  that there may be remaining gaps in U.S. product safety law or unforeseen  consequences of CPSIA with respect to imported products, CPSIA  mandated GAO to review a range of issues regarding CPSC\u2019s authorities to  prevent the entry of unsafe products into the United States. Because  CPSIA was recently passed, and CPSC has not had time to implement it  fully, we responded to the mandate by (1) determining how CPSC assesses  the effectiveness of its authorities in preventing the entry of unsafe  consumer products and determining what is known about CPSC\u2019s  effectiveness in using these authorities, (2) comparing certain aspects of  CPSC\u2019s authorities with those of selected U.S. agencies, (3) comparing  CPSC\u2019s authorities with those of selected international entities, and   (4) evaluating CPSC\u2019s plans to prevent the entry of unsafe consumer  products in the future.", "To determine the effectiveness of CPSC\u2019s import safety authorities, we  examined CPSC data and interviewed CPSC officials to learn how the  agency measures and assesses its own effectiveness. We conducted  extensive document reviews on consumer product safety generally and  import safety specifically. We interviewed legal professionals and  consumer and industry representatives to obtain their perspectives on the  effectiveness of CPSC\u2019s authorities. We also interviewed officials from  other federal agencies involved in product safety at the international level,  including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Office of the  United States Trade Representative (USTR), and the Departments of State  and Commerce. We visited a U.S. port of entry to observe CPSC import  surveillance activities and CPSC\u2019s interaction with CBP staff at the port.  We also visited CPSC\u2019s Product Testing Laboratory in Gaithersburg,  Maryland, to observe laboratory testing that supports import safety  activities. Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of CPSC\u2019s  authorities to prevent the entry of unsafe consumer products to similar  authorities of selected U.S. federal agencies and selected countries. For  our comparative analysis of U.S. federal agencies, we selected agencies  that regulate the safety of products used by consumers and that possess  recent, relevant experience with import safety. Specifically, we selected  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the  Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration (NHTSA). We conducted interviews with agency officials  and reviewed agency statutes, regulations, and other documents. For our  comparative analysis of other countries\u2019 product safety authorities, we  selected Australia, Canada, China, the European Union (EU), and Japan  for review. We developed a set of questions concerning consumer product  safety authorities, practices, and procedures and worked through the U.S.  Department of State to distribute the questions to appropriate contacts at  U.S. embassies overseas and, in some cases, to foreign embassies in  Washington, D.C. We conducted interviews with product safety officials  from Canada, the EU, and Japan, and with U.S. officials at the embassies in  Australia, Canada, and China. We received written responses to our  questions from the U.S. embassies in Australia, Canada, and China; from  officials with the Embassy of Japan in Washington, D.C.; and from  consumer product safety officials in the EU. We also reviewed documents  regarding product safety in the selected countries and reports on  consumer product safety prepared by the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD). To evaluate CPSC\u2019s plans to  prevent the entry of unsafe products in the future, we reviewed CPSC\u2019s  2010 Performance Budget Request and compared CPSC\u2019s planning efforts  with guidance GAO has developed to assess implementation of the  Government Performance and Results Act. Appendix I provides a more  detailed description of our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 to August 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The  Consumer Product Safety Act consolidated existing federal safety  regulatory activity related to consumer products within CPSC. As a result,  in addition to general responsibilities for protecting consumers against  product hazards, the duties and functions under the following four statutes  were transferred to CPSC:   the Flammable Fabrics Act, which among other things, authorizes CPSC to  prescribe flammability standards for clothing, upholstery, and other  fabrics;  the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which establishes the framework  for the regulation of substances that are toxic, corrosive, combustible, or  otherwise hazardous;  the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, which authorizes CPSC to  prescribe special packaging requirements to protect children from injury  resulting from handling, using, or ingesting certain drugs and other  household substances; and  the Refrigerator Safety Act of 1956, which mandates CPSC to prescribe  safety standards for household refrigerators to ensure that the doors  thereof can be opened easily from the inside.", "CSPC has also subsequently been charged with administering the Virginia  Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, which establishes mandatory  safety standards for swimming pool and spa drain covers, as well as a  grant program to provide states with incentives to adopt pool and spa  safety standards. In addition, CPSC has been charged with administering  the Children\u2019s Gasoline Burn Prevention Act, which establishes safety  standards for child-resistant closures on all portable gasoline containers.", "Thus, CPSC\u2019s jurisdiction is extremely broad, covering thousands of types  of products. According to CPSC, this jurisdiction covers over 100,000  different manufacturers and generally includes all consumer products  except food, drugs, and cosmetics, which are regulated by FDA;  pesticides, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency;  automobiles and other on-road vehicles, which are regulated by the  Department of Transportation; flotation devices, which are regulated by  the Coast Guard; and firearms, tobacco, and alcohol, which are regulated  by the Department of Justice.", "The Consumer Product Safety Act established CPSC as an independent  regulatory commission. The rationale for establishing independent  commissions such as CPSC includes these assumptions: (1) long-term  appointment of commissioners would promote stability and develop  expertise, (2) independent status would insulate the commissioners from  undue economic and political pressures, and (3) commissioners with  different political persuasions and interests would provide diverse  viewpoints. The act provides for the appointment by the President of five  commissioners for staggered 7-year terms. However, no more than three  commissioners have served at one time since 1986, and the commission  has been led by two commissioners since 2006. One of these  commissioners is designated the Chairman, who directs all the executive  and administrative functions of the agency.", "CPSC was designed as a complement to tort law, under which one may  seek compensation for harm caused by another\u2019s wrongdoing. The threat  of legal action under tort law plays an important role in assuring that  companies produce safe products. However, tort law is primarily a  postinjury mechanism, and foreign manufacturers are usually outside of  the U.S. tort law system.

If CPSC determines that there is no feasible standard that would  adequately protect the public from danger, CPSC may issue regulations to  ban the manufacture and distribution of the product.", "Many consumer products are subject to voluntary standards. These  voluntary standards, which are often established by private standard- setting groups, do not have the force of law. However, many voluntary  standards are established with input from consumer groups and industry  and, as a result, are often referred to as \u201cconsensus standards.\u201d In addition,  the 1981 amendments to the Consumer Product Safety Act require CPSC  to defer to a voluntary standard\u2014rather than issuing a mandatory  regulation\u2014if CPSC determines that the voluntary standard adequately  addresses the hazard and that there is likely to be substantial compliance  with the voluntary standard.

The Office of  International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs was created in 2004  to provide CPSC with a more comprehensive and coordinated effort at the  international, federal, state, and local levels in developing and  implementing consumer product safety standards. The office conducts  activities and creates strategies aimed at ensuring greater import  compliance with recognized American safety standards. A major emphasis  of this program is encouraging foreign manufacturers to establish product  safety systems as an integral part of the manufacturing process. The office  is also involved in coordinating international consumer product safety  efforts with such U.S. federal agencies as the Departments of Commerce  and State. It also ensures that CPSC regulatory efforts are consistent with  U.S. international trade obligations by coordinating with the United States  Trade Representative.

CPSC, in  cooperation with other appropriate federal agencies, is required to  maintain a permanent product surveillance program for preventing the  entry of unsafe consumer products into the commerce of the United  States. Previously, CPSC operated the import surveillance program  through product safety investigators staffed in multiple regions throughout  the country who included among their investigative responsibilities ports  of entry in their particular regions. Over the years, the numbers of CPSC  regional offices and product safety investigators have been reduced. CPSC  states that these product safety investigators continue to support the  import surveillance program, operating in 48 locations throughout the  country. The Import Surveillance Division marks the first permanent, full- time presence of CPSC investigators at key ports of entry, according to  CPSC. As of July 2009, the division was staffed by 11 full-time employees\u2014 9 compliance investigators located at seven ports of entry and a Director  and Supervisory Compliance Investigator located at CPSC headquarters in  Bethesda, Maryland.

Under several of the acts that CPSC  administers, CPSC identifies potentially unsafe products and requests that  CBP set them aside for CPSC examination. CPSC has implemented  programs at some ports for CBP to target certain categories of products  based on their Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes. CBP has import  specialists at major ports who specialize in certain commodities, including  consumer products. They analyze manifest, entry, and other import data to  identify shipments for CPSC review. In some instances, CBP will  independently identify shipments for CPSC examination. Once samples  are delivered to or taken by CPSC for examination, CPSC may detain the  shipment pending further examination and testing, conditionally release  the shipment to the importer\u2019s premises pending examination and testing,  or release the shipment to the importer outright. Compliance investigators  examine the sample to determine whether it    complies with the relevant mandatory standard(s);  is accompanied by a certification of compliance with the relevant  product safety standard that is supported by testing, in some instances  by a third party;  is or has been determined to be an imminently hazardous product;    has a product defect that presents a substantial product hazard; or  is produced by a manufacturer who failed to comply with CPSC  inspection and recordkeeping requirements.", "If compliance investigators decide that further testing of a sample is  necessary, they will send the sample to the CPSC Product Testing  Laboratory or to a CBP laboratory. If the sample is found to violate any  of the above criteria, CPSC is authorized to refuse admission of the  shipment. Consumer products that are refused admission will be  destroyed unless the Secretary of the Treasury allows the product to be  exported.  CPSC may instead instruct CBP to seize shipments upon  finding a prohibited act, which according to CPSC is the most common  outcome when a violation is discovered. The importer may be subject to  civil or criminal penalties.  See figure 1 for an overview of CBP andpections at ports of entry.  CPSC\u2019s current process for conducting ins CPSC relies on CBP to carry out key import surveillance activities at ports  of entry. In addition to its numerous antiterrorism and trade  responsibilities, CBP faces pressure from the international trade  community to quickly move compliant shipments into commerce. Factors  such as the high volume of containers, financial incentives for  longshoremen to unload ships quickly, and the limited amount of time  CBP has to identify and examine cargo contribute to the challenges CBP  faces in facilitating commerce. In addition, CBP enforces regulations for  45 other federal agencies. Importers place pressure on CBP to correctly  identify violations because the cost of storing CBP-detained products at  privately run container examination stations is high.

As described  above, CPSC primarily protects consumers from unreasonable risk of  injury by promulgating mandatory standards and working with private  standard-setting organizations to promulgate voluntary standards, and  CPSC has broad authority to enforce those standards at ports of entry. In  particular, CPSC and other product safety experts believe CPSC\u2019s  enforcement of mandatory standards at ports of entry will be strengthened  because now all products subject to a mandatory standard under any law  administered by CPSC must be accompanied by a certification of  compliance that is supported by product testing. In addition, every  manufacturer or private labeler of a product subject to a children\u2019s  product safety rule must have samples of the product tested by an  accredited third-party laboratory for conformance with the applicable  mandatory standard. For many years, CPSC focused import surveillance  activities on enforcement of certain mandatory standards for consumer  products, primarily toys, fireworks, and lighters. The new testing  requirement puts greater burden on industry to ensure that products  comply with mandatory standards. If implemented properly, CPSC should  be able to use the testing and certification requirements to strengthen  surveillance of regulated products at ports of entry.", "Furthermore, CPSC believes its ability to monitor compliance with  voluntary standards at ports of entry will be strengthened by new  authority to create a \u201csubstantial product hazard list.\u201d  As described  above, many consumer products are produced according to voluntary  standards. In addition, many products are subject to no standards. CPSC  primarily protects consumers from unsafe products subject to voluntary or  no standards by declaring them \u201csubstantial product hazards\u201d when the  products have a defect that creates a substantial risk of injury. However,  CPSC faces difficulty at ports of entry identifying defects in products  subject to voluntary or no standards because defects are not always  apparent until the product has been used by the public. With  implementation of the substantial product hazard list, CPSC will be able to  target new shipments and refuse admission of products subject to  voluntary standards that it has already determined have a defect  constituting a substantial risk of injury.", "Despite this broad authority, CPSC has made limited progress in  measuring the effectiveness of its authorities to prevent the entry of  unsafe consumer products. CPSC measures the performance of its import  surveillance program by the number of product samples collected and by  the number of samples ultimately found to be unsafe and therefore seized.  CPSC is now considering altering this metric so that it will track all  shipments that CPSC investigators examine, rather than just those samples  collected and tested. Furthermore, CPSC measures the performance of its  Office of International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs by the  number of outreach events conducted. These metrics provide measures of  the output of program staff but do not necessarily provide accurate  measures of the effectiveness of the programs. In the 1990s, CPSC used  industry compliance with mandatory standards as an alternative basis for  measuring the agency\u2019s effectiveness, what it termed the Comprehensive  Plan. The plan was designed to examine the compliance of these products  with mandatory standards on a periodic basis and then identify problem  areas for focusing limited agency resources. CPSC did not continue the  Comprehensive Plan after the mid-1990s because the data indicated that  compliance was high, and CPSC believed that the plan did not help it  address problems with noncompliant products. CPSC sought information  from the public in 2008 to develop a new methodology that would replace  the Comprehensive Plan. CPSC reported receiving two responses, but  commission staff stated that they did not pursue further work because the  responses did not address their needs for developing new performance  measures. While CPSC recognizes the need for outcome-oriented  performance measures and has taken steps to develop new measures,  without these measures, CPSC may not be able to determine how effective  its authorities are for preventing the entry of unsafe products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation of CPSC\u2019s New Authorities to Prevent Entry of Unsafe Products into the United States Has Been Delayed", "paragraphs": ["While CPSC has broad authority to prevent the entry of unsafe consumer  products into the United States, there have been delays in implementing  new authorities CPSC received in CPSIA. According to CPSC, the agency  has more than 40 rulemakings to conduct under CPSIA, including  approximately 20 rulemakings to initiate or complete by August 2010,  which has contributed to the delay in implementing the act. In particular,  the two new authorities discussed above\u2014certain testing and certification  requirements and the substantial product hazard list\u2014have not been  implemented. CPSC issued a stay of enforcement of certain testing and  certification requirements until February 10, 2010, delaying  implementation of these standards and raising questions among  manufacturers subject to this requirement. CPSC stated that it did not  complete the rulemaking process because it was unable to respond to  innumerable inquiries from industry seeking relief from the testing  requirement at a time when the agency faced severe resource limitations  because it was operating under the prior year\u2019s budget. In addition, to date  CPSC has not conducted rulemaking to implement the substantial product  hazard list. The effectiveness of CPSC\u2019s new authorities will not be clear  until CPSC completes its rulemaking and demonstrates the ability to  enforce these regulations.", "Another factor contributing to delays in implementation of new authorities  is the need for CPSC to balance its mission to protect consumers with  industry interests. CPSC\u2019s mission is to protect the public from  unreasonable risk of injury associated with consumer products, and CPSC  is also required to work with industry to develop product safety standards,  collect information about unsafe products, and conduct recalls. Private  companies have expressed concerns about CPSC\u2019s implementation of  CPSIA, particularly the expanded testing and certification requirements,  which, as noted earlier, helped contribute to CPSC\u2019s decision to delay  enforcement of these provisions. In public comments on CPSIA, several  industry representatives commented that the certification requirements  are duplicative and could cause them to incur tremendous costs due to the  complexity of their business operations. For example, industry  representatives stated that large manufacturers produce hundreds of  thousands of variations of their products that may require testing and  certification, while small manufacturers may have limited product lines  across which to spread costs.", "In addition to industry concerns, CPSC has also faced concerns from  consumers that CPSC\u2019s implementation of CPSIA has not, at times,  fulfilled the consumer protection goals of the act. In one recent example,  consumer groups challenged CPSC\u2019s advisory opinion that CPSIA\u2019s  provisions prohibiting the sale of children\u2019s products that contain certain  chemicals called phthalates did not apply retroactively to inventories  existing prior to the effective date of the prohibitions. These groups were  concerned that if the phthalate prohibitions were not applied retroactively,  consumers would continue to be exposed to unsafe products in the  marketplace. The consumer groups filed suit in a federal district court  seeking a declaratory judgment that CPSC\u2019s advisory opinion, which was  issued at the request of certain wholesale and retail entities, was contrary  to CPSIA, and thus violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The district  court held that the phthalate prohibitions in CSPIA unambiguously applied  to existing inventory and set aside CPSC\u2019s opinion.", "According to some industry representatives we interviewed, retailers are  taking the lead in product testing and certification in response to  industry\u2019s uncertainty over how CPSC will enforce CPSIA provisions.  These representatives believed that retailers are ahead of CPSC in this  regard. For example, one industry group said that although CPSC has  stayed enforcement of many of its certification requirements, retailers still  require suppliers to provide certifications, and some retailers had more  stringent lead standards than CPSIA. According to industry groups, U.S.  companies, particularly retailers, have an incentive to institute and enforce  stringent product safety standards because selling products that cause  injury or death can have negative impacts on their brands. The U.S. tort  system that exposes companies selling unsafe products to lawsuits also  helps to ensure that companies comply with product safety standards. To  respond to industry concerns about how to comply with safety standards  under current and prior consumer product safety laws, some industry  groups have also developed or are developing their own testing and  certification programs. CPSC indicated that while these types of  programs can help improve compliance with safety standards, there are  limits to how well this type of industry self-regulation can be used to  protect consumers. They indicated that there is a trade-off between  consumer protection and industry cooperation; if the requirements are too  onerous, companies might not participate in these voluntary programs.  Balancing the interests of both consumer and industry participants adds  complexity in completing CPSC\u2019s implementation of CPSIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Needs Better Targeting Information to Strengthen Enforcement with CBP at Ports of Entry", "paragraphs": ["CPSC needs better targeting information to strengthen its ability to  identify risks from imported products and communicate inspection  priorities to CBP.

CPSC and the former U.S. Customs Service (now CBP)  established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 1990 that serves as  the foundation for the working relationship of the agencies for  enforcement of CPSC\u2019s authorities over imported products. For example,  the MOU provides for \u201cthe joint conduct of a mutually agreed number of  high-visibility, intensive inspection operations annually.\u201d This provision is  consistent with CPSC\u2019s informal system for targeting risks. The MOU is  now out of date and does not reflect anticipated changes to CPSC\u2019s  relationship with CBP required under CPSIA. CPSIA requires CPSC, by  August 2010, to develop a methodology for identifying shipments of  imported consumer products that are likely to violate import provisions  enforced by CPSC. A CPSC official told us that, as part of the agency\u2019s  work to develop this risk assessment methodology, CPSC plans to create a  flowchart of the current product-entry process to identify gaps in any  current CPSC authorities to stop unsafe products at the ports. The official  noted that CPSC anticipates completing the flowchart later this year.  Updating the 1990 MOU between CPSC and CBP and thereby revisiting the  roles and responsibilities of each agency would be a useful way for CPSC  to identify gaps in the current product entry process and speed completion  of its risk assessment methodology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Advance Shipment Data Would Strengthen CPSC\u2019s Targeting Efforts", "paragraphs": ["During interviews with CPSC staff and our visit to a U.S. port of entry to  determine how CPSC prevents the entry of unsafe products into the  United States, we found that CPSC does not have access to CBP data that  would provide CPSC with information about products in a shipment  before it arrives in the United States. CPSC has access to entry summary  data, which CBP generally receives shortly before a shipment enters the  United States or, in some cases, as many as 10 days after the shipment has  been released into commerce. However, CPSC does not have access to  manifest data, which is provided to CBP 24 hours before a shipping vessel  bound for the United States is loaded at a foreign port. CPSC and CBP  established a second MOU in 2002, which superseded the 1990 MOU,  specifying procedures and guidelines for information sharing between the  agencies with a particular focus on CPSC access to CBP data systems. The  2002 MOU was intended to allow CPSC access to both entry summary and  manifest data. According to a CPSC official, CBP has not provided CPSC  with access to manifest data because it believed the data were not specific  enough for CPSC purposes. For instance, the manifest data generally do  not include the name of the importer and may not have specific  Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes to help CPSC identify the merchandise  in the shipment. However, CPSC still believes that manifest data will help  the agency improve its targeting, as it will give CPSC more timely  information on shipments and potentially more specific information as  CPSC seeks to revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule codes to better align  them with the categories of products they regulate. CBP also  acknowledged that, while CPSC can use the entry summary data to target  future shipments for inspection, CPSC cannot place inspection holds on  shipments that are about to depart for or are in transit to the United States  without the manifest data. In comparing CPSC border surveillance  activities with those of other federal agencies that regulate the safety of  products used by consumers, we found that FDA has a stronger capability  to target imports using CBP data (discussed further below). FDA receives  advance shipment data from CBP of all entries containing food under FDA  jurisdiction that arrive at ports, which FDA then screens electronically  against criteria it developed to detect potential violations.", "CPSC and CBP state that they have been working together to resolve  information-sharing issues. Specifically, in February 2007, CPSC applied  for access to the International Trade Data System (ITDS), which CBP  intends to be a single source for import and export documentation that is  to provide participating agencies quicker access to data and improved  ability to identify potentially unsafe shipments of consumer products. As  part of the application process, CPSC has submitted to CBP for review an  operations plan (a \u201cConcept of Operations\u201d or \u201cConOps\u201d) and an update to  the 2002 MOU with guidelines for the exchange of information. The  agencies have had follow-up discussions on these plans; however, CBP has  reported that implementation of ITDS has been delayed. As a result,  CPSC\u2019s efforts to access more complete import data to help it better target  incoming shipments have also been delayed. CPSC staff said that they  anticipate this work will not be completed until at least 2011.", "In addition to this effort, CPSIA requires CPSC and CBP to improve  information sharing and coordination. Specifically, CPSIA requires CPSC  to develop, by August 2009, a plan for sharing information and  coordinating with CBP. According to CPSIA, the proposed plan is to  consider, at a minimum, the number of CPSC staff that should be stationed  at U.S. ports and the nature and extent of cooperation between CPSC and  CBP at the ports. The plan is also to discuss the nature and extent of  cooperation between CPSC and CBP at the National Targeting Center or  its equivalent. CPSC has not completed this plan, and it is unlikely to do  so until it updates information-sharing agreements with CBP.", "A CPSC official told us that as part of developing this plan for sharing  information with CBP, CPSC is seeking to assign a staff member to a  planned CBP targeting center that would focus on health and safety issues.  This targeting center, which would be equivalent to the National Targeting  Center, would seek to identify shipments of imported products that should  be stopped at the ports for further screening and review. A CPSC official  said that, in assigning a staff person to this targeting center, the agency  would have access to CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System. However,  creation of the health and safety planned targeting center has been  delayed, so CPSC has not been able to place staff at the center or access  CBP targeting information, delaying its ability to better target imported  products. A CPSC official explained that the analytical approach that FDA  took by creating its own system for analyzing data would require a  considerable investment of both time and money. CPSC prefers the option  of working with CBP through the planned targeting center to leverage this  analytical capability. CPSC believes this option would be more efficient  than developing its own system to analyze data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CPSC\u2019s Enforcement of Import Safety Authorities Is Limited by Resource and Practical Constraints", "paragraphs": ["CPSC\u2019s enforcement of its authorities to prevent the entry of unsafe  products into the United States is limited by resource and practical  constraints. Specifically, CPSC has few staff at ports of entry and limited  analytical and laboratory support. Furthermore, although CPSC has  authority to destroy products refused admission, it lacks a source of  funding to immediately pay for the costs of destruction. In addition, while  CPSC has authority to condition the importation of consumer products  based on compliance with CPSC inspection requirements, there are  practical constraints on the agency\u2019s ability to conduct inspections of  foreign manufacturing plants.", "CPSC\u2019s ability to inspect shipments for potential violations at ports of  entry is limited by resource constraints, such as few staff at ports and  limited analytical and laboratory support. In passing CPSIA, Congress  recognized the need to strengthen CPSC\u2019s resources, including  requirements that CPSC increase the number of full-time employees to at  least 500 by fiscal year 2013 and that CPSC hire additional personnel to be  assigned to U.S. ports of entry. As noted above, CPSC had 9 compliance  investigators stationed at 7 ports as of July 2009, as well as 100 product  safety investigators in 48 other locations across that country that may help  to conduct periodic inspections at ports of entry. CBP staff indicated that  having a CPSC compliance investigator collocated at ports has been  useful, and during our visit to a U.S. port of entry we saw the cooperative  relationship between agency officials. Furthermore, a CPSC official said  that currently there is limited analytical support at CPSC headquarters to  assist in import surveillance work. According to CPSC, the agency cannot  establish a greater presence at U.S. ports without having the requisite  analytical support. CPSC also has limited laboratory support for testing  potentially unsafe products and has faced significant backlogs at various  times. As of April 2009, CPSC had 28 engineers and scientists at its  laboratory. CPSC\u2019s laboratory facility is located across the country from  where a large percentage of imported goods enter the United States.  Moreover, fireworks, which are heavily targeted for inspection, must be  tested at a separate facility under current procedures. As a result of these  conditions, testing backlogs have inhibited import surveillance efforts. In  May 2009, CPSC announced that it had secured and was in the process of  outfitting a new laboratory with enhanced testing facilities. CPSC also  announced that certain support staff from CPSC headquarters would be  collocated at the lab to assist the laboratory staff. However, the new  facilities still cannot accommodate fireworks testing. Moreover, the new  facility does not provide CPSC with a presence on the West Coast, where  many consumer products enter the United States. As discussed below, in  comparing CPSC\u2019s resources supporting border surveillance with those of  other federal agencies that regulate the safety of products used by  consumers, particularly FDA and USDA, we found that CPSC\u2019s resources  are much less than those of these other agencies.", "According to CPSC and CBP, CPSC can refuse entry for products that  violate U.S. laws, but CPSC does not have immediate funding available to  subsequently destroy these products if the importers do not destroy or  export these products at their own expense. Instead, CPSC generally asks  CBP to seize unsafe products, and CBP is authorized to access the U.S.  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Forfeiture Fund to cover the cost of product  destruction. The Treasury Forfeiture Fund is also available to CBP for  other enforcement purposes, so that any money CBP uses for destroying  seized products reduces the amount of money available to CBP for other  purposes. Moreover, CBP is concerned that the costs of product  destruction are likely to increase as CPSC fully implements CPSIA.  Although CBP requires that formal entries be covered by a bond, which is  another funding source that may be used to cover the cost of product  destruction, we found that CBP has not pursued bonds for that purpose  because they may not cover the full cost of destruction. CPSC officials  also noted that bonds are not immediately available for product  destruction but may only be recovered to reimburse destruction costs.  However, a new mandate in CPSIA requires CPSC to work with CBP to set  bond amounts sufficient to cover these costs. CBP and CPSC\u2019s efforts to  implement this requirement are still in process. Given the limited  resources immediately available for product destruction, CBP indicated  that CPSC and other federal agencies might explore other funding sources  for this purpose. However, we previously found that estimating the cost of  destroying consumer products is difficult given the wide range of products  CPSC oversees, making it challenging to determine the appropriate size of  a dedicated fund. In addition to setting aside enough funds for product  destruction, CPSC would have to consider establishing parameters on the  use of any funding source it administers.", "While CPSC has broad authority to conduct inspections of manufacturers  and importers, significant resource and practical constraints limit its  ability to conduct traditional inspections of foreign manufacturing plants.  CPSC is required by rule to condition the import of a consumer product on  the product manufacturer\u2019s compliance with CPSC inspection and  recordkeeping requirements. CPSC does not conduct inspections in  foreign countries, and CPSC and many product safety and international  trade experts cite several constraints on its ability to do so. Specifically,  these parties state that U.S. inspectors would likely need the consent of  both the foreign manufacturer and the foreign government to conduct an  inspection. Other experts stated that such consent from a foreign  government, if granted, may be accompanied by a request for the same  rights to inspect U.S. manufacturing plants. Another constraint on  inspections of foreign manufacturers is that such a program would need to  be prohibitively large in order to be effective, perhaps larger than CPSC\u2019s  domestic inspection program. As noted earlier, CPSC had about 100  product safety investigators in 48 locations to conduct its domestic  inspections as of July 2009. Also, it is not clear what CPSC would look for  when inspecting foreign manufacturing plants given that CPSC evaluates  the final product for compliance with product safety regulations rather  than the production process. As noted above, CPSC may condition the  import of consumer products on cooperation with inspections. However,  ensuring that the specific manufacturer\u2019s products do not enter the United  States would be difficult without detailed knowledge of individual  companies\u2019 supply chains, which could be gained through inspection of  the manufacturer\u2019s records. Due to these legal and practical constraints,  CPSC stated that expanding its international education and outreach  activities rather than conducting inspections of foreign manufacturing  plants would more effectively prevent the entry of unsafe consumer  products."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Authorities of Select Agencies Are Comparable to CPSC\u2019s, but FDA and USDA\u2019s Border Surveillance Activities and Overseas Presence Provide Useful Information for Strengthening CPSC\u2019s Implementation of Its Authorities", "paragraphs": ["CPSC\u2019s regulatory authority to prevent the entry of unsafe imports is  generally comparable to that of certain other federal agencies with  substantial responsibility over the safety of products entering the United  States.

CPSC\u2019s authorities  provide it with similar or stronger authority to require or engage in certain  activities compared with the authorities of the other agencies we studied.", "Safety standards: All of these agencies have authority to regulate and  enforce product safety standards or bans relevant to products under their  jurisdiction.", "Border surveillance: All of these agencies except NHTSA appear to have  specific authority to conduct border surveillance activities and broad  authority to refuse entry to items that fail to comply with relevant  standards, among other things. NHTSA officials told us that, like CPSC,  NHTSA requests that CBP detain and seize products at the border on its  behalf.", "Product certification/testing: Similar to FDA, manufacturers must certify  to CPSC that their products comply with relevant standards, and this  certification must be based on a reasonable testing program or, in the case  of certain children\u2019s products, the tests must be performed by third  parties. Under FSIS, containers of eggs, egg products, poultry, and meat  must be labeled as having passed inspection. Although NHTSA authorities  require manufacturers of vehicles and equipment to certify that products  comply with applicable federal safety standards, these certifications are  not required to be based on testing.", "Temporary hold at ports: CPSC, FDA, FSIS, and APHIS have the authority  to temporarily hold shipments at U.S. ports for inspection.", "Foreign inspection: Like FDA and FSIS, CPSC is not expressly prohibited  from requesting consent to inspect foreign facilities. Specifically, CPSC  may request inspection of foreign manufacturing or distribution facilities,  third-party testing laboratories, or conveyances used to transport  consumer products in commerce. As discussed above, CPSC does not  conduct foreign inspections. Both FSIS and FDA have been successful in  obtaining access to foreign facilities for the purpose of inspections or  audits where incentives are strong for foreign entities to grant this access.  For example, access is generally provided for requests that are tied to  applications or audits before products may be eligible for import into the  United States. FDA officials told us that in practice, if a foreign firm  refuses to permit such an inspection, FDA can sometimes refuse  admission of products offered for import into the U.S.  For example, the  refusal to permit an inspection could lead to a product not receiving a  required pre-market approval or the refusal to permit an inspection,  combined with other information, could support a determination of the  appearance of a violation. According to NHTSA, it does not have the  authority to inspect foreign facilities for the manufacture of vehicles and  vehicle equipment imported into the United States.", "Consent to local court jurisdiction: Based on our interviews with officials  at the federal agencies we studied, none of the agencies requires foreign  manufacturers to consent to the jurisdiction of local courts with respect to  enforcement actions. Some agencies, including CPSC, told us they do not  see a need for this requirement, as they have been able to effectively carry  out their enforcement duties under existing authorities. For example,  foreign manufacturers seeking to offer motor vehicles for import into the  United States are required by statute to designate a U.S. resident or firm as  its agent to receive service of notices and process in administrative and  judicial proceedings, and service on the agent is deemed to be service on  the foreign manufacturer or importer. Also, FSIS told us that they expect  foreign governments to carry out enforcement actions for their  manufacturers that are certified to export to the United States. CPSC  noted that it has satisfied its enforcement objectives by pursuing the  domestic partners\u2014manufacturers, importers, and retailers\u2014of the  foreign manufacturer without needing to resort to adjudicative  proceedings. For example, in June 2009, CPSC reached a $2.3 million  settlement with Mattel, Inc., regarding the importation of toys made in  China that violated a federal ban on paint containing lead. Furthermore,  CPSC also has the ability to settle enforcement actions with foreign  parties. For example, in July 2009, CPSC reached a $50,000 settlement with  a Hong Kong corporation with offices in the United States regarding the  importation of toys manufactured in China that also violated the  commission\u2019s lead paint ban. Finally, CPSC staff we interviewed stated  that the agency prefers to expand its international education and outreach  programs rather than require foreign manufacturers to consent to U.S.  jurisdiction to effectively prevent the entry of unsafe products, although  they acknowledged that consent to jurisdiction or a requirement of a U.S.  agent for service of process would be helpful. Appendix II contains a  more detailed discussion of the elements of establishing personal  jurisdiction in U.S. courts.", "The requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act appear to demand  more from manufacturers than NHTSA with respect to preventing the  entry of unsafe imports. NHTSA\u2019s key authorities to ensure the safety of  imported goods are to prescribe mandatory vehicle safety standards and to  require foreign and domestic manufacturers to certify compliance with  these standards. However, these certifications are not required to be based  on a testing program, unlike CPSC\u2019s new certification requirements for  children\u2019s products, nor are the results of any testing required to be  reported to NHTSA as a condition to entry. Appendix III contains a more  detailed description of the agencies\u2019 key authorities for preventing the  entry of unsafe products.", "Where key differences exist in these agencies\u2019 authorities, they appear to  be due to differences in the types of products under an agency\u2019s  jurisdiction and the particular risks that are presented. As such, these  differences are not directly applicable to CPSC as it improves its ability to  ensure the safety of imported goods.", "FSIS\u2019s foreign country equivalency: A major feature of FSIS\u2019s framework  for ensuring the safety of imported meat, poultry, and egg products is a  requirement that foreign countries have a certified food safety system  equivalent to that of the United States. As of fiscal year 2008, 34 foreign  countries were eligible to import these products into the United States.  According to an FSIS budget document, the United States invests  substantial resources, over $800 million in fiscal year 2008, in the  inspection of domestic products. The amount of funds spent on domestic  inspection is relevant given that the concept of foreign equivalency is  predicated on there being a domestic inspection program. As such, it is  unclear how FSIS\u2019s country equivalency program could be adapted for  CPSC given that CPSC does not have comparable resources for the  inspection of domestic products, with a budget of about $80 million in  fiscal year 2008 for all of its activities. Furthermore, the concept of  equivalency for meat, poultry, and egg products is established in a 1994  multilateral trade agreement, to which the United States is a signatory.  According to the United States Trade Representative, it is not clear  whether any WTO Agreement to which the United States is a party  specifically precludes application of an equivalency requirement to  consumer products.", "FDA\u2019s preapproval of certain drugs and medical devices: In addition,  FDA requires drug manufacturers to obtain prior approval for marketing  certain drugs in the United States and for selling certain medical devices.  However, FDA\u2019s prior approval requirement would be inefficient for CPSC  given the diversity of products it oversees and the frequency with which  these products change or are updated. CPSC oversees thousands of types  of consumer products, and many of the products it oversees, especially  toys, change or are updated every year.", "Other key statutory differences across agency authorities need not be  addressed by providing CPSC with new authorities because CPSC officials  have told us they already consider CPSC to have similar authorities.", "Agreements with foreign governments and overseas presence: FDA is  authorized to participate through appropriate processes with  representatives of other foreign countries to reduce the burden of  regulation, harmonize regulatory requirements, and achieve appropriate  reciprocal arrangements, including international agreements such as  mutual recognition agreements, agreements to facilitate commerce in  devices, and memorandums of understanding, among other things. As  discussed below, CPSC already has MOUs with foreign governments,  including China and the EU, and is finalizing plans for its first overseas  office in Beijing, China, in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Agencies\u2019 Border Surveillance and Overseas Activities to Prevent the Entry of Unsafe Products May Be Useful for CPSC to Consider", "paragraphs": ["As CPSC considers ways to improve its ability to prevent the entry of  unsafe imports, various agencies\u2019 border surveillance and outreach  activities to foreign governments and industry provide useful information.  FDA, FSIS, and APHIS have expansive border surveillance activities based  on the amount of data obtained on incoming shipments, number of staff  supporting border surveillance operations, and targeting programs and  information technology systems that help to integrate data from various  sources for use in making border entry decisions. These capabilities  enable these agencies to screen incoming shipments for a greater number  of risks than CPSC does. According to data provided by CPSC, the agency  has generally focused on relatively few categories of consumer products  since 2001, specifically toys, fireworks, lighters, and electrical products  (such as holiday lights and extension cords).", "FDA and FSIS have better access to data for screening incoming  shipments than CPSC. FDA receives shipment data from CBP for all  entries under FDA jurisdiction that are imported or offered for import,  which FDA then screens electronically against criteria it developed to  detect potential violations, including information from domestic  surveillance and outreach to foreign governments. In addition, the Public  Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002  requires that FDA be given advance notice on shipments of imported food.   FDA allows importers to provide this data no more than 30 days in  advance of the date of arrival. This advance information helps FDA  determine whether the food potentially poses a bioterrorism or other  significant health risk such that FDA should deploy resources to the port  of arrival so that an inspection can be conducted before the product enters  the United States. FDA officials told us that this information has been so  important in screening food shipments for potential violations that they  are considering expanding prior notification requirements to all products  the agency oversees. FSIS requires by regulation that various information  accompany shipments of meat, poultry, and egg products in order to be  considered for admission into the United States, including a foreign health  certificate. As discussed earlier, while CPSC receives entry summary data  regarding shipments already released into commerce, CPSC does not  receive data on incoming shipments prior to their arrival at U.S. ports of  entry, though CBP receives such data as much as 24 hours before the  shipment is loaded in the foreign port. Without advance shipment data,  CPSC lacks information that other agencies have found useful in screening  incoming shipments for potential safety violations.", "FDA and USDA have significantly more staff supporting border  operations than CPSC. Federal agencies assign staff resources to border  operations to identify and refuse admission to potentially unsafe imported  products. NHTSA has no staff dedicated to border operations, but instead  relies on CBP to screen incoming shipments and third-party laboratories  to test pulled shipments. However, FDA, FSIS, and APHIS assign  significantly more staff resources to border operations. According to FSIS  officials, the agency physically examines 100 percent of meat, poultry, and  egg product shipments presented for import with about 75 inspectors  located at approximately 150 facilities near 35 border entry points. In  addition, FSIS employed 20 import surveillance officers as of fiscal year  2009. APHIS officials told us 100 percent of plants and animals are  inspected in cooperation with CBP. Because of the high percentage of  shipments that are inspected, staff resources are accordingly greater. For  example, about 1,800 port staff had been assigned to inspect fruit and  plants at 139 ports of entry as of 2003. FDA examines approximately 1  percent of food presented for import and has requested about $382 million  for fiscal year 2010 for activities that support import safety. This amount  would fund approximately 700 staff supporting import examinations alone,  including port operations, of which 78 percent would be field based. FDA  personnel cover most ports of entry into the United States, including 297  ports in fiscal year 2008, but for the ports where FDA does not maintain a  normal presence, it coordinates with CBP to ensure it is notified of  relevant incoming shipments for which examination and/or sampling may  take place. FDA\u2019s border inspection activities are supported by  compliance programs for agency field staff to use in carrying out  inspections, sample collections, and analyses, among other things. For  food safety alone, there are approximately 25 compliance programs and 12  that cover different imported foods. While FDA, FSIS, and APHIS have  significant resources devoted to the port and overseas activities, they still  face significant challenges in ensuring that products entering the United  States are safe for consumers. As discussed earlier, CPSC has 9  compliance investigators at seven ports of entry, as well as about 100  product safety investigators located across the United States who work  episodically to support the import surveillance program. Although the  missions of FDA, USDA, and CPSC differ, CPSC\u2019s staff resources  supporting border surveillance are much less than the staff resources of  these other agencies and may not be adequate to prevent unsafe products  from entering the United States.", "FDA and USDA have more sophisticated information technology systems  and analytical support to target potential risks at border entry points. FDA,  FSIS, and APHIS invest significant resources in information technology  systems that support border surveillance efforts. To oversee inspection of  plants and animals, CBP created positions in each of its 20 district offices for  agriculture liaisons. These liaisons not only advise CBP on border  surveillance operations but also report back to APHIS on risks detected at the  border for the purpose of expanding targeting operations. These liaisons have  access to CBP\u2019s Automated Targeting System, a computer system that stores  detailed information from cargo manifests and other documents that shipping  companies are required to provide before shipments arrive at ports for  inspection. This system allows border staff to focus inspections on higher  risk cargo. FSIS invests substantially\u2014nearly $1 billion\u2014in data  infrastructure systems to assist its border inspections by linking inspection  data with other public health information that is designed for FSIS to quickly  and accurately identify trends and vulnerabilities affecting meat, poultry, and  egg products. In addition, FSIS has developed a centralized computer  system\u2014the Automated Import Information System (AIIS)\u2014that links all  ports and tracks prior inspection results from each country and each foreign  establishment for use in generating the type of inspection required on  incoming shipments. FDA also uses an electronic environment\u2014 Operational and Administrative System for Import Support (OASIS)\u2014to  screen shipments presented for entry for relative risks and for making entry  or inspection decisions. OASIS links with other data systems within FDA to leverage the latest information relating to public health. Also, FDA staff  manually enter criteria into OASIS from sources such as import alert  documents so that products can be flagged as they enter U.S. custom territory for the appearance of violations. According to FDA officials, there  are currently about 270 import alerts in effect. FDA officials also told us that  the overseas audits and direct communication with foreign governments  provide useful information in helping border surveillance agents make entry  determination decisions. As discussed earlier, CPSC targets few produ border inspections and has not developed formal systems for assessing risk and providing port staff with risk management tools.", "Whereas border surveillance efforts are geared toward intercepting  potentially unsafe products at U.S. borders, outreach activities focused  overseas may prevent potentially unsafe products from being shipped to  U.S. ports. To this end, FDA and USDA assign staff to permanent positions  in foreign countries and send staff overseas on a temporary basis to  conduct educational workshops, as well as to conduct audits and  inspections. Furthermore, some agencies have established cooperative  agreements with foreign agencies to facilitate product safety.", "FDA and APHIS overseas outreach efforts help inform agencies about  unsafe products. APHIS has more than 80 people around the world  working with foreign embassies on plant and animal health issues. FDA  announced the opening of offices in three cities in China in November  2008, and it has also announced plans to place technical experts and  inspectors in four other regions, including Europe, India, Latin America,  and the Middle East. These staff would be supported by approximately 8  staff in FDA headquarters in the United States. In addition, FDA has plans  to hire 20 locally employed staff. FDA staff told us that an in-country  presence is useful in preventing the entry of unsafe products because it  improves the information border agents have to make entry decisions and  allows the agency to train foreign establishments about compliance  requirements. As discussed in more detail later, CPSC states that, with  increased resources, it plans to open its first overseas office in Beijing,  China, to facilitate safety efforts with one of the largest exporters of  consumer products to the United States.", "FDA and FSIS conduct temporary visits, audits, or investigations in  foreign countries that help to build foreign awareness of U.S. product  safety laws. FSIS conducts on-site audits of foreign manufacturers as part  of its systems equivalence determinations of foreign countries\u2019 food safety  systems. FDA officials told us that the audits and announced inspections it  conducts of overseas manufacturers are very useful in training these  manufacturers about U.S. standards. Furthermore, FDA has reported that  it has engaged in a variety of efforts with foreign governments to build  foreign capacity and provide technical assistance. For example, they  report holding regional workshops in Peru and China, participating in a  multilateral food safety meeting geared toward developing a rapid alert  system, and auditing Chinese government inspectors during their review  of 13 Chinese firms to detect drug residues in aquaculture products. As  discussed earlier, CPSC does not conduct foreign inspections. However,  CPSC staff have conducted visits to foreign manufacturing plants with the  permission of the foreign government. CPSC also has plans for conducting  three outreach and training events each for foreign government officials  and foreign manufacturers in fiscal year 2010, but the agency is limited in  its outreach efforts due to limited numbers of staff.", "FDA and FSIS have actively engaged with foreign governments on food  safety. FDA has actively engaged with foreign governments to develop  cooperative arrangements and agreements, including a substantial number  of international government-to-government agreements. FDA\u2019s Web site  indicates a total of 63 MOUs or other cooperative agreements with about  25 different foreign countries.

According to  the OECD, a fundamental objective of consumer product safety policy is to  prevent consumers from suffering harm as a consequence of using  products that present an unreasonable risk of injury. While these countries  have similar authorities, however, the implementation of those authorities  may be different. For example, all the countries monitor both domestically  manufactured and imported products, and all conduct some type of  product testing and/or sampling. However, some of the countries monitor  goods on their own initiative, while others operate on the basis of  complaints that they receive about particular goods and products.", "According to the officials representing the countries we reviewed, none of  those countries has the authority to conduct an extraterritorial inspection  of the facilities of a foreign manufacturer that exports products to that  country. In most cases, these officials stated that the countries have been  more successful in working with the exporting country and its  manufacturers in order to correct problems that may arise. These officials  also stated that none of the countries we reviewed has the authority to  require foreign manufacturers to consent to local jurisdiction. U.S.  Embassy and Australian government officials indicated that, under current  law, Australia could ask foreign jurisdictions to enforce Australian  consumer product safety laws; however, the Australian government  prefers other methods, such as approaching manufacturers directly to  raise safety concerns.", "The approach countries take to consumer product safety begins  fundamentally with how they define \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d products. The  definitions vary considerably from country to country, as indicated in  appendix IV. According to a report by the OECD, most countries apply  broad principles to determine whether a product can be defined as safe.  For example, according to this report, in some countries (Japan, the  United States, and the EU) all products must meet a positive standard\u2014 that is, they should be safe for consumers to use or consume prior to  market distribution. Businesses selling unsafe goods may be subject to  regulatory action, regardless of whether the product has caused a specific  accident, injury, or harm to a consumer. In other countries (Australia and  Canada), according to the OECD report, products must not breach a  negative standard\u2014that is, once the goods are placed on the market they  should not carry an unreasonable risk of injury or death. The report notes  that producers are held liable for the negative effects of their products  once placed on the market.", "According to officials, some variations exist with other authorities. They  noted that in most of the countries we reviewed only a relatively small  number of imported consumer products are subject to mandatory  standards. However, according to a senior representative of an industrial  association in Europe, the wide variety of product standards among  countries, combined with variable concepts and legal interpretations  applied by governments makes it difficult for industry to ensure safety and  for countries to coordinate enforcement efforts. There are also differences  in the case of product certification. Officials stated that neither Australia  nor Canada requires certification for imported products. According to  Japanese government officials, certain imported and domestic products in  Japan are subject to product testing and cannot be sold in Japan without  certification to prescribed standards. In the EU, according to official  documentation, businesses must carry out conformity and safety  assessments of their products in accordance with the General Product  Safety Directive (GPSD), and businesses are required to certify that their  products are safe, as defined under GPSD. The documentation indicates  that for some products self-declaration is sufficient, but other products  require third-party verification.", "According to the OECD report on consumer product safety, institutional  structures for product safety can also vary from country to country, which  can sometimes create challenges for coordination within and among  countries and, in many cases, accounts for differences in enforcement and  implementation of authorities. The report states that in Canada, consumer  product safety policy, development, enforcement, information, and  education functions are in one organization, Health Canada, with the  provinces retaining some enforcement responsibilities. In the United  States, CPSC is the primary agency responsible for implementing and  enforcing federal consumer product safety laws and establishing  consumer product safety policy. The OECD report further notes that some  countries have institutional arrangements that separate policy and  enforcement functions. In Japan, for example, policy responsibility is  spread across the government in a range of departments, with a central  coordinating function in a central policy agency (the Cabinet Office).  Certain other countries, such as Australia, have regionally focused policy  and enforcement structures for consumer product safety that reflect a  division of powers and responsibilities between the national government  and states, provinces or regions. In the EU, policy responsibilities lie with  the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU responsible for  defining and implementing its policies and running its programs. However,  individual EU member countries are responsible in their respective  territories for enforcement\u2014market surveillance, product monitoring and  testing, and possible restrictive or corrective actions.", "Countries also share similar challenges as they respond to changing  demands in the international market place. Similar to the United States,  national governments\u2019 efforts to address import safety problems have  intensified in light of the growing volume of imports entering each country  and recent consumer safety incidents. According to the OECD report,  many countries face enforcement challenges at both domestic and  international levels, including  inconsistent laws, regulations, standards, and sanctions within  countries and across borders;  ineffective cooperation and liaison among agencies involved in  consumer product safety enforcement; and  insufficient sharing of injury information across borders.", "Governments have taken a variety of actions to address these challenges,  including enacting new laws and regulations and, in some cases, they have  created new organizations to address new consumer safety challenges.

In the United States, CPSC\u2019s  Office of International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs  administers MOUs between CPSC and consumer product safety entities in  other countries, maintains regular contact with key exporting countries,  and attends meetings and discussions sponsored by multilateral  organizations. According to CPSC, as of June 2009, the office had  established MOUs for the purpose of consumer product safety with 16  foreign agencies in Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, Israel, South Korea,  Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, India, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, Egypt, Columbia,  and Vietnam. CPSC\u2019s Office of International Programs also conducts  training sessions in various countries to explain U.S. import safety  processes and procedures. According to CPSC, staff hold monthly  teleconferences with the agency\u2019s counterparts in Canada, China, and the  EU, and every two months CPSC holds a three-way teleconference with  Mexico and China to provide additional opportunities for engagement. In  2008, CPSC created a Chinese-language page on the CPSC Web site and,  not long after, a Vietnamese-language page to help facilitate information  sharing. The pages provide information about U.S. product safety  requirements, including relevant regulations and standards for products  bound for the U.S. market, as well as information about the new CPSIA.", "Over the last few years, CPSC has increased its bilateral engagement with  China. According to CPSC, the first U.S.-China Product Safety Summit was  held in Beijing in 2005 and culminated in a joint Action Plan on Consumer  Product Safety. CPSC and its counterpart in China, the General  Administration for Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine  (AQSIQ), established four working groups focused on fireworks, toys,  lighters, and electrical products. According to CPSC, a third summit will  be held in October 2009 and will build on the previous two, with the goal  of institutionalizing a culture of product safety among Chinese consumer  product manufacturers and exporters. In 2005, CPSC established a China  Program Plan as a way of managing CPSC\u2019s various China-related  activities and as the basis for an overall strategy to promote the safety and  compliance of Chinese consumer products exported to the United States.  Although the plan is to be updated on an annual basis to account for  changing conditions and new opportunities for progress, CPSC has not  updated the China Program Plan since 2007. According to a senior CPSC  official, the fiscal year 2008 and 2009 plans were essentially the same as  the 2007 plan. He stated, however, that a revised China Program Plan for  2010 will be submitted to the reconstituted commission and will be  published when approved.", "Other countries have also established bilateral agreements with China.   The European Commission engages in international contacts and  cooperation and has, for instance, agreed on a Memorandum of  Understanding with China's AQSIQ. According to the EU, one of the key  initiatives launched by the EU and China has involved the RAPEX system,  the EU\u2019s Rapid Alert System for nonfood consumer products. In May  2006, according to EU documentation, the European Commission decided  to provide China\u2019s AQSIQ with access to the RAPEX system\u2014specifically  its notifications on products coming from China.  EU officials report that  China agreed to investigate all reported cases of dangerous products of  Chinese origin and report back to the EU on the results, including  withdrawals of export license and other corrective actions.  Also, EU  officials state that certain individual EU Member States have established  limited bilateral contacts with China. According to Health Canada, Canada  signed an agreement with China on import safety in 2007. A summit  between China, the EU, and the United States occurred in November 2008  to strengthen consumer product safety trilateral cooperation, according to  U.S. and EU documents. As a key exporting nation, China has revised  some of its own laws, regulations, and procedures in response to high- profile recalls of Chinese-made goods and the consequent international  engagement on these issues, according to a senior CPSC official. He  indicated that an example of such a change occurred in March 2009, when  the Chinese National Institute of Standardization approved Administrative  Guidelines for Safe Consumer Product Manufacturing that emphasizes the  role of manufacturers in ensuring consumer product safety. In addition,  the CPSC official stated that China\u2019s AQSIQ had reported to CPSC that it  has increased significantly the inspection of paint on export toys and  closed down many factories that failed to implement a government  requirement of selecting paint suppliers for toys only from a government- approved list.", "Multilateral engagement on consumer product safety issues provides other  ways to encourage sharing of information and lessons learned on  consumer product safety among a larger group of nations. Organizations  such as OECD, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the  International Consumer Product Safety Caucus provide additional  frameworks for cooperation. U.S. and other officials believe that  continued cooperation and coordination among governments and  regulators can improve policy consistency and enforcement and,  ultimately, the effectiveness of consumer product safety frameworks,  particularly since consumer safety enforcement challenges are shared by  most nations.", "On October 23, 2008, the OECD\u2019s Committee on Consumer Policy hosted  its first Roundtable on International Consumer Product Safety, with an  aim to examine consumer product safety trends and challenges at both  domestic and international levels. The Director of CPSC\u2019s Office of  International Programs and Intergovernmental Affairs attended this  meeting, as did other OECD member nation representatives. The final  report identified a number of key issues shared by member nations and  initiatives for the future. CPSC representatives have also participated in  APEC discussions concerning consumer product safety. In 2007, APEC  leaders agreed on the need to develop a more robust approach to  strengthening food and consumer product safety standards and practices  in the region, using scientific, risk-based approaches and without creating  unnecessary impediments to trade, according to APEC documents. APEC  members reconvened in 2009 to determine future work on consumer  product safety. CPSC\u2019s Chairman and three staff participated in an APEC  regulators\u2019 dialogue on toy safety in August 2009 in Singapore aimed at  strengthening information exchange among APEC members\u2019 product  safety officials.", "The International Consumer Product Safety Caucus is another platform  that facilitates the exchange of information on consumer product safety  issues in the area of governmental policy, legislation and market  surveillance, with a view to strengthening collaboration and cooperation  among governments and regulatory agencies around the world.

These three principles are consistent  with principles established on a governmentwide basis in 2007. In  particular, the principles are consistent with those established by the  Interagency Working Group on Import Safety, of which CPSC was a part.  The working group issued an Action Plan for Import Safety in November  2007 that established three organizing principles: (1) prevention, which  means to prevent harm in the first place by working with the private sector  and foreign governments to adopt an approach to import safety that builds  safety into manufacturing and distribution processes; (2) intervention,  which means to act swiftly and in a coordinated manner when problems  are discovered to seize, destroy, or otherwise prevent dangerous goods  from advancing beyond the point of entry; and (3) response, which means  to take swift action to limit potential exposure and harm to the American  public in the event an unsafe import makes its way into domestic  commerce.", "As part of the governmentwide strategy, CPSC developed its Import Safety  Initiative, which contains annual goals that are consistent with the  initiative\u2019s key principles, but it is a short-term plan. For example, to help  assure that product safety is built into manufacturing and distribution  processes from the start, CSPC states that it plans to conduct three  outreach and training events for foreign government officials in 2010 and  three outreach and training events for foreign manufacturers. CPSC also  has a short-term plan for how it will manage its various China-related  activities and states that, for 2010, staff will review and update this plan.  To increase enforcement at the border, CPSC states that it plans to  increase the number of full-time staff working at U.S. ports and to increase  the number of sample products screened at the ports. CPSC\u2019s Import  Safety Initiative also links goals to requests for increased resources. For  example, CPSC states that, with increased resources, it plans to increase  its presence at U.S. ports of entry and open its first overseas office in  Beijing, China.", "CPSC officials have described to us other short-term plans that they  developed to respond to requirements and authorizations in CPSIA. For  example, as discussed earlier in this report, CPSC\u2019s decision to assign  additional full-time staff to ports responds to Section 202 of CPSIA, which  requires CPSC to hire personnel to be assigned to duty stations at U.S.  ports of entry, or to inspect overseas manufacturing facilities, subject to  the availability of appropriations. In its Import Safety Initiative, CPSC  requests funding for 10 additional staff to be assigned to ports in 2010. A  CPSC official with whom we spoke said that he expects the number of  staff assigned to ports to grow from its current level of 9 to about 50 over  the next few years. However, CPSC has conducted limited analyses of how  it plans to assign additional staff to ports in the coming years, and  standard operating procedures that describe compliance investigators\u2019  roles and responsibilities at ports of entry have not been updated since  1989. CPSC officials acknowledged the need to update these procedures.  CPSIA also requires CPSC, as discussed earlier in this report, to develop a  methodology for identifying shipments of imported consumer products  that are likely to violate import provisions enforced by CPSC due by  August 2010. CPSC, as noted earlier, has taken steps to develop a plan for  sharing information and coordinating with CBP, but it is unlikely that  CPSC will complete this plan by August 2009, as required under CPSIA,  because of delays in updating its agreements with CBP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Has Recognized the Need for U.S. Consumer Product Safety Policy to Comply with WTO Obligations and International Trade Agreements", "paragraphs": ["In undertaking its planning efforts, CPSC has recognized the need for U.S.  consumer product safety policy to comply with World Trade Organization  (WTO) obligations and international trade agreements\u2014a positive  recognition on CPSC\u2019s part.

With  delays in some rulemakings, such as testing and certification  requirements, it remains unclear whether CPSC will be able to implement  its authorities effectively. Furthermore, CPSC faces significant challenges  due to competing priorities and resource constraints. CPSC has taken  positive steps to shift its approach to import product safety from one  focused on responding to problems after products have entered the  marketplace to an approach focused on preventing harmful products from  ever reaching consumers. To implement this preventive approach, CPSC  states that it is taking steps to enhance surveillance activities, increase  enforcement at the ports, engage foreign governments, and educate  foreign manufacturers on U.S. standards for consumer product safety.", "Our work demonstrates that CPSC needs to strengthen its surveillance  activities, particularly its ability to target potentially unsafe products for  further screening and review at U.S. ports. CPSC has yet to obtain access  to advance shipment data, which FDA\u2019s experience suggests could be  useful in targeting incoming shipments. In addition, CPSC\u2019s agreements  with CBP are outdated, which hinders CPSC and CBP\u2019s ability to target  imports under CPSC\u2019s jurisdiction. CPSIA requires that CPSC and CBP  work together to develop a methodology to assess the risks of various  imported products and to cooperate on CPSC\u2019s participation in a CBP  targeting center. These joint efforts are a key element for improving  CPSC\u2019s ability to target shipments for screening and review at the ports  and to ensuring consistent enforcement of CPSC\u2019s authorities across the  United States. Because CPSC relies heavily on CBP for enforcement at the  ports, it is imperative for CPSC and CBP to resolve issues concerning their  agreements for sharing information and update their procedures for  operating at the port. CPSC\u2019s targeting efforts could be strengthened  further through expanded engagement with foreign governments and  education of foreign manufacturers on U.S. consumer product safety  standards. Such outreach could inform industry of its responsibility for the  safety of consumer products entering the United States and provide CPSC  with information on manufacturing in the respective countries to assist the  agency\u2019s development of a risk assessment methodology for imported  products. Without improving its ability to target potential risks across a  broad range of product categories, it is unclear how CPSC will succeed in  preventing unsafe consumer products from entering the United States.", "CPSC\u2019s inspection of foreign manufacturing plants faces practical  constraints and would likely require tremendous resources to implement.  CPSC believes strong cooperative relationships between countries to build  strong frameworks for consumer product safety are a more effective  approach for the United States. As part of its approach, CPSC is in the  process of developing such relationships, and current MOUs between  CPSC and certain foreign countries primarily address information sharing.  CPSC officials state that expanding CPSC\u2019s education and outreach rather  than inspection of foreign plants could serve to more effectively prevent  the entry of unsafe consumer products. Similarly, officials from the U.S.  agencies, with the exception of FDA, and countries we reviewed, stated  that they do not conduct inspections of foreign manufacturing plants. In  most cases, officials we interviewed stated that the countries have been  more successful in working with exporters in order to correct problems  that may arise. Therefore, we are not recommending any additional  authorities be granted to CPSC at this time.", "Efforts to expand U.S. jurisdiction to foreign manufacturers for purposes  of enforcement action also present unique practical considerations. It may  be argued that if foreign manufacturers were required to consent to U.S.  jurisdiction, CPSC\u2019s enforcement ability would be strengthened because  CPSC would have one less hurdle to overcome in pursuing enforcement  actions. Nevertheless, CPSC staff stated that, at this time, CPSC does not  see the need for this requirement in order to effectively carry out its  enforcement duties. To date, CPSC has been able to satisfy its  enforcement objectives by pursuing the domestic partners\u2014broadly  defined to include those companies along the supply chain to the  retailer\u2014associated with the foreign manufacturer. CPSC also has the  ability to settle enforcement actions with foreign parties. FDA and USDA  officials have found that their efforts to educate overseas industry and  governments on U.S. safety standards and the particular risks being  screened for at the border could reduce the number of unsafe products  that reach U.S. consumers. Similarly, CPSC staff we interviewed stated  that expanded international education and outreach, rather than expanded  enforcement jurisdiction, would more effectively prevent the entry of  unsafe products, although they acknowledged that consent to jurisdiction  or a requirement of a U.S. agent for service of process would be helpful.  Due to the practical considerations associated with requiring foreign  manufacturers to consent to U.S. jurisdiction for purposes of CPSC  enforcement actions, we make no recommendations for additional CPSC  authorities at this time.", "CPSC\u2019s short-term plans to prevent the entry of unsafe products are  consistent with a governmentwide approach taken by the Interagency  Working Group on Import Safety in 2007.

CPSC may  opt to negotiate a settlement or consent agreement rather than instituting  an adjudicative proceeding in a federal or administrative court. Enforcing  product safety standards on foreign manufacturers through an  adjudicative proceeding could theoretically pose practical challenges. For  example, one important prerequisite to maintaining an action against any  defendant in a U.S. state, federal, or administrative court is that the court  must have the ability to exert personal jurisdiction over that party. A  court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a party must satisfy the  fundamental notions of fairness mandated by the Due Process Clause of  the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. In the case of a defendant physically  located outside the territorial jurisdiction, such as a foreign manufacturer,  personal jurisdiction can be established if sufficient contacts exist  between a defendant and the territorial jurisdiction where the court sits,  and the defendant receives fair notice of the suit. Both requirements are  fact-specific and must ultimately be decided by a court, if challenged by  the defendant. By requiring foreign manufacturers to consent to U.S.  jurisdiction for purposes of CPSC enforcement actions, CPSC\u2019s  enforcement process could possibly be expedited in that it would  eliminate a personal jurisdictional challenge to the enforcement action.", "However, as noted above, CSPC did not see a need to take such action at  this time.", "CPSC noted that it can pursue each of the actors in the supply chain, from  the manufacturer to the retailer, foreign or domestic. Despite the  challenges that could theoretically arise in instituting an enforcement  action against a foreign actor, to date, pursuing the domestic partners of  such actors has satisfied CPSC\u2019s enforcement objectives. Further, CSPC  has the ability to settle enforcement actions with foreign parties. In the  event a settlement cannot be reached voluntarily, any formal action  against a foreign corporation must be served following the Convention on  the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or  Commercial Matters (\u201cConvention\u201d). CPSC also has the authority to file  suit against a foreign manufacturer for civil penalties for violations of  certain provisions of its statutes, if it can effect service by the Convention  or otherwise, and establish that the court has jurisdiction. For example,  the Department of Justice on behalf of CPSC recently filed suit against a  foreign manufacturer in the U.S. District Court for the District of  Minnesota, which was settled in July 2009. CPSC staff we interviewed  believe that expanded international education and outreach programs, as  opposed to requiring foreign manufacturers to consent to jurisdiction, are  preferable tools to effectively prevent the entry of unsafe consumer  products, although they acknowledged that consent to jurisdiction or a  requirement of a U.S. agent for service of process would be helpful.
