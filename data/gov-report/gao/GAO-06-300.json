CMS established two programs--the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) Program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP)--to measure the accuracy of claims paid. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 directed GAO to study the adequacy of the methodology that CMS used to estimate the Medicare FFS claims paid in error. GAO reviewed the extent to which CMS's methodology for estimating the fiscal year 2004 error rates was adequate by contractor type for (1) the CERT Program, (2) the HPMP, and (3) the combined national error rate (including both the CERT Program and the HPMP). GAO reviewed relevant CMS documents and reports related to the CERT Program and the HPMP. In addition, GAO reviewed work performed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) and its contractor that evaluated CMS's fiscal year 2004 statistical methods and other aspects of the error rate estimation process. GAO also conducted interviews with officials from CMS, HHS's OIG, and their contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The methodology used by CMS for the CERT Program was adequate to estimate the fiscal year 2004 error rates by contractor type--carrier, durable medical equipment regional carrier (DMERC), and fiscal intermediary (FI). Carriers pay claims submitted by physicians, diagnostic laboratories and facilities, and ambulance service providers. DMERCs pay claims submitted by durable medical equipment suppliers. FIs pay claims submitted by hospitals, home health agencies, hospital outpatient departments, skilled nursing facilities, and hospices. The methodology was adequate because CMS used a large sample--about 120,000 claims--and an appropriate sample selection strategy. For these fiscal year 2004 error rate estimates, CMS made improvements in the collection of medical records that supported the sampled claims. These medical records were appropriately reviewed to determine whether there were errors in payment. CMS used valid statistical methods to estimate the fiscal year 2004 error rates for the carrier, DMERC, and FI contractor types. The methodology used by CMS for the HPMP was adequate to estimate the fiscal year 2004 error rate by quality improvement organizations (QIO), which are responsible for ascertaining the accuracy of coding and payment of Medicare FFS paid claims for acute care inpatient hospital stays. CMS's sampling methods were adequate because the agency used a large sample, approximately 40,000 claims, that was representative of the population from which it was drawn in terms of average dollar amount per claim. Also, the HPMP had adequate processes in place to ensure appropriate determinations of error. CMS used valid statistical methods to estimate the fiscal year 2004 error rate for the QIO contractor type. The fiscal year 2004 contractor-type error rate estimates for the CERT Program and the HPMP were appropriately combined to determine the national Medicare error rate through the use of a valid statistical method. CMS estimated the national Medicare error rate by averaging the carrier, DMERC, and FI contractor-type error rates in the CERT Program and the QIO contractor-type error rate in the HPMP, weighted by each contractor type's share of total Medicare FFS payments. In written comments, HHS noted that GAO found CMS's methodology adequate for estimating the fiscal year 2004 national Medicare FFS error rate. HHS also noted that CMS is continually committed to refining the processes to estimate, as well as lower, the level of improper payments in the Medicare FFS program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that  administers the Medicare program, monitors the accuracy of claims paid  for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.

In fiscal year 2004, CMS reported an error rate of   9.3 percent, which represented approximately $20 billion in error out of  the approximately $214 billion in fee-for-service (FFS) payments. The  fiscal year 2004 error rate estimated the percentage of FFS payments that  did not comply with Medicare\u2019s payment rules for a sample of claims that  included inpatient discharges that occurred from July 1, 2002, through  June 30, 2003, as well other services that were paid in 2003.

Using contractor-specific error rate information,  CMS estimates an error rate for each type of contractor; the agency  produces a national Medicare error rate by aggregating the four  contractor-type error rates. In its fiscal year 2004 Medicare error rate  report, CMS stated that it planned to use error rate information to help  determine the underlying reasons for claim errors, such as incorrect  coding, and implement corrective actions. In a congressional testimony in  July 2005, the Director of CMS\u2019s Office of Financial Management stated  that CMS plans to create performance incentives for contractors. CMS is  also implementing a multiyear contractor reform initiative, which will  reduce the number of contractors responsible for paying claims.", "To monitor the accuracy of Medicare FFS claims paid by contractors, CMS  established two programs\u2014the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing  (CERT) Program and the Hospital Payment Monitoring Program (HPMP).  Through the CERT Program, CMS monitors payment decisions made by  three types of contractors\u2014carriers, DMERCs, and FIs. It does this  through a review of the claims and submitted medical record  documentation to ensure that there is support for the payment based on  the information reviewed for a sample of paid claims. CMS uses a similar  process for the HPMP for a sample of claims that are reviewed by QIOs for  accuracy of payment.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector  General (OIG) estimated the error rate for each fiscal year from 1996  through 2002.

CMS has continued to make changes to the  methodology in subsequent years.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 requires that we study the adequacy of the methodology that CMS  used to estimate Medicare error rates and to make recommendations as  deemed appropriate.

In  addition, we reviewed work performed by an OIG contractor that  evaluated CMS\u2019s statistical sampling and estimation methodology for the  fiscal year 2004 Medicare error rate, including the contractor\u2019s report and  supporting workpapers. We interviewed OIG officials; OIG contractor  staff; CMS officials; and staff of the CERT subcontractor responsible for  calculating the error rates for carriers, DMERCs, and FIs and the national  error rate for fiscal year 2004. Commenting on the adequacy of the  methodology used in any other years was beyond the scope of our work.  However, it is important to note that changes in the methodology may  affect the estimation of the error rates and thus the comparability of these  rates over time.", "As part of our assessment of the adequacy of the methodology that CMS  used to estimate the Medicare error rates for fiscal year 2004, we reviewed  the reliability of these estimates by examining the precision of the  contractor-specific error rates, the contractor-type error rates, and the  national error rate. Precision is the amount of variation between an  estimate (such as the error rate for a sample of Medicare FFS paid claims)  and the result that would be obtained from measuring the entire  population (such as the error rate for all Medicare FFS paid claims). We  examined precision of the error rate estimates by assessing relative  precision, which is the standard error of the error rate estimate divided  by the estimate itself. Estimates with lower relative precision are more  reliable. For the purposes of this report, we established that a relative  precision of no greater than 15 percent was within the acceptable  statistical standard for precision. We chose relative precision because it  allows for better comparison of the reliability of the range of error rates  across contractors.", "During the course of our work, CMS published a report in November 2005  that included its fiscal year 2005 error rates.

OIG began estimating the national Medicare error rate in fiscal year  1996, and continued doing so for each subsequent fiscal year through  2002. The transfer of responsibilities for estimating the national Medicare  error rate to CMS coincided with the implementation of the Improper  Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). The IPIA requires federal  agencies to estimate and report annually on the extent of erroneous  payments in their programs and activities. The IPIA defines an improper  payment as any payment that should not have been made or that was  made in an incorrect amount, including both under- and overpayments. All  agencies that identify a program as susceptible to significant improper  payments, defined by guidance from the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) in 2003 as exceeding both 2.5 percent of total program payments  and $10 million, are required to annually report to Congress and the  President an estimate of improper payments and report on corrective  actions.", "In addition to estimating the national Medicare error rate for purposes of  compliance with the IPIA, CMS also began producing contractor-specific  error rate estimates beginning in fiscal year 2003 to identify the underlying  causes of errors and to adjust action plans for carriers, DMERCs, FIs, and  QIOs. To produce these contractor-specific error rate estimates for fiscal  year 2004, CMS sampled approximately 160,000 claims. The contractor- specific error rate information was then aggregated by the four contractor  types (carrier, DMERC, FI, and QIO), which were ultimately combined to  estimate the national Medicare error rate. Under the methodology  previously used by OIG to estimate the national Medicare error rate, 6,000  claims were sampled. While the sample size used by OIG was sufficient to  estimate the national Medicare error rate, it was not sufficient to reliably  estimate the contractor-specific error rates.

If a provider did not  respond to the initial request for medical records after 19 days,  AdvanceMed initiated a series of follow-up procedures in an attempt to  obtain the information. The follow-up procedures with nonresponding  providers for fiscal year 2004 included three written letters and three  contacts by telephone. Additionally, in fiscal year 2004, OIG followed up  directly with nonresponders on claims over a certain dollar amount. If  medical records were not received within 55 days of the initial request, the  entire amount of the claim was classified by AdvanceMed as an  overpayment error.", "When medical records were received from the provider or from the  contractor, CERT medical review staff reviewed the claim (which billed  for the services provided) and the supporting medical records (which  detailed the diagnosis and services provided) to assess whether the claim  followed Medicare\u2019s payment rules and national and local coverage  decisions. Claims that did not follow these rules were classified by  AdvanceMed as being in error. Providers whose claims were reviewed  were allowed to appeal these claims, and if the error determination for a  claim was overturned through the appeals process, AdvanceMed adjusted  the error rate accordingly.

CMS estimated the QIO contractor-type error rate by  aggregating the QIO error rate estimates for each of the 50 states, the  District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. (See fig. 2.) Through the HPMP,  CMS sampled approximately 40,000 claims for acute care inpatient  hospital discharges that occurred from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003,  to estimate the fiscal year 2004 state-specific and contractor-type error  rates for QIOs.", "For fiscal year 2004, CMS contracted with two organizations known as  Clinical Data Abstraction Centers (CDAC)\u2014AdvanceMed and  DynKePRO\u2014that were responsible for requesting medical records from  providers for each of the approximately 40,000 sampled claims. Each  CDAC was responsible for reviewing the sampled claims, which were  assigned on the basis of the geographic location where the discharge  occurred. Upon receipt of the medical records, CDAC admission necessity  reviewers screened the related claims for the appropriateness of the  hospitalization and, with the exception of claims from Maryland, coding  specialists independently recoded diagnosis-related groups (DRG) based  on the records submitted.

CMS took an equal sample size from each contractor  despite the fact that individual contractors accounted for varied amounts  of Medicare claim volumes and total payments. For example, the claim  volume for carriers in 2003 ranged from a minimum of 5.3 million claims to  a maximum of 206 million claims; total payments for carriers in 2003  ranged from a minimum of $168 million to about $6.7 billion.", "CMS officials told us that they plan to reallocate the CERT Program  sample at the contractor level by increasing the sample size for those  contractors that are not reaching CMS\u2019s targeted precision and by  decreasing the sample size for those contractors that are reaching targeted  precision and achieving low error rates. In September 2005, CMS officials  reported that this change to the methodology is expected to be  implemented for the fiscal year 2007 error rate estimation, which will be  based on claims processed in parts of 2006 and 2007. We support CMS\u2019s  planned changes to its sampling methodology. We believe that reallocation  of the sample as planned by CMS will improve the relative precision of  these estimates. If future samples were based on the volume of claims or  total payments of each contractor and the relative precision of the  contractor-specific error rate rather than on the current basis of an equal  allocation across contractors, relative precision would likely be improved  for the contractor-specific error rates of those targeted contractors that  were allocated a larger sample.

According to the CMS fiscal year 2003 error rate  report, for example, the agency found that some nonresponse in fiscal year  2003 was due to providers\u2019 lack of familiarity with AdvanceMed. In  previous years when OIG had responsibility for estimating the Medicare  error rate, OIG requested medical records directly from providers;  providers were familiar with OIG and understood the importance of  complying with the requests. However, when the responsibility for  estimating the Medicare error rate was transferred to CMS, many  providers were unfamiliar with AdvanceMed and may have been reluctant  to submit medical records to an unknown company. Another factor that  caused provider nonresponse in fiscal year 2003, according to the CMS  report, was providers\u2019 confusion about the submission of medical records  within the constraints of the privacy regulations issued by HHS under the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which limit  the use and release of individually identifiable health information.  According to the CMS report, CMS found that providers were sometimes  unaware that sending medical records to the CERT Program contractor  was permissible under the regulations. As reported in the OIG review cited  previously, CMS implemented corrective actions that increased provider  compliance with medical record requests in fiscal year 2004. According to  the OIG report, CMS conducted educational efforts to clarify the role of  AdvanceMed.

CMS\u2019s documentation stated that the HPMP used a systematic  sample selection process with a random start, which is a generally  accepted method of sampling that is designed to ensure that the sample  drawn is representative of the population. Our review of the computer  programming code that selected the sample, however, found that a  random start was not used. To determine whether the HPMP sample was  compromised by the lack of a random start and whether it represented the  population from which it was drawn, we examined the OIG contractor\u2019s  comparison of the June 2003 sample to a re-created version of the   June 2003 population file from which the sample was drawn. Based on  our review, we found that the HPMP sample was representative of the  population from which it was drawn in terms of average dollar amount per  claim.", "While relative precision of the fiscal year 2004 QIO contractor-type error  rate estimate was within acceptable statistical standards, relative  precision of most of the state-specific QIO error rate estimates was not.  (See app. II for state-specific QIO error rate information, including the  error rate estimates and corresponding relative precision.) Only three  states\u2019 error rate estimates\u2014Kentucky, Massachusetts, and New Mexico\u2014 had relative precision of less than 15 percent. Additionally, there was wide  variation in relative precision of the state-specific QIO error rate  estimates. Relative precision of the state-specific QIO error rates ranged  from 10.5 percent in Massachusetts to 83.3 percent in Mississippi. The  differences in relative precision of these state-specific QIO error rate  estimates indicate that the error rate estimate for the QIO that served  Massachusetts was eight times more reliable than the error rate estimate  for the QIO that served Mississippi. The variation in relative precision was  due, in part, to the sampling methods used by CMS for the HPMP. CMS  took an equal sample size for each state except Alaska, despite the fact  that there was significant variation between states in the overall volume of  discharge claims and total payments. The number of discharges per state  varied from a low of 15,166 in Wyoming to a high of 825,845 in Florida.  Similarly, total dollars paid for acute-care inpatient hospital stays varied  from less than $100 million in Wyoming to a high of $7.5 billion in  California.", "Although in February 2006 a CMS official told us the agency has no plans  to reallocate the HPMP sample, CMS could adopt a similar sampling  strategy as it plans to do for the CERT Program. If future state samples  were based on the volume of discharge claims or total payments per state  and the relative precision of the state-specific QIO error rates, rather than  on the current basis of an equal allocation per state, relative precision  would likely be improved for the state-specific QIO error rates in those  states that were allocated a larger sample since relative precision  improves as sample size increases. There would also likely be decreased  variation in relative precision across all state-specific QIO error rates.  These results could be achieved without increasing the overall sample size  for the HPMP.", "In addition to issues with the wide variation of relative precision of the  state-specific QIO error rate estimates, we also found large differences in  the average dollar amount per claim between the state-specific samples for  some states and the respective state populations. These differences  suggest that the samples drawn for more than half of the states were not  representative of each state\u2019s population. Based on our examination of the  OIG contractor\u2019s comparison of the state samples and the state  populations for June 2003, we found that the ratio of the average dollar  amount per claim in a state\u2019s sample to the average dollar amount per  claim in a state\u2019s population varied from 62 percent in Maryland to   143 percent in Kentucky. Twelve states had a ratio above 110 percent, and  16 states had a ratio below 90 percent. It is still possible for the national  HPMP sample to be representative of the national HPMP population even  if all of the state-specific samples are not representative of their state  populations.

The increased sample size  allowed the agency to estimate not only the error rate at the national level,  but also more detailed error rates at the contractor-type and contractor- specific levels. Further, CMS has made changes in the way it collects  medical records from providers in an effort to reduce the rate of error  caused by nonresponse and insufficient documentation.
