For several impact reports that we  examined, the reporting local government agencies, when calculating  service costs, did not define compact migrants according to the  criteria in the amended compacts enabling legislation. For instance,  some agencies defined and counted compact migrants using the  proxy measures of ethnicity, language, or citizenship rather than the  definition in the amended compacts\u2019 enabling legislation. Using  ethnicity or language as a proxy measure could lead to overstating  costs, since neither measure would exclude individuals who came to  the jurisdiction prior to the compact, while using citizenship as a proxy  measure could lead to understating costs, since it would exclude U.S.- born children of compact migrants.", "Federal funding. Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI, among other U.S.  states and territories, receive federal funding for programs that  compact migrants use; however, not all compact impact reports  accounted for this stream of funding and included costs in compact  impact estimates for programs that federal funding had partially  addressed. To the extent that federal revenue for programs in affected  jurisdictions is based on population counts or data on usage, the  presence of, and use of services by, compact migrants lead to federal  offsets. For example, from 2004 to 2008, Hawaii developed its  education impact costs by calculating a per-pupil expenditure  multiplied by the number of compact migrant students enrolled each  school year. However, federal funds received through several  programs are included in these annual expenditures. If the federal  funds component of per-pupil expenditures were subtracted from  Hawaii\u2019s education impact reporting, as well as a correction made to  eliminate a data error that double-counted Marshallese students, it  would reduce the total cost of services to compact migrants by  approximately $61 million for 2004 through 2008 from $229 to $168  million.", "Revenue. Multiple local government agencies that receive fees as a  result of providing services to compact migrants did not consider fees  in their compact impact reports. Any exclusion of revenue may cause  an overstatement of the total impact reported. Compact migrants also  participate in local economies through their participation in the labor  force, payment of taxes, consumption of local goods and services,  and receipt of remittances.

Many local government agencies did not include  capital costs in their impact reporting. Capital costs entail, for  example, providing additional classrooms to accommodate an  increase in students or constructing additional health care facilities.

A number of local government agencies used an  average per-person service cost for the jurisdiction rather than  specific costs associated with providing services to compact migrants.  For example, one jurisdiction based the cost of providing health care  services to compact migrants on the number of migrants served out of  the total patient load instead of totaling each patient\u2019s specific costs.
