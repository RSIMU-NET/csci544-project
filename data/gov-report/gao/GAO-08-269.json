For the 32 selected contract actions GAO reviewed, DOD contracting officials generally applied these tools to their assessments. The degree of assessment depended on whether the contract was competed and whether the contract type required the government to pay a fixed price or costs incurred by the contractor. When using full and open competition, contracting officials assessed contractor value added based on the technical ability to perform the contract, but did not separately evaluate cost since market forces generally control contract costs, potentially minimizing the risk of excessive pass-through charges. However, when using noncompetitive contracts, contracting officials were required to evaluate more detailed cost information in assessing value added, as market forces did not determine the contract cost. For example, for a $3 billion noncompetitive contract for an Air Force satellite program, contracting officials assessed detailed cost or pricing data that included subcontractor costs, and received DCAA and DCMA support to negotiate lower overall contract costs. However, assessing contractor value added is especially challenging in unique situations where requirements are urgent in nature and routine contracting practices may be overlooked. Related GAO work and DOD audits on contracts awarded for Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts found multiple layers of subcontractors, questionable contractor value added, increased costs, and lax oversight. The selected private sector companies GAO interviewed rely heavily on acquisition planning, knowledge of supply chain, and managing contractual relationships to minimize risk of excessive pass-through charges when purchasing goods and services. They seek to optimize competition to minimize overall contract costs, and several companies indicated that they prefer fixed-price competitive arrangements. In addition, some form collaborative business relationships with contractors and subcontractors that provide greater insight into their supply chains and costs--a challenge DOD continues to face. When using other than fixed-price contracts, they recognize the financial risks and ensure proper oversight and accountability. As GAO has reported in the past, DOD's use of riskier contracts, such as time-and-materials contracts, has not always ensured good acquisition outcomes. DOD recently issued an interim rule requiring a contract clause in all eligible contracts, which allows it to recoup contractor payments that contracting officers determine to be excessive. The rule also requires detailed information from contractors on their value added when subcontracting costs reach 70 percent or more of total contract cost. However, the rule alone will not provide greater insight into DOD's supply chain and costs--information companies told us they use to mitigate excessive costs. Further, contracting officials indicated the need for guidance to ensure effective implementation and consistent application of tools in the FAR as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2006, the Department of Defense (DOD) spent over $294  billion to procure goods and services from prime contractors, with more  than one-third of this spending for awards to subcontractors. However,  concerns have been raised among federal auditors and Congress about the  potential for DOD to overpay contractors that subcontract work and add  little or no value. To help minimize this risk, Congress mandated that  DOD issue regulations on preventing these pass-through charges. It also  required GAO to assess the extent to which DOD may be vulnerable to  excessive pass-through charges. Specifically, we (1) determined DOD\u2019s  current approach to assessing the risk of excessive pass-through charges  when work is subcontracted, (2) identified the strategies selected private  sector companies use to minimize risks of excessive pass-through charges  when purchasing goods and services, and (3) assessed DOD\u2019s interim rule  to prevent excessive pass-through charges.", "To determine DOD\u2019s current approach to assessing the risk of excessive  pass-through charges when work is subcontracted, we reviewed and  analyzed the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense  Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).  We also discussed  these regulations with DOD acquisition policy, audit, and contracting  officials. This included Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and  Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) staff to discuss their roles  in reviewing and managing contracts.  To obtain a broad perspective on  the processes in place to determine costs and extent of subcontracting, we  met with contracting staff from 10 of the top contracting locations across  DOD. At those locations, we reviewed and analyzed available  documentation for a nongeneralizable sample of 32 DOD contract actions  awarded in fiscal year 2005. Using DOD\u2019s procurement information  system\u2014DD350 database\u2014we selected actions that had subcontracting  plans and small business contracts over $10 million.  While our sample  cannot be generalized to all DOD contract actions, it represented a range  of products and services, levels of competition, types of contracts, and  dollar value across DOD military services. We discussed these contracts  with the responsible contracting officials and examined the degree to  which available tools in acquisition regulations were used in assessing the  value added of contractors. Because no specific criteria exist for assessing  value added, we did not measure the adequacy of the contracting officials\u2019  assessments. To understand how DOD approached the assessment for  contracts where much of the work was subcontracted, we reviewed recent  GAO and DOD audits and reports on questionable value added and costs  as well as discussed the reports with responsible DOD audit officials. We  also looked at practices outside of DOD to identify the strategies nine  selected companies use to minimize the risk of excessive pass-through  charges when purchasing a range of goods and services. We also reviewed  findings and recommendations of the Acquisition Advisory Panel\u2019s 2007  report on commercial practices. We reviewed previous GAO reports and  issues raised in various GAO acquisitions forums and interviewed officials  from industry groups such as the Professional Services Council and the  Coalition for Government Procurement. To assess DOD\u2019s recent efforts to  prevent excessive pass-through charges, we reviewed its interim rule  responding to the congressional mandate and discussed it with DOD  officials. We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to  December 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

When using full and open competition, the value added by the  prime contractor was determined by its technical ability to perform the  contract, but generally contracting officers did not do a separate detailed  evaluation of cost to determine value added. DOD contracting officials told us  that competitive fixed-price contracts allow the market to control overall  contract value, which provided them with reasonable assurance of the  contractor\u2019s value added and potentially minimizing the risk of excessive  pass-through charges. When using noncompetitive contracts, however, the  market forces did not control contract cost and required contracting officers  to consider\u2014in addition to cost\u2014the technical ability to perform the work.  Specifically, DOD contracting officials noted that noncompetitive as well as  other than fixed-price contracts require additional oversight and  administration, including more detailed information to conduct the  assessment of contractor value added and minimize the risk of excessive  pass-through charges. For the 32 selected contracts we reviewed, 16 were  awarded noncompetitively, with 7 of those on a cost-reimbursement basis and  2 on a time-and-materials basis. (see table 1) .", "DOD contracting officials noted that fixed-price contracts incentivize  prime contractors to keep overall contract costs low\u2014to include any  subcontract costs\u2014as they will have to absorb cost overruns under such  contracts. In reviewing two fixed-price competitive contracts for Air Force  space systems, acquisition planning and market research up-front  provided insights into reasonable prices as well as identified the best- qualified suppliers to do the work. Air Force officials stated that because  competitive contracts are often proposed by a team of contractors\u2014the  prime plus the subcontractors\u2014market pricing extends to subcontractor  costs as well. In discussing the two contracts, these officials added that  fixed prices lowered the government\u2019s risk of increased costs. As a result,  the contracting officials said that in assessing the prime contractor\u2019s value  added, they focused more on the technical capabilities\u2014rather than  cost\u2014to ensure contractors were responsive in meeting the mission.", "Contracting officials told us that contracts awarded noncompetitively  decrease their assurance of price reasonableness since there is no basis of  comparison through competition. Therefore, they rely on other pricing  tools contained in the FAR and DFARS.  These tools assist the contracting  officers in obtaining more detailed information to provide reasonable  assurance of contractor value added and potentially minimize the risk of  excessive pass-through charges. Our review of contract files also  revealed the role that DCAA and DCMA played in reviewing cost  information in several of the 16 noncompetitive contracts we reviewed  and helping to negotiate subcontract costs.", "For the Air Force\u2019s estimated $3 billion satellite program contract,  DCAA reviewed the certified cost and pricing data that the contractor  was required to provide. The required data included not only the  contractor\u2019s costs but a detailed description of the efforts and costs of  each subcontractor, including subsidiary companies. The contracting  officer judged the proposed costs based on results of audit reports and  a technical evaluation. Because of the high dollar value and complexity  of this contract, the program office required the prime contractor to  submit cost data reports at the conclusion of each effort and cost  performance reports to provide insight into the prime contractor\u2019s and  subcontractor\u2019s cost and schedule data. Additionally, DCAA and DCMA  helped to negotiate individual subcontracts and, in some cases, achieve  lower overall costs.", "The Army similarly relied on DCAA and DCMA assistance on a $1  billion fixed-price contract for a family of heavy tactical vehicles. The  Army did not pursue full and open competition, citing the lack of  industry response, thus requiring contracting officers to gain more  insight into prime contractor and subcontract costs to assess  contractor value added and minimize the risk of excessive pass- through charges. The Army used a teaming arrangement that allowed  the contracting command, DCAA, DCMA, and the contractor to  evaluate, discuss, and negotiate the costs. Each cost element was  mutually agreed upon, resulting in a negotiated price list. Contracting  officials told us that these negotiated prices applied to subcontracts for  vehicle parts as well, preventing overcharges by lower-tier  subcontractors.", "For an $11 million Navy contract for fighter aircraft support, DCMA  provided an evaluation of prime contractor and subcontractor costs for  certain services. In prenegotiation discussions with the Navy, DCMA  described the technical evaluation of the contractor\u2019s cost proposal,  providing a cost summary of what was proposed by the contractor and  what was recommended during the technical evaluation.  For one  portion of the contract, the evaluators questioned the direct labor  hours proposed by the prime contractor for managing the project  because most (if not all) the actual work would be done by  subcontractors. The DCMA technical evaluator found the hours  proposed to be excessive, raising questions about the prime  contractor\u2019s value added relative to the costs. Documentation in the  contract file stated that although the prime contractor believed the  hours proposed were fair, it agreed to a 25 percent reduction in the  hours.", "In addition to the presence of competition, the risk associated with  contracts in which the government pays based on costs incurred also  affects the degree to which contracting officers assess contractor value  added and potentially minimize the risk of excessive pass-through charges.  These contracts, which include cost-reimbursement and time-and- materials contracts, increase DOD\u2019s need to ensure appropriate  surveillance during performance to provide reasonable assurance that  efficient methods and effective cost controls are used. Because of the risks  involved, the FAR directs that these contracts should be used only when it  is not possible at the time of award to estimate accurately the extent or  duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of  confidence. Of the selected contracts we reviewed, 18, or 56 percent,  were cost-type contracts with 11 noncompetitively awarded. Contracting  officials told us that under these arrangements, although competition  increases the assurance of reasonable prices and controls contract cost,  the absence of a fixed price requires them to take additional steps to  obtain other information to assess the roles and costs of prime contractors  and subcontractors, which assists in evaluating contractor value added.", "For example, a task order awarded under a $3 billion Army multiple award  contract, which reimbursed the contractor based on the cost of its time  and materials, demonstrated the risk associated with these contracts.  Under this multiple award contract, eight prime contractors competed for  task orders, with one of the contractors identifying over 75 subcontractors  in its proposal. On the task order we reviewed, for engineering services,  most of the work was subcontracted. Contracting officers stated that  because the contract was awarded on a time-and-materials basis, the  government was particularly vulnerable to the prime contractor charging  more than it paid for its subcontractor since at this time prime contractors  could charge for subcontract labor at the prime\u2019s rate and keep any  difference between its rate and the subcontractor\u2019s. While the prime  contractor was not required to submit certified cost or pricing data, it was  required to provide a task execution plan that described the specific duties  of both the prime contractor and the subcontractor, including the fees  they were charging the government to manage the subcontractor. The  Army evaluated the plan and determined that the number of hours and  rates proposed by the prime contractor were reasonable based on the data  provided.  We have previously reported that for some time-and-materials  contracts, DOD paid more than actual costs for subcontracted labor. To  minimize this risk with time-and-materials contracts, a new DOD  regulation set forth different rules about how prime contractors are to be  reimbursed for subcontracted labor to ensure that prime contractors do  not charge the government higher rates than those charged by  subcontractors.", "In our review of other cost-type contracts, DOD gained insight into value  provided by the prime contractor in determining price reasonableness.  The cost or pricing data in some cases provided the contracting officer  with added insight by breaking out costs of the prime contractor and  major subcontractors by the work they were to perform.  Further, in some  cases, DCAA questioned the proposed subcontractor costs and provided  an estimate for the contracting officer to use in negotiating a more  reasonable price to ensure best value. For example, in a $92 million Army  contract for the redesign of a chemical demilitarization facility, DCAA  questioned the surcharges applied to certain subcontractor costs and  recommended lower rates. The contractor accepted the lower rates,  reducing the overall cost to the Army.", "According to several contracting officials, as prime contractors assign  subcontractors more critical roles to achieve a mission, the increased need  for detailed cost information is coupled with the need for more insight into  the technical capabilities of the subcontractors. Because cost is not always  the primary criterion used to determine best value, technical capabilities  can also be evaluated to determine the role of the prime contractor when  work is subcontracted. We found that cost was not always ranked as the  highest factor in reviewing source selection criteria for five cost-type  contracts. For one example\u2014an $863 million Navy contract for support  services related to a destroyer\u2014the technical evaluation determined the  ability of the prime contractor and multiple tiers of subcontractors to  perform the work. While detailed cost information was obtained from the  prime contractor and considered in the source selection, its ability to  consolidate and manage efforts that had previously been conducted under  five separate contracts was a particularly significant factor in evaluating  the contractor\u2019s value added. In another example\u2014a $2.9 billion Navy  contract for a major weapons system\u2014given the size of the contract and  magnitude and complexity of work involved, the contracting officer  required greater insight into how the prime contractor intended to  subcontract. As a result, the contracting officer modified the contract to  increase requirements for the prime contractor to obtain consent to  subcontract. The contracting officer told us that although prime  contractors are ultimately responsible for managing their subcontractors,  DOD still needed to maintain a certain level of insight into subcontracting,  given the increased role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unique Circumstances Can Drive Contracting Arrangements That Carry Greater Risk of Excessive Pass-Through Charges", "paragraphs": ["Some unique contracting arrangements that are noncompetitive or where  requirements are urgent in nature carry greater risk of excessive pass- through charges and pose challenges in conducting assessments of  contractor value added. This was the case with a contract we reviewed  that had been awarded to an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) firm  through a small business development program. In addition, related GAO  work and DOD audits on contracts awarded for Hurricane Katrina  recovery efforts found multiple layers of subcontractors, questionable  value added by contractors, increased costs, and lax oversight.", "Through the Small Business Administration\u2019s 8(a) program, DOD and  other federal agencies can award sole-source contracts to ANC firms for  any dollar value. The Small Business Administration requires agencies to  monitor the percentage of work performed by the 8(a) firms versus the  percentage performed by their subcontractors to ensure that small  businesses do not pass along the benefits of their contracts to  subcontractors. The \u201climitations on subcontracting\u201d clause in the FAR  requires that for 8(a) service contracts with subcontracting, the firm must  incur at least 50 percent of the personnel costs with its own employees  (for general construction contracts, the firm must incur at least 15 percent  of the personnel costs). However, for one contract we reviewed that was  awarded to an ANC firm, contracting officials had failed to include the  required FAR clause in the contract and other contracting officials we  spoke to were unsure who should be monitoring compliance\u2014findings  consistent with our past work on ANC 8(a) contracts.", "For an Army logistics support services cost-reimbursement contract for  $54 million awarded to an ANC noncompetitively, substantial variations in  workload created too much cost risk to make it a fixed-price contract.  According to the contracting officer, usually with a scope of work this  large and varied, the contract lends itself to subcontracting. When asked  about the level of insight into how the ANC would use subcontracted  support, the contracting officer responded that this was challenging since  small businesses are not required to submit subcontracting plans. In  reviewing the base contract, we found that it did not contain the required  clause that limits subcontracting. We brought this to the attention of the  contracting officer, who told us that although he was not aware of any  subcontracting, the clause should have been included and it was an  oversight. Several other contracting officials we spoke to said they were  unsure of whose responsibility it is to monitor compliance with the  subcontracting limitations under these 8(a) contracts. They recognized  that they should be doing more to monitor compliance. By not ensuring  compliance with the limits on subcontracting requirement, there is an  increased risk that an inappropriate degree of the work is being done by  large businesses, raising questions about the value added by the ANC firm.", "According to contracting officials we spoke with, assessing the value  added by a prime contractor is especially challenging in emergency  situations, where requirements are critical and urgent in nature, such as  those for recovery from Hurricane Katrina. We have similarly reported that  the circumstances created by these situations can make it difficult to  balance the need to deliver goods and services quickly with the need for  appropriate controls. Our past work has cautioned, however, that limited  predictability must not be an excuse for poor contracting practices. In  some cases, the response to Hurricane Katrina suffered from inadequate  planning and preparation to anticipate requirements for needed goods and  services. The scale of operations and the government\u2019s stated inability to  provide program management after Katrina drove the decision to award  contracts with large scopes of work that, in certain cases, led to multiple  layers of subcontractors and increased costs.", "GAO\u2019s past work in reviewing orders and contracts for the Katrina  recovery effort found that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)  disclosed increased costs associated with multiple supplier layers. In  reviewing orders and contracts for portable public buildings in Mississippi,  which were awarded in 2005, we found that USACE ordered 88 buildings  that were purchased and sold through two to three layers of suppliers,  resulting in prices 63 percent to 133 percent higher than manufacturers\u2019  sales prices. In one example, 45 of the 88 portable public buildings were  purchased from a contractor who in turn purchased the buildings from a  distributor, who in turn purchased them from another distributor, who had  purchased the 45 buildings from the manufacturer. Each layer added an  additional fee, resulting in USACE agreeing to a price that was 63 percent  higher than the manufacturer\u2019s price.", "DOD auditors have noted additional concerns in some Katrina contracts  they reviewed. For example, a November 2006 Army Audit report stated  that unclear requirements for four post-Katrina debris removal contracts  awarded by USACE\u2014for $500 million each with an option for an  additional $500 million\u2014resulted in prices renegotiated in unfavorable  circumstances. According to the report, the urgency to award contracts  quickly did not give USACE contracting personnel sufficient time to  develop a well-defined acquisition strategy\u2014one that defined desired  outcomes and risks related to the acquisition to ensure contracts were  structured in the government\u2019s best interest. Contracting officials were  less diligent about complying with acquisition regulations regarding best  value contracts and reasonable pricing. Fixed-price contracts were  renegotiated at higher prices without the benefit of a DCAA review.  USACE\u2019s decision to use four large contracts also resulted in multiple tiers  of subcontractors to accomplish the work, with each tier adding costs.  Post-award audits performed by DCAA found substantial overcharges by  the debris contractors.", "USACE officials we spoke with noted that they have revised the  acquisition strategy to structure the size and scope of contracts to  maximize competition and minimize subcontractor tiers. New contracts  will have reduced performance periods to ensure that prices reflect the  existing conditions. While USACE previously set production rates in its  contracts, it did not measure them during the performance of the contract.  USACE officials further stated that under the revised strategy, they will  negotiate the production rate and measure the contractor\u2019s ability to  maintain it. To ensure price reasonableness of proposed prices, USACE  plans to request DCAA to assist the contracting officer in reviews of  competitive proposals and in negotiations.

In April 2007, DOD issued an interim rule to require a  contract clause that provides audit rights and cost recovery should these  excessive pass-through charges occur. The rule also requires specific  disclosure by a contractor that intends, or subsequently decides, to  subcontract most of the work.  Specifically, the contractor is to identify in  its proposal the percentage of effort it intends to perform, and the  percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor under the  contract, task order, or delivery order, or if a decision to subcontract  comes after award, the contractor must notify the contracting officer in  writing. Under the interim rule, prime contractors are required to inform a  contracting officer of the value added that they are providing when  subcontract costs exceed 70 percent of the total contract value.

We met with DOD officials from the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy, Defense Contract  Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA),  and contracting officials from 11 DOD contracting locations to discuss  these regulations and their approach to assessing the risk of pass-through  charges, evaluating contractor value added, and factors that drive these  assessments. We selected 10 of these locations, which had some of the  highest spending in fiscal year 2005, to visit and discuss specific contracts,  policies, and processes related to evaluating contractor value added when  work is subcontracted. In addition, while we did not visit the Army Tank  and Automotive Command in Warren, Michigan, we obtained contract  documents from it for review. While our selection of locations cannot be  generalized to the population of all DOD contracting locations, those  selected represented each of the military services and represented a  variety of goods and services procured.

These selected actions included base  contracts, task orders under contracts, and modifications to contracts.  Since DOD\u2019s procurement information system\u2014DD350 database\u2014does  not contain a specific field for percentage of subcontracting, of all DOD  contract actions over $10 million and had reported submitting a   subcontracting plan, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of actions that  provided a mix of contract types, levels of competition, dollar values, and  goods and services procured.  Moreover, we also selected small business  contracts over $10 million. While small businesses are not required to  submit subcontracting plans, the dollar value of these actions would have  otherwise required them. We relied on data provided in the DD350  database and verified the reliability of the information where practical  with contracting officers, contract files at contract locations visited, and  through review of contract documents in DOD\u2019s Electronic Data Access  Web-based system.

In  reviewing and discussing contract files with contracting officials at these  locations, we examined factors that drove the need to assess prime  contractor and subcontractor costs, guidance and tools available to  conduct assessments, and level of insight into subcontracting activity.  Included in the contract files and also reviewed were documents from  DCAA and DCMA that were used to support the decisions of contracting  officials.
