For example, GAO found that changes to the Office of Professional Responsibility's (OPR) processes for assessing the merits of misconduct complaints reduced assessment time that took up to 90 days in 2008 to about 7 days in 2014. However, GAO found that DOJ does not require its components to demonstrate that attorneys have served the discipline imposed on them for misconduct. Ensuring that discipline is implemented helps hold attorneys accountable for violating professional standards and provides the public reasonable assurance that misconduct is being addressed. DOJ also has not implemented a change called for in a January 2011 memorandum from the Attorney General that would expand the purview of the Professional Misconduct Review Unit (PMRU)--the unit that proposes and decides discipline for attorneys with findings of misconduct by OPR. With this change, PMRU would go from deciding discipline for attorneys with professional misconduct findings in U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAO) and the Criminal Division to all components. According to the Attorney General, this change could help reduce delays in implementing discipline and ensure consistent decisions about discipline. DOJ did not provide GAO with reasons for not making this change.", "DOJ policy provides that supervisors of attorneys accused of, or found to have engaged in, professional misconduct can use discretion to determine what work to assign to these attorneys. DOJ also provides agency-wide guidance to supervisors, such as administrative directives and the U.S. Attorneys' Manual, that identify steps supervisors may take when dealing with attorneys accused of misconduct. Representatives for 12 of the 20 USAOs and 20 of the 28 litigating sections we surveyed reported that supervisors assign work on a case-by-case basis but consider factors, such as the nature of the alleged misconduct, in doing so. A smaller number of respondents reported that supervisors may assign work to such attorneys no differently than to other attorneys until the supervisors determine allegations have merit or professional misconduct is confirmed.", "Under departmental policy, DOJ is not to authorize legal representation for attorneys in OPR proceedings, including representation to assist such attorneys in preparing submissions to support their defense. However, DOJ attorneys, like all federal employees, may be provided legal representation by DOJ for carrying out their duties, under certain circumstances. For example, DOJ may provide representation for an attorney whose conduct is the subject of a state bar proceeding while the attorney is also the subject of an OPR investigation related to the same conduct. The representation would cover defense for the state bar but not the OPR proceeding. As a result, from fiscal years 2008 through 2013, DOJ expended $3.66 million for private counsel representation for 38 DOJ attorneys involved in 18 legal proceedings where there were also related OPR investigations. DOJ found 12 attorneys within these investigations to have engaged in professional misconduct."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOJ (1) require components to demonstrate that they have implemented discipline for misconduct and (2) establish near-term milestones for expanding PMRU's jurisdiction to decide discipline for all attorneys with findings of misconduct.DOJ agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, the Attorney General moved to overturn the conviction of former  senator Ted Stevens, who had been found guilty of seven felony counts  of lying on Senate financial disclosure forms, upon finding that federal  prosecutors had failed to disclose evidence that would have helped  Senator Stevens to defend himself against false statement charges.

To what extent does DOJ have processes to manage complaints of  professional misconduct to discipline attorneys for findings of  misconduct, and that advise on performance awards for these  attorneys?  2.  How do supervisors determine work responsibilities for attorneys  accused of, or who have been found to have engaged in, professional  misconduct?  3.

We  reviewed OPR complaint data from fiscal years 2008 through 2013 in  order to describe what, if any, changes occurred in the number of  complaints and the length of time to complete inquiries and investigations  since DOJ\u2019s process for managing complaints of professional misconduct  changed in 2011. We reviewed internal DOJ personnel and disciplinary  documentation for all 40 cases for which OPR investigated attorneys for  professional misconduct and for which PMRU was responsible for  considering discipline from fiscal years 2011 through 2013, and compared  DOJ\u2019s practices for documenting disciplinary actions with internal  controls.

The Deputy Counsel stated that cases of  misconduct may not be referred to OPR because the attorney\u2019s  supervisor has concluded that misconduct did not occur.

According to OPR\u2019s Deputy Counsel, DOJ does not have any set  schedule of penalties if an attorney fails to report professional misconduct  for at least two reasons. First, discipline must be imposed on an individual  basis, taking into consideration established factors, and DOJ prefers the  flexibility to recommend disciplinary measures on a case-by-case basis  rather than being restricted to a set of predetermined penalties. Second,  according to OPR\u2019s Deputy Counsel, imposing penalties that are not  based upon individual conduct and circumstances may serve to  discourage attorneys from reporting misconduct.

OPR also  has no authority over judges and defense attorneys and OPR cannot  compel them to report misconduct when it occurs.

We reviewed OPR complaint  data from fiscal years 2008 through 2013 in order to describe what, if any,  changes occurred in the number of complaints and the length of time to  complete inquiries and investigations since DOJ\u2019s process for managing  complaints of professional misconduct changed in 2011.We reviewed  OPR complaint data from fiscal years 2008 through 2013 in order to  describe what, if any, changes occurred in the number of complaints and  the length of time to complete inquiries and investigations since DOJ\u2019s  process for managing complaints of professional misconduct changed in  2011. We reviewed internal DOJ personnel and disciplinary  documentation for 40 cases that the Office of Professional Responsibility  (OPR) investigated for professional misconduct between fiscal years  2011 and 2013 to determine the discipline imposed upon these attorneys,  and compared DOJ\u2019s practices for documenting disciplinary actions with  internal controls. We reviewed these cases because they were the first  and only cases of professional misconduct, at the time of our review, for  which the Professional Misconduct Review Unit (PMRU) has jurisdiction  to review and assess for disciplinary action. For each case, we reviewed  internal DOJ personnel and disciplinary documentation to determine the  discipline imposed upon attorneys found to have engaged in professional  misconduct and the extent to which DOJ implemented disciplinary  decisions when attorneys were found to have engaged in professional  misconduct. We did not test whether discipline imposed was consistent  across offenses because the type and length of discipline is dependent  upon DOJ\u2019s professional judgment. For these attorneys we also  determined whether DOJ had provided a performance award or  promotion to them within 1 year of PMRU\u2019s disciplinary decision.", "To identify what constituted a performance award we used criteria  provided by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which allows  agencies to provide one of four types of awards to federal employees:  lump-sum cash awards, honorary awards, informal recognition awards,  and time-off awards. We also reviewed DOJ-provided data to determine  whether these attorneys had received any DOJ-specific awards. In  addition, we interviewed the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for  Human Resources and Administration to determine how DOJ decides  which employees are eligible to receive an award. We also interviewed  senior-level DOJ officials within OPR, PMRU, the Criminal Division, the  Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA), and the Professional  Responsibility Advisory Office, and the National Discovery Coordinator to  obtain their views on how DOJ manages complaints of professional  misconduct and identifies actions DOJ has taken to help deter departures  from professional standards. We interviewed and reviewed the literature  produced by a variety of third-party stakeholders, such as advocacy  groups and academics, to obtain information on their perspectives on  DOJ\u2019s efforts to address professional misconduct. Interviews with these  stakeholders cannot be generalized. However, they provide valuable  insights about DOJ\u2019s abilities to effectively identify and address  professional misconduct within the department.", "To address our second objective, we sent a questionnaire to 20 selected  U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices (USAO) and 28 litigating sections within selected  DOJ components to collect information on the various types of policies  and procedures put in place to manage the work activities of attorneys  accused of or found to have engaged in professional misconduct. We  selected USAOs because officials from EOUSA\u2019s General Counsel\u2019s  Office stated that attorneys within the USAOs would be in the best  position to discuss management of the work activities of attorneys alleged  or found to have committed professional misconduct. We selected  litigating sections to provide additional examples of how the department  manages the work activities of attorneys alleged or found to have  committed professional misconduct. To ensure that we obtained  information across USAOs with varying workloads, we ordered DOJ\u2019s 93  USAOs by size using office case workload hours provided in the U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 2012 Statistical Report, divided these into quartiles, and  randomly selected 5 USAOs within each quartile. We selected litigating  sections within DOJ components that have experience managing  attorneys subject to a complaint of professional misconduct between  fiscal years 2008 and 2013.to the Criminal Division, Civil Rights Division, Tax Division, Environment  and Natural Resources Division, Antitrust Division, and the Civil Division.  Because we used a nongeneralizable sample, our findings cannot be  used to make inferences about other USAOs or DOJ components. We  received responses from all 20 USAOs and 28 litigating offices within  DOJ components. We did not independently verify the data reported by  offices in the questionnaire; however, we interviewed senior-level officials  with EOUSA\u2019s General Counsel to assess the reasonableness of the data  reported. We believe the data are reliable for our purposes. We also  interviewed officials within EOUSA to identify what challenges may arise  when managing attorneys are accused of, or who have been found to  have engaged in, professional misconduct, and to determine how they  manage attorneys\u2019 work assignments.", "Using these criteria, we sent questionnaires  To address our third objective, we analyzed DOJ\u2019s policies for providing  legal representation to federal employees as outlined in 28 C.F.R \u00a7 50.15  and 28 C.F.R \u00a7 50.16. We assessed agency-wide policy guidelines  identifying the circumstances under which federal employees are eligible  to receive representation by private counsel at DOJ expense. We  collected data from the Constitutional and Specialized Torts Litigation  Section (CSTL) of the Civil Division\u2014 the primary section that authorizes  legal representation for federal employees and maintaining data on these  requests\u2014and the Civil Division\u2019s Office of Planning and Budget  Evaluation, on the number of cases for which DOJ approved legal  representation for federal employees, between fiscal years 2008 and  2013. We also collected cost data from DOJ on the total amount the DOJ  paid to provide legal representation by private counsel to federal  employees between fiscal years 2008 and 2013. We did not collect cost  data from DOJ on the amount it expended to provide direct representation  because of the time and difficulty required of DOJ to collect this data. We  did, however, collect cost data from DOJ on the amount expended for  private counsel because DOJ keeps receipts for expenditures made to  private counsel firms. We assessed the reliability of both sets of these  data by interviewing staff within CSTL and the Civil Division\u2019s Office of  Budget. We concluded that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To determine the amount paid by DOJ for private  counsel representation for its attorneys where there was a related OPR  investigation, we asked CSTL to provide data on matters where private  counsel representation at DOJ expense was provided to attorneys in a  main justice component or USAO, for fiscal years 2008 through 2013.  OPR also provided information for each of these matters as to whether  there was related OPR inquiry or investigation; OPR may not have  investigated all persons to whom representation was granted. To  determine the nature of the matters\u2014including whether they involved the  failure to disclose certain required evidence in the discovery process\u2014we  reviewed bar disciplinary decisions, docket sheets, judicial opinions, and  other publically available documents describing allegations of  professional misconduct related to these matters.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to December  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Dawn Locke (Assistant Director);  Sara Margraf (Analyst-in-Charge); Wendy Dye; Lorraine Ettaro; Eric  Hauswirth; Jonathan Hutto; Tracey King; Linda Miller; Jessica Orr; Tovah  Rom; Joseph Som-Pimpong; and Janet Temko-Blinder made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
