Fundamental differences in how work is scheduled and how hours are counted also result in pay differences. For overtime, Sunday, and holiday work, Customs officers are generally paid for hours worked, whereas INS officers are often paid on the basis of minimum periods of time worked. Night pay is also fundamentally different. Foreign language awards and the inclusion of overtime pay in calculating retirement benefits are other examples of pay provisions that apply to Customs officers but not to INS officers. Because Customs and INS schedule work differently, it is difficult to compare the two systems and to analyze the effects of differences on officers' pay."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2001, we reported to you about the effects of proposed legislation on U.S. Customs Service officers\u2019 night pay, the first of the two issues that we agreed to report on in response to your request. This report focuses on the second issue, differences in Customs and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officers\u2019 pay. Our objectives were to (1) identify the differences in Customs and INS officers\u2019 pay provisions, focusing on overtime and premium pay and (2) determine the effects of some of the differences on officers\u2019 pay.", "To address our first objective, we compared Customs and INS pay provisions and identified differences in the provisions, with emphasis on how officers are paid overtime and premium pay. To address our second objective, we analyzed selected Customs and INS officers\u2019 work schedules, shifts, and pay for two federal pay periods covering 4 weeks in January and February 2001. We conducted our analysis at one port of entry and selected six examples of different work schedules to compare officers\u2019 pay. Our analysis involved obtaining the officers\u2019 work schedules, shifts, and pay for the two federal pay periods and comparing the amount officers were paid with the amount they would have been paid under the other agency\u2019s pay provisions. Our analysis of the effects of different provisions on selected officers\u2019 pay does not include all the differences between the two pay systems. For example, we did not analyze the effects of Customs\u2019 foreign language proficiency award on officers\u2019 pay. Our comparisons are illustrative of some differences in the two pay systems and their effects on officers\u2019 pay, but they are not intended to provide generalizable findings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Customs Service and INS work closely together to perform their diverse missions at the nation\u2019s ports of entry. Customs officers\u2019 responsibilities include (1) collecting revenue from imports, (2) inspecting all cargo entering the country, (3) enforcing Customs and other U.S. laws and regulations, and (4) preventing the smuggling of drugs and other contraband into the United States. INS officers\u2019 responsibilities include (1) conducting inspections of travelers entering the United States to ensure that all who enter have appropriate documentation, (2) denying entry to those who are not legally admissible, and (3) enforcing all immigration laws related to the immigration and naturalization of noncitizens. Both agencies are cross-designated to enforce each other\u2019s respective areas of responsibility, and consequently, both Customs and INS officers interdict inadmissible aliens, contraband, and drugs.", "At the close of fiscal year 2000, Customs had a permanent workforce of about 20,000 employees, including about 8,000 Customs officers. These employees carry out Customs\u2019 mission at its headquarters, 20 Customs Management Centers, 20 Special Agent-in-Charge offices, 301 U.S. ports of entry, 5 Strategic Trade Centers, and over 25 international offices. Customs processed over 23 million import entries, with a value of $1.17 trillion; 140 million conveyances; and 489 million land, sea, and air passengers in fiscal year 2000.", "The operational and management functions of INS are administered through INS headquarters, which oversees approximately 29,000 employees through three Regional Offices and a headquarters-based Office of International Affairs. These offices are responsible for directing the activities of 33 districts and 21 Border Patrol sectors throughout the United States and three district offices and 39 area offices outside U.S. territory. In March 2000, INS had over 5,000 officers staffing the country\u2019s ports of entry. In fiscal year 2000, INS carried out immigration inspections for nearly 438 million travelers at the land borders and nearly 92 million travelers at airports and seaports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify the differences between the Customs and INS systems for paying overtime and premium pay to their officers, we researched the current laws and regulations pertaining to both agencies\u2019 overtime and premium pay. We interviewed key officials from several Customs and INS organizations, including Customs\u2019 Offices of Finance, Field Operations, and Human Resource Management and INS\u2019 Offices of Human Resources and Development, Inspections, and Budget Systems and Reports Branch. We also reviewed other documents, such as a 1998 Congressional Research Service report comparing Customs and INS overtime and premium pay.", "We also visited the South Pacific Customs Management Center and the INS District Office, both in San Diego, CA, and the San Ysidro port of entry, which is the largest and busiest land border port in the world.

We compared work schedules, shifts, and pay for federal pay periods 2 and 3, covering 4 weeks in January and February 2001.", "We selected these two pay periods because they allowed us to assess the effects of the differences in overtime, Sunday, holiday, and night pay. Our analysis involved obtaining the officers\u2019 work schedules, shifts, and pay for the two pay periods and comparing the amount officers were paid with the amount they would have been paid under the other agency\u2019s pay provisions.", "We obtained work schedules, shifts, and pay data for Customs officers from Customs\u2019 central pay database, the Customs Overtime Scheduling System (COSS), which contains detailed information of officers\u2019 overtime and premium pay. For INS, we obtained planned work schedules from the Finalized Schedule Report and actual work schedules and shift data from the Time & Attendance Worksheet and the Inspection Overtime Order Report and Certification forms at the port. We obtained pay data for INS officers at San Ysidro from their Budget Systems and Reports Branch at INS headquarters.", "We developed three pay comparisons based on Customs officers\u2019 work schedules, shifts, and pay and three based on INS officers\u2019 work schedules, shifts, and pay. From each agency, we judgmentally selected two GS-11, step 7 officers, and one GS-9, step 4 officer. GS-11 and GS-9 officers were selected because they are the predominant grade levels at the port. We selected officers who worked on the most heavily staffed shifts at San Ysidro, whose work schedules or shifts we believed would best illustrate the differences in specific pay elements including Sunday, holiday, and night differential pay.", "Customs and INS payroll specialists with expertise in time and attendance reporting assisted us in calculating our comparisons. The officers manually performed calculations to determine how much overtime and premium pay the selected officers would have been paid under their agency\u2019s pay provisions, assuming the same pay grades and that similar schedules were worked. The officers documented and explained their calculations based on Customs and INS pay provisions.", "Our comparisons were complicated by difficulties in obtaining agency- wide shift and payroll data at INS and the need to manually calculate and verify the pay estimates with the assistance of the Customs and INS payroll specialists at San Ysidro. Moreover, the comparisons demonstrate only a small fraction of the combinations of work schedules and shifts that are, and can be, worked by Customs and INS officers in the field. Therefore, we must caution that our comparisons may not be representative of Customs and INS operations nationwide. They demonstrate, however, that straightforward and generalizable comparisons in relation to these pay provisions are infeasible. Tables showing the effects of the differences in pay systems for each of our comparisons are shown on pp. 11-12 and in appendix II.", "We performed our work between February 2001 and September 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparison of Customs and INS Officers\u2019 Pay Provisions", "paragraphs": ["For many years, Customs and INS officers were paid under similar systems. Customs was governed by the Act of February 13, 1911 (36 Stat. 899, 901), which is commonly referred to as the \u201c1911 Act,\u201d and INS by the Act of March 2, 1931 (46 Stat. 1467), referred to as the \u201c1931 Act.\u201d The 1931 legislation was intended to bring overtime pay for INS officers to a level comparable to that of Customs officers under the 1911 Act. In 1993, Congress passed legislation providing for Customs officer pay reform; the INS officers\u2019 pay system was not addressed in the legislation. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66) changed the overtime and premium pay system for Customs officers. The Customs Officers Pay Reform Amendments (COPRA) provisions of P.L. 103-66 amended the 1911 Act. Overtime and premium pay for most other federal employees is governed by the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, referred to as the \u201c1945 Act,\u201d as amended. Under certain circumstances, INS officers are also compensated for overtime under the 1945 Act.", "Table 1 shows differences between Customs and INS pay provisions and explains some terms used when referring to certain provisions and pay calculations.", "Table 2 shows that Customs and INS have different provisions for overtime and pay for Sunday, holiday, and night work. The systems are not easy to compare because pay rates and time periods that count toward overtime and night differential pay also differ.", "Table 3 shows a comparison of the hours of overtime worked versus the number of hours paid under Customs and INS pay provisions. The primary difference between the two overtime provisions is that Customs pays double the hourly rate for actual hours worked, while INS can pay more than double-time depending on the number of hours worked.", "Table 4 shows a comparison of Sunday pay under Customs and INS pay provisions. The major difference is that Customs pays 1.5 times the hourly rate for actual hours worked; INS provides 2-days\u2019 pay for 8 or fewer hours worked.", "Table 5 shows a comparison of holiday pay under Customs and INS pay provisions. The primary difference again is that Customs pays 8 hours basic pay plus one hour of holiday pay for each additional hour worked; INS provides 2-days\u2019 pay for 8 or fewer hours worked in addition to basic pay when the holiday falls on a workday other than Sunday.", "Two other differences between Customs and INS pay provisions involve extra pay for foreign language proficiency and consideration of overtime in calculating retirement benefits. Customs pays officers an award of between 3 and 5 percent of basic pay for using a foreign language on the job, while foreign language proficiency is a condition of employment for INS officers. Customs also includes overtime up to a maximum of $15,000 in calculating retirement benefits; INS does not."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of Differences in Customs and INS Pay Provisions Varied Depending on Schedules and Shifts Worked", "paragraphs": ["Our six comparisons of Customs and INS officers\u2019 overtime and premium pay showed that the effect of differences in pay provisions varied based on schedules and shifts worked.

The difference is primarily because INS pays 2-days\u2019 pay plus basic pay for a holiday, and Customs pays 1-day\u2019s pay plus basic pay for the holiday. This difference is partially offset, however, by Customs\u2019 paying night differential to an officer on annual leave (vacation); INS pays limited night differential to officers while they are on leave.
