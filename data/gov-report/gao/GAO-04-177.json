The Schedules of  Federal Debt present the beginning balances, increases and decreases, and  ending balances for (1) Federal Debt Held by the Public and  Intragovernmental Debt Holdings, (2) the related Accrued Interest  Payables, and (3) the related Net Unamortized Premiums and Discounts  managed by the bureau.", "The auditor\u2019s report contains our (1) opinion on the Schedules of Federal  Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2003 and 2002, (2) opinion on  the effectiveness of related internal control as of September 30, 2003,  (3) conclusion on the bureau's compliance in fiscal year 2003 with laws we  tested, and (4) conclusion on the consistency between information in the  Schedules of Federal Debt and the Overview on Federal Debt Managed by  the Bureau of the Public Debt.", "As of September 30, 2003 and 2002, federal debt managed by the bureau  totaled about $6,783 billion and $6,213 billion, respectively, for moneys  borrowed to fund the government\u2019s operations. As shown on the Schedules  of Federal Debt, these balances consisted of approximately (1)  $3,924 billion as of September 30, 2003, and $3,553 billion as of September  30, 2002, of debt held by the public and about (2) $2,859 billion as of  September 30, 2003, and $2,660 billion as of September 30, 2002, of  intragovernmental debt holdings.", "The level of debt held by the public reflects how much of the nation\u2019s  wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior  federal spending in excess of total federal revenues. It best represents the  cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today\u2019s economy and the  federal budget. To finance a cash deficit, the government borrows from the  public. When a cash surplus occurs, the annual excess funds can then be  used to reduce debt held by the public. In other words, cash deficits or  surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the amount of  government borrowing from the public.", "Cash surpluses during fiscal years 1998 through 2001 enabled Treasury to  reduce debt held by the public by $476 billion, from $3,815 billion as of  September 30, 1997, to $3,339 billion as of September 30, 2001. Treasury  reduced this debt by redeeming maturing debt, reducing the number of  auctions and size of new debt issues, conducting \u201cbuybacks\u201d of debt before  its maturity date, and redeeming callable securities when the opportunities  arose. However, because of the return to deficits, in fiscal years 2002 and  2003, debt held by the public increased by $585 billion, with about  $371 billion of this increase occurring in fiscal year 2003. Treasury issued  more debt by increasing the number of auctions and the size of new debt  issues. During fiscal year 2003, Treasury reintroduced the 3-year note,  which will be offered every quarter. In addition, Treasury increased the  offerings of the 5-year note from quarterly to monthly offerings; the 10-year  note from an offering every quarter to eight offerings a year; and the 10- year inflation indexed note from three offerings a year to an offering every  quarter. Notwithstanding the increases in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, debt  held by the public as a percentage of total federal debt has decreased from  approximately 71 percent as of September 30, 1997, to approximately  58 percent as of September 30, 2003.", "Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities  held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds, that  typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over  disbursements in federal securities. Most federal trust funds invest in  special U.S. Treasury securities that are guaranteed for principal and  interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These securities  are nonmarketable; however, they represent a priority call on future  budgetary resources. Certain of these trust funds, such as the Social  Security and federal civilian employee and military retirement trust funds,  have been running cash surpluses, which are loaned to the Treasury and  reduce the current need for the government to borrow from the public.  Primarily as a result of such trust fund surpluses, intragovernmental debt  holdings have increased by approximately $1,276 billion during fiscal years  1998 through 2003, from $1,583 billion as of September 30, 1997, to  $2,859 billion as of September 30, 2003, with about $199 billion of this  increase occurring in fiscal year 2003. Intragovernmental debt holdings as a  percentage of total federal debt have increased from approximately  29 percent as of September 30, 1997, to approximately 42 percent as of  September 30, 2003.", "The transactions relating to the use of the federal government accounts\u2019  surpluses net out on the government\u2019s consolidated financial statements  because, in effect, they represent loans from one part of the government to  another. Importantly, these intragovernmental debt holdings also constitute  future obligations of the Treasury since the Treasury must provide cash to  redeem these securities in order for the individual accounts to pay their  benefits or other obligations as they come due. When this occurs, if  sufficient cash surpluses are not available to redeem the securities, the  government would either need to increase borrowing from the public, raise  future taxes, reduce future spending, retire less debt (if the budget as a  whole is in surplus), or some combination thereof.", "While both are important, debt held by the public and intragovernmental  debt holdings are very different. Debt held by the public approximates the  federal government\u2019s competition with other sectors in the credit markets.  Federal borrowing absorbs resources available for private investment and  may put upward pressure on interest rates. In addition, interest on debt  held by the public is paid in cash and represents a burden on current  taxpayers. It reflects the amount the government pays to its outside  creditors. In contrast, intragovernmental debt holdings perform an  accounting function but typically do not require cash payments from the  current budget or represent a burden on the current economy. In addition,  from the perspective of the budget as a whole, interest payments to federal  government accounts by the Treasury are entirely offset by the income  received by such accounts\u2014in effect, one part of the government pays the  interest and another part receives it. This intragovernmental debt and the  interest on it represents a claim on future resources and hence a burden on  future taxpayers and the future economy. However, these  intragovernmental debt holdings do not fully reflect the government\u2019s total  future commitment to trust fund financed programs. They primarily  represent the cumulative cash surpluses of those trust funds and also  reflect future priority claims on the U.S. Treasury. They do not have the  current economic effects of borrowing from the public and do not currently  compete with the private sector for available funds in the credit markets.  However, when trust funds redeem Treasury securities to obtain cash to  fund expenditures, and Treasury borrows from the public to finance these  redemptions, there is competition with the private sector and thus an effect  on the economy.", "During fiscal year 2003, Treasury again faced the challenge of managing the  debt within the statutory debt limit. On February 20, 2003, Treasury entered  into a debt issuance suspension period that required it to depart from its  normal debt management procedures and to invoke legal authorities  provided to avoid breaching the debt limit. Actions taken by Treasury  included suspending investment of receipts of the Government Securities  Investment Fund (G-Fund) of the federal employees\u2019 Thrift Savings Plan,  the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund (Civil Service fund),  and the Exchange Stabilization Fund; redeeming Civil Service fund  securities early; suspending the sales of State and Local Government Series  nonmarketable Treasury securities; exchanging Treasury securities for  Federal Financing Bank securities; and recalling compensating balances  held at some commercial banks. In addition, because the debt subject to  the limit was so close to the ceiling during this period, Treasury turned to  issuing bills with maturity dates of 14 days or less to manage short-term  financing needs. On May 27, 2003, legislation was enacted to raise the  statutory debt limit by $984 billion to $7,384 billion. Subsequently, Treasury  restored all losses to the G-Fund and Civil Service fund in accordance with  legal authorities provided to the Secretary of the Treasury. The  Congressional Budget Office recently projected that this new debt limit will  be reached during fiscal year 2004.", "The challenge of managing the federal debt is not likely to diminish any  time soon. In fiscal year 2003 alone, debt held by the public increased by  approximately 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014from  34.2 percent at the start of the fiscal year to an estimated 36.5 percent at the  end. Although the recession of 2001 has been over for almost 2 years, the  federal budget deficit for fiscal year 2003 is the largest (in nominal dollars)  on record, and projections suggest that the deficit for fiscal year 2004 will  be even larger. Budget controls instituted to achieve balance in the past  have expired, and no agreement has been reached on the appropriate  structure or process for focusing on the large and growing fiscal challenges  that now face the federal government.", "These large deficits come as the squeeze on the federal budget from the  impending retirement of the baby boom generation is becoming more  apparent in the fiscal outlook. Under the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s  most recent 10-year budget outlook, economic growth is projected to be  about half a percentage point lower on average after 2008 when the leading  edge of the baby boom generation becomes eligible for early retirement. At  the same time, growth in Social Security and Medicare spending is  projected to accelerate while Medicaid spending is projected to continue  growing even faster than these two programs. Under current law, spending  for these three programs will account for nearly half of all federal spending  in 2013. Indeed, GAO\u2019s long-term budget simulations continue to show that  without changes to the major entitlement programs for the elderly, the  nation will ultimately have to choose between escalating federal deficits  and debt, significant tax increases, and/or dramatic budget cuts in other  areas. Acting sooner rather than later is essential to ease these building  fiscal pressures.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Appropriations; the Senate  Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Senate Committee on the Budget;  the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and General Government,  Senate Committee on Appropriations; the House Committee on  Appropriations; the House Committee on Government Reform; the House  Committee on the Budget; the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury,  and Independent Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations; and the  Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and Financial Management,  House Committee on Government Reform.

Nearly all the federal debt  has been issued by the Treasury with a small portion being issued by other federal government agencies.
