Almost all states described initiatives to improve access to dental services, including simplifying claims processing, increasing reimbursement rates, recruiting providers, and educating beneficiaries. Nonetheless, access rates remain low and states reported that long-standing barriers hinder further improvement. Since May 2007, CMS has taken steps to strengthen its oversight of Medicaid dental services for children, but gaps remain. For example, CMS reviews of Medicaid dental services in 17 states identified a number of concerns and made recommendations for improvement. Nonetheless, at the time of our review CMS did not plan to perform more reviews, even though other states had utilization rates well below HHS's 2010 target for low-income children receiving a preventive dental service. CMS also provided guidance to states and facilitated collaboration among stakeholders, but states reported needing more CMS support, including guidance on setting dental payment rates, on quality initiatives, and on promoting outreach.

Although dental services are a  mandatory benefit for the 30 million children served by Medicaid, these  children often experience elevated levels of dental problems and have  difficulty finding dentists to treat them. Attention to this subject became  more acute after the widely publicized case of a 12-year-old boy who died  in 2007 as a result of an untreated infected tooth, even though he was  entitled to dental coverage under Medicaid. In testimony before the  Subcommittee on Domestic Policy of the Committee on Oversight and  Government Reform last year, we reported that children in Medicaid were  almost twice as likely to have untreated cavities as children with private  insurance. We also reported that the percentage of children in Medicaid  ages 2 through 18 who received any dental care\u201437 percent according to  national survey data\u2014was far below the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) target of having 66 percent of low-income children under  age 19 receive a preventive dental service.", "Concerns about low-income children\u2019s poor oral health and inadequate  access to dental services, low payment rates for dental services, and  insufficient federal and state efforts to address oral health access  problems are long-standing. Our reports dating back to 2000 highlight the  problem of chronic dental disease and the factors that contribute to low  use of dental services by low-income populations, including children in  Medicaid. A major concern has been the adequacy of the network of  dental providers who serve low-income populations, particularly for  children who receive Medicaid dental services under managed care. This  concern stems in part from investigations by the Subcommittee that found  that some managed care organizations (MCO) did not have adequate  provider networks\u2014that is, a sufficient number and mix of dental  providers\u2014to provide timely access to covered Medicaid dental services.  In September 2000, we reported that while several factors contributed to  the low use of dental services among low-income persons who had  coverage, the major factor was difficulty finding dentists to treat them.  During a Subcommittee hearing in May 2007, concerns were raised about  federal oversight of state Medicaid dental services for children by the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees  Medicaid at the federal level.", "You expressed concern about the state and federal actions taken to ensure  children in Medicaid receive recommended dental services. This report  examines (1) the strategies that state Medicaid programs employ to  monitor and improve access to dental services for children in Medicaid  and (2) CMS actions since 2007 to improve oversight of state Medicaid  dental services for children. To identify state strategies to improve  children\u2019s access to Medicaid dental services, we conducted a Web-based  survey of state Medicaid directors in all 50 states and the District of  Columbia. The survey included both closed-ended and open-ended  questions regarding dental services for children, the methods states have  used for promoting and monitoring dental utilization (the use of dental  services), statewide goals for the delivery of dental services, and the  federal support provided to states for the provision of dental services. To  establish the reliability of our survey data, we consulted with  knowledgeable state officials in developing the survey and pre-tested the  survey questions with Medicaid officials from two states. The survey was  conducted from December 8, 2008, through January 30, 2009. We received  responses from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We reviewed  survey responses for internal consistency and in certain cases where  responses were absent, unclear, or inconsistent, we contacted state  officials for clarification. We did not independently verify specific aspects  of responses or the effectiveness of programs reported through the survey.  We determined that the data submitted by states were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our engagement. In addition to the Web-based survey,  we reviewed studies and reports on state Medicaid dental-related  initiatives and conducted a review of current literature to obtain  information on these initiatives and on barriers to providing dental care in  Medicaid. To describe contractual provisions between states and MCOs  concerning network adequacy and timely access standards related to  dental services for children, we obtained and reviewed a non-generalizable  sample of contracts from the MCOs that covered dental services and that  served the most Medicaid beneficiaries in 9 states, including 5 states  whose dental programs had been reviewed by CMS in 2008.", "To examine CMS\u2019s oversight of state Medicaid dental services for children,  we interviewed CMS officials; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and  guidance that CMS provides to states; and interviewed key stakeholders,  including the Medicaid/SCHIP Dental Association, the National  Association of State Medicaid Directors (NASMD), and experts involved  with pediatric dental issues. We also reviewed data used by CMS to  monitor provision of dental services to children in state Medicaid  programs, including information in annual reports submitted by states on  the provision of dental and other services provided under Medicaid\u2019s early  and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) benefit. We  also examined CMS\u2019s reviews of Medicaid dental programs in 17 states. To  obtain states\u2019 perspectives of CMS oversight, we included several  questions about CMS\u2019s guidance and activities in our survey of state  Medicaid programs. We conducted this performance audit from July 2008  through August 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Left untreated, the pain and infections  caused by tooth decay can lead to problems in eating, speaking, and  learning. Proper dental care can prevent tooth decay and associated  problems that can lead to dental disease and even death. Research has  shown that preventive dental care is cost effective and can make a  significant difference in health outcomes. For example, a 2004 study found  that, over a 5-year period, low-income children who had their first  preventive dental visit by age 1 had average dental-related costs of $262,  compared to $546 for children who received their first preventive visit at  age 4 through 5.", "The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) recommends that  each child see a dentist when the child\u2019s first tooth erupts and no later  than the child\u2019s first birthday, with subsequent visits occurring at 6-month  intervals or more frequently if recommended by a dentist. The early initial  visit establishes a \u201cdental home\u201d for the child, creating an opportunity to  build an ongoing relationship with a dental provider who can ensure  comprehensive, continuously accessible care. Comprehensive dental visits  can include both clinical assessments, such as for tooth decay and the  need for sealants, and appropriate discussion and counseling for oral  hygiene, injury prevention, and speech and language development, among  other topics. Because resistance to tooth decay is determined partly by  genetics and partly by behavior, delaying the onset of tooth decay may  also reduce long-term risk for decay.", "Recognizing the importance of good oral health, HHS in 1990 established  oral health goals as part of its Healthy People 2000 initiative; and in 2000  updated these oral health goals for 2010. These include goals related to  oral health in children, for example, reducing the proportion of children  with untreated tooth decay. Another goal relates to the Medicaid  population: to increase the proportion of low-income children and  adolescents under the age of 19 who receive any preventive dental service  each year to 66 percent in 2010.", "At the federal level, CMS oversees Medicaid, which provides health care  coverage for low-income families and aged, blind, and disabled people.  CMS oversight includes monitoring state Medicaid programs, issuing  guidance to states, and facilitating communication and collaboration  among stakeholders. Medicaid provided health coverage for over   30 million children under 21 in fiscal year 2008. The states operate their  Medicaid programs within broad federal requirements and may contract  with MCOs to provide Medicaid benefits. CMS estimated that in 2006 about  65 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received benefits through some form  of managed care. State Medicaid programs are required to cover certain  populations and services under federal law. For instance, under the  Medicaid EPSDT benefit, state Medicaid programs generally must provide  coverage of dental screening, diagnostic, and related treatment services  for all eligible Medicaid beneficiaries under the age of 21. Other federal  requirements for the EPSDT benefit that are related to dental services  include the following:    Developing dental periodicity schedules. State Medicaid programs  have some flexibility in determining the frequency and timing of dental  screenings covered for children under the EPSDT benefit. Under federal  law, however, state Medicaid programs must provide these dental services  at intervals that meet reasonable standards of dental practice as  determined by the state after consultation with recognized dental  organizations involved in children\u2019s health care. According to CMS  guidance, as an alternative to developing a state-specific periodicity  schedule, a state may adopt a nationally recognized dental periodicity  standard, such as the schedule recommended by AAPD. CMS considers  AAPD\u2019s periodicity schedule a model for comparison and it is published in  CMS\u2019s Guide to Children\u2019s Dental Care in Medicaid.", "Reporting on delivery of EPSDT services. Federal law requires states  to report annually on the provision of EPSDT services, including dental  services. The annual EPSDT participation report, Form CMS-416  (hereafter called the CMS 416), is the agency\u2019s primary tool for gathering  data on the provision of dental services to children in state Medicaid  programs. It captures data on the number of children who received a  preventive dental service, a dental treatment service, or any dental service  each year. Information on the CMS 416 report is used to calculate a state\u2019s  dental utilization rate\u2014the percentage of children eligible for EPSDT that  received any dental service in a given year.", "Inadequate access to dental services for low-income children has been a  longstanding concern. In April 2000, we reported that Medicaid  beneficiaries and other low-income people had low rates of dental visits  and high rates of dental disease relative to the rest of the population. In a  September 2000 report, we identified factors influencing the access that  low-income groups have to dental care: a primary factor was limited  dentist participation in Medicaid. As part of its oversight of state  Medicaid dental services for children, in January 2001 CMS issued a letter  to state Medicaid directors indicating that, through a series of state  reviews, CMS would increase its oversight activities and assess state  compliance with statutory requirements. CMS highlighted four areas for  review: outreach and administrative case management, adequacy of  Medicaid reimbursement rates, increasing provider participation, and  claims reporting and processing. CMS did not complete this initiative. In  September 2008, we reported that the extent of dental disease in Medicaid- enrolled children had not decreased between 1988 through 1994 and 1999  through 2004. We also reported that millions of Medicaid-enrolled  children were estimated to have untreated tooth decay, and that children  in Medicaid were often not receiving dental services.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)  authorized an estimated $87 billion in additional federal Medicaid funding  for states in the form of a temporary increase in the funds that the federal  government contributes toward state Medicaid programs, including the  provision of Medicaid dental services for children. The Recovery Act  provides this money to states through a temporary, 27-month increase in  the federal medical assistance percentage formula\u2014the formula that  determines the federal share of a state\u2019s Medicaid service expenditures.  In July 2009, we reported that the receipt of an increased federal share  may reduce the states\u2019 share of expenditures for their Medicaid program,  and states have reported using these available funds for a variety of  purposes, such as maintaining program eligibility, covering increased  Medicaid caseloads, and maintaining local health care reform initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Medicaid Programs Reported They Employ Multiple Strategies to Monitor and Improve Access to Medicaid Dental Services, but Problems Persist", "paragraphs": ["In response to our survey, most states reported using multiple strategies to  monitor and improve access to Medicaid dental services, but they also  reported that persistent barriers hinder improvements.

In the 21 states where  both fee-for-service and managed care programs are used to provide  dental services to Medicaid-enrolled children, state monitoring can vary by  service delivery method. For example, one state reported that it monitors  the percentage of dentists who treat children through its managed care  program, but does not monitor the percentage of dentists who treat  children through its fee-for-service program.

However, more than half\u201414 of the 21 states\u2014reported that the  MCOs either did not meet any, or only met some, of their standards.  Seventeen states reported that they used incentives or penalties to  encourage the MCOs to meet or exceed state standards. However,  potential incentives or penalties did not always produce the desired result.  For example, one state reported MCOs had not met any of the established  standards even though MCOs could be paid a bonus if they met some or all  of the standards. Similarly, other states reported that only some standards  were being met, despite potential financial penalties if MCOs did not meet  all of the state\u2019s standards.", "State oversight of MCO provider networks varied.

States also described other challenges to meeting their goals and  improving children\u2019s access to dental care, such as fluctuations in  eligibility for services, lack of beneficiary compliance, low oral health  awareness among beneficiaries, and a lack of demand for routine dental  care by beneficiaries.", "In addition to barriers that hinder state initiatives, states report that access  rates could also be affected by two other types of barriers: those faced by  children seeking dental services and those faced by providers serving  Medicaid beneficiaries. For children seeking dental services, most states  reported that finding a provider that accepts Medicaid is a moderate or  major barrier. Comparatively fewer states reported that obtaining  transportation to and from the provider\u2019s office or the ability of parents to  take time off work are moderate or major barriers for children seeking  dental care. For providers, most states also reported that beneficiaries not  showing up for appointments and a limited capacity to accept new  patients (reported by 45 and 30 states, respectively) are moderate to major  barriers.

Between October 2007 and May  2008, CMS conducted a series of focused dental reviews in 17 states. The  reviews were designed to examine state efforts to improve children\u2019s  dental utilization rates, assess state compliance with federal Medicaid  statutes and regulations, and identify promising or notable state practices  to improve the delivery of oral health services. In January 2009, CMS  published a summary report of its findings and recommendations in 16  states (in February 2008, CMS had published a separate report on  Maryland).

In 2008, CMS examined dental- related periodicity schedules from all states. CMS found that all but three  states reported having some type of periodicity schedule, but not all  schedules were in compliance with CMS requirements. For example, some  schedules indicated when a primary care provider should refer a child to a  dentist, but the schedule did not specify how often dental services should  occur. CMS also found that periodicity schedules in several states were  not readily accessible by providers or beneficiaries. For states that had not  submitted separate dental periodicity schedules as required by CMS, CMS  recommended that the states adopt AAPD\u2019s periodicity schedule for  children.", "Publication of a dental policy document. CMS posted a 16-page  document on Medicaid dental policy issues on its Web site in September  2008. This document covered a variety of questions from states on topics  including periodicity schedules, dental referral requirements, covered  services, and patient cost sharing. For example, one question asked if the  state could allow providers to bill patients for missed appointments. CMS  responded that Medicaid policy did not permit such billing, in part because  no service was delivered. Further, missed appointments are not a distinct,  reimbursable Medicaid service, but are instead considered part of a  provider\u2019s overall cost of doing business.", "Communications with states and stakeholders. From 2007 through  2009, CMS held several meetings and conference calls with state dental  representatives, provider associations, and other stakeholders to discuss  issues concerning Medicaid dental services for children.

In the remaining 2 states, CMS cited deficiencies in MCO  provider networks, but did not report its concerns as findings. CMS made  recommendations to strengthen MCO provider networks in all 8 states;  however, CMS did not require these states to take corrective action\u2014 rather, agency officials indicated they would follow up with states on the  status of CMS\u2019s recommendations.", "CMS 416 reports provide limited information on dental service  utilization. The CMS 416 report only gathers data on the number of  children who received a preventive dental service, a dental treatment  service, or any dental service. We have reported in the past that these data  are limited in their usefulness for oversight of Medicaid dental services for  children. For example, because dental services delivered to managed  care enrollees are not reported separately from services to fee-for-service  enrollees, the CMS 416 data does not provide information that could be  used to flag problems with a specific service delivery method. Further, it is  not possible to determine how many children in a state received all of the  recommended dental services included in the state\u2019s periodicity schedule.  According to the CMS Deputy Administrator, the Oral Health Technical  Advisory Group has a project under way to consider improvements to the  CMS 416.", "States report that additional guidance from CMS is needed. In  response to our survey, 2 states reported that CMS\u2019s September 2008  policy paper on Medicaid dental issues was helpful, but nearly all states  (49 of 51) reported that additional CMS guidance could help them improve  delivery of Medicaid dental services. States cited a need for additional  information in several areas: for example, guidance on standards for  dental care, information on billing policies, better definitions for outreach  and transportation services in Medicaid programs, establishing  appropriate dental fee schedules, improving documentation and coding  practices, and information on quality and preventive initiatives.", "CMS has posted relatively few promising practices on its Web site.", "When asked what CMS assistance would be helpful to their state Medicaid  program, the most common answer (other than increasing the federal  medical assistance percentage), cited by 37 states, was information on  other states\u2019 efforts to improve dental utilization. Although CMS maintains  a Web site to publicize promising state Medicaid dental practices, 11 states  reported that they were unaware of the promising practices posted on  CMS\u2019s Web site. The 4 promising practices posted as of May 2009 are just a  few of the practices that could be shared with other states. For example,  during its focused dental reviews, CMS identified 17 additional promising  and notable practices, none of which were included on the CMS promising  practice Web site. Further, 26 states responding to our survey reported  that their states had \u201cbest practices\u201d that could be shared with other  states, such as providing mobile dental vans, training and reimbursing  physicians to do oral screens and apply fluoride varnish, and establishing a  dental home for children (see app. V for brief descriptions of these  practices)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS has begun several initiatives to strengthen its oversight of state  Medicaid dental services for children, but information on the oral health of  and receipt of dental services by Medicaid children show that much more  needs to be done. Although many states have reported moderate increases  in access to Medicaid dental services, we reported in September 2008 that  the extent of dental disease in children had not decreased and that  millions of children were estimated to have untreated tooth decay. States  responding to our survey reported that a lack of available funding, low  provider participation, and administrative burdens\u2014many of the same  factors that contributed to the low use of dental services in 2000\u2014still  present barriers to access today. Through a series of focused reviews of  states\u2019 efforts to provide dental services to children in Medicaid, CMS has  identified deficiencies in several state Medicaid programs. Although CMS  made recommendations for improvement to the states, it required no  corrective actions. Moreover, not all states with low rates of children\u2019s  dental utilization have been reviewed, nor are such reviews planned.  These reviews have not only identified problem areas, but have also  helped identify information on promising state dental practices that could  be useful to other states seeking to improve their own programs. Finally,  for Medicaid-enrolled children who receive dental services through  managed care programs, CMS has found that certain states have not  ensured that MCOs have adequate provider networks to provide covered  dental services to their enrollees. Although CMS and states have taken  steps to address long-standing barriers, continued attention and action is  needed to ensure children\u2019s access to Medicaid dental services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen monitoring of state Medicaid dental services for children  and help states improve children\u2019s access to Medicaid dental services, we  are recommending that the Administrator of CMS take the following four  actions:    Develop a plan to review dental services for Medicaid children in all states  with low utilization rates, such as those not meeting HHS\u2019s Healthy People  2010 targets.", "Ensure that states found to have inadequate MCO dental provider  networks take action to strengthen these networks.", "Work with stakeholders to develop needed guidance on topics of concern  to states.", "Identify ways to improve sharing of promising practices among states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for comment to HHS. Responding for  HHS, CMS provided written comments. In summary, CMS concurred with  three of our recommendations\u2014specifically, to ensure that states found to  have inadequate MCO provider networks take corrective action, to  develop additional guidance on topics of concern to states, and to improve  sharing of promising practices among states and other stakeholders. CMS  described several initiatives planned or under way that would strengthen  its oversight of state Medicaid dental services for children. CMS concurred  in part with our fourth recommendation, to develop a plan to review  Medicaid dental services in states with low utilization rates. In following  up with CMS, an official clarified that CMS agreed with the need to review  Medicaid dental services in these states but wanted this plan to be part of  the agency\u2019s broader plan to review all EPSDT services. As part of this  broader plan, CMS would consider additional focused dental reviews as  well as comprehensive EPSDT service reviews. We believe that CMS\u2019s  action will meet the intent of our recommendation. CMS also noted that  the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009  included a number of provisions related to dental services that the agency  was in the process of implementing, including requirements for states to  post a listing of participating Medicaid and CHIP dental providers on  HHS\u2019s www.insurekidsnow.gov Web site, to publish new quality measures  for Medicaid and CHIP children, and to report additional information on  children receiving dental care under Medicaid.
