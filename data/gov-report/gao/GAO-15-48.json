Specifically, DOJ collected about $4.3 billion from seven major alternative sources of funding\u2014including the Assets Forfeiture Fund, the Crime Victims Fund (CVF), and noncriminal fingerprint checks fees, among others\u2014which were available to DOJ. Agency flexibility regarding the use of the seven funding sources varied with laws specifying funding purposes, amounts, and availability by, for instance, limiting obligations from a source or limiting the period in which funds may be obligated.", "DOJ can improve management of two alternative sources of funding. Specifically:", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division collected $396 million in fees for providing non-criminal justice fingerprint checks during fiscal year 2013. The fee is made up of a cost recovery and automation portion but the breakout between the two portions of the fee is not explicitly communicated to stakeholders. As a result, stakeholders do not have complete information for providing meaningful feedback. Additionally, CJIS sets fees, in part, based on projected volume of transactions. Actual volumes have exceeded projected volumes, resulting in CJIS bringing in more than anticipated in automation fees and contributing to an unobligated balance of $284 million at the end of fiscal year 2013. CJIS officials stated that they are aware of growing unobligated balances but have not evaluated what an appropriate amount should be. As a result, CJIS does not know if it is carrying over a suitable amount to meet future needs.", "In addition, unobligated balances in the CVF grew to nearly $9 billion by the end of fiscal year 2013. Statutory provisions annually limit DOJ's ability to obligate collections in the fund. For example, during fiscal year 2013, DOJ received about $1.5 billion in deposits to the fund, from sources such as criminal fines, and had statutory authority to obligate $730 million from the fund for crime victim assistance programs. Consistent with scorekeeping guidelines used during the congressional budget process, DOJ reported funds not available for obligation as a credit or offset to its annual discretionary budget authority. From fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DOJ reported $32 billion in offsets provided primarily by the CVF. As a result, DOJ's reported net discretionary budgetary authority decreased about 36 percent from 2009 to 2013, while DOJ's actual total discretionary budget authority remained relatively constant during these years."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOJ develop a policy to analyze unobligated carryover balances of the Three Percent Fund.

How much of DOJ\u2019s total budgetary resources comes from major  alternative sources of funding, and what are the key statutory  characteristics that provide agency flexibility regarding use of these  sources?  2.  What opportunities, if any, exist for DOJ to better manage unobligated  balances from selected major alternative sources of funding?", "To address the first question, we identified various alternative sources of  funding that DOJ receives across multiple accounts or programs. To do  this, we interviewed DOJ officials knowledgeable about the DOJ budget  and we reviewed various budget documents. We initially identified 21  accounts or programs that are financed by alternative sources of funding.  We narrowed our review to the seven major alternative sources of  funding, determined by the following decision criteria: Collections must  be at or above $100 million annually to focus on the alternative sources  bringing in the largest sums to DOJ, the funds must be managed primarily  by DOJ, and they must not be entitlement or trust funds. The scope of  our review covered funding from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 so that  we could include enough years to identify any recent trends in collections,  obligations, and unobligated balances. To report the financial information  such as collections and obligations related to alternative sources of  funding for the 5 years, we analyzed DOJ performance and accountability  reports, president\u2019s budgets appendixes, congressional budget  submissions, and supporting data provided by DOJ. We compared the  amounts in the seven selected alternative sources of funding against  DOJ\u2019s statement of budgetary resources using DOJ\u2019s audited information  reported in its annual financial statements. For six of the seven alternative  sources of funding, we determined that the data on the amounts reported  for the years under review DOJ-wide were sufficiently reliable for  determining how much of DOJ\u2019s budgetary resources comes from these  alternative sources of funding. We also determined that for fiscal year  2013, the fingerprint-based Criminal History Record Information checks  provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice  Information Services (CJIS) Division (CJIS fingerprint checks fees) were  also reliable for our purposes. However, as discussed later in this  report, the amounts for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for the CJIS  fingerprint checks fees were provided by DOJ sources and could not be  reconciled to the audited financial statements. We analyzed DOJ\u2019s  statutory requirements applicable to the funding, specifically considering  constraints on the purpose of the funds, the amount of funds available,  the period of the availability of funds, and reporting requirements on  activities. We also interviewed agency officials about the various  alternative sources of funding to understand their interpretation of the  laws governing them.", "To address the second question, we selected for review three of the  seven alternative sources we examined under the first question based on,  among other things, the highest percentage of unobligated balance at the  end of fiscal year 2013 compared with the total collections from fiscal  years 2009 through 2013. We removed the Assets Forfeiture Fund  (AFF) from consideration in the second question because GAO has  conducted recent reviews of AFF fund management. We then  interviewed agency officials responsible for these alternative sources  about how they manage unobligated balances. We compared the  management of the funds with criteria developed in our past work on  evaluating carryover balances. For the one alternative source of funding  derived from user fees, we also compared the setting of fees with (1) our  design guide for federal user fees and (2) our past work on identifying fee  design options for managing carryover balances in fee accounts. To  determine financial activity for the Crime Victims Fund (CVF), we  compared both reconciled financial information and separate DOJ- provided information on receipts. To report on the impact of unavailable  balances from the CVF and the AFF to the department\u2019s annual  discretionary budget authority, we used reported information from the  President\u2019s Budget for DOJ\u2019s total discretionary budget authority and the  scorekeeping credit.

As shown in figure 3, the CRAB\u2019s rate of allocations has resulted in a 12- point decrease in the percentage of unobligated balances remaining at  the end of the following year from fiscal years 2009 through 2013.  Specifically, while DOJ\u2019s unobligated balances have marginally  increased, the CRAB has had more total budgetary resources available  during the fiscal year and has obligated a larger portion of those  resources. CRAB officials stated that they conduct analyses to determine  how to allocate Three Percent Fund amounts in the following year, but  they could not demonstrate how, if at all, increasing obligation rates may  have an impact on the availability of funding in future years. Without  analyzing trends in unobligated balances, it is difficult to determine if  committing larger portions of budgetary resources is sustainable or has  an impact on future-year funding.", "In response, CRAB officials stated that the CRAB\u2019s typical practice is to  obligate only the amount that is carried forward from the previous year,  and not to consider any amounts that may come into the Three Percent  Fund in the following year. The agency does not conduct analyses of  unobligated balances to, for example, help estimate future collections or  determine future reserve needs. According to CRAB officials, they do not  incorporate estimates for collection amounts from year to year because  the CRAB does not have control over how much will be collected in the  Three Percent Fund. Collections are determined from civil settlements  and other judgments, and CRAB officials believe that soliciting  information from litigating units to develop estimates may be viewed as  inappropriate pressure on litigators. However, in the 5-year time period  we examined, DOJ consistently collected at least $83 million annually,  indicating stability in collections.", "While we understand DOJ\u2019s concerns about determining precise  estimates, these concerns could be mitigated by developing strategies for  projecting collections without a negative perception. For example, in lieu  of projecting a specific dollar amount, CRAB could determine a range  between the potential lowest and highest collection amounts based on  historical trends and current collection activities.", "Additionally, while CRAB officials identified a reserve to set aside for the  following fiscal year, as shown in table 2, the Three Percent Fund\u2019s  unobligated balances at the end of the year have been notably higher  than DOJ\u2019s identified reserve in each fiscal year from 2009 through 2013.  Specifically, in comparing the reserve that officials reported they needed  and the unobligated balance, the amount carried over was consistently  larger by a factor of at least two. Such a consistent difference between  the unobligated balance and the reserve fund needed the following year  may indicate that the Three Percent Fund could fund additional activities  during the following year. For example, CRAB officials stated that several  activities and initiatives either do not receive funding or receive a smaller  portion of funding, including funding for more litigative term personnel for  civil debt collection activities. Some of these activities, if funded, could  result in more collections for the Three Percent Fund.", "CRAB officials stated that DOJ has limited discretion for when amounts  are received in the Three Percent Fund because many transactions result  from judgments from courts and are not controlled by DOJ. As a result,  CRAB officials stated that they could not commit more funding during the  year because they do not know what amounts may come in the following  year and generally make funding decisions only once during the year. If  the CRAB has determined that no more funds can be committed in a  fiscal year than it currently allocates, then the reported reserve needed in  the Three Percent Fund may be too low and not accurately reflect the  Three Percent Fund operational needs. However, if the CRAB is  confident that the reported reserve for the following year is correct and  the reserve is much lower than the beginning unobligated balances as  reported in table 2, then the CRAB may be missing opportunities to fund  additional activities.", "GAO\u2019s Key Questions to Consider When Evaluating Balances in Federal  Accounts has emphasized the importance of regularly analyzing these  balances by, for example, estimating and managing such balances\u2014such  as estimating collections and determining reserve needs\u2014in order to  effectively anticipate program needs and ensure the most efficient use of  resources. The Key Questions also concluded that if an agency does  not have a robust strategy in place for estimating and managing carryover  balances, balances may either fall too low to efficiently manage  operations or rise to unnecessarily high levels. While DOJ officials  disagreed that they may allocate and obligate more because their  practice is to allocate only what is in the fund at the beginning of the year,  our analysis demonstrated that the Three Percent Fund\u2019s beginning  unobligated balances consistently outpace DOJ\u2019s stated reserve needs.  This is, in part, because DOJ does not consider estimates of collections in  future years as part of its determination of reserve needs. DOJ\u2019s current  practice has resulted in increasing balances in the fund as it allocates a  larger portion of its total budgetary resources. Without an analysis that  includes projected collections, reserves that align with DOJ priorities and  stated needs, and the impact of previous obligation rates on unobligated  balances, it is difficult to determine the impact of committing funds on  unobligated balances in the Three Percent Fund.

Specifically, annual appropriations  legislation prohibited DOJ from making obligations in excess of the  obligation limitation, and as a result, DOJ could not obligate the excess  funds during the course of the given fiscal year. For instance, CVF  deposits totaled about $1.75 billion during fiscal year 2009. However,  because federal law limited DOJ\u2019s allowable CVF obligations to about  $640 million that year, DOJ was unable to obligate over $1 billion of CVF  deposits during the remaining fiscal year.

Specifically, OJP officials stated that victim assistance  stakeholders such as state administrators of crime victims\u2019 grants have  told them that the current funding levels provided in law are not  adequately addressing the needs of crime victims nationwide. However,  OJP officials state that stakeholders have not been able to verify how  much funding need exists nationwide, in part because of current restraints  on administrative spending in VOCA that limit state administrators\u2019 ability  to monitor the effectiveness of grants or evaluate crime victim needs.", "In response, OJP has taken steps to determine crime victim needs. For  instance, in 2010, OJP developed an initiative called Vision 21, where the  goals are to identify recommendations to help OJP adopt a systematic  approach in addressing crime victim needs. This culminated in a report  released in 2013 that contained recommendations for better addressing  crime victim needs, including overcoming challenges related to  constraints in CVF funding due to VOCA restrictions. In addition, in  2012, OJP entered into an interagency agreement with the U.S. Bureau  of Justice Statistics to conduct a survey of victim assistance  administrators and other stakeholders, the purpose of which includes  validating crime victim needs nationwide. OJP officials stated that the  results of the survey will help determine and validate funding needs and  help OJP provide empirically driven policy options to address such needs.

For example, DOJ does not query litigating  components for the number of cases that will be settled because the  agency does not want to be perceived as inappropriately encouraging  larger government civil collections. Additionally, DOJ does not calculate  such estimates due to the high level of variability in the civil debt litigation  cases that make it difficult to use historical information to estimate  reserves. The report recognizes these concerns. Specifically, on page 20,  we acknowledge DOJ\u2019s concern about soliciting information from its  litigating units.
