This change caused pension contributions to greatly  exceed CAS pension costs reflected in contract prices. The Board  updated the CAS effective in 2012 to harmonize CAS pension costs with  statutory changes to the pension funding requirements. However, the  Board\u2019s changes did not address how costs were settled when pension  plans were curtailed. In January 2013, we recommended that the Board  set a schedule to revise parts of the CAS dealing with settlement of  pension plan curtailments. Citing our recommendation, the Board began  efforts to resolve this issue in July 2013 and the work is on-going.", "While Board staff have been working to resolve these pension issues, the  Board went several years without holding official meetings of the full  board.

In addition, OFPP officials said that the Board forms  interagency working groups to address specific issues, such as pension  harmonization. The Board receives its funding from OMB and does not  have a separate funding source. According to OFPP officials, the Board\u2019s  main expenses were salary reimbursement for the non-government  employees who serve on the Board and publication costs for Federal  Register notices.", "Other federal agencies also have responsibilities to help administer the  standards. For example, according to OFPP officials, most CAS-covered  contracts are defense related. As such, DCAA reviews federal  contractors\u2019 disclosure statements for adequacy and compliance\u2014that is,  whether the statements are current, accurate, and complete. Disclosure  statements describe the company\u2019s actual or proposed cost accounting  practices, including how they distinguish between costs, and how costs  are allocated to contracts. DCAA also conducts audits to ensure  contractors comply with CAS and with the contractors\u2019 disclosed and  established cost accounting practices and procedures.

In addition, the panel made several  recommendations, including moving the Board out of OFPP to ensure  autonomy. Congress did not act on this recommendation.

The guiding principles outlined in the staff  discussion paper describe the elements the Board will consider when  determining whether changes to the CAS will reduce burden on  contractors while continuing to protect the interests of the federal  government. As stated in the staff discussion paper, the Board will:  1)  reduce CAS requirements where practicable;  2)  consider whether the proposed action would reduce burden on  3)  consider whether other CAS or federal rules would protect the  government\u2019s interests in case of any gaps created by relying on  GAAP;  4)  monitor future changes to GAAP and the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) to identify and evaluate their impact on CAS and  revise CAS, as necessary; and  5)  monitor future significant disputes related to the conformance to  GAAP and evaluate whether the Board should address them  through clarifying guidance or rulemaking.", "Prioritization. The Board grouped the 19 CAS into four categories  based on the Board\u2019s assessment of which standards are most likely  to have overlap with GAAP (see figure 3).", "The Board plans to focus its initial efforts on the seven standards in  the first group, which focus on cost measurement and assigning costs  to accounting periods. According to its staff discussion paper, the  Board\u2019s proposed approach is to assess the standards by developing  side-by-side comparisons of CAS requirements to corresponding  GAAP requirements and identifying any gaps between the two. The  Board will then evaluate the potential risk of any gaps identified,  taking into account coverage by other CAS requirements and related  regulations; for example, the FAR. The Board will also assess  whether there is a history of compliance issues for those standards.  According to OFPP officials, such assessments will help the Board  determine whether they need to update guidance related to a  particular CAS. Lastly, the Board plans to assess changes that have  occurred in GAAP relative to CAS and to evaluate the need to  conform CAS to the updated GAAP. For example, the Board has  identified two recent changes in GAAP that it states may not align with  CAS.", "Comparison. The Board has begun this effort by looking at two  standards focused on measuring and assigning costs (CAS 408 and  CAS 409), since it believes that GAAP potentially provided additional  coverage compared to when the two CAS were established in 1975.

For example, four respondents commented that the Board  should not limit its focus to only revising or eliminating particular CAS  when it was clear that GAAP provided adequate coverage. Instead, these  industry groups stated that each CAS should be eliminated unless proven  to be absolutely necessary due to the barriers to contractors that these  groups believe the CAS create.", "The Board members we met with stated that all options for refining CAS  requirements were on the table. However, they also stated that GAAP  and CAS are focused on two separate goals\u2014the former on a business\u2019s  high-level financial statement, the latter on individual contract costs.  Board members, as well as DCAA and DCMA officials, noted that  eliminating CAS requirements to rely purely on GAAP standards would  limit the government\u2019s ability to compare contract proposals, assess  actual costs to avoid overcharges by contractors, and protect its interests.  For example, DCMA officials stated that the government has $3.1 billion  in pending litigation for identified CAS noncompliances. Recovery of increased costs is accomplished in part through contract clauses that  entitle the government to recover specific cost increases on affected  CAS-covered contracts. Were CAS and the associated contract clauses  eliminated, DCAA and DCMA officials noted that the government\u2019s ability  to recover these costs would be greatly reduced. In addition, the Board is  concerned that in modifying or perhaps even eliminating certain CAS  requirements, and instead using GAAP, there is the risk that future GAAP  changes would no longer cover the areas of CAS concern. This would  leave the government vulnerable to the issues that the modified or  eliminated CAS were originally created to address.", "Members of the Board and staff we spoke with indicated that the Board is  reviewing and assessing the public comments on the staff discussion  paper to determine whether the Board needs to make changes to the  paper\u2019s guiding principles or methodology going forward.

Additionally, they said the Board will consult with the  Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2014which is responsible for GAAP\u2014 to answer technical questions and ensure that the Board has an accurate  understanding of GAAP coverage as they continue to perform side-by- side comparisons of CAS and GAAP.

For example, some comments encouraged the  Board to consider increasing CAS full-compliance dollar thresholds.  Reassessing the CAS full-compliance threshold aligns with findings from  congressionally established panel reports from 1999 and 2018.  According to both panels\u2019 findings, increasing compliance thresholds is a  way to decrease burden on many government contractors while still  protecting the bulk of the government\u2019s contracting dollars.

According to officials, both DCAA and  DCMA provide audit findings to the cognizant federal agency official, who  then disposes the audit findings by making the final determination of  adequacy and compliance.", "The purpose of disclosure statement audits is to determine whether  the contractor\u2019s disclosed or established practices are in compliance  with CAS rules, regulations, and standards, as well as appropriate  acquisition regulations. A CAS-related noncompliance may be found if  a contractor with a CAS-covered contract proposes a practice that will  violate CAS or a government acquisition regulations cost principle, or  if the contractor\u2019s actual practices are either inconsistent with their  own disclosure statement or noncompliant with the cost standards or  principles. For example, in 1970, we, along with DCAA auditors, found  instances where contractors charged costs as both direct and indirect  costs to the same contract, resulting in the contractors recovering the  same charge twice.", "If an auditor discovers a noncompliance issue, the auditor will submit  an advisory report to the cognizant federal agency official who makes  the final determination. The consequences of a CAS noncompliance  can range from a contract adjustment to litigation. According to the  DCMA\u2019s Contract Dispute Resolution Center, there were 15 judicial  decisions issued in CAS-related board and court cases in the last five  years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bruce H.
