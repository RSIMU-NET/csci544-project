Citizens, police departments, and other agencies are to work together to identify problems and apply appropriate problem-solving strategies. The practice of community policing began to emerge in the late 1970s. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has supported community policing efforts through various implementation and research grants for about the last 15 years.", "The Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of 1994 (Community Policing Act)\u2014Title I of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994\u2014authorizes DOJ to make grants for the hiring or rehiring of law enforcement officers to participate in community policing. In addition, the Community Policing Act authorizes DOJ to award grants for the purchase of equipment, technology, and support systems if the expenditures would result in an increase in the number of officers deployed in community-oriented policing. It also authorizes grants for other programs such as providing specialized training to enhance skills needed to work in partnership with members of the community. The purposes of the grants are to increase police presence, expand and improve cooperative efforts between law enforcement agencies and members of the community to address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise enhance public safety.", "The Community Policing Act authorizes $8.8 billion in grants over a 6-year period to states, local governments, Indian tribal governments, other public and private entities, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia. Fiscal year 1995 appropriated funds for the Community Policing Act totaled $1.3 billion.

COPS: Phase I was open only to jurisdictions not funded due to a scarcity of funds under DOJ\u2019s 1993-1994 Police Hiring Supplement Program (PHSP). COPS FAST is open to state, local, and other public enforcement agencies, Indian tribal governments, other public and private entities, and multijurisdictional or regional consortia that employ sworn law enforcement officers and that serve populations under 50,000. COPS AHEAD is open to those agencies serving populations of 50,000 or more.", "DOJ community policing guidelines provide that jurisdictions that had received COPS: Phase I funding were also eligible to receive additional funding under COPS AHEAD if the combined hiring under both programs did not exceed 3 percent of the actual October 1, 1994, total police force level.In addition, an agency that received funding under COPS: Phase I is eligible to receive additional funding under COPS FAST.

The act makes special provisions for applications of local government or law enforcement agencies in jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000 and for nonpolice hiring grants of less than $1 million by allowing the Attorney General to waive one or more of the grant application requirements and to facilitate the submission, processing, and approval of these applications."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Application Process for COPS: Phase I Differed From the Process for COPS FAST and COPS AHEAD Grants", "paragraphs": ["The difference in the application process between COPS: Phase I and COPS FAST and COPS AHEAD grants is the stage at which jurisdictions could begin recruiting and hiring additional officers. In the traditional grant process used for COPS: Phase I, jurisdictions submitted a detailed application to BJA for review and waited for final grant approval and award before beginning officer recruitment, hiring, and training. For the COPS FAST and COPS AHEAD grant programs, the COPS Office implemented a two-step application process that allowed jurisdictions to recruit, hire, and train officers while final grant applications were being reviewed.", "In response to a suggestion from the U.S. Conference of Mayors to expedite the grant application process for the COPS FAST and COPS AHEAD programs, the COPS Office designed a two-step application process to try to get new officers on the street months earlier than they would be under traditional grant award processes. First, for COPS AHEAD, the COPS Office used a one-page initial application to determine the number of officers jurisdictions could recruit and train. Approved jurisdictions were notified of proposed funding levels, cautioned that the funding was tentative, and warned that if the subsequent application was not approved, the COPS Office would not be held liable for officers hired. In COPS FAST, grant decisions were made based upon one-page applications. Second, the selected jurisdictions in both programs were to submit additional information to the COPS Office prior to issuance of formal awards. COPS AHEAD agencies were asked to submit detailed applications, while COPS FAST supplied brief budget and community policing information.", "The type of information and amount of detail required in this second application differed between COPS FAST and COPS AHEAD programs.

About 92 percent of jurisdictions that applied for a COPS grant received initial award approval. COPS Office staff said that if an application was incomplete, a COPS Office grant adviser contacted a local official for further information. In some cases, jurisdictions were referred for technical assistance to help them plan and implement a community policing strategy. On July 1, 1995, the COPS Office and the Community Policing Consortium entered into a cooperative agreement for the provision of certain training and technical assistance services.", "Table 1 shows the authorized hiring scale for approved jurisdictions.", "Table 2 summarizes information about the grant application and selection process for the three COPS programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The COPS Office Is to Monitor and Evaluate the Three Grant Programs", "paragraphs": ["The Attorney General established the COPS Office to administer all Community Policing Act grants, including monitoring and evaluation to assess the financial and programmatic impact of the grants.

An intra-agency agreement between the COPS Office and OJP allows OJP to provide certain accounting and financial monitoring to track grantee compliance with audit requirements, as well as prepare financial status reports.", "According to the Assistant Director for Grants Administration, the frequency and extent of evaluation to assess a jurisdiction\u2019s grant implementation process will depend on the amount of the grant award, with the level of scrutiny increasing for larger awards. A COPS FAST jurisdiction, for example, which received a grant award for only one law enforcement officer\u2014about 6,200 jurisdictions\u2014is to receive a minimum of telephone contacts and have its periodic progress reports reviewed. A COPS AHEAD jurisdiction, however, which may have received funding for a large number of officers, should expect site visits, frequent telephone contacts, and close review of its community policing efforts through its periodic progress reports. COPS Office staff said that each jurisdiction is to complete periodic progress reports that will outline information on each officer hired and the specific activities and achievements of its community policing program. The COPS Office is to conduct evaluations to review how the jurisdiction interacts with the community, what kind of training is provided to officers and residents, and what specific strategies are used to prevent crime.", "The COPS Office is to select a sample of jurisdictions for continuous impact evaluations. The Policy Support and Evaluation Unit within the COPS Office is to conduct these evaluations. DOJ\u2019s National Institute of Justice is also expected to conduct impact evaluations. Impact evaluations are to be conducted on fewer sites than the process evaluations and are to assess how the quality of life in the community has been affected by community policing efforts. The COPS Office is to examine, for example, crime and arrest data, victimization surveys, and citizen surveys to evaluate the impact of the grants.

An additional 18 percent cited the 25-percent local match requirement as the most important reason in their decision; 4 percent cited other financial reasons. An additional 8 percent said the jurisdiction did not apply either because of a lack of information on the grants or because of problems meeting the application deadlines, 3 percent mentioned local political or management decisions, and 4 percent cited various other reasons.

We merged the COPS Office\u2019s listing of applicant jurisdictions with UCR data to identify nonapplicant jurisdictions. Next, we used UCR data to assign jurisdictions to population categories (less than 50,000 and 50,000 and over) and calculated the number of crimes reported per 1,000 population served.

We limited our survey population to city, local, county, and tribal police. These types of law enforcement agencies account for 91 percent of all jurisdictions.

We completed 334, or 87 percent, of our planned contacts with the sample of 384 jurisdictions. Fifty contacts were not completed for various reasons, including difficulty in reaching the appropriate respondent and unwillingness of some jurisdictions to respond. Of the 334 contacts made, we completed interviews with respondents in 289 jurisdictions. We found that 45 did not belong in our study population because they had applied for a COPS grant. Mostly, these jurisdictions were either covered under another jurisdiction\u2019s application (and the application was identified by the other jurisdiction) or not listed on the COPS program\u2019s applicant file as an individual applicant.

Applications were stored at various locations in the COPS Office. To obtain our sample, we used a random starting point and then took every 16th application from the files. Jurisdictions applying for the COPS FAST program were required to rank order their public safety issues from a list of 16 issues. We did not review COPS AHEAD applications because their statements of public safety needs were included as part of a narrative description of their community policing program, which could be up to 18 pages.
