DTV  technologies enable broadcasters to offer their viewers clearer, sharper  pictures and a wider range of broadcast services than are possible with  traditional analog technologies.  This transition to digital technologies was  sought by many broadcasters and was mandated by Congress and the  Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  Pursuant to statute, FCC  (which administers radiofrequency spectrum for nonfederal government  use) is temporarily providing each broadcast station with additional  spectrum on which to begin broadcasting a digital signal.  For several  years, during which time it is envisioned that consumers will begin to  purchase digital television sets and other equipment, broadcasters will  transmit both digital and analog signals.  At some point, the analog signals  are to be discontinued, leaving television stations to continue broadcasting  only in digital format.  FCC established 2006 as the target date for ending  analog transmissions and this was later codified by Congress.  Spectrum  that broadcasters vacate is to be returned for other uses.  Some of the  returned spectrum has been reallocated for public safety uses and some for commercial uses.  After September 11, 2001, reassigning the spectrum for  wireless uses, such as public safety communications and mobile phones,  has become a higher priority and greater emphasis has been placed on a  timely completion of the DTV transition.", "To move the transition along and more quickly reassign the spectrum, FCC  established staggered deadlines by which broadcasters must build their  DTV stations and begin broadcasting a digital signal.  Generally, larger  stations in major television markets were required to begin broadcasting a  digital signal by May or November 1999, while all remaining full-power  commercial stations were required to begin broadcasting a digital signal by  May 1, 2002.   Additionally, all of the nation\u2019s public broadcast stations are  to begin broadcasting a digital signal by May 1, 2003.", "According to a commercial database that contains information on  broadcasters, there are currently 1,240 full-power commercial television  stations in the United States.  As of April 12, 2002, according to FCC, 298 of  these stations had begun broadcasting a DTV signal.  Although some  stations are on the air with a digital signal and others are close to launching  their DTV stations, some stations are still investigating what funds and  equipment they will require and have much work remaining before they can  broadcast a digital signal.  Concerns have been expressed by industry  officials that many commercial stations will have difficulty building their  DTV stations by the May 2002 deadline.  Because of your interest in the  DTV rollout and the ultimate reassignment of the broadcast radiofrequency  spectrum for other uses, you asked us to provide you with information on  the following: (1) broadcasters\u2019 progress in building DTV stations, as well  as broadcasters\u2019 perceptions of consumer interest in DTV and  broadcasters\u2019 plans for developing and marketing DTV content; (2) the  experiences among broadcasters who have and have not completed the  building of their DTV stations, including any key problems that may have  arisen; and (3) the extent to which there are concerns about meeting DTV  deadlines among broadcasters who have not completed building DTV  stations.  This report provides information on these broadcaster-specific  issues.  Later in 2002, we plan to provide an additional report on other  issues affecting the DTV transition, including digital content production,  copyright protection, cable carriage of DTV channels, and consumer  knowledge about DTV.", "To respond to your request for information about the progress in building  DTV stations, we conducted a survey of all full-power commercial and  public broadcast television stations operating in the United States.  We  developed two versions of the survey: one was sent to stations that are  already on the air in digital, and one was sent to stations that are not yet on  the air in digital.  The survey asked a variety of questions about the stations\u2019  transitions.  The survey questions and detailed survey results for  commercial stations are contained in appendixes IV and V, and the  questions and results for public stations are contained in appendixes VI and  VII.  To supplement and better analyze the broadcasters\u2019 responses to our  survey, we purchased a commercial database with information on  broadcast stations, which included information such as annual revenues,  market size, and parent company or ownership information.  Throughout  this report, percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.  A more  detailed discussion of our overall scope and methodology is provided in  appendix I.  We conducted our review from May 2001 to April 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In total, we received 1,036 of 1,554 surveys (a response rate of 67 percent).   We received 135 of 168 surveys (80 percent) from commercial stations that  had gone on the air with a digital signal as of September 2001, hereafter  referred to as \u201ccurrent DTV stations.\u201d We received 727 of 1,014 surveys (72 percent) from commercial stations that were still in the process of  building their DTV stations as of September 2001, and that had not yet gone  on the air with a digital signal, hereafter referred to as \u201ctransitioning  stations.\u201d  We also received 174 of 372 surveys (47 percent) from public  stations; 15 of these responses were from 37 public stations that were  already on the air in digital as of September 2001 (41 percent).  Because all  public stations are under a deadline to be on the air in May 2003\u20141 year  later than most commercial stations\u2014we report separately on our survey  results for public stations in appendix III.  This letter discusses only the  survey results for commercial stations.", "Lastly, we did not mail surveys to 8 New York City stations that had  broadcast towers located atop the World Trade Center, and that were  directly affected by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  Instead, we  directly spoke to a representative from each of those stations to gather  information about how the events of September 11 affected their station  operations generally and affected their DTV plans in particular.  A  discussion of the current situation of the New York stations is provided in  appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Free over-the-air television broadcasts have been available to Americans  for more than 50 years.  According to the National Association of  Broadcasters, the average television market includes over-the-air signals  from at least seven local broadcast stations. Commercial stations may get  their programming content through an affiliation with one of the top seven  television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, PAX, UPN, and WB) or they may  be an independent broadcaster.  Some commercial television stations are  owned by large media companies or other corporations; others are owned  by individuals or small companies.  The United States also has 380 public  television stations that receive funding from a variety of sources, including  federal funding, state funding, commercial grants and donations, and  private donations from individuals.  Public stations tend to show more  educational and arts programming, and many of these stations are affiliated  with the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).  In addition to over-the-air  availability, most broadcasters are carried on local cable television systems  along with numerous cable programming channels.  Also, satellite  television providers now offer subscribers the signals of local broadcasters  in approximately 40 television markets.  In fact, according to FCC, more  than 86 percent of television households nationwide now subscribe to  some type of multichannel video programming service, such as a cable or  satellite provider, rather than relying solely on over-the-air broadcast  television.", "Since its inception, the broadcast television industry has relied on \u201canalog\u201d  technologies to transmit over-the-air television signals.  During the last few  decades, however, media of all types have been transitioning to \u201cdigital\u201d  technologies.  Because digital technologies can provide greater versatility  and higher quality pictures and audio than traditional analog technologies,  the broadcast television industry supported, and Congress and FCC  mandated, a transition of broadcast television stations from analog to  digital technology. This decision was based on the notion that a transition  to digital television would bring the broadcast television industry into the  21st century with current and competitive technology, and would help to  preserve for consumers the benefits of a healthy free over-the-air television  service in the future.", "Traditional television broadcasting uses the radiofrequency spectrum to  transmit analog signals\u2014that is, signals in which motion pictures and  sounds have been converted into a \u201cwave form\u201d electrical signal.   Traditional analog signals fade with distance, so consumers living farther  from a broadcast tower will experience pictures that are distorted or full of  \u201csnow.\u201d  With digital technology, the analog wave form is converted into a  stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones.  Although digital signals also  fade over distance, because each bit of information is either a zero or a one,  the digital television set or receiver can adjust for minor weaknesses in the  signal to recreate the zeros and ones originally transmitted.  Pictures and  sound thus remain perfect unless significant fading of the signal occurs, at  which point the transmission cannot be corrected and there is no picture at  all.", "Digital technology also makes it easier to offer high definition television  (HDTV).  With HDTV, roughly twice as many lines of resolution are  transmitted, creating a television picture that is much sharper than  traditional analog television pictures. Another advantage of digital  television is that \u201cdigital compression\u201d technologies allow for more  efficient use of the radiofrequency spectrum than analog technologies.   Using digital compression, broadcasters will have the opportunity to use  the 6 megahertz of spectrum required to broadcast one analog television  show to transmit four or five different digital \u201cstandard definition\u201d  television shows simultaneously. This process of using the digital  spectrum to show multiple programs at once is known as multicasting.  To  enjoy HDTV broadcasts or to be able to see multicasts of digital signals,  consumers must own a television monitor that is capable of displaying  these features and a digital tuner that is capable of receiving the  broadcasts.", "The DTV transition involves a substantial overhaul and replacement of the  stations\u2019 transmitting and studio equipment as well as the eventual  replacement of consumers\u2019 analog television sets or the attachment of  \u201cdigital converter boxes\u201d to those analog sets.  Thus, building DTV stations  involves a large outlay of capital and effort by the broadcast television  industry.  Sometimes a new broadcast tower or significant modifications to  an existing tower are required for the digital antennas.  Broadcasters must  purchase digital transmission equipment, obtain digital programming, and  acquire equipment for converting analog programming to digital.  One  station representative with whom we spoke noted that broadcasters must  then incur the costs of running two stations simultaneously during the  transition period, even though viewership and advertising revenues are  likely to remain roughly the same.", "To facilitate the transition, Congress and FCC temporarily provided each  full-power television station (both commercial and public) with another 6  megahertz of radiofrequency spectrum so that they could begin  broadcasting a digital signal.  A transition period was established during  which broadcasters would build their DTV stations and simultaneously  transmit both analog and digital signals.  In 1997, FCC established a  timeline for this transition period.  By May 1, 1999, the affiliate stations of  the 4 largest networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC) in the top 10 television  markets in the country were to have a digital signal on the air. By  November 1, 1999, the affiliates of the 4 largest networks in the top 11 to 30  television markets were to have a digital signal on the air. By May 1, 2002,  all full-power commercial television stations across America are to have a  DTV signal on the air.  By May 1, 2003, all public stations are to be  broadcasting a DTV signal as well.", "The few stations that missed the earlier 1999 deadlines were granted  extensions by FCC.  In March 2002, FCC closed an application period for  stations that have May 2002 deadlines to file for extensions.  FCC said it  will not issue any type of blanket waiver of the deadline, but it would allow  extensions on a case-by-case basis.  According to FCC, it also has the  authority to sanction stations that do not meet their deadlines.  FCC said it  is currently considering what those sanctions might be and under what  circumstances the sanctions might be imposed.", "The goal is for the transition period to end in December 2006.  By that time,  the analog signals presumably are to be shut off, and Americans are to be  watching DTV broadcasts on either a DTV set or on an analog set with  some form of a digital converter box.  The government is supposed to  \u201crepack\u201d the digital stations within channels 2 to 51. The federal  government has reallocated some of the spectrum in channels 52 to 69 for  public safety needs and some for commercial uses (such as mobile phone  services).  The public safety spectrum is currently being licensed, and the  spectrum set aside for commercial uses will be auctioned later this year.", "However, Congress created exceptions to the 2006 date.  In the Balanced  Budget Act of 1997, Congress stated that no analog television station  license was to be extended beyond December 31, 2006, except in cases  where (1) one or more of the top four network affiliates in a market is not  yet on the air in digital, (2) digital converter technology is not generally  available in the market, or (3) 15 percent or more of the households in the  market cannot receive DTV signals.  The last exception\u2014often referred to  as \u201cthe 85 percent rule\u201d\u2014has the potential to significantly delay the cutoff  of analog signals and the turnback of some spectrum beyond 2006.  This is  because the 85 percent rule might rely on consumer adoption of DTV  equipment, which is currently market-driven (i.e., based on consumer  demand, rather than on a government mandate) and does not appear at the  present time to be progressing at a rate that will reach 85 percent in the  next 4 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Almost One-Quarter of Commercial Stations Are Broadcasting a Digital Signal, Although Many Stations Perceive Little Consumer Demand", "paragraphs": ["In this section, we address several issues related to the progress of  broadcasters to date in getting digital signals on the air.

Only 119 of  the 298 current DTV stations were mandated to be broadcasting a digital signal before May 2002. Thus, some stations have elected to build their  DTV stations and begin broadcasting a digital signal before they were  required to do so.  As for the progress of transitioning stations, we  conducted interviews with representatives from a few transitioning  stations and found them to be in various stages of building their DTV  facilities.

A station also can choose to multicast or  to take advantage of the ability of DTV to transmit text or data, such as  stock quotes or electronic newspapers.  There are concerns that if  broadcast stations use their digital channel largely to duplicate the  programming from their analog channel, consumers would have little  incentive to purchase digital televisions sets and cable systems would have  little incentive to carry broadcasters\u2019 DTV channels.  This lack of DTV  adoption could delay the goal of having broadcasters vacate the spectrum  in channels 52 to 69 by the end of 2006 to make the spectrum fully available  for public safety and other uses.", "We asked current DTV stations what services they were offering over their  digital spectrum, and they responded as follows:  Seventy-four percent of current DTV stations are providing some  amount of HDTV content on their digital broadcast channel.

By contrast, transitioning DTV stations are more likely  than current DTV stations to be unaffiliated with the top four networks or  to be in smaller television markets.  Unaffiliated stations have less access  to the increasing amount of HDTV or other digital content that is provided  by the major networks.  Smaller stations sometimes rely more on  syndicated shows\u2014such as game shows, talk shows, or reruns of popular  network programming\u2014that are less likely to have been filmed in digital or  high definition.  Smaller stations also have fewer resources to buy the  equipment necessary to film and produce their own digital content.

We asked stations to report or estimate the  approximate total cost they incurred or expect to incur in complying with  the initial requirements for digital transmission\u2014including expenses for a  new tower or construction on an existing tower, transmission line, antenna,  digital transmiters and encoders, consultants, licensing, and other capital  expenditures. Our comparisons of reported costs by station types showed  that the average reported costs per station among different types of  stations were not dramatically different.  Figure 1 shows that current DTV  stations and larger stations on average reported somewhat higher costs  than transitioning stations and smaller stations.  For example, current DTV  stations reported an average cost of $3.1 million per station to comply with  the initial requirements for digital transmission, while transitioning stations  reported an average of $2.3 million per station.", "Some of the lower cost reported by transitioning stations may be due to  recent rule changes by FCC that were designed to reduce the amount  stations must spend to meet the initial requirements for digital  transmission.  For example, FCC\u2019s new rules allow stations to build less  than maximum broadcast facilities. FCC staff said they believe that the  costs of meeting the requirements for building DTV stations are  significantly lower than the costs reported in our survey.  The amounts  reported to us may be due in part to stations\u2019 reporting their actual costs of  construction, even where construction exceeded FCC\u2019s minimum  requirements.  At a recent meeting of the National Association of  Broadcasters, one broadcaster said he was able to go on the air for  approximately $125,000 and that most of the equipment he was using could  be upgraded to higher power.  However, another speaker stated that for  some stations, FCC\u2019s minimum requirements are not a long-term solution,  particularly for stations that plan to show HDTV, and that upgrading the  equipment at a later date could be problematic.  Thus, some stations prefer  to spend the money initially to build their DTV stations to exceed FCC\u2019s  minimum requirements for broadcasting a digital signal.", "Although there were no dramatic differences in the overall costs of building  DTV facilities among various types of stations, our analysis of the reported  overall expenditures as a percentage of station annual revenue did show  considerable differences among various types of stations.  For example,  among current DTV stations the overall expenditures averaged 11 percent  of annual revenues, while for transitioning stations the overall  expenditures averaged 63 percent of annual revenues.  For stations with  annual revenues below $2 million (based on all stations), the overall  expenditures averaged 242 percent of annual revenues.  Thus, the overall  cost of building the DTV stations appears to be more burdensome for some  broadcasters than for others.", "Given the significant costs reported for getting a DTV signal on the air, it is  not surprising that survey respondents cited funding as one of the most  common problems they had experienced or expected to experience.   Although the overall costs of building the DTV stations reported by  broadcasters were fairly similar, the annual revenues of stations and the  funding sources available to stations differed.  Thus, the problem of  obtaining funding did not appear to affect all stations equally.  While 14  percent of the current DTV stations said they had experienced problems in  the area of funding, 55 percent of transitioning stations reported funding as  a problem.  This difference raises concerns about the ability of some  transitioning stations to pay for construction of their DTV stations and  meet the May 1, 2002, deadline for broadcasting in digital.", "We asked stations what sources of funding they used or expected to use to  pay for the building of their DTV stations.  Almost half of all commercial  stations that responded reported multiple sources of funding.  As shown in  figure 2, the most commonly cited source of funding for both current DTV  stations and transitioning stations was funding from the station owner or  parent company.  Over 79 percent of current DTV stations had relied, in  whole or in part, on their owner or parent company to provide money for  their DTV construction.  For transitioning stations, 62 percent reported  obtaining some amount of funding from the station owner or parent  company.  This difference may be explained, in part, because stations with  earlier DTV deadlines were more likely to have a large corporate parent,  whereas transitioning stations are somewhat less likely to be owned by a  large parent company.", "Regarding funding sources, survey respondents also reported the  following:  Transitioning stations were more than twice as likely to rely on debt  financing than current DTV stations. Forty-three percent of  transitioning stations reported that they had borrowed or planned to  borrow money to fund the construction of their DTV stations, while 16  percent of current DTV stations said they had relied on debt capital.", "Six percent of the transitioning stations said they were considering sale  of the station as a way to fund the DTV transition.  We met with a  representative of one TV station who said that sale of the station to a  larger ownership group might be the only way for the station to fund its  transition to DTV.  Concerns about a reduction in the number of small,  independent broadcasters serving local communities could arise should  such sales actually take place.", "Seventeen percent of transitioning stations reported that they did not  know how they would completely fund the construction of the DTV  station.  This uncertainty raises concerns about whether these stations  will be able to broadcast a digital signal on time, given that our survey  was conducted only 7 months before the May 2002 deadline.", "We also asked stations to select the primary funding source from the  funding sources that they reported using.  Both current DTV stations and  transitioning stations most often named funding from the station owner or  parent company as their primary funding source.  However, 72 percent of  current DTV stations said funding from the station owner or parent was  their primary source, while 45 percent of transitioning stations listed a  station owner or parent as the primary source. Eleven percent of  transitioning stations reported that they did not know what would be their  primary funding source.", "Some industry executives noted that there are ways to mitigate the initial  costs of the DTV transition.  We asked about some of these methods in our  survey, and the responses showed the following:  Some stations reported sharing a broadcast tower with other stations,  which can be less expensive than having an individual, private tower.   However, we found no relationship between reported shared tower use  and reported lower average overall cost for construction of the DTV  station.", "We were told by industry executives that a temporary or \u201cside-mount\u201d  antenna can be less expensive to mount on the broadcast tower and can  be used to delay the construction of a new tower.  Twenty-seven percent  of current DTV stations reported having an antenna in a temporary  location; 26 percent of transitioning stations said that they plan to  temporarily install an antenna.", "FCC currently allows a broadcaster to transmit a DTV signal at less than  full power.

One of the most commonly cited problems among all  stations, for example, was weather.  Frozen ground, wind, and snow can  cause complications in tower work, particularly in the northern states  during the winter months, and can lead to delays in DTV construction  schedules.  Of the stations answering our survey, 41 percent of current DTV  stations and 57 percent of transitioning stations cited the weather as a  problem that had arisen or that was expected to arise.  We spoke with  representatives of three tower crew companies who told us that certain  types of weather require tower work to be delayed.

The survey questions and detailed survey  results for commercial stations are contained in appendixes IV and V, and  the questions and results for public stations are contained in appendixes VI  and VII.", "To provide the population information, we acquired the MEDIA Access Pro  database of BIA Financial Network, Inc., which is a private firm that  specializes in broadcast industry data.  This database provided us with the  names, addresses, and other contact information of broadcast stations as  well as information on such things as station size and ownership, station  revenues, market size, and station operating status.  We also used this  database to determine which stations were commercial and which were  public as well as which were broadcasting in digital and which were not.   The digital broadcasting status listed in BIA\u2019s database was combined with  information from the National Association of Broadcasters\u2019 Web site to  determine which version of the survey to mail to each station.  We mailed  surveys to all full-power commercial and public television stations on the  air at the end of September 2001.  We sent a different survey to any station  that indicated that we had misclassified its digital broadcasting status.  As  such, some of the stations that filled out the survey for digital stations  began that service after September 2001.  Our survey was not sent to low- power commercial broadcast stations because these stations have not been  required by FCC to transition to digital technologies.  In addition, the  survey was not mailed to the eight stations in New York City whose  broadcast towers atop the World Trade Center were destroyed in the  September 11 terrorist attacks.  Instead, we spoke directly to a  representative of each of these stations to gather information about how  the events of September 11 affected their operations generally and affected  their DTV plans in particular.  A discussion of the situations of the stations  in New York City is provided in appendix II.  We also adjusted the survey  population to exclude the few stations that (1) had recently gone off the air,  (2) indicated that they were not assigned a digital channel, or (3) were  broadcasting outside of the United States.

We received no U.S. mail for more than 2 months.  On  December 27, 2001, we conducted a second mailing of the survey to all  stations from which we had not received a survey response before October  15, 2001.  This time, surveys were mailed from and returned to our Boston  field office.  The second mailing went only to commercial stations due to  time constraints on the research phase created by the mail stoppage.   For  commercial stations that may have completed and returned the survey  twice, only the original survey from the October mailing was analyzed.  We  made a third and last attempt to contact the commercial station  nonrespondents in telephone reminder calls during the first 2 weeks of  March.  These telephone contacts resulted in an additional 237  questionnaires from late respondents (approximately 27 percent of all  commercial responses).", "Of the population of broadcast stations, we received 1,036 of 1,554 usable  questionnaires, for an overall response rate of 67 percent.

We received 727 of 1,014 surveys from commercial  transitioning stations (72 percent response rate) and 159 of 335 public  transitioning stations (47 percent response rate).", "We conducted two types of analyses of commercial stations to evaluate the  possibility that the respondents might differ from nonrespondents.   Although there is some evidence of differences, these are not sufficiently  consistent nor large enough to provide a basis for adjusting our survey  responses.  The first type of analysis directly compared two measures of  the size of the responding and nonresponding stations.   The  nonrespondents tended to be from larger markets and from larger  ownership groups.  For the transitioning stations, for example, 40 percent  of the nonrespondents and 31 percent of the respondents were from the top  50 markets.  The second analysis compared the early responses (sent  between October and February) with the later responses (sent in March).   The evidence was mixed as to whether the earlier or later responding  stations might have more difficulties in meeting the DTV station deadline.   On the one hand, transitioning early respondents were less likely than  transitioning late respondents to give the direct assessment that they might  have problems in meeting the deadline (73 percent and 80 percent,  respectively).  On the other hand, early respondents were more likely than  late respondents to report experiencing specific types of digital transition  problems.  For example, a funding problem was reported by 19 percent of  digital early respondents versus 5 percent of digital late respondents, and  62 percent of transitioning early respondents versus 43 percent of  transitioning late respondents.  No definite pattern emerges from these  findings, and it is unclear whether differences are due to actual differences  in the station characteristics of early and later respondents or to the  differing proximity to the deadline for broadcasting a digital signal.", "Questionnaires were mailed to station managers but were completed by  station managers, station engineers, or officials of the station owner or  parent company.

We were told that it will take up to 3 years to  achieve full analog signal restoration because each station must repair  transmission lines, install new antennas, acquire backup generators, and  negotiate for temporary and permanent space on rooftops and towers.", "An immediate need for the broadcasters was to negotiate the terms of  placing antennas, transmitters, and other equipment atop the Empire State  Building, which was the favored temporary location due to its more than  100-story height.  By mid-October, nearly every local TV station had begun  to broadcast from the roof of the Empire State Building.  Although the  Empire State Building seemed initially to be an effective substitute for the  World Trade Center location, unanticipated constraints arose, including  limited physical space, an aging infrastructure, and the lower height (as  compared with the World Trade Center).", "First, we were told that space on the Empire State Building\u2019s rooftop is  severely limited.  Many of New York City\u2019s radio stations have broadcast  from the rooftop for decades, and, as the rooftop is currently configured,  there is little room for the TV stations to install new broadcasting  equipment.  Second, the station representatives said that television  broadcasting is limited by engineering constraints related to the Empire  State Building\u2019s aging infrastructure.  Unlike the World Trade Center  buildings, the Empire State Building\u2019s infrastructure is more than 70 years  old.  While considered a safe building for workers, it is nonetheless a fragile  physical plant on which to place the amount of broadcasting equipment  required by eight television stations.   The aging infrastructure also creates  wiring and powering issues.  One station representative said that it simply  may not be possible to wire the Empire State Building to power the  necessary antennas, transmitters, and associated equipment.  Third, the  broadcasters used antennas perched on a 343-foot tower rising from a 110- story base when they were using the World Trade Center.  The Empire State  Building offers either operation from a 200-foot tower atop the somewhat  lower roofline or operation from the 81st floor.  In either case, nearby  Manhattan buildings\u2014even the Empire State Building itself\u2014cause  interference with the stations\u2019 signals and prevent reception for some  viewers.  One executive we spoke with believed that the Empire State  Building would serve more effectively as a backup transmission location.

In addition, use of the island would allow all stations to be located together,  thus obviating the need for each station to secure its own space in  Manhattan proper.", "While station executives attempt to secure permanent broadcasting space,  they must grapple with a range of budget and finance matters.  We were  told that, in particular, stations are dealing with (1) ensuring redundancy in  equipment placement, which requires negotiating twice for building rent,  consulting services, and other key purchases; (2) seeking reimbursement  from insurers for losses directly attributable to the events of September 11;  and (3) retaining high-quality programming so that affected viewers will  return when the analog signal is fully restored.", "Station executives with whom we spoke emphasized the need for  \u201credundancy\u201d of their broadcast signal as a precaution against future  terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other calamities.  This redundancy  requires stations to invest at least twice the amount that would be required  simply to replace the equipment that was destroyed on September 11,  contract twice for the services of design and engineering consultants, and  seek permits and negotiate rent at two distinct locations.  In addition,  stations are currently negotiating with their insurance companies to  determine precisely what is reimbursable in the wake of the September 11  events.  One station executive told us that his \u201ccomplex claim\u201d could  surpass $30 million.

Eighty percent of public current DTV stations said they were offering some  HDTV programming.  Many had their digital signal on the air constantly; the  stations averaged 50 hours per week of HDTV content and 66 hours per  week of multicasting.  Two-thirds of current DTV stations said they were  producing some of their own content in digital.  Of the transitioning  stations, most had various plans for their digital channel, including 84  percent that said they planned some amount of HDTV and 73 percent that  said they planned some amount of multicasting.  Fifty-three percent plan to  produce their own content in digital.", "As for problems that the public stations were experiencing or expecting,  funding ranked as the most reported problem.  Similar to the commercial  stations, funding was said to be a problem by 76 percent of transitioning  stations.  Weather was reported as a problem by 57 percent of transitioning  stations, and lengthy permit reviews were reported by 30 percent of  transitioning stations.", "Another difference from the commercial stations was the number of public  transitioning stations that said they might not make the deadline for  broadcasting a digital signal.  While 74 percent of commercial stations said  this, 45 percent of public stations said this.  It is likely that the additional  year given to public stations in the FCC\u2019s schedule partly explains the lower  number of public stations that think they will fail to meet their deadline.   There were also differences in the extensions that public stations felt they  might need from FCC.  Thirty-eight percent of public stations said they  would need an extension of 2 years or more, compared with 54 percent of  commercial stations that said this.  Lastly, public stations were more  optimistic about when they would have had a DTV signal on the air had  they not been given a timeline.  Fifty-two percent of public transitioning  stations said they would have been on the air in digital by 2006 (compared  with 46 percent of commercial transitioning stations)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Results for Commercial Current DTV Stations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Results for Commercial Transitioning Stations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Results for Public Current DTV Stations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Results for Public Transitioning Stations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Naba Barkakati, Jason Bromberg, Aaron  Casey, Michael Clements, Michele Fejfar, James M.
