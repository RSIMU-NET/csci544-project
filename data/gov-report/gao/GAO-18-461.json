Annual interstate agent agreements \u2014held by 9 states\u2014allow states to participate in all inspection activities and can bolster interstate pipeline oversight. For instance, an inspection conducted in 2014 by New York state officials led to $61,900 in federal civil penalties. Temporary interstate agreements \u2014used in 6 states to date\u2014allow PHMSA to request states to participate in specific interstate pipeline inspections. PHMSA officials said these agreements provide the agency greater flexibility. Some current interstate agents GAO interviewed said that temporary interstate agreements are useful, but are not substitutes for interstate agent status because states do not participate in the full range of inspections. Finally, PHMSA as authorized by federal law recently established joint inspections allowing states to request to participate in interstate inspections. However, state officials were concerned that their role is limited and that they must bear the full cost to participate. PHMSA officials said they intend to clarify the state inspector role in joint inspections and acknowledged that federal grants cannot be used by states to support joint inspection activities.", "PHMSA allocated recently hired inspectors based on regional workload, but has not assessed future resource needs. From fiscal years 2012 to 2017, PHMSA's appropriations increased over 40 percent, allowing the agency to expand its inspector workforce by about 25 percent. PHMSA allocated the additional inspectors across the agency's five regions based on workload. For example, PHMSA's central region received a greater percentage of inspectors than other regions to help oversee a number of new pipeline construction projects. However, PHMSA has not planned for future workforce needs for interstate pipeline inspections. In particular, it has not assessed the resources and benefits that states can provide through the three types of agreements. Leading practices for workforce planning indicate that such forward-looking analyses are essential for effective workforce planning. Without such analyses, PHMSA cannot proactively plan for future inspection needs to ensure that federal and state resources are in place to provide effective oversight of interstate pipelines."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["PHMSA should develop a workforce plan for interstate pipeline inspections, considering, among other things, the additional resources and safety oversight that state pipeline officials can provide.

At the federal level, the Pipeline and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is responsible for  developing safety-related regulations for these pipelines. In general,  PHMSA conducts inspections and enforces regulations for interstate  pipelines, while certified states generally oversee intrastate pipelines.  Historically, PHMSA has also entered into agreements with some state  pipeline safety offices to act as \u201cagents\u201d to supplement the federal  inspection workforce for interstate pipelines. Over the years, however, the  number of interstate agents has declined from 22 in 1973 to 9 today.

At the start of 2017, there were about 340,000 miles  of interstate transmission pipelines nationwide. Newly tapped  domestic gas and oil deposits have resulted in an increase in the  existing pipeline infrastructure to transport natural gas and oil.", "Intrastate pipelines: Intrastate pipelines are primarily composed of gas  distribution and some transmission pipelines that transport natural gas  pipelines to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. As of  2015, there were about 2.2 million miles of distribution pipelines  nationwide. In addition, an estimated 18,000 miles of federally  regulated gathering pipelines carry natural gas or hazardous liquids  from production areas to processing facilities where the product is  refined before continuing in transmission pipelines.", "At the federal level, PHMSA is responsible for developing regulations for  domestic interstate and intrastate natural gas and hazardous liquid  pipelines. Its regulatory programs are focused on ensuring safety in the  design, construction, operation, and maintenance of pipelines. Inspectors  from PHMSA\u2019s five regional offices and states are responsible for  inspecting nearly 3,000 companies that operate 2.7 million miles of  pipelines.", "Each year, PHMSA uses its Risk Ranking Index Model (RRIM) as one  input to determine its annual inspection priorities.

PHMSA\u2019s guidance specifies that high-risk pipelines should be  inspected at least once every 3 years, medium-risk pipelines every 5  years, and low-risk pipelines every 7 years. PHMSA\u2019s goal each year is to  inspect, at a minimum, pipeline systems where the time since last  inspection meets or exceeds the PHMSA guidance for the tier.", "Under federal pipeline safety laws, states may assume inspection and  enforcement responsibilities for intrastate gas and hazardous liquid  pipelines, which are primarily natural gas distribution pipelines. States  assume that responsibility by annually certifying their state pipeline safety  program to PHMSA, which PHMSA must validate. As part of a state\u2019s  certification, states must establish pipeline laws similar to federal pipeline  safety regulations for intrastate pipelines, but may also impose more  stringent pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA reimburses certified state  agencies up to 80 percent of the total cost of operating their pipeline  safety program through an annual grant.", "PHMSA may permit certified states to participate in interstate inspections  through three types of agreements. (See fig.1):  Interstate agent agreement: At PHMSA\u2019s discretion, certified states  may enter into an interstate agent agreement for either their natural  gas program, hazardous liquid program, or both on an annual basis.  As of April, 2018, nine state pipeline agencies hold these agreements.  On PHMSA\u2019s behalf, these agencies assume inspection  responsibilities for the range of interstate inspection activities, as  agreed upon by PHMSA and prioritized by PHMSA during the  agency\u2019s annual inspection planning process. States may also  propose and conduct additional inspections as they believe  necessary.  While state inspectors can identify violations, PHMSA is  ultimately responsible for enforcement of interstate pipeline  regulations and uses a range of enforcement tools from Warning  Letters to more stringent Notices of Probable Violation with either  proposed compliance orders or proposed civil penalties.", "Temporary interstate agreement: These agreements allow PHMSA to  request a state that has had its certification validated by PHMSA to  perform interstate pipeline inspections on a temporary basis.

PHMSA  regional officials generally agreed that interstate agents have well-trained  staff and leverage their local knowledge to enhance interstate pipeline  inspections within their state. Additionally, interstate agents, if authorized  by PHMSA, may conduct inspections of interstate pipelines within their  state more frequently than PHMSA. For instance, officials in one PHMSA  region noted that an interstate agent in their jurisdiction ensured each  interstate operator was inspected once every 2 years, regardless of  PHMSA\u2019s risk ranking. Similarly, in two of 5 regions that have interstate  agents, PHMSA regional officials stated that they needed interstate  agents to supplement their current allocation of federal inspectors. For  instance, in one region, PHMSA officials said that if interstate agent  agreements were discontinued, the region would need to hire 3 to 4  additional inspectors. In another region, officials said that interstate  agents provided the equivalent of 5 to 10 additional inspectors. Officials in  one PHMSA region said that, although the region could absorb the  interstate agent workload if needed, doing so would lead to less extensive  inspections because there would more pipelines to inspect with fewer  federal inspectors.", "Interstate agents may also enhance pipeline safety oversight within their  state by going above and beyond the annual interstate inspection  activities required under their agreement with PHMSA. Specifically, as  part of the annual inspection planning process, PHMSA\u2019s regional offices  work with interstate agents to develop an annual inspection plan. While  interstate agents must prioritize PHMSA\u2019s inspection priorities, such as  participation in new construction inspections and PHMSA-led systems  inspections, they can also propose additional inspections of interstate  pipelines within their state. Officials in half of the nine states with  interstate agent agreements stated that they proposed and obtained  PHMSA\u2019s approval for additional interstate pipeline inspections that would  not otherwise have been included in PHMSA\u2019s annual inspection plan.  For instance, PHMSA\u2019s Western Region reported that between January  1, 2015 and December 31, 2016 Washington State\u2019s pipeline safety  agency\u2014which holds an interstate agent agreement\u2014proposed and  conducted 13 inspections beyond those identified in PHMSA\u2019s inspection  plans.", "During these additional inspections conducted by interstate agents, state  officials have identified violations of pipeline safety regulations. Some  violations, including the four illustrative examples below, were deemed  serious enough that PHMSA imposed civil penalties.", "In 2015, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental  Protection inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state.  During the inspection, Connecticut inspectors found the pipeline  operator had failed to employ properly qualified welders in  constructing a section of the pipeline. As a result, PHMSA issued a  civil penalty of $26,200 to the pipeline operator. In response to the  findings, the operator ensured its welders were properly qualified and  replaced the 14 welds completed by improperly qualified welders.", "In 2014, the New York Department of Public Service\u2019s Pipeline  Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state.  During that inspection, New York inspectors identified violations  related to the operator\u2019s corrosion-control practices. Inspectors also  found that the operator failed to prepare, and follow, a manual for  conducting operations and maintenance activities, as well as for  emergency response. As a result, PHMSA issued a civil penalty of  $61,900. In response to the findings, the operator took action to  address the corrosion control-related violations and revised its  operations and maintenance manual.", "In 2011, the New York Department of Public Service\u2019s Pipeline  Division inspected an interstate pipeline that traverses the state.

PHMSA also issued a Compliance Order,  requiring the operator to remediate the identified violations, or face an  additional civil penalty.", "In 2014, Arizona\u2019s Corporation Commission\u2019s Pipeline Safety Section  inspected two interstate gas transmission lines that traverse the state.  During the inspection, PHMSA and Arizona inspectors found that the  operator had committed probable violations by not properly odorizing  its pipeline, and providing insufficient information to the public about  its pipeline odorization methods. As a result, PHMSA issued a  Notice of Probable Violation, proposed civil penalties totaling  $162,700, and issued a Proposed Compliance Order.", "Although state involvement in interstate inspections can enhance  oversight, officials from almost all of our selected states that do not  currently have an interstate agent agreement expressed little interest in  pursuing such an agreement. Specifically, some officials in we spoke with  plan to focus their limited resources on intrastate pipeline safety oversight  activities. For example, although Texas has over 50,000 miles of  interstate pipeline, officials in that state have focused exclusively on  intrastate inspection activity, citing the heavy workload of their inspection  staff, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining additional  inspectors. In another instance, California\u2019s state pipeline safety agency  responsible for hazardous liquid oversight voluntarily withdrew from the  interstate agent program in 2013, citing staffing shortages stemming from  a difficult economic climate.", "Although PHMSA\u2019s current policy stance does not prohibit the agency  from entering into a formal interstate agent agreement if the  circumstances warrant, the agency prefers that state agencies enter into  temporary interstate agreements.

PHMSA officials stated that they do not intend to discontinue current  interstate agent agreements, but due in part to a recent staff increase the  agency has sufficient staff to meet its inspection needs without adding  additional interstate agents. PHMSA officials also told us that intrastate  pipelines pose the highest safety risk to states and, consequently, state  pipeline safety agencies should focus their efforts on intrastate pipeline  oversight rather than participating in interstate pipeline inspections.  During the last 7 years, four states that applied for an agent agreement\u2014 New Hampshire, Virginia, Maryland, and Nevada\u2014were not accepted  by PHMSA for these reasons. (See app. I.)

In the event PHMSA  requested assistance with certain interstate inspections, state inspectors  may be unfamiliar with the interstate pipeline systems and operators. As a  result, some state officials said that their inspectors may have a steep  learning curve when conducting inspections under a temporary interstate  agreement. However, PHMSA officials disagreed that most interstate  agent states would have such steep learning curve because they  currently inspect intrastate transmission pipelines; the regulations for  interstate and intrastate pipelines are for the most part identical. Another  obstacle some state officials identified relates to the fact that state  pipeline safety agencies may not have sufficient inspection staff available,  when needed, to participate in ad hoc interstate inspections.", "Due to the limited state role and competing priorities, state pipeline safety  agencies rarely enter into temporary interstate agreements. According to officials in five of the 6 states that have that have entered into temporary  interstate agreements, the agreements were used for limited, ad hoc  inspections that were initiated by PHMSA. The sixth temporary interstate  agreement was initiated by PHMSA in lieu of the Virginia pipeline safety  agency\u2019s 2017 application for an interstate agent agreement for natural  gas. PHMSA offered to enter into a longer-term, temporary interstate  agreement, which would permit the state agency to inspect the installation  of two large interstate pipeline systems. The state agency accepted the  temporary interstate agreement, which may be extended annually until  the completion of the pipeline construction. To meet its new interstate  inspection obligations, the state agency told us it hired two additional  inspectors. According to state officials, those two inspectors will be  dedicated to intrastate pipeline inspection, which will allow two of the  state agency\u2019s more experienced inspectors to conduct interstate pipeline  inspections.", "Current interstate agents do not consider temporary interstate  agreements to be an adequate substitute for an interstate agent  agreement. According to officials we spoke with that are currently  interstate agents, an interstate agent agreement allows state agencies  and their inspectors to develop a strong understanding of operators and  pipelines within their state. A few state officials stressed that the greatest  benefit of interstate agent status was the ability to leverage their local  knowledge\u2014such as the proximity and familiarity with interstate pipelines  within their states\u2014to allow for quick responses to public concerns and  pipeline incidents.

In response to the requirement in the PIPES Act, PHMSA  created joint inspections and established certain criteria for state  participation. For instance, to ensure that participation in joint inspections  does not compromise intrastate pipeline safety, PHMSA only allows state  inspectors to participate if the state agency has accomplished the  required minimum number of inspection days during the preceding  calendar year. PHMSA also requires state agencies to bear the cost of  participating in joint inspections\u2014including travel and inspection time for  the state inspectors\u2014rather than allowing states to include this activity in  their annual pipeline safety program grant reimbursement.
