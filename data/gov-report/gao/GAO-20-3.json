OMB, the Technology Modernization Board, and GSA oversee the TMF. The board is responsible for approval of agency project proposals focused on replacing aging IT systems. Agencies receive incremental award funding and are required to repay the funds transferred and an administrative fee within five years. Agencies may use the project's generated cost savings to repay the award. GSA can use TMF appropriations to cover its operating expenses, and is required to collect administrative fees from awarded projects to offset these expenses. GSA's fee rate was established with the intent to fully recover its costs. As of August 2019, Congress had appropriated $125 million to the TMF.", "The act included a provision for GAO to report biannually on the TMF. For its first TMF report, among other things, GAO analyzed the TMF's operating costs and assessed the reliability of selected projects' cost savings estimates.

GAO also analyzed TMF project proposal and supporting cost estimate documentation from selected agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of August 2019, the Technology Modernization Board had made seven Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) awards to five agencies, totaling about $89 million, and had transferred $37.65 million of this funding to the projects (see table). In addition, pursuant to the Modernizing Government Technology (MGT) Act, the General Services Administration (GSA) had obligated about $1.2 million to cover TMF operating expenses, but had recovered only about 3 percent of those expenses through fee payments. The seven projects are expected to make $1.2 million in scheduled fee payments by the end of fiscal year 2025; as of August, three projects have made fee payments totaling $33,165. Based on the current schedule, GSA will not fully recover these expenses until fiscal year 2025 at the earliest.", "GSA had collected fewer fees than planned to offset costs due to several factors. For example, the seven projects paid fees based on the amounts transferred, rather the total funds awarded, thereby reducing fee collections in the initial years. Two projects also proposed scope changes that are expected to reduce funding required and, thus, reduce total fees. Such factors raise doubts on whether GSA will be able to fully recover future operating expenses. Although GSA acknowledged this issue, the agency has not yet developed a plan outlining the actions needed to fully recover its TMF operating costs in a timely manner.", "The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) funding guidelines require projects to include a reliable estimate of any project-related savings. However, the seven projects' reported savings estimates derived from cost estimates are not reliable. None of the projects incorporated all of the best practices for a reliable cost estimate, as defined in GAO and OMB guidance. Without clarifying the requirement that agencies follow Circular A-11's cost estimating process (that references GAO's cost estimating guidance discussed in this report), agencies are at risk of continuing to provide unreliable cost information in their proposals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making five recommendations\u2014two to OMB and three to GSA, including developing a plan to fully recover operating costs and clarifying that agencies should follow required cost guidance.

We  also held initial discussions with staff from OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government  and Information Technology and with officials from the Department of the  Treasury and GSA, regarding each agency\u2019s role in administering the  fund\u2019s operations and the costs associated with those activities. In doing  so, we confirmed that GSA is the only federal agency obligating funds  from the TMF to cover operating costs.", "To ensure the accuracy and completeness of GSA\u2019s financial data on the  operating costs for TMF administration, we obtained information from  officials within GSA\u2019s Office of the Deputy Administrator on the controls in  place for ensuring the reliability of the financial data.

(Fiscal year 2019 was the  first fiscal year that awarded projects could have realized cost savings as  a result of receiving TMF funding.) In doing so, we confirmed that none of  the seven projects had begun to realize cost savings; therefore, it was  premature to compare projects\u2019 realized savings to TMF administrative  costs.", "For the second objective, we analyzed TMF project proposals, including  cost estimates and supporting documentation, from the five agencies that  received the seven awards.

First, we interviewed officials in the TMF  Program Management Office responsible for developing the template in  order to understand the purpose of each template data field and what  information was required to be completed. We took this step because  there were no written instructions for the template regarding the data  elements or the fields required to be completed.", "We also interviewed officials in the Office of the CIO and other  appropriate offices at each agency, who were in charge of completing the  TMF cost estimate template.

Further, according to the Executive Director, the  office did not expect that the agencies\u2019 selection of a 5-year repayment  term instead of a 3-year term to significantly affect the performance of the  fund. However, as the Executive Director noted, these longer repayment  terms do affect the collection of administrative fee payments because a  longer repayment term means that these funds are not as readily  available to award to new projects and generate new fees.", "Projects make payments based on funds transferred. Agencies  receiving awards were only required to make administrative fee payments  based on the amount of the award funding that was transferred, rather  than based on the full awarded amount. As such, this reduced the amount  of fees that the TMF Program Management Office could collect in the  initial years that agencies made fee payments.", "As of August 31, 2019, the Technology Modernization Board had  authorized the transfer of $37.65 million (of the $89.36 million awarded) to  the seven projects. Based on the amounts transferred, the office is  scheduled to collect $1.2 million in administrative fees through 2025 from  the seven projects.

However, the Technology  Modernization Board had not made awards to any additional projects as  of August 2019, and, as a result, the office will not likely be able to collect  any additional fees from new projects until at least fiscal year 2021. Any  newly awarded projects would be eligible to delay paying administrative  fees until 1 year after the initial award date in accordance with the funding  guidelines.", "Fee rates were determined based on assumptions regarding  appropriations that were not met. The TMF Program Management  Office set its current administrative fee rates in June 2018 based on the  assumption that the fund would receive higher levels of appropriations  than what was ultimately received. In doing so, the office projected that it  would transfer more funds to projects, which would result in larger  administrative rates over the initial years of the fund. Specifically, GSA  requested $438 million in its fiscal year 2018 and 2019 budget requests  for the TMF, but actually received $125 million in appropriations.", "Table 4 lists the amounts that GSA requested in its budget requests and  the amounts appropriated for fiscal years 2018 through 2020.", "In making its June 2018 assumptions about the appropriations, the office  projected that it would distribute larger amounts of funds in the first 2  years of operation and collect more administrative fees through fiscal year  2025. However, the office\u2019s projected collection of administrative fees is  less than what was scheduled as of the end of August 2019. In particular,  while the office exceeded its projections for distributing funds in fiscal  year 2018 ($1.93 million more than projected), the office had not yet met  its projection of distributing $75 million in fiscal year 2019\u2014specifically, as  of August 31, 2019, the office had distributed only $25.71 million to  awarded projects. Consequently, these lower levels of distributed funds  decreased the amount of administrative fees scheduled to be collected.", "Table 5 shows the TMF Program Management Office\u2019s projections for  fund distribution for fiscal years 2018 through 2019 and its projected fee  collection, compared to the current scheduled distributions and  administrative fee collection for fiscal years 2018 through 2025, as of  August 31, 2019.", "Going forward, the office had projected that it would distribute $75 million  in fiscal year 2020. However, based on our analysis, only approximately  $35.6 million was available in the fund as of August 31, 2019, to award to  new projects.", "The Executive Director of the TMF Program Management Office stated  that the office had to make assumptions about the TMF appropriation  levels in order to develop the rate model. In doing so, all of the underlying  assumptions and parameters related to determining the administrative fee  rates and ensuring the fund operated at full cost recovery were reviewed  by GSA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer and Office of General  Counsel, OMB, and the Technology Modernization Board before the GSA  Deputy Administrator approved the fee rates in June 2018. In addition,  the Executive Director noted that, at the time the rate model was  developed, the office did not yet have information on the fiscal year 2019  appropriations and made the assumption that the fund would receive the  same level of appropriations as in fiscal year 2018 ($100 million).", "However, based on the wide gap between the budget requests and what  funds were ultimately appropriated in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, these  assumptions regarding fund appropriation levels did not materialize and  impacted the amount of fees that could be collected from awarded  projects in fiscal year 2019.", "Four projects\u2019 changes will affect fee collection. As of August 31,  2019, officials responsible for the management of four of the seven TMF- funded projects reported that they were planning to make significant  changes to their projects\u2019 approved scope or scheduled milestones.  Officials from two projects reported that they had received approval for  these scope changes from the Technology Modernization Board (in June  2019 and August 2019, respectively) and are currently waiting on  approval for the repayment schedule changes as of August 31, 2019.  Officials from the other two projects reported in August 2019 that they  planned to present their changes to the board for approval. Based on our  analysis, these changes are expected to affect the four projects\u2019  administrative fee repayment schedules and reduce two projects\u2019  administrative fee collection by $369,117.", "Table 6 lists the changes to the four TMF-funded projects as of August  31, 2019, as reported by the agencies; the status of the Technology  Modernization Board\u2019s approval of the changes; and the potential impacts  these changes are expected to have on administrative fee collection. In  addition, more details on the changes reported by the four projects are  included in appendix II.", "The Executive Director of the TMF Program Management Office stated  that the four projects\u2019 reduction or delay in administrative fee payments  should not affect administrative fee collection. The Executive Director  explained that the return of prior awarded funds will allow the Technology  Modernization Board to have more funds available to award to new  projects, which would generate new administrative fees. However, these  proposed changes to the four projects\u2019 scope and schedule likely will  affect upcoming administrative fee collection because additional time will  be needed to review new project proposals. In addition, the agencies may  delay administrative fee payments for one year after award issuance.", "As a result of the five factors that we identified that had impacted  administrative fee collection as of August 2019, there is likely to be a  period of time between when the office\u2019s current administrative fee  collection occurs and when the office can recover its operating expenses  from this collection. Specifically, based on our analysis, it will take the  TMF Program Management Office at least 5 years (until 2024) to recover  the operating costs expended as of August 31, 2019, (over $1.2 million)  with the current collection of administrative fees. In addition, once the two  projects\u2019 proposed scope and schedule changes are approved by the  Technology Modernization Board (decreasing fees collected by  $369,117), it is likely that the office will take longer than 5 years to  recover these operating costs.", "Further, it is not clear when the TMF Program Management Office will  recover future operating expenses incurred in fiscal year 2020 and  beyond. Moreover, these factors will most likely continue to be a  challenge for OMB and the office going forward if newly awarded projects  choose longer repayment periods or more awarded projects make  changes that affect fee collection. Consequently, OMB and the TMF  Program Management Office are not currently on track to operate the  fund at full cost recovery, as intended.", "The Executive Director of the TMF Program Management Office stated  that the office had reduced its fiscal year 2019 operating expenses by  almost 50 percent from the original planned operating level (in the fiscal  year 2019 President\u2019s Budget). In particular, the Executive Director  reported that the office used temporary staff internally to deliver  administrative and support activities, such as website updates and the  preparation of meeting agendas and minutes, rather than rely on  contractors. The office added that, using internal temporary employees  had provided the office with the flexibility to scale operations up and down  as appropriate. As of August 2019, the office was not pursuing a staff  increase.", "Further, the Executive Director stated that, as of August 2019, the office  was reassessing the assumptions for the administrative fee rate model for  the upcoming year, including assumptions for fiscal year 2020  appropriations. The Executive Director added that the office would like to  have more information on its fiscal year 2020 appropriations in order to  help determine the new rate.

The  Executive Director added that the office still intends to pursue full cost  recovery going forward, but noted that this may change if the new set of  assumptions is not met. Further, the Executive Director reported that four  project proposals were in draft stages or pending a Technology  Modernization Board determination as of August 2019.", "Since the fund was established in December 2017, OMB, the Technology  Modernization Board, and the TMF Program Management Office have  provided oversight of the fund\u2019s awarded projects by requiring the  respective agencies to provide quarterly updates on the status of project  milestones and transferring additional funds only when milestones were  reached. However, the board had not made a corresponding effort to  ensure that the TMF Program Management Office\u2019s operating costs and  administrative fee collection remained on track to achieve full cost  recovery as intended.", "In addition, the office\u2019s plan to take 12 years\u2014from the start of operations  in fiscal year 2018 until fiscal year 2029\u2014to fully recover its operating  costs hinders GSA\u2019s ability to maximize the amount of appropriations  available for award due to the length of time necessary to recover its  costs.

However, given the lower-than-expected collection of these administrative  fees and the office\u2019s lengthy time frame for recovering all costs, it may be  prudent to review those fees and determine whether their rates are set  appropriately. Unless OMB and the TMF Program Management Office  take steps to develop a plan that outlines the actions needed to fully  recover TMF operating expenses with administrative fee collection in a  timely manner, there will be fewer funds available to award to projects  that are intended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of  government IT systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TMF Projects Plan to Begin Realizing Cost Savings in Fiscal Year 2020 or Later", "paragraphs": ["The MGT Act established the TMF to help improve, retire, or replace  federal IT systems with more efficient and effective systems that would  cost less money to operate and maintain.

Further, we acknowledge GSA\u2019s  statement that the agency will commit to working with OMB and the  Technology Modernization Board to identify necessary updates to the  cost estimating guidance as a positive step towards addressing our  recommendation.

GSA\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix IV.", "OMB provided written comments in which the agency did not state  whether it agreed or disagreed with our recommendations; however,  OMB stated that the agency remains concerned with the facts,  characterizations, and opinions in the draft report. The agency further  stated that the draft report contains many key assumptions and  recommendations that are misleading and paints an incomplete  picture of the TMF. OMB then stated that while we met with the  agency twice during the course of the audit, we engaged with GSA  multiple times in contrast. According to OMB, many of the questions  we posed to GSA would have been better answered by OMB, whose  authorities in the budget, apportionment, and approval process for  TMF proposals could have enabled us to state items in the report with  greater accuracy. In addition, the agency stated that many of its  corrections and suggestions offered in its review of the statement of  facts were rejected by us, although the agency offered no examples to  support its comments.", "We disagree with OMB\u2019s statements regarding our audit methodology  for several reasons. First, in meetings with staff from OMB\u2019s Office of  E-Government and Information Technology, we obtained information  from the staff in all of the areas noted by OMB in its letter. In our  report, we discuss OMB\u2019s role in the fund\u2019s administration and the  approval process for TMF proposals, as well as OMB\u2019s guidance in  these areas. Further, we made ourselves available to engage with  OMB throughout the course of the audit. For example, we arranged a  meeting with the Federal CIO and her staff to discuss the  administration of the TMF and to present our preliminary  observations, but the meeting was cancelled by the Federal CIO\u2019s  office due to scheduling constraints and not rescheduled.", "Second, we incorporated many of OMB\u2019s comments on the statement  of facts related to OMB\u2019s role in fund administration and the approval  process into our draft report. For example, although we had included  information in the statement of facts regarding the requirement that  agency CIOs and chief financial officers approve TMF proposals prior  to submittal to the Technology Modernization Board, OMB requested  that we include this information in other sections throughout the  report. OMB also requested that we include language in the report to  ensure that it was understood that TMF projects began after an  interagency agreement was signed between the TMF Program  Management Office and the agency and not when TMF awards were  announced. We incorporated these changes into the background and  other relevant report sections.", "However, in cases where OMB asked us to incorporate the entirety of  language from the MGT Act\u2014rather than summarizing the law\u2019s key  requirements\u2014we chose not to do so for the purposes of  conciseness. In addition, OMB also requested that we update the  status information for the TMF awarded projects in our report to be  closer to the report\u2019s issuance. However, as we had told OMB staff  during our review, we intended to report project information as of  August 31, 2019, based on our audit methodology and reporting  timeframes. Consequently, we believe that we have accurately  characterized the facts related to OMB\u2019s role in TMF administration  and sufficiently incorporated OMB\u2019s relevant comments into our  report.", "OMB also disagreed with our characterization of the TMF repayment  process and the assumptions about potential insolvency of the fund.  As noted above in our response to GSA\u2019s comments, our report did  not make a conclusion that the fund was insolvent, or that the fund  was on track to being insolvent. Rather, our report discusses the  factors affecting administrative fee collection and the impact these  ongoing challenges have on the TMF Program Management Office\u2019s  ability to pursue a full cost recovery model and recover all costs by  fiscal year 2029, as GSA intended. In addition, we acknowledged the  Program Management Office\u2019s efforts to reduce its operating costs in  fiscal year 2019 (to under $1 million).", "OMB also stated that the primary shortcoming has been the fact that  the TMF has been underfunded by Congress, leading to slower than  anticipated project volume. In our report, among the factors that we  discussed as affecting TMF fee collection, we noted that the initial  TMF fee rates were determined in June 2018 based on assumptions  regarding appropriations that were not met. We also noted the impact  that these assumptions had on the TMF Program Management  Office\u2019s projected collection of administrative fees in the first two years  of operation and for fiscal year 2020. Specifically, we noted that the  office projected it would distribute $75 million in fiscal year 2020 but  had only approximately $35.6 million available in the fund as of  August 31, 2019.", "We concluded that OMB and the TMF Program Management Office  were not on track to recovering all operating expenses in a timely  manner, thereby leaving less of the fund\u2019s capital available for project  awards. At no point did we assert the fund was insolvent, or was in  danger of becoming so. As such, we continue to believe our  assessment of the fund\u2019s ongoing fee recovery is accurate and that  our recommendation for OMB and GSA to work together to develop  and implement a plan to use administrative fee collection to fully  recover operating expenses is still warranted.", "OMB also challenged our analysis of agency projects\u2019 cost estimates  using our Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide because,  according to the agency, we had asserted that federal agencies must  follow the cost guide when developing cost estimates for federal  projects. OMB stated that all projects, including those submitted for  consideration, must follow OMB Circular A-11, not the GAO guide.", "Since OMB first introduced its cost estimating appendix to Circular A- 11 in 2006, the circular has stated that the appendix is based on the  GAO cost estimating guide. Specifically, the circular stated that the  appendix is based on GAO\u2019s \u201cguide to their auditors on how to  evaluate an agency's cost estimating process, and the reliability and  validity of the data used to develop the cost estimates. Following  these guidelines will help agencies to meet most cost estimating  requirements.\u201d Further, we reported that OMB\u2019s Circular A-11 cost  estimating appendix outlined a number of major steps in the cost  estimating process, and referenced the practices outlined in GAO\u2019s  cost guide. As our report states, OMB Circular A-11 directs agencies  to follow the guidance outlined in the appendix on cost estimating for  all IT investments and acquisitions within the federal government, and  as mentioned above, is based on GAO\u2019s cost estimating guidance.   We noted that OMB\u2019s guidance referenced GAO\u2019s cost guide;  however, we did not assert that agencies were required to follow  GAO\u2019s cost guide independent of Circular A-11.", "Further, our analysis of the cost estimates for the seven projects  found that none of the projects incorporated all of the best practices  for a reliable estimate cost estimate, as defined in either OMB Circular  A-11 or GAO guidance. We noted that the TMF\u2019s website did not  include any guidance instructing agencies to follow the requirements  outlined in Circular A-11; however, we stated that, regardless of  whether or not agencies were told to do so, it was an agency\u2019s  responsibility to follow these steps. Further, we noted that ensuring  agencies understand the requirements they are supposed to follow  when developing a cost estimate for the TMF proposal process is  critical to the success of the proposal process.", "Accordingly, we continue to believe our assessment of the seven  projects\u2019 cost estimates is accurate and based on appropriate and  generally-accepted criteria, and that our recommendations to OMB  and GSA in this area are still warranted. However, in the interest of  ensuring that our recommendations are explicit about clarifying which  requirements agencies are to follow when developing cost estimates,  we have modified the language of our related recommendations to  more directly address Circular A-11.", "OMB also noted the additional requirements\u2014beyond those found in  Circular A-11\u2014imposed on agency submissions by the Technology  Modernization Board, including authoritative signoff by the agency  chief information officer and chief financial officer for schedule and  repayment documentation. The agency further asserted that the  characteristics of the TMF, including the ability to incrementally fund  projects and to adjust project scope and timing of project transfers,  means that projects funded by the TMF are more likely to succeed.", "We agree that agencies\u2019 executive review of submissions to the board  is an integral part of ensuring the quality of those submissions. Such  reviews, coupled with more clear direction to agencies on what federal  guidance they are required to follow, as discussed above, will further  strengthen the quality of the supporting documentation submitted to  the board.", "Further, OMB also stated that the board takes seriously its  responsibilities to make sure approved projects meet the  requirements of the MGT Act, the guiding principles established by  the board, and to ensure that projects repay all required amounts  while successfully delivering smarter, more secure commercial  capabilities to improve citizen services. In addition, OMB stated that  the board requires that all approved projects have requirements to  provide information, best practices, playbooks, and other supporting  documentation. OMB also stated that the board has managed the  TMF both in alignment with industry-wide best practices for iterative,  agile financing for technology projects, and has been judicious and  discerning in how it invests TMF funds.", "We agree with the importance of ensuring approved projects meet the  requirements of the MGT Act. In our report, we acknowledged OMB,  the Technology Modernization Board, and the TMF Program  Management Office\u2019s efforts to provide oversight of the fund\u2019s  awarded projects. However, our report also identified ongoing  challenges with the TMF Program Management Office\u2019s fee collection,  including the office\u2019s plan to take 12 years to fully recover its operating  costs\u2014a plan that was reviewed by the Technology Modernization  Board and OMB\u2014that will hinder GSA\u2019s ability to maximize the funds  available for awards.", "We also agree that it is important that all approved projects have  requirements in place related to providing information and supporting  documentation. In our report, we discussed that OMB\u2019s funding  guidelines required projects to include a reliable estimate of project- related savings. However, as we also noted, none of the seven  projects\u2019 reported savings estimates were reliable because they did  not incorporate all of the best practices for a reliable cost estimate as  defined in OMB Circular A-11 and GAO\u2019s cost estimating guide.  Therefore, it was not certain whether the projects that we reviewed  would save the government as much money as was estimated. While  it is important that the board have requirements in place, it is equally  vital that agencies clearly understand the requirements they are  supposed to follow\u2014and that these requirements are clearly  articulated on the TMF website\u2014for the proposal process to be  successful. As such, we continue to believe our recommendations to  OMB and GSA are appropriate. OMB\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix V.", "In addition to the aforementioned comments, the four agencies to which  we did not make recommendations provided the following responses.", "In an email received on November 22, 2019, a Director of Strategic  Planning, Policy, Egovernment and Audits in the Office of the CIO at  Agriculture stated that the agency concurred with the information  presented in the report.", "In an email received on November 7, 2019, an audit coordinator in  Energy\u2019s Office of the CIO did not state whether the agency had  comments on the report and provided technical comments, which we  incorporated as appropriate.", "In written comments provided on November 19, 2019, the department  stated that it had no comments to provide on the written report.

We also reviewed  GAO, GSA Office of Inspector General, and GSA reports that discussed  the results of prior reviews of internal controls for GSA financial systems.", "Based on discussions with agency officials and our reviews of these prior  reports, we did not identify any specific findings that would affect our  reporting of these data. In addition, we reviewed GSA-provided data for  obvious errors and inconsistencies and identified no significant errors  related to the accuracy or completeness of the data. Based on these  steps, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for us to be  able to report accurately on GSA\u2019s operating costs for TMF  administration.", "We also obtained and analyzed agency documentation from, and  interviewed officials within, GSA\u2019s TMF Program Management Office  regarding the fund\u2019s actual and planned operating expenses as of August  31, 2019. We assessed the collection of administrative fees used to  ensure the solvency of the fund during the period from June 2018 (when  projects first began to receive awards) through August 31, 2019. In  addition, we interviewed staff in OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and  Information Technology regarding OMB guidance and its administrative  responsibilities for the fund.", "Further, we obtained and analyzed TMF project proposal documentation  and signed interagency agreements and interviewed officials in charge of  the TMF-funded projects within the Office of the CIO and other  appropriate offices at each of the five agencies to determine the  scheduled repayment transfers, administrative fee payments, and  whether awarded projects had realized cost savings for fiscal year 2019.  (Fiscal year 2019 was the first fiscal year that awarded projects could  have realized cost savings as a result of receiving TMF funding.) In doing  so, we confirmed that none of the seven projects had begun to realize  cost savings; therefore, it was premature to compare the projects\u2019  realized savings to TMF administrative costs.", "For the second objective, we analyzed TMF project proposals, including  cost estimates and supporting documentation, from the five agencies that  received the seven awards. In addition, we interviewed the agencies\u2019  project officials responsible for developing the overall TMF cost savings  estimate and associated cost estimates regarding their estimation  processes. We compared each TMF-funded project team\u2019s estimating  methodologies and documentation to the best practices of a reliable cost  estimate discussed in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.  Our analysis enabled us to determine whether each project\u2019s cost  estimate, used to determine the project\u2019s cost savings estimate, was  comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible.", "The GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide considers an estimate  to be comprehensive if its level of detail ensures that all pertinent costs  are included and no costs are double-counted or omitted; well- documented if the estimate can be easily repeated or updated and can be  traced to original sources through auditing; accurate if it is not overly  conservative, is based on an assessment of the most likely costs, and is  adjusted properly for inflation; and credible if the estimate has been  cross-checked with an independent cost estimate and a level of  uncertainty associated with the estimate has been identified and  quantified.", "For each characteristic, our analysis had five possible assessment  categories:", "Not met. The estimate provided no evidence that satisfies any of the  characteristic\u2019s set of best practices.", "Minimally met.

The estimate provided complete evidence that satisfies the  characteristic\u2019s entire set of best practices.", "A cost estimate is considered reliable if the overall assessment for each  of the four characteristics are met or substantially met.", "We presented the results of our initial analysis of each TMF project cost  estimate to its respective agency in July 2019. We asked the agencies to  verify the information presented in the analysis and provide any updates  or additional supporting documentation, as appropriate. Each of the  agencies provided updated information, which we incorporated into this  analysis, as appropriate.", "In addition, we interviewed staff in the Office of E-Government and  Information Technology, as well as officials from the TMF Program  Management Office, about the process for the review and approval of  TMF-funded project cost savings estimates and cost estimate  documentation.", "Because the Technology Modernization Board required agency project  teams to use a template to submit the project cost savings estimates and  because we learned from project officials at each of the five agencies that  they did not rely on data from agency financial systems when completing  the template, we took additional steps to assess the reliability of the data  in the completed templates. First, we interviewed officials in the TMF  Program Management Office responsible for developing the template in  order to understand the purpose of each template data field and what  information was required to be completed. We took this step because  there were no written instructions for the template regarding the data  elements or the fields required to be completed.", "We also interviewed officials in the Office of the CIO and other  appropriate offices at each agency, who were in charge of completing the  TMF cost estimate template. We discussed with these officials how the  template was filled out and what sources of data were used. Because  project teams did not rely on data from agency financial systems when  completing the spreadsheet template, we reviewed agency responses  and other supporting documentation to determine how the estimated  costs and savings were derived and whether there were any qualifications  of the provided data. This included whether certain costs were excluded  from the program cost estimate, how up-to-date the data were, or whether  there were other qualifications of the provided data. We followed up with  agency officials regarding these qualifications as appropriate. Further, we  reviewed the completed templates to identify missing data, or other  errors, and consulted with our cost estimation specialists about these  issues, as appropriate.", "Based on our assessment of each project\u2019s cost estimate (used to derive  the cost savings estimate) and the other measures we took to assess the  reliability of the data included in the completed templates, we determined  that the cost savings data for all seven TMF projects were not sufficiently  reliable; thus, we did not include the estimated savings amounts in our  report. In addition, we discuss the data\u2019s shortcomings in the report.", "To accomplish the third objective, we obtained and analyzed contract  documentation for each of the seven awarded projects. We also  interviewed officials in charge of the TMF-funded projects within the  Office of the CIO and other appropriate offices at each of the five  agencies about acquisitions related to the awarded projects.

Specifically, the cost estimate should be based on a product-oriented  work breakdown structure that allows a program to track cost and  schedule by defined deliverables, such as hardware or software  components. In addition, all cost-influencing ground rules and  assumptions should be detailed in the estimate\u2019s documentation.", "Well-documented: An estimate should be thoroughly documented;  describe how it was developed; and include source data, clearly  detailed calculations and results, and explanations of why particular  estimating methods and references were chosen. Data should be  traced to their source documents.", "Accurate: An estimate should be based on historical data or actual  experiences on other comparable programs and an assessment of  most likely costs, and be adjusted properly for inflation. In addition,  the estimate should be updated regularly to reflect significant changes  in the program\u2014such as when schedules or other assumptions  change\u2014and actual costs, so that it should always reflect the current  status.", "Credible: An estimate should discuss any limitations of the analysis  because of uncertainty surrounding data or assumptions.
