As one aspect of the requests, you asked that we compare the benefits available to Members of Congress and congressional staff with those available to other groups of employees under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). This report responds to that part of your requests.", "CSRS and FERS are, by far, the two largest retirement programs for federal civilian personnel. In general, CSRS applies to employees who entered federal service before December 31, 1983, and FERS applies to employees who entered after that date. The two programs are very different. CSRS was designed as a \u201cstand-alone\u201d pension program with no supplementation by Social Security or any other source of employment-related retirement income. In fact, CSRS predates the Social Security system by several years.", "FERS was developed in response to the Social Security Amendments of 1983 that extended Social Security coverage to federal civilian employees hired after December 1983. FERS includes (1) a pension plan; (2) a Thrift Savings Plan to which most employees and the government contribute; and (3) Social Security, as a three-part retirement package.", "The Social Security Amendments of 1983 required all Members of Congress to be covered by Social Security on January 1, 1984, regardless of when they entered Congress. Members in CSRS were given the option of being fully covered by both CSRS and Social Security and making the employee contributions required by each or participating in an \u201coffset plan\u201d whereby the Social Security contributions Members made and any Social Security benefits they received from their congressional service would be deducted from their CSRS contributions and benefits, respectively. A similar offset plan was applied to all other employees who entered the government between December 1983, when Social Security coverage began and CSRS was closed to new entrants, and January 1987, when the FERS pension plan was implemented.", "CSRS and the FERS pension plan each have a number of separate provisions for the various employee groups they cover. Differing provisions in each plan apply to Members of Congress, congressional staff, law enforcement officers and firefighters, air traffic controllers, and all other employees.The latter group (which we refer to as \u201cgeneral employees\u201d) constitutes more than 90 percent of all employees covered by the plans.", "Appendixes I and II show all the CSRS and FERS provisions that differ by employee group. The significant differences are highlighted in the next sections. The comparisons do not include several provisions that are the same for all groups, such as disability retirement and annuitant cost-of-living adjustments. Appendixes III and IV illustrate the benefit amounts that are available to each employee group at various ages and years of service.", "We derived the information in this report by reviewing chapters 83 and 84 of title 5 of the U. S. Code (chapter 83 covers CSRS and chapter 84 covers the FERS pension plan) and federal regulations on CSRS and FERS contained in parts 831 through 846 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) specialists on the two retirement systems reviewed the information we developed and made certain suggestions for clarification and/or completeness that we incorporated where appropriate. Our work was done during January through April 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Civil Service Retirement System", "paragraphs": ["The CSRS features that differ by employee group are discussed in the following sections."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility Requirements for Optional Retirement", "paragraphs": ["Members of Congress can retire at younger ages and with fewer years of service than can general employees and congressional staff. General employees and congressional staff are eligible for optional retirement at age 55 with 30 years of service, at age 60 with 20 years, or at age 62 with 5 years. Members can retire at the same age and service combinations but may also retire at age 50 with 20 years and at any age with 25 years. Additionally, Members may retire at age 60 with 10 years of Member service and at age 50 with service in 9 Congresses.", "Law enforcement officers and firefighters may retire at age 50 with 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter. Air traffic controllers can retire at age 50 with 20 years of air traffic controller service or at any age with 25 years of air traffic controller service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retirement Benefit Formulas", "paragraphs": ["The CSRS statute specifies the formulas that will be used in calculating benefit amounts for the various groups. For Members of Congress and congressional staff who have 5 or more years of congressional service, the formula is 2.5 percent of the average annual salaries they earned during their 3 consecutive highest-paid years (known as the \u201chigh 3\u201d) for each year of congressional service. The same benefit formula applies to employees who are federal Claims Court judges, bankruptcy judges, U.S. Magistrates, or judges of the U.S. Court of Military Appeals. For example, the formula provides a benefit of 75 percent of high-3 salary to a Member or congressional staff with 30 years of congressional service. In comparison, the formula for general employees is 1.5 percent of high-3 for each of the first 5 years of service, 1.75 percent for each of the next 5 years of service, and 2 percent for each year of service greater than 10 years. The general employee formula provides a benefit of 56.25 percent of high 3 after 30 years of service.", "The benefit formula for law enforcement officers and firefighters is 2.5 percent of high 3 for each of the first 20 years of service and 2 percent for each year of service greater than 20. Thus, a law enforcement officer or firefighter who retires at age 50 with 20 years of service would receive 50 percent of high 3. After 30 years of service, the benefit would be 70 percent of high 3.", "Air traffic controllers are covered by the general employee benefit formula, but they are guaranteed to receive no less than 50 percent of their high 3 at retirement. To illustrate this point, a controller who retires at age 50 with 20 years of service receives 50 percent of his or her high 3 because the general employee formula would provide only 36.25 percent of high 3 after 20 years of service. At 25 years of service, a controller would still receive 50 percent of high 3 because the general employee formula would provide 46.25 percent. The \u201cbreak-even\u201d point occurs at just under 27 years of service when the general employee formula provides about 50 percent of high 3.", "When Members of Congress retire before age 60, their accrued benefits are reduced. The reduction is one-twelfth of 1 percent for each month (1 percent a year) they are between ages 55 and 60 and one-sixth of 1 percent for each month (2 percent a year) they are younger than age 55. There is no age reduction for any of the other groups covered by CSRS when they meet the optional retirement eligibility requirements. However, the reduction for Members younger than age 60 does not eliminate the overall advantages of their higher benefit formula compared with most other employees. A Member who retires at age 55 with 30 years of service receives a benefit equal to 71.25 percent of high 3 rather than the 75 percent he or she would otherwise receive without the age reduction (1 percent of accrued benefits for each of the 5 years the retiree is younger than age 60). General employees receive 56.25 percent of high 3 at age 55 and 30 years of service. Since the age reduction does not apply to congressional staff, they would receive 75 percent.", "Several groups, including law enforcement officers, firefighters, customs inspectors, and Veteran\u2019s Affairs\u2019 physicians, receive an additional advantage in their benefit calculations that is not afforded to other employee groups. Their high-3 salaries include certain types of premium pay. For example, the high 3 of law enforcement officers includes pay they receive for administratively uncontrollable overtime or availability pay.The high-3 amounts for other groups are limited to basic salaries and do not include any overtime they may have received."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Retirement", "paragraphs": ["In certain circumstances, employees may retire before attaining the requirements for optional retirement or before they intended to retire. For example, general employees might be unable to continue in federal employment because their jobs were abolished or congressional staff might retire involuntarily if the Members of Congress who employ them are not reelected. Also, employees (except congressional staff) might be given the opportunity to voluntarily retire early to save the jobs of younger employees when their agencies are downsizing or transferring functions to other locations.", "CSRS does not include any separate early retirement provisions for Members of Congress. The optional retirement provisions apply if a Member loses an election. However, some of the age and service eligibility requirements available to Members for optional retirement are the same as the early retirement eligibility requirements for other employees under CSRS.", "General employees and congressional staff may retire early if they are age 50 with 20 years of service or any age with 25 years of service. Benefit amounts are reduced by one-sixth of 1 percent for each month (2 percent a year) they are younger than age 55. As discussed previously, Members may retire optionally at age 50 with 20 years of service, at any age with 25 years, or at age 50 with service in 9 Congresses (18 years). Similar to general employees, when Members retire under these provisions, their benefits are reduced by 2 percent for each year they are younger than age 55. However, unlike other employees, Members\u2019 benefits are also reduced by 1 percent for each year they are between ages 55 and 60. Members who resign or are expelled from Congress cannot receive immediate benefits unless they are at least age 55 with 30 years of service, age 62 with 5 years of service, or age 60 with 10 years of Member service.", "There are no special provisions for law enforcement officers, firefighters, or air traffic controllers to retire before meeting their age and service requirements for optional retirement.

Deferred benefits for all employees, other than Members, are payable at age 62. Members may receive deferred benefits at age 62 if they had at least 5 years of federal service, but they are also eligible for deferred benefits at age 60 if they had at least 10 years of Member service or at age 50 if they had 20 years of federal service of which at least 10 were Member service (with the same benefit reductions as applied to Member optional retirements before age 60).", "Members of Congress receive another advantage under the deferred retirement provisions that is not available to any other employee group. CSRS provides benefits to the survivors of former Members who die in the interim between their separation from federal service and the age at which their deferred annuities would have commenced. Other former employees do not have this survivor protection. If they die before deferred benefit payments begin, their survivors are not eligible for survivor benefits.

For general employees, about 41 years and 11 months of service are necessary to accrue benefits equal to 80 percent of high 3. Congressional staff benefits reach 80 percent after 32 years of congressional service. The same maximum benefit applies to law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers, but, because of their mandatory retirement requirements (see pp. 8-9), these employees generally cannot work long enough to earn benefits of 80 percent of high 3.", "Maximum benefits for Members of Congress are determined somewhat differently, and this difference is more favorable to Members. Their maximum benefit (reached after 32 years of service) is 80 percent of the greater of their high 3 or final salary as a Member of Congress. If a Member leaves Congress to accept an appointive position, the final salary of that position is used as the basis for the maximum benefit if it is greater than the former Member\u2019s high-3 salary or final salary as a Member."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reemployment of Annuitants", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, retirees are reemployed by the government. The CSRS provisions covering reemployment of retired Members of Congress are significantly different from the provisions covering the reemployment of other retirees.", "In general, retirees (other than retired Members of Congress) who are reemployed by the government continue to receive their annuities, but their salaries are reduced by the amount of the annuity. A reemployed annuitant does not contribute to the retirement fund unless the individual chooses to have such deductions withheld. Reemployment for less than a year does not earn additional retirement benefits. However, annuitants reemployed for a year or more in positions subject to the retirement system are entitled to a supplemental annuity upon subsequent separation if they make retroactive contributions or already had deductions withheld. The supplemental annuity is based on the salary received during the reemployment period. Reemployed annuitants who serve for 5 years or more may, upon separation, elect to pay their retirement contributions retroactively (if they had not elected to have them withheld from pay) and have their annuities recomputed using their total service and new high-3 salary.", "When retired Members of Congress are reemployed in either elective or appointive positions, their annuities are suspended, and they again become covered by the system as if they had not retired. Reemployed Member retirees make contributions in the amount required for the positions they hold.
