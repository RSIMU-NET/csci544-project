Explosives serve many functions in  nuclear weapons because they can deliver energy quickly and precisely.  To perform these precise functions, explosives for use in nuclear  weapons must be designed and manufactured to exacting specifications.  The Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors ceased producing  some key explosives used in nuclear weapon components in the early  1990s. DOE\u2019s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and its  contractor-operated sites have recently resumed their production and  testing of some explosives in support of ongoing life extension programs  (LEP) and modernization efforts for nuclear weapons. Each of these  efforts involves replacing or modernizing explosive components. Many of  the facilities that support NNSA\u2019s LEPs and modernization efforts\u2014and  the related activities to develop and produce explosives\u2014were built in the  1940s and 1950s, making them costly and difficult to maintain. The age  and condition of some of these facilities also pose safety issues if  mitigation actions are not implemented, according to NNSA documents.  In this context, in December 2018, NNSA released its Defense Programs  Strategic Plan for Energetic Materials (strategic plan), which provided a  framework for addressing challenges related to managing explosive  materials and related activities, such as NNSA\u2019s aging infrastructure, as  well as strategies to mitigate them.", "A Senate committee report accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a provision for us to  review NNSA\u2019s high explosive capabilities specific to nuclear weapons.

Findings from these site visits are not generalizable to all sites, but they  provide illustrative examples of explosives activities at some NNSA sites.  We also gathered information on the workforce at NNSA sites that is  engaged in explosives activities. We interviewed relevant contractor  representatives to ascertain the source of the workforce information they  provided and to understand any limitations or caveats associated with it.

Scientists  first synthesized TATB in 1888 but did not  initially recognize it as an explosive. In 1966,  Los Alamos National Laboratory developed  the industrial method for synthesizing TATB.  From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, two  domestic manufacturers supplied TATB to  DOD and NNSA. However, when the Cold  War ended and a U.S. nuclear test  moratorium began, the demand for TATB  declined, and both manufacturers ceased  production by 1993. DOD then acquired TATB  from a U.K.-based firm until its plant closed in  2005. Beginning in 2007, DOD and NNSA  collaborated to re-establish a manufacturing  capability for TATB in the United States.  Specifically, DOD\u2019s Holston Army Ammunition  Plant (Holston), which is located in Kingsport,  Tennessee, began producing TATB in 2014.

Under the new enterprise-wide approach, NNSA has taken  several steps to centralize management at an enterprise level and to  coordinate explosives activities across its sites. Specifically:  In May 2018, NNSA established the Energetic Materials Enterprise  Manager (enterprise manager) position to help coordinate NNSA\u2019s  explosives activities.

For example, Livermore scientists said they are  conducting research to synthesize new TATB that is uniquely suited to  NNSA\u2019s needs. According to NNSA contractor representatives, the  synthesis process will be refined until it can be replicated by Holston for  the W80-4 LEP. Additionally, Los Alamos scientists are researching the  formulation process with legacy TATB for the B61-12 main charges. The  chemical formulation of binder material used in the past has slightly  changed, affecting the structural strength of formulated TATB. Without  the proper strength, this formulated explosive cannot be pressed  effectively, according to contractor representatives. Sandia is also  working to re-establish the THKP production process.", "NNSA is also working to address the challenge of lost recipes by  developing a comprehensive master list for explosive materials. The list  tracks information such as the suppliers involved and specific production  challenges. According to NNSA and contractor officials, collecting and  sharing such information across the sites related to explosive production  processes, specifications, and performance will help prevent lost recipes  in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fragile Supplier Base", "paragraphs": ["Even if the sites can replicate lost recipes for explosive materials, NNSA\u2019s  supplier base for those materials is fragile. As previously reported and  according to NNSA documentation, finding suppliers willing and able to  provide required parts and materials can be difficult. Contractor  representatives told us that this difficulty arises because of the small  quantities of explosive parts and materials NNSA procures, the irregular  nature of NNSA\u2019s procurements, and the agency\u2019s exacting performance  requirements. For example, neutron generators contain explosive parts  that Sandia orders irregularly, in batches numbering only in the hundreds.  These parts have such exacting requirements for size and timing that  they are hand-made under microscopes. Sandia contractor  representatives explained that sometimes the laboratory\u2019s part and  material orders may represent only 1 to 3 percent of a company\u2019s total  production.", "To address this challenge, NNSA is working to purchase materials more  consistently to ensure that companies can rely on NNSA as a steady  customer and be comfortable working to meet NNSA\u2019s exacting  requirements. Contractor representatives said that ensuring consistency  in production can help maintain the expertise needed to avoid having to  reconstitute a specialized process, which can be costly. For example, the  effort to restart TATB synthesis and formulation cost approximately $13  million and added 3-1/2 years to the original TATB production schedule,  according to Los Alamos contractor representatives. Contractor  representatives at Pantex and Los Alamos said that they plan to support  continuous production of synthesized TATB and formulated explosives at  Holston in the future to avoid delays in restarting production (see  sidebar).", "A Fragile Supplier Base for Other Material   The National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA) has identified challenges with a  fragile supplier base for other specialized  materials that are used in explosives-related  experiments and research. For example, Los  Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos) in  New Mexico requires highly specialized test  vessels to conduct essential nuclear weapons  research. Specifically, Los Alamos\u2019s Dual-Axis  Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility  (DARHT) uses X-ray machines to record  three-dimensional interior images of mock  nuclear materials that are imploded using  explosives. The exploding components are  contained in steel vessels. This facility is  unique because it is the world\u2019s most powerful  X-ray machine for analysis of these  implosions (called hydrodynamic tests). The  vessels used at DARHT are made of  specialized steel that does not need to be  heat-treated during repairs, allowing the  laboratory to easily repair them after explosive  testing. There is currently a small supplier  base (domestic and international) for  manufacturing these vessels. Los Alamos  contractor representatives are concerned with  vendor availability, capability, and willingness  to produce vessels because of the small  number the laboratory has purchased in the  past\u2014they currently have seven operational  vessels. Also, contractor representatives said  they are concerned that the workforce which  knows how to create this specialized steel is  nearing retirement. To help ensure a  continued future supply of the vessels, Los  Alamos is working with Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory in California and the  Nevada National Security Site, which use  similar vessels, to develop a multi-year  procurement plan to encourage suppliers to  continue to produce the specialized steel  used in their manufacture.", "NNSA supplier challenges are complicated further when a supplier is  foreign or there is only one domestic supplier. According to NNSA  documentation, using a foreign supplier may leave NNSA vulnerable to a  potential national security risk. Even when the only supplier is domestic,  single-point failure is a concern should that supplier delay or cease  production, according to contractor representatives. NNSA officials  provided an example involving Holston, NNSA\u2019s sole supplier of TATB.  According to NNSA officials and contractor representatives, Holston also  serves DOD customers that order far larger quantities of explosives, and  Holston is required to prioritize those customers\u2019 orders using DOD  procurement priority ratings, which may mean that NNSA orders are  delayed. For example, Livermore placed an order for the W80-4 main  charge explosives at Holston that was to be fulfilled by March 2019, but  that order was delayed while the plant worked to finish a DOD order with  a higher-priority rating. In addition to this delay, Livermore\u2019s order will be  further delayed because Holston had an explosive incident in January  2019 and ceased operations for 3 weeks, according to Livermore and  DOD contractor representatives. As a result of both these delays, the  W80-4 LEP will have to postpone a hydrodynamic test and other studies,  complicating an already tight design and development schedule. This will  delay the W80-4 LEP at least 2 months, according to Livermore officials.", "To minimize the potential for future production delays at Holston, NNSA is  working to elevate the priority of all its orders for explosives. Some DOD  nuclear weapon delivery platforms have the highest-priority DOD rating,  and NNSA officials said they have received permission from DOD to  apply this rating to the DOE explosives orders for the nuclear warheads  associated with those delivery platforms, including explosive orders for  the B61-12 LEP. NNSA officials said they cannot currently use the  highest-priority rating for orders associated with the W80-4 LEP because  the delivery platform for that LEP does not have the highest-priority  rating. NNSA officials are working with DOD and DOE attorneys to  obtain permission for using DOD\u2019s highest-priority rating. A contractor  representative at Livermore said that in addition to NNSA\u2019s efforts, the Air  Force is working separately to obtain permission to use the highest- priority rating for this delivery platform. If the Air Force is successful,  NNSA could use that delivery platform\u2019s new high-priority rating for its  W80-4 LEP orders. The Livermore contractor representative said that  they believe the Air Force will receive permission to use the highest- priority rating before NNSA does.", "In situations where a supplier cannot or will not produce a specialized  material or related component, NNSA is exploring options for producing  those materials or components itself. NNSA officials said that they are  conducting an analysis of alternatives to meet synthesis, formulation, and  production requirements to be completed by the spring of 2019. The  analysis will include an option for in-house production of TATB at Pantex.  NNSA documentation indicates that Pantex could independently produce  the TATB needed for current and future LEPs and modernization efforts  with a substantial investment, exact figures for which may be reported  upon completion of the analysis of alternatives. Similarly, contractor  representatives from Sandia said that in the absence of qualified  suppliers, they are working to produce explosive materials, such as THKP  as discussed above."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Officials and Contractor Representatives Have Identified Infrastructure and Workforce Challenges and Are Taking Actions to Address Them, but NNSA Has Not Fully Addressed the Accuracy of Infrastructure Data", "paragraphs": ["NNSA has also identified challenges with its explosives infrastructure,  infrastructure data, and workforce. Specifically, NNSA\u2019s infrastructure is  aging and deteriorating, some infrastructure data are inaccurate, and  some storage areas are near capacity. In addition, recruiting and training  qualified staff have presented a challenge to NNSA. As we have  previously reported, these challenges are shared across the nuclear  security enterprise and are not confined to explosives activities. NNSA  is taking several actions to address these challenges, as described  below, but data inaccuracies remain related to NNSA\u2019s explosives-related  assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Infrastructure Is Aging and Deteriorating", "paragraphs": ["According to NNSA documentation, no mission risk is greater than the  state of the agency\u2019s aging infrastructure.

Contractor representatives told us that such contamination has occurred.  For example, Pantex contractor representatives said that batches of  explosives have been contaminated in its main formulation building by  rust falling from the rafters and grass blowing through cracks in the walls.  Similarly, Los Alamos contractor representatives said that detonator  subassemblies have been rejected at the laboratory because of  contamination from foreign debris, such as dust particles that enter  through cracks in exterior doors.", "In addition, older facilities were not built to modern safety standards and  pose risks to explosives activities and employees, according to contractor  representatives and NNSA documents. At Los Alamos, the design of  several older facilities is insufficient to meet current needs, which  negatively affects both productivity and safety. For example, the Los  Alamos\u2019s High Explosives Chemistry Laboratory is a 1950s era building  that is difficult to adapt to modern instrumentation, and electrical and  other system failures cause approximately 20 percent downtime, according to contractor representatives. This building is also under a state  of continuous limited operation because the laboratory must work under a  decreased net explosive limit to keep employees safe while handling  explosive materials because the facility lacks adequate blowout walls,  according to contractor representatives. Contractor representatives at  Los Alamos said that the decreased explosive limits in this facility have  hampered their productivity levels. Contractor representatives at Pantex  stated that the intrusion of water in key facilities poses electrocution risks,  can damage expensive equipment, and can affect production because of  downtime when explosives activities must be suspended because of  severe weather. Further, we observed facilities at Pantex with water leaks  in the roof and floor; some of these facilities house expensive equipment  that must be stored under plastic sheeting to prevent water damage. One  such facility is Pantex\u2019s Analytics and Chemistry Laboratory, built in 1943  and shown in figures 4 and 5.", "NNSA and its sites have taken some actions to address this infrastructure  challenge. For example, Los Alamos plans to replace its High Explosives  Chemistry Laboratory by 2026, and Pantex recently constructed a new  building to replace an aging pressing facility and has plans to begin  construction on a new analytical laboratory and a formulation building in  the 2020s. NNSA documentation states that the new pressing facility will  improve operational safety and security thereby enhancing the quality and  efficiency of operations. Pantex\u2019s planned analytical laboratory and  formulation buildings, however, will not be completed in time to support  the currently scheduled B61-12 LEP and W88 alteration modernization  effort.

NNSA policy and the FIMS  user\u2019s guide state that NNSA and sites should review and update the  capabilities, or programmatic mission(s) associated with each asset, such  as being explosives-related, every 5 years, or more frequently if mission  requirements change or there are changes in an asset\u2019s physical  condition or use. However, 8 of the 22 randomly selected assets from the  four sites that we observed contained data in FIMS that were inaccurate  because either the information on an asset was out of date or the asset  should never have been listed as explosives-related. Some contractor  representatives told us that they did not understand why some of their  sites\u2019 assets had been characterized as primary assets related to the high  explosives mission. For example, an inert storage closet at Pantex and a  tool shed at Livermore were labeled as primary explosives-related assets,  but according to contractor representatives, they can no longer be used to  store explosives because they do not meet appropriate safety standards.  Figure 6 illustrates the inert storage at Pantex, which officials said had not  been used for any explosives operations for at least 20 years, despite  \u201cexplosives storage\u201d labeling on the door, but was still characterized as a  primary explosives-related asset. However, according to NNSA officials,  NNSA was, at the time of our review, in the process of revising guidance  on how to associate capabilities with assets. The contractor  representatives may not have been aware of the initial guidance the asset  was characterized under or of the change underway at the time of our site  visit.", "In other cases, contractor representatives told us that the asset name did  not indicate its current use. For example, FIMS data on explosives-related  assets at Los Alamos has a \u201cplastics building\u201d that had not been used for  manufacturing and assembling plastics for 20 years. Although it currently  houses explosives-related work, the building\u2019s name in FIMS had not  been updated. Additionally, Los Alamos\u2019s FIMS data indicated that the  site had a \u201cday room\u201d that to contractor representatives\u2019 knowledge had  never been used for any explosives activities although its purpose has  changed over time.", "We found additional inaccuracies related to various measures of  explosives-related assets reported in FIMS. For example, we found at  least 94 erroneous entries on the gross square footage of the 1,266  assets identified as having some type of explosives-related capability.", "For example, FIMS data indicated that a road at Livermore, a bunker at  Sandia, and an asset named \u201crecreational/fitness\u201d at Pantex were 3, 1,  and 2 gross square feet, respectively. The data listed replacement values  of at least $1 million for each of these assets. Los Alamos\u2019s data  contained similar errors, such as electrical cables recorded as measuring  zero square feet.", "NNSA officials and contractor representatives identified potential causes  for inaccuracies in the FIMS data. For example, contractor  representatives who work on explosives activities do not enter explosives- related asset information in FIMS, according to NNSA officials and  contractor representatives. Instead, FIMS administrators, who manage  information on infrastructure across NNSA sites, said they update FIMS  using information that subject matter experts or building managers  provide to them, typically in an annual data call. FIMS administrators may  therefore not be aware of information that is dated or otherwise incorrect  for explosives-related assets. In addition, entering information in certain  data fields in FIMS was difficult for assets that were not buildings,  according to one FIMS administrator. For example, piping and other  utilities may be replaced or updated in sections over time, and it can be  difficult to know which date to record for age in FIMS. Because our review  included only a limited sample of explosives-related assets, we could not  determine the full extent of the FIMS data inaccuracies.", "NNSA managers use data from FIMS for planning purposes on  infrastructure modernization decisions. According to NNSA officials, data  from FIMS feeds into other databases that are used to inform  infrastructure funding decisions, such as developing the Integrated  Priority List that helps NNSA determine the most critical infrastructure  modernization projects. While NNSA relies on these data to make  planning and funding decisions, our observations of explosives-related  assets shows that these data may not be useful in informing the agencies\u2019  infrastructure modernization decisions. Federal internal control standards  state that managers should make decisions using quality information that  is appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a  timely basis. By taking steps to improve the accuracy of FIMS data\u2014 such as by reviewing and updating information about associations of  assets with their primary and secondary programmatic missions, ensuring  that those who provide asset information to FIMS administrators  understand the data they need to provide, and clarifying how to  accurately enter information in FIMS for assets that are not buildings\u2014 NNSA would have more reasonable assurance that officials, contractor  representatives, and the enterprise manager have the quality information  necessary to support management decisions on explosives-related  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Storage Areas for Explosives Are Filled to or Near Capacity", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s requirements for explosives storage limit the amount and type of  explosives that can be stored in a single location, since certain explosives  may react when stored together. Explosives must be properly stored  throughout their life cycles, from the synthesis of raw explosives to their  use in weapon assembly or testing. According to a senior NNSA official  and site contractor representatives, some sites are running out of space  where they can safely store explosives. As contractor representatives  from Pantex told us and we observed on our site visit, bunkers for storing  explosives are filled to or near capacity, especially for storage in high- security areas. According to contractor representatives, this is  problematic because Pantex has the greatest need of all NNSA sites for  explosives storage because of its role in producing explosives, receiving  and holding explosive parts from across the nuclear security enterprise  prior to weapon assembly, and assembling and disassembling weapons.  Contractor representatives from Los Alamos also voiced concern about  being near their capacity to store detonator cable assemblies and other  explosives awaiting shipment for installation in weapons or for testing.", "NNSA officials and contractor representatives said that they are tracking  the shortage of sufficient explosives storage and in some cases have  plans to expand current capacity. Los Alamos contractor representatives  also said that they are moving forward with constructing a small staging  facility that will be collocated with their detonator production facility. It is  expected to cost less than $5 million so it will not affect larger line item  infrastructure projects. Contractor representatives at Pantex explained  that although some storage areas have been identified for replacement,  they are, as yet, unfunded projects.

However, Pantex contractor representatives  indicated that as of November 2018, they had 172 FTEs on board. A  major recruitment challenge is competition from industry. Contractor  representatives at multiple sites told us that they often compete with large  corporations and industries in the local area that offer well-paying jobs for  qualified new staff, such as for engineers. For example, site contractor  representatives told us that Los Alamos and Sandia compete with  Facebook in Albuquerque to attract qualified staff; and Pantex competes  with various oil and gas companies in Texas. To address this challenge,  contractor representatives from Pantex have recently expanded outreach  to local colleges and universities, and NNSA has held job fairs to attract  new staff.", "Lengthy training and clearance processes that are required for  specialized explosives work present another challenge. Pantex  representatives said recent graduates are required to undergo on-the-job  training that can take years before they are ready to safely engage in  certain explosives activities. NNSA officials and contractor  representatives said that this training challenge is exacerbated by the  delays in processing security clearances. NNSA contractor  representatives said that some new hires have waited more than a year,  and some more than 2 years, to receive clearances to conduct required  work or training. In December 2017, we identified delays in obtaining  personnel security clearances as a government-wide risk. We also  added this issue to our March 2019 High-Risk List. To mitigate this  challenge, contractor representatives from Pantex said that they are  hiring students before they finish college so that security clearances can  be granted by the time students are ready to begin their first day on the  job or at least closer to that time. Los Alamos has decided to hire and  train individuals without clearances, who must wear red vests and be  escorted at all times while their clearances are finalized. We observed  numerous workers in this temporary and escorted status during our site  visit. Contractor representatives at Livermore said that they also use  escorts for new staff without clearances.

According to a December 2018 Los Alamos  document, pressing operations had resumed at the facility. Although the  cause of the incident is still unclear, it provided an opportunity to make  safety improvements in the facility at Los Alamos, according to contractor  representatives.

When developing the strategic plan, NNSA shared a draft with  members of the coordinating committee and incorporated their  comments to ensure that their interests and expectations were met.", "Assessing external and internal forces helps managers anticipate  future challenges and make adjustments before potential problems  become crises. For example, external forces (e.g., emerging  technological trends and new statutory requirements) and internal  forces (e.g., culture, management practices, and business processes)  may influence the program\u2019s ability to achieve its goals. When  developing the strategic plan, NNSA officials and coordinating  committee members considered external and internal forces. For  example, the officials and members discussed the availability of  explosives from external suppliers, such as Holston, compared to the  potential costs or challenges related to internal NNSA production of  explosives.", "Covering at least a 4-year period, while making adjustments as  needed to reflect significant changes to the operating environment, is  also a key strategic planning practice. The strategic plan covers more  than 4 years of explosives activities. For example, there is a  performance goal to re-establish a reliable THKP supply by 2024.

The strategic plan does not clearly  identify a mission statement but includes an overarching \u201cstrategy to  ensure the availability of energetic materials and products for the  stockpile.\u201d When asked to identify the energetics mission statement,  the two contractor representatives who led the development of the  strategic plan told us that they consider this \u201cstrategy\u201d to be the  energetics mission. However, a strategy cannot be a mission, since a  strategy is how a mission may be achieved.", "Long-term strategic goals and objectives, strategies, and  performance goals. There are several interrelated elements on long- term strategic goals, objectives, strategies, and performance goals,  according to leading strategic planning practices. These include that  long-term strategic goals and objectives should specify how an  agency will carry out its mission and explain what results are expected  from the program. The strategic plan includes four long-term strategic  goals for meeting its mission, some strategies for achieving its goals,  and some performance goals to assess progress related to ensuring  the availability of explosives. They are also logically linked to each  other. For example, the strategic plan\u2019s goal to sustain and modernize  the energetics infrastructure relates to the strategic plan\u2019s strategy to  eliminate facilities that are inadequate, too costly to maintain, or no  longer needed. However, we found that responsibilities for achieving  the strategic plan\u2019s four goals are not clearly assigned within NNSA,  and the four goals are not consistently quantifiable. For example, the  third goal is to \u201cmanage the energetics supply chain,\u201d but the strategic  plan does not specify who is responsible for achieving this goal within  NNSA. Further, this long-term strategic goal is not quantifiable  because it describes a general process and does not define the  expected results, which may make it difficult for NNSA to assess  progress in meeting the goal.", "According to leading strategic planning practices, strategies should be  specific enough to allow an assessment of whether they will help  achieve those goals, such as by describing the resources needed,  including the staff responsible to achieve a program\u2019s goals and  objectives. We found that the strategic plan contains several  strategies for achieving goals, but some of them are not specific  enough to clearly identify the types of resources required, such as the  parties responsible for achieving them. For example, under the goal of  managing the energetics supply chain, there is a strategy to \u201cplan,  track and assess the energetics strategic posture,\u201d but the strategic  plan does not specify what is meant by the energetics strategic  posture or who is responsible for undertaking these actions. This  strategy is also limited because it does not describe the resources  needed to achieve the broader goal.", "According to leading strategic planning practices, performance goals  should be used to assess progress toward long-term goals and should  include (1) the specific activities within the program that will be  assessed for performance and (2) the level of performance to be  achieved for each measure. We found that the strategic plan has 50  performance goals, most of which were quantifiable\u2014or able to be  assessed for performance or progress. However, some were not  quantifiable, such as to \u201cenhance or advance energetics formulations  for additive manufacturing.\u201d This performance goal also does not set  milestones, such as a time frame for completion, or staff assigned to  achieve it, contrary to leading strategic planning practices. Further,  the level of performance for some goals was not fully developed. For  example, the performance goal \u201cto reduce substandard mission- critical facilities below 10 percent\u201d does not clarify whether the goal is  to reduce the current number of inadequate and substandard facilities  by 10 percent (a change of about 50 facilities) or reduce the total  number of inadequate and substandard facilities to be less than 10  percent of all facilities (a change of about 500 facilities). This  performance goal also does not set time frames for measuring  performance or list responsible parties associated with it. Another  performance goal that was not fully developed is to \u201cmanage the  energetics supply chain,\u201d which falls under the long-term strategic  goal of \u201csustaining and modernizing the infrastructure.\u201d In addition,  this performance goal is identical to a long-term strategic goal in the  strategic plan titled \u201cmanage the energetics supply chain.\u201d A  performance goal should not replicate a strategic goal, since long- term strategic goals are broader in nature than performance goals.  Moreover, this particular performance goal is not quantifiable, does  not set a time frame for completion, and does not list a responsible  party to carry out specific activities to achieve the goal.", "External factors. According to leading strategic planning practices,  external factors that could significantly affect achievement of the  strategic goals, such as economic trends or actions by Congress,  state and federal agencies, or other entities, should be identified. The  strategic plan identifies some external factors that could significantly  affect the achievement of strategic goals. Specifically, the strategic  plan notes that DOD\u2019s demand for explosives from Holston could  affect NNSA\u2019s ability to achieve its goals. According to NNSA officials  and documents, DOD\u2019s demand for explosives is increasing, and  Holston is already struggling to meet DOD\u2019s needs. According to  Holston contractor representatives, DOD is expanding Holston\u2019s  production capabilities for HMX, research development explosive  (RDX), and insensitive munitions explosive (IMX) which when  completed will relieve pressure on TATB production. In addition, the  strategic plan identifies challenges to its supplier base, such as the  difficulty of sourcing explosive materials from non-U.S. suppliers and  that the small size of NNSA\u2019s orders provides limited economic  incentive for commercial vendors. However, the strategic plan does  not identify other external factors that could significantly affect the  achievement of strategic goals, such as actions taken or not taken by  Congress. Specifically, modernizing the explosives infrastructure will  require appropriations for the significant capital investment needed,  but the uncertainty of future appropriations in a challenging fiscal  environment is an external factor not identified in the strategic plan. In  addition, the strategic plan does not acknowledge that other NNSA  programs may compete for funds or affect infrastructure  modernization priorities at a given site.", "NNSA officials, including the enterprise manager, stated that they are  aware that the strategic plan for energetic materials has limitations, such  as performance goals that are not specific or are difficult to quantify.  NNSA officials said that they released the strategic plan quickly as it was  the first of its kind for explosives activities, and they believed the  explosives community would receive the most benefit it if it was published  as soon as possible, though it was not fully complete. Further, they said  that they intend to revise the strategic plan in the next year or so. As  NNSA revises its strategic plan for energetic materials, including fully  developed elements of an effective plan\u2014such as a clear mission  statement and quantifiable performance goals that set time frames for  completion and list responsible parties who will carry out specific activities  for all strategic goals\u2014would help NNSA make the strategic plan useful in  measuring goal achievement and assessing accountability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NNSA is undertaking an extensive, multifaceted effort to sustain and  modernize U.S. nuclear weapons, and explosives are essential to the  functioning of these weapons. Five NNSA sites conduct a range of  interdependent activities to design and produce explosives. NNSA has  identified several challenges in carrying out these activities and is taking  actions to address them. For example, NNSA officials and contractor  representatives identified challenges related to producing highly  specialized materials and are working to re-establish their supply.  However, NNSA managers may be relying on inaccurate FIMS data on  infrastructure related to explosives activities to make modernization  decisions, because we found a number of inaccuracies in FIMS data on  explosives activities. NNSA officials and contractor representatives  identified a few potential causes for these inaccuracies; however,  because our review included only a limited sample of explosives-related  assets, we could not determine the full extent of the FIMS data  inaccuracies. According to NNSA officials, NNSA has taken some initial  steps to revise guidance, which we find encouraging as these revisions  may help improve accuracy of FIMS data. By taking additional steps to  improve the accuracy of FIMS data\u2014such as reviewing and updating  information about associations of assets with their primary and secondary  programmatic missions, ensuring that those who provide asset  information to FIMS administrators understand the data they need to  provide, and clarifying how to accurately enter information in FIMS for  assets that are not buildings\u2014NNSA would have more reasonable  assurance that officials, contractor representatives, and the enterprise  manager have the quality information necessary to support management  decisions on explosives-related activities.", "In addition, the strategic plan for energetic materials\u2014which represents a  positive step toward managing explosives in a forward-looking,  enterprise-wide approach\u2014does not discuss three of the significant  challenges that NNSA officials and contractor representatives identified  related to explosives activities. NNSA officials said that they are planning  to revise the strategic plan in 2020 but did not state that they would  incorporate data quality, workforce, or safety challenges. As the agency  revises its strategic plan for energetic materials, by discussing these  challenges and actions planned to address them, as appropriate, or  documenting the rationale for why the challenges were not included,  NNSA would have better assurance that it is effectively managing  challenges that present risks to achieving its objectives.", "The strategic plan for energetic materials also does not contain fully  developed elements that we have previously reported that effective  strategic plans should include, such as a fully developed mission  statement and performance goals that are quantifiable, set time frames  for completion, and list responsible parties to carry out specific activities.
