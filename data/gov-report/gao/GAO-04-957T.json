Among current CIOs and former agency IT executives, views were mixed on whether it was important for the CIO to have responsibility for each of the 13 areas and a direct reporting relationship with the agency head. In addition, current CIOs come from a wide variety of professional and educational backgrounds and, since the enactment of the legislation establishing this position, the permanent CIOs who had completed their time in office had a median tenure of about 2 years. Their average time in office, however, was less than the 3 to 5 years that both current CIOs and former agency IT executives most commonly cited as the amount of time needed for a CIO to be effective. Too short of a tenure can reduce a CIOs' effectiveness and ability to address major challenges, including implementing effective IT management and obtaining sufficient and relevant resources. Both the Congress and the federal agencies can take various actions to address GAO's findings. First, as the Congress holds hearings on and introduces legislation related to information and technology management, there may be an opportunity to consider the results of this review and whether the existing statutory framework offers the most effective structure for CIOs' responsibilities and reporting relationships. Second, agencies can use the guidance GAO has issued over the past few years to address, for example, agencies' IT management and human capital challenges. Finally, agencies can also employ such mechanisms as human capital flexibilities to help reduce CIO turnover or to mitigate its effect."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to join in today\u2019s hearing on federal agency  chief information officers (CIO). Our work and the work of others have  shown that the federal government has had long-standing information and  technology management problems. Various laws have been enacted to  improve the government\u2019s performance in this area. For example, the  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 requires agency heads to designate CIOs to lead  reforms to help control system development risks, better manage  technology spending, and achieve real, measurable improvements in  agency performance through better management of information resources.", "At your request, I will summarize our report being issued today that  focuses on the status of federal CIOs, including their responsibilities and  reporting relationships, professional backgrounds and tenure, and what  they viewed as their major challenges. In addition, I will discuss what can  be done to address our findings. In performing our work at 27 major  federal departments and agencies (23 entities identified in 31 United States  Code 901, the Department of Homeland Security, and the 3 military  services), we initially collected information using a data collection  instrument and subsequently interviewed each of the CIOs who were in  place at the time of our review. We also conducted two panel discussions  with former agency information technology (IT) executives, including  former CIOs, that addressed their experiences and challenges, and we held  a series of discussions with our Executive Council on Information  Management and Technology, which is composed of noted IT experts from  the public and private sectors and from academia.

Moreover, one of the panels of former agency IT  executives suggested that not all 13 areas were equally important to CIOs.  A few of the former agency IT executives even called some of the areas  relating to information management a distraction from the CIO\u2019s primary  responsibilities.

All but a few of the agencies complied  with this requirement. The other significant duties reported by some CIOs  generally related to other administrative or management areas, such as  procurement and human capital.

In the other 8  agencies, the CIOs stated that they reported instead to another senior  official, such as a deputy secretary, under secretary, or assistant secretary.", "The views of current CIOs and former agency IT executives about whether  it is important for the CIO to report to the agency head were mixed. For  example, of the 8 CIOs who did not report directly to their agency heads,  (1) 3 stated it was important or critical, (2) 2 stated it was not important,  (3) two stated it was generally important but that the current reporting  structure at their agencies worked well, and (4) 1 stated it was very  important that a CIO report to at least a deputy secretary. In contrast, 15 of  the 19 CIOs who reported to their agency heads stated that this reporting  relationship was important. However, 8 of the 19 CIOs who said they had  a direct reporting relationship with the agency head noted that they also  reported to another senior executive, usually the deputy secretary or  under secretary for management, on an operational basis. Finally,  members of our Executive Council on Information Management and  Technology told us that what is most critical is for the CIO to report to a  top level official.

Both of these factors can significantly  influence whether a CIO is likely to be successful. First, the background of  the current CIOs varied in that they had previously worked in the  government, the private sector, or academia, and they had a mix of  technical and management experience. Virtually all of them had work  experience and/or educational backgrounds in IT or IT-related fields. For  example, 12 current agency CIOs had previously served in a CIO or deputy  CIO capacity.

When asked how long a CIO needed to  stay in office to be effective, the most common response of current CIOs  and former agency IT executives was 3 to 5 years. Between February 10,  l996 and March 1, 2004, only about 35 percent of the permanent CIOs who  had completed their time in office reportedly had stayed in office for a  minimum of 3 years. The gap between actual time in office and the time  needed to be effective is consistent with the views of many agency CIOs,  who believed that the turnover rate was high and that the political  environment, the pay differentials between the public and private sectors,  and the challenges that CIOs face contributed to this rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency CIOs Face Major Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Current CIOs reported that they faced major challenges in fulfilling their  duties. In particular, two challenges were cited by over 80 percent of the  CIOs: implementing effective information technology management and  obtaining sufficient and relevant resources. This indicates that CIOs view  IT governance processes, funding, and human capital as critical to their  success. Other common challenges they cited were communicating and  collaborating internally and externally and managing change. Effectively  tackling these reported challenges can improve the likelihood of a CIO\u2019s  success. The challenges the CIOs identified were as follows:  IT Management. Leading organizations execute their information  technology management responsibilities reliably and efficiently. A little  over 80 percent of the CIOs reported that they faced one or more  challenges related to implementing effective IT management practices at  their agencies. This is not surprising given that, as we have previously  reported, the government has not always successfully executed the IT  management areas that were most frequently cited as challenges by the  CIOs\u2014information security, enterprise architecture, investment  management, and e-gov.", "Sufficient and Relevant Resources. One key element in ensuring an  agency\u2019s information and technology success is having adequate resources  available. Virtually all agency CIOs cited resources, both in dollars and  staff, as major challenges. The funding issues cited generally concerned  the development and implementation of agency IT budgets and whether  certain IT projects, programs, or operations were being adequately funded.", "We have previously reported that the way agency initiatives are originated  can create funding challenges that are not found in the private sector. For  example, certain information systems may be mandated or legislated, so  the agency does not have the flexibility to decide whether to pursue them.  Additionally, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the funding levels  that may be available from year to year. The government also faces long- standing and widely recognized challenges in maintaining a high-quality IT  workforce. In 1994 and 2001, we reported the importance that leading  organizations placed on making sure they had the right mix of skills in  their IT workforce. About 70 percent of the agency CIOs reported on a  number of substantial IT human capital challenges, including, in some  cases, the need for additional staff. Other challenges included recruiting,  retention, training and development, and succession planning.", "Communicating and Collaborating. Our prior work has shown the  importance of communication and collaboration, both within an agency  and with its external partners. For example, one of the critical success  factors we identified in our CIO guide focuses on the CIO\u2019s ability to  establish his or her organization as a central player in the enterprise. Ten  agency CIOs reported that communication and collaboration were  challenges. Examples of internal communication and collaboration  challenges included (1) cultivating, nurturing, and maintaining  partnerships and alliances while producing results in the best interest of  the enterprise and (2) establishing supporting governance structures that  ensure two-way communication with the agency head and effective  communication with the business part of the organization and component  entities. Other CIOs cited activities associated with communicating and  collaborating with outside entities as challenges, including sharing  information with partners and influencing the Congress and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB).", "Managing Change. Top leadership involvement and clear lines of  accountability for making management improvements are critical to  overcoming an organization\u2019s natural resistance to change, marshaling the  resources needed to improve management, and building and maintaining  organizationwide commitment to new ways of doing business. Some CIOs  reported challenges associated with implementing changes originating  both from their own initiative and from outside forces. Implementing  major IT changes can involve not only technical risks but also  nontechnical risks, such as those associated with people and the  organization\u2019s culture. Six CIOs cited dealing with the government\u2019s  culture and bureaucracy as challenges to implementing change. Former  agency IT executives also cited the need for cultural changes as a major  challenge facing CIOs. Accordingly, in order to effectively implement  change, it is important that CIOs build understanding, commitment, and  support among those who will be affected by the change."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions Can Be Taken to Improve Agencies\u2019 Information and Technology Management", "paragraphs": ["The Congress and agencies can take various actions to assist CIOs in  fulfilling their vital roles. With respect to the Congress, hearings such as  this, Mr. Chairman, help to raise issues and suggest solutions. Also, the  report we are releasing today contains a Matter for Congressional  Consideration in which we suggest that, as you hold hearings on and  introduce legislation related to information and technology management,  you consider whether the existing statutory requirements related to CIO  responsibilities and reporting to the agency head reflect the most effective  assignment of information and technology management responsibilities  and the best reporting relationship. To further assist in your oversight role,  as you requested, we are beginning work on the development of a set of  CIO best practices, based on the practices of leading organizations in the  private sector, to complement the report we are releasing today.", "Agencies, too, can take action to improve their information and  technology management. First, to address concerns about the high CIO  turnover rate, agencies may be able to use human capital flexibilities\u2014 which represent the policies and practices that an agency has the authority  to implement in managing its workforce\u2014to help retain its CIOs. For  example, our model on strategic human capital management notes that  recruiting bonuses, retention allowances, and skill-based pay can attract  and retain employees who possess the critical skills the agency needs to  accomplish its mission. We have also issued several reports that discuss  these issues in more depth and provide possible solutions and  recommendations. Second, we have issued various guides to assist CIOs  in tackling the major challenges that they have cited. This guidance  includes (1) information security best practices to help agencies with their  information security challenges; (2) an IT investment management  framework, including a new version that offers organizations a road map  for improving their IT investment management processes in a systematic  and organized manner; and (3) a framework that provides agencies with a  common benchmarking tool for planning and measuring their efforts to  improve their enterprise architecture management.", "In summary, the report we are issuing today indicates that CIOs generally  stated that they had most of the responsibilities and reporting  relationships required by law, but that there were notable exceptions. In  particular, some agency CIOs reported that, contrary to the requirements  in the law, they were not responsible for certain areas, such as records  management, and that they did not report to their agency head. However,  views were mixed as to whether CIOs could be effective leaders without  having responsibility for each individual area. In addition, most CIOs did  not stay in office for 3 to 5 years\u2014the response most commonly given  when we asked current CIOs and former agency IT executives how long a  CIO needed to be in office to be effective. Agencies\u2019 use of various  mechanisms, such as human capital flexibilities, could help reduce the  turnover rate or mitigate its effect. Reducing turnover among CIOs is  important because the amount time CIOs are in office can affect their  ability to successfully address the major challenges they face. Some of  these challenges\u2014such as how IT projects are originated\u2014may not be  wholly within their control. Other challenges\u2014such as improved IT  management\u2014are more likely to be overcome if a CIO has sufficient time  to more effectively address these issues.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.

Originating in the  1977 recommendations of the Commission on Federal Paperwork, the IRM  approach was first enacted into law in the Paperwork Reduction Act of  1980 (PRA). The 1980 act focused primarily on centralizing  governmentwide responsibilities in the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB). The law gave OMB specific policy-setting and oversight duties  with regard to individual IRM areas\u2014for example, records management,  privacy, and the acquisition and use of automatic data processing and  telecommunications equipment (later renamed information technology).  The law also gave agencies the more general responsibility to carry out  their IRM activities in an efficient, effective, and economical manner and  to comply with OMB policies and guidelines. To assist in this effort, the  law required that each agency head designate a senior official who would  report directly to the agency head to carry out the agency\u2019s responsibilities  under the law.", "Together, these requirements were intended to provide for a coordinated  approach to managing federal agencies\u2019 information resources. The  requirements addressed the entire information life cycle, from collection  through disposition, in order to reduce information collection burdens on  the public and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government.", "Amendments to the PRA in 1986 and 1995 were designed to strengthen  agency and OMB implementation of the law. Most particularly, the PRA of  1995 provided detailed agency requirements for each IRM area, to match  the specific OMB provisions. The 1995 act also required for the first time  that agencies develop processes to select, control, and evaluate the results  of major information systems initiatives.", "In 1996, the Clinger-Cohen Act supplemented the information technology  management provisions of the PRA with detailed Chief Information Officer  (CIO) requirements for IT capital planning and investment control and for  performance and results-based management. The 1996 act also  established the position of agency chief information officer by amending  the PRA to rename the senior IRM officials CIOs and by specifying  additional responsibilities for them. Among other things, the act required  IRM to be the \u201cprimary duty\u201d of the CIOs in the 24 major departments and  agencies specified in 31 U.S.C. 901. Accordingly, under current law,  agency CIOs are required to carry out the responsibilities of their agencies  with respect to information resources management, including  information collection and the control of paperwork;   statistical policy and coordination;    privacy, including compliance with the Privacy Act;  information security, including compliance with the Federal Information  Security Management Act; information disclosure, including compliance with the Freedom of  Information Act; and information technology.", "Together, these legislated roles and responsibilities embody the policy that  CIOs should play a key leadership role in ensuring that agencies manage  their information functions in a coordinated and integrated fashion in  order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs  and operations.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
