In 2004, new government accounting standards were issued, calling for the reporting of liabilities for future retiree health costs. As these standards are implemented and the extent of the related liabilities become known, questions have been raised about whether the public sector can continue to provide the current level of benefits to its retirees. GAO was asked to provide an overview of state and local government retiree benefits, including the following: (1) the types of benefits provided and how they are structured, (2) how retiree benefits are protected and managed, and (3) the fiscal outlook for retiree benefits and what governments are doing to ensure they can meet their future commitments. For this overview, GAO obtained data from various organizations, used our model that simulates the fiscal outlook for the state and local sector, and conducted site visits to three states that illustrate a range of benefit structures, protections, and fiscal outlooks. Cognizant agency officials provided technical comments which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The systems for providing retiree benefits to state and local workers--who account for about 12 percent of the nation's workforce--are composed of two main components: pensions and retiree health care. These two components are often structured quite differently. Importantly, state and local governments generally have established protections and routinely set aside monies to fund their retirees' future pension costs, but this typically has not been the practice for retiree health benefits. A model GAO developed to simulate the fiscal outlook for state and local governments indicates that, for the sector as a whole, (1) estimated future pension costs (currently about 9 percent of employee pay) would require an increase in annual government contribution rates of less than a half percent, and (2) estimated future retiree health care costs (currently about 2 percent of employee pay) would more than double by the year 2050 if they continue to be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. Because the estimates are very sensitive to the assumed rates of return and projected rates of health care inflation, the model also indicates that if rates were to fall below historical averages, the funding requirements necessary to meet future pension and health care costs could become much higher. Nevertheless, state and local governments generally have strategies to manage future pension costs. In contrast, many are just beginning to respond to the newly issued standards calling for the reporting of retiree health liabilities, and they generally have not yet developed strategies to manage escalating retiree health care costs. Across the state and local government sector, the ability to maintain current levels of retiree benefits will depend, in large part, on the nature and extent of the fiscal challenges that lie ahead--challenges driven primarily by the growth in health-related costs for Medicaid, and for active employees as well as retirees. In future debates on retiree benefits, policy makers, voters, and beneficiaries will need to decide how to control costs, the appropriate level of benefits, and who should pay the cost--especially for health care."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past half-century, the number of state and local government  workers has grown significantly. In 2006, this sector accounted for about  12 percent of the nation\u2019s workforce. Since 1996, accounting standards  calling for state and local governments to report their liabilities for future  pension costs have been in place, but standards calling for similar  treatment of the future costs of retiree health benefits have only recently  been issued. It is unclear, as yet, what actions state and local governments  may take once the future costs of these benefits are known. However,  future decisions about the appropriate levels of benefits for retirees will  likely occur in a broader context of persistent fiscal challenges that state  and local governments will face in the next decade. Hence, concerns have  been raised about the public sector\u2019s capacity to meet the rising cost of  providing its retirees with promised pension and other postemployment  benefits, such as retiree health care.", "State and local retiree benefits are not subject, for the most part, to federal  laws governing private sector retiree benefits. Nevertheless, there is a  federal interest in ensuring that all Americans have a secure retirement, an  interest that is reflected in preferential tax treatment for contributions and  investment earnings associated with qualified pension plans in both the  public and the private sectors. To better understand these benefits and the  future challenge state and local governments may face, you requested that  we provide an overview of state and local government pension plans and  retiree health benefit programs. Specifically, we examined  (1) the types of state and local retiree benefits provided and how they are  (2) how state and local retiree benefits are protected and managed, and  (3) the fiscal outlook for state and local retiree benefits and what  governments are doing to ensure they can meet their future  commitments.", "For nationwide information about state and local retiree benefits, we  spoke with experts, advocacy groups, and union officials from various  national organizations and associations (see app. I). To profile the types of  governance and benefits provided, we obtained data from these  organizations, from various federal agencies, and from various  nongovernmental entities that analyze government data and conduct  surveys on these topics. (See the selected bibliography at the end of this  report for brief descriptions of each of these studies.) Much of the  available data are self-reported, but we conducted data reliability  assessments and determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also used our model that simulates the fiscal outlook for the  state and local government sector to develop projections for funding state  and local government retiree benefits in aggregate nationwide (see app.  II). In addition, we conducted site visits and gathered detailed information  about the benefits provided and the future fiscal implications in three  states (California, Michigan, and Oregon) and two local governments (San  Francisco and Detroit). We selected these sites to illustrate various types  of plan structures, legal protections, and levels of employer funding  commitments. For example, in California, the primary pension plan for  most state and local government employees is a defined benefit plan, with  protections in the state constitution, and with a funded ratio of 87.3  percent in 2005. In Michigan, the primary pension plan for general state  employees hired on or after March 31, 1997, is a defined contribution plan,  which is covered by the same state constitutional provision applicable to  the previous defined benefit plan; the previous plan, now closed to new  members, had a funded ratio of 79.8 percent in 2005. In Oregon, the  primary pension plan for most state and local government employees  includes both a defined benefit and a defined contribution component,  with no explicit protections in the state constitution; the defined benefit  component\u2019s funded ratio was 104.2 percent in 2005. (See app. III for an  overview of retiree benefit plans in our site visit locations.) Finally, to  illustrate a wider range of retiree benefit system characteristics, in some  instances, we complemented information from our site visit locations with  information gathered about retiree benefits provided in other state and  local jurisdictions. We conducted our work from November 2006 to August  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The state and local government sector is likely to face persistent fiscal  challenges within the next decade. In July 2007, we issued a report based  on simulations for the state and local government sector that indicated  that in the absence of policy changes, large and growing fiscal challenges  will likely emerge within a decade. Our report found that, as is true for the  federal sector, the growth in health-related costs is a primary driver of  these fiscal challenges (see fig. 1). Two types of health-related costs are of  particular concern at the state and local level: (1) Medicaid expenditures,  and (2) the cost of health insurance for state and local government  employees, retirees, and their beneficiaries.", "Retirement benefits consist primarily of two components: pensions and  retiree health benefits. According to Census data, in fiscal year 2004-2005,  state and local governments provided retirement benefits to nearly 7  million retirees and their families. In addition to supporting a secure  retirement for state and local government employees and their families,  such benefits constitute an important component of the total  compensation package state and local governments offer to attract and  retain the skilled workers needed to protect lives and health, and to  promote the general welfare. These workers include highway patrol  officers, local police, firefighters, school teachers, and judges, as well as  general state and local government employees who staff the broad array of  state and local agencies.", "Pension plans can generally be characterized as either defined benefit or  defined contribution plans. In a defined benefit plan, the amount of the  benefit payment is determined by a formula typically based on the retiree\u2019s  years of service and final average salary, and is most often provided as a  lifetime annuity. In defined benefit plans for state and local government  retirees, postretirement cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) are frequently  provided. But benefit payments are generally reduced for early retirement,  and in some cases, payments may be offset for receipt of Social Security.  State and local government employees are generally required to contribute  a percentage of their salaries to their defined benefit plans, unlike private  sector employees, who generally make no contribution when they  participate in defined benefit plans. According to a 50-state survey  conducted by Workplace Economics, Inc., 43 of 48 states with defined  benefit plans reported that general state employees were required to make  contributions ranging from 1.25 to 10.5 percent of their salaries.  Nevertheless, these contributions have no influence on the amount of  benefits paid because benefits are based solely on the formula.", "In a defined contribution plan, the key determinants of the benefit amount  are the employee\u2019s and employer\u2019s contribution rates, and the rate of  return achieved on the amounts contributed to an individual\u2019s account  over time. The employee assumes the investment risk: The account  balance at the time of retirement is the total amount of funds available,  and unlike with defined benefit plans, there are generally no COLAs. Until  depleted, however, a defined contribution account balance may continue  to earn investment returns after retirement, and a retiree could use the  balance to purchase an inflation-protected annuity. Also, defined  contribution plans are more portable than defined benefit plans, as  employees own their accounts individually and can generally take their  balances with them when they leave government employment. There are  no reductions based on early retirement or for participation in Social  Security.", "Accounting standards governing public sector pensions were established  by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in 1994.  Comprehensive accounting and financial reporting standards governing  other postemployment benefits (OPEB) in the public sector, such as  health care, were issued in 2004 (superseding the interim standards issued  previously). Implementation of the new OPEB standards is currently being  phased in (see app. IV). The purpose of these standards is to prescribe  accounting and financial reporting requirements that apply broadly to  state and local government employers\u2019 benefit plans. Reporting by  employers and plan administrators helps keep the municipal bond market,  taxpayers, elected public officials, plan members, and other interested  parties informed about employers\u2019 OPEB costs and obligations, and the  operation and funded status of the plans. As with the Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) in the private sector, it is not the GASB\u2019s function  to enforce compliance with the standards it promulgates. Rather, the  GASB functions as an independent standard setter, and its statements and  interpretations constitute the highest source of generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP) for state and local governments, as  specified in the Code of Professional Conduct of the American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants.  State and local governmental entities issue  annual financial reports prepared in conformity with GAAP for a variety of  reasons\u2014such as to comply with general or specific state laws requiring  GAAP financial reporting, or to protect the highest possible credit rating  on the government\u2019s bonds in order to reduce the government\u2019s cost of  borrowing. Compliance with GASB standards is necessary in order to  obtain an independent auditor\u2019s report that the financial statements are  fairly presented in conformity with GAAP, and a failure to do so would  result in a modification of the auditor\u2019s report if the effects were material.", "Although the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  imposes participation, vesting, and other requirements directly upon  employee pension plans, governmental plans such as those provided by  state and local governments to their employees are excepted from these  requirements. In addition, ERISA established an insurance program for  defined benefit plans under which promised benefits are paid (up to a  statutorily set amount), if an employer cannot pay them\u2014but this too does  not apply to governmental plans. However, for participants in  governmental pension plans to receive preferential tax treatment (that is,  for plan contributions and investment earnings to be tax-deferred), plans  must be deemed qualified by the Internal Revenue Service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Retiree Benefits Typically Include a Defined Benefit Plan, a Voluntary Savings Plan, and Partially Paid Health Coverage", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments typically provide their employees with  retirement benefits that include a defined benefit plan, a supplemental  defined contribution plan for voluntary savings, and group health  coverage.

Almost a decade later, we found that as  of 2007, only one additional state (Alaska) had adopted a defined  contribution plan as its primary plan; one additional state (Oregon) had  adopted a combined plan, and Nebraska had replaced its defined  contribution plan with a cash balance defined benefit plan.

We found that  defined benefit plans were still prevalent for most of these other state and  local employees as well. For example, a nationwide study conducted by  the National Education Association in 2006 found that of 99 large pension  plans serving teachers and other school employees, 79 were defined  benefit plans, 3 were defined contribution plans, and the remainder  offered a range of alternative, optional, or combined plan designs with  both defined benefit and defined contribution features."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Savings Plans Are Largely Voluntary, with No Employer Match", "paragraphs": ["In addition to primary pension plans (whether defined benefit or defined  contribution), data we gathered from various national organizations show  that each of the 50 states has also established a defined contribution plan  as a supplementary, voluntary option for tax-deferred retirement savings  for their general state employees, and such plans appear to be common  among other employee groups as well. These supplementary defined  contribution plans are typically voluntary deferred compensation plans  under section 457(b) of the federal tax code.

In a  2006 nationwide survey conducted by the National Association of  Government Defined Contribution Administrators, the average  participation rate for all defined contribution plans was 21.6 percent.", "One reason cited for low participation rates in these supplementary plans  is that, unlike in the private sector, it has been relatively rare for  employers to match workers\u2019 contributions to these plans, but the number  of states offering a match has been increasing.

In San Francisco, however, despite the lack of  an employer match, 75 percent of employees had established 457(b)  accounts. The executive director of the city\u2019s retirement system attributed  this success to several factors, including (1) that the plan had been in  place for over 25 years, (2) that the plan offers good investment options  for employees to choose from, and (3) that plan administrators have a  strong outreach program.

With respect to this health care program, the CalPERS board is  responsible for selecting insurers through which participants can receive  coverage. The CalPERS board negotiates, for example, the specific  services covered, premiums, and participant co-payments.

Some economists and  financial analysts have expressed concern that returns in the future may  not be quite as high as those in the past. Future investment returns may  not match past returns because, for example, slower labor force growth  may lead to slower economic growth, which may, in turn, reduce  investment returns. Also, pension managers may choose to invest in less  risky, lower-return investments in the future. If future rates of return are  more or less in line with historic experience, then our simulation should  provide a reasonable estimate of the contribution rates that will be needed  in the future.

For example, on the basis of research and discussions with  experts, we assumed that health care costs would grow at a higher rate  than the growth in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). If health  care costs were to rise only at the same rate as GDP, then by 2050, our  projected costs would grow only from 2.0 percent to 2.9 percent of  salaries, instead of 5.0 percent. Also, because our model is based on data  that did not incorporate possible savings attributable to the Medicare Part  D drug subsidy that began in 2006, the estimates may slightly overstate  retiree health costs.

Funding status is a measure that  captures a government\u2019s ongoing effort at one point in time to prefund its  future pension liability, generally expressed as the ratio of assets to  liabilities (also referred to as the funded ratio). Assessing the funding  status of public sector pension plans provides a second perspective on the  fiscal outlook of state and local government efforts to fund future pension  benefits. According NASRA\u2019s Public Fund Survey as of 2007, the most  recent reports from 126 of the largest state and local pension plans in the  country indicate that over three-fifths of the plans were at least 80 percent  funded\u2014a level generally viewed as being acceptable to support future  pension costs. However, funding levels across the different plans ranged  from about 32 to 113 percent. (See fig. 5.) Those state and local  governments with plans that are funded below acceptable levels may face  tough choices in the future between the need to raise taxes, cut spending,  or reduce benefits in order to meet their obligations.", "A primary way state and local governments keep the funding status of  their pension funds on track is to make their actuarially required  contributions. There are three sources of revenues for pension benefits:  investment earnings, employee contributions, and employer contributions.  Investment earnings provide the major source of funding (see fig. 6). The  amount that employees are required to contribute is generally fixed by  state statute as a percentage of salary, while state and local governments  determine the level of employer contributions based on their plans\u2019  funding status\u2014that is, the extent to which liabilities already accrued are  funded. Actuaries calculate the contribution amount needed to cover the  liability that accrues each year and to pay an installment on any unfunded  liability. If a plan sponsor (that is, a state or local government employer) is  making these actuarially required contributions, the plan can have a  funded ratio below 100 percent yet still be on track toward full actuarial  funding.", "Governments use various strategies to help them make their actuarially  required pension fund contributions. One strategy that governments use to  lessen the volatility of fluctuations in their actuarially required  contribution is to average the value of plan assets over a number of years  (referred to as \u201csmoothing\u201d). For example between 1999 and 2005,  California\u2019s contribution rate for one of CalPERS\u2019 pension plans ranged  from 1.5 percent of salaries to 17 percent of salaries. In 2005, California  began using smoothing techniques, and the contribution rate over the last  2 years changed only slightly\u2014from 15.9 percent of salaries in 2006 to an  estimated 15.7 percent in 2007.", "Another strategy government sponsors use to control their pension fund  contribution rates is to implement new, less costly benefit levels for newly  hired employees. Plan sponsors create a new \u201ctier,\u201d with different benefits,  for all employees hired after the date the new tier goes into effect. For  example, New York has four tiers in its State and Local Retirement  System, based on an employee\u2019s occupation and date of hire. General  employees in tier 1 (hired before July 1, 1973) can retire at age 55 after 20  years of service with no reduction for early retirement. However, general  employees in tier 3 (hired between July 26, 1973, and September 1, 1983)  must be age 62 with 5 years of service or age 55 with 30 years of service to  retire with no reduction in benefit.", "In addition to creating new tiers within the same pension plan,  government sponsors can also lower costs by adopting entirely new plans  for future hires. For example, Alaska recently switched from its previous  defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans for all general public  employees and teachers hired on or after July 1, 2006. According to the  state\u2019s 2006 comprehensive annual financial report, the new pension  system was adopted to help stabilize contribution rates for all public  employers within the state. Also, in 2003, Oregon adopted a new program  with both a defined benefit and a defined contribution component as its  primary plan for public employees. Under the new program, Oregon  continues to provide a defined benefit funded by employer contributions  (with a lower benefit formula for new employees), while the employees\u2019  contributions are now placed in individual accounts with no state  matching (the defined contribution component). Oregon officials estimate  that its pension reforms save public employers over $400 million per year.", "Yet another strategy plan sponsors use to manage their costs is to seek  higher contribution rates from its employees. For example, in 2005,  Louisiana enacted legislation to raise the employee contribution rate for  general state employees participating in the State Employees\u2019 Retirement  System hired on or after July 1, 2006, from 7.5 to 8.0 percent.", "Finally, another strategy that some plan sponsors have used as part of an  overall strategy for managing pension costs is to issue bonds to reduce  their unfunded actuarial liabilities. If the interest rate on the bond is less  than the rate of return earned on pension assets, sponsors can achieve  some savings. For example, in 2005, Detroit issued $1.44 billion in bonds  to pay down the unfunded accrued actuarial liabilities of its two  retirement systems. Similarly, Oregon recently issued pension obligation  bonds to help reduce its employer contribution rate for the Public  Employees Retirement System. According to officials from Oregon\u2019s  Legislative Fiscal Office, by issuing the pension bonds, they were paying a  lower interest rate on the debt service for the bonds (about 5.75 percent)  than they were currently earning on the bond proceeds. OPERS officials  said that earnings on the bond proceeds have averaged over 15 percent  over the last 4 years. However, it should be noted that issuing bonds to  make the employer contribution increases the government\u2019s overall  exposure to financial risks to the extent that the bond proceeds are  invested in equities or highly leveraged portfolios for returns to exceed the  borrowing costs. Also, if rates of return were to move lower than the bond  rates, state and local governments would no longer realize an advantage to  having issued the bonds, because the rate they could earn on the proceeds  may no longer cover the debt service costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Failure to Maintain Acceptable Funding Levels May Place Future Taxpayers and/or Beneficiaries at Risk", "paragraphs": ["Public pension plan funding levels are sensitive to a variety of external  influences, such as the rate of return on the funds\u2019 investments, the annual  stream of contributions to the fund, and changes to the levels of benefits  that ultimately affect future liabilities. Although strategies are being used  to keep the funding of most plans on track, we found some notable  exceptions where the failure to use such strategies caused the funding  status to drop significantly. Over time, state and local governments could  be faced with the need to raise taxes, cut spending, or reduce benefits in  order to meet their obligations.", "As investment earnings are the major source of pension funding, timely  payment of contributions is key to maximizing the compound interest  earned. However, sometimes a combination of factors makes it difficult  for state and local governments to make their actuarially required  contribution, and funding levels can drop. For instance, the sharp and  prolonged decline in the stock market that occurred in the early 2000s  reduced the value of many plans\u2019 assets and increased the amount many  states and local governments needed to contribute to remain on track  toward full funding. Furthermore, to the extent state and local  governments experience slower economic growth, revenues might not  keep up with expenditures, making it difficult for the governments to meet  their funding commitments for pensions. For example, from 2001 to 2007,  Michigan\u2019s contribution rate for the State Employees\u2019 Retirement System  (MSERS) dramatically increased\u2014from 4.7 percent to 18.1 percent of  payroll. During this period of slow revenue growth, Michigan used money  transferred from a pension fund subaccount to supplement the amount it  contributed to MSERS to make its full actuarially required contribution.", "Even so, from 2002 through 2005, MSERS\u2019s funded ratio dropped steadily  from 98.7 percent to 79.8 percent.", "In some cases, employers fell short of making their actuarially required  contributions at the same time that they adopted significant increases in  pension benefits for their employees, and did so for years. For example, a  New Jersey state treasury department official told us that in 1997, the state  viewed the status of its pension funds as \u201coverfunded,\u201d and began  substituting \u201cexcess\u201d pension assets for their actuarially required  contributions. The state skipped payments to the retirement plans over a  7-year period, totaling $8 billion. While in this \u201coverfunded\u201d position, the  state also approved costly benefit enhancements and early retirement  packages. According to the official, as a result of these enhancements and  less than prudent funding arrangements, compounded by the downturn in  the market conditions beginning in 2001, the funded ratios of several New  Jersey pension plans fell below acceptable levels. For instance, since 1999,  the funded ratio of New Jersey\u2019s Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System  declined from 113.5 to 79.1 percent as of June 30, 2005. Overall, the state  now faces an $18.9 billion unfunded liability for all of its retirement plans  combined. Similarly, in San Diego, the city did not make its actuarially  required contribution to the San Diego City Retirement System by about  $80 million from 1999 through 2004. At the same time, the city increased  benefits to current employees, and in a litigation settlement, increased  benefits to current retirees. As of June 30, 2006, the actuarial valuation  report for the system stated that the funding status had dropped from 97.3  percent in 2000 to a low of 65.8 percent in 2004, with an unfunded liability  of $1.37 billion. However, as of 2006, the system had regained ground up to  79.9 percent, with an unfunded liability of about $1.0 billion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most State and Local Governments Have Yet to Develop Long-Term Strategies for Financing Future Health Care Costs for Retirees", "paragraphs": ["Most state and local governments generally lack long-term strategies to  address future health care costs. In addition, many of the governments are  still in the process of responding to the new GASB statement calling for  valuations of the liability for the future cost of other postemployment  benefits (OPEB), including health care benefits for retirees, as the  standard is being implemented in phases. Officials for the governments we  visited said that once the valuations were completed, they would consider  options for addressing these costs, if needed.", "Several funding vehicles are available under the federal tax code to help  facilitate state and local government efforts to accumulate funds to meet  their future health care liabilities. (See table 6.) As noted earlier, of the  state and local governments that contribute to retiree health benefits, most  treat the cost of the benefits as an operating expense and do not prefund  the future obligation. Of the states that provide an explicit contribution to  the premiums for retiree health coverage, it has been reported that 13  partially prefund their future health care costs. But these prefunding  efforts have been slow to get started. For example, in 1989, the  Connecticut Teacher\u2019s Retirement System created a Health Insurance  Premium Account, using a 1 percent of salary contribution from active  teachers to fund health benefits for retirees. The fund was facing  insolvency by 1999. To address the shortfall, in 2004, Connecticut  increased active teachers\u2019 contributions to the fund from 1 percent to 1.25  percent of salary. In Michigan, state budget officials said that they would  like to prefund retiree health care benefits for state employees, but other  state priorities have prevented them from doing so. However, a fund was  recently set up for local employees in Michigan. In 2004, the Municipal  Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Michigan created a Retiree Health  Funding Vehicle to allow municipalities to contribute to a trust fund for  retiree health benefits. As of September 2007, system officials reported  that 55 employers were participating in the program, and that the fund had  over $95 million available for retiree health care costs. More recently, in  March 2007, CalPERS launched the California Employers\u2019 Retiree Benefit  Trust Fund, an investment vehicle that allows public employers that  contract with CalPERS for employee health benefits to prefund their  future OPEB costs.", "At the sites we visited, state and local government officials we spoke with  said that the rising cost of health care was one of the biggest fiscal  challenges confronting them in the near term. They said the drivers of  their health care costs mirror those of the nation as a whole: rapidly  escalating costs for prescription drugs, medical care, and hospital care.  Further, they noted that the health care industry\u2019s practice of shifting costs  not paid by the Medicare and Medicaid programs to employers is causing  employers\u2019 costs for health insurance premiums to rise even faster. In  addition to the costs associated with providing health care benefits for  their active and retired workers, states also must contend with rising costs  for their uninsured residents and federal changes to Medicaid. Officials  who administer health benefits for California state and local governments  noted that much of the cost increase for the health care market is due to  health care inflation and demographic factors that are outside of their  control. At the same time, with respect to health care, there are also  factors that are within their control to help manage these costs, such as  their program\u2019s benefit design and eligibility criteria.", "Aside from prefunding through establishment of a trust, several states  have taken steps to address escalating costs of retiree health benefits by  negotiating lower premium costs and/or reducing benefits. For example,  as in the private sector, some public employers have negotiated lower  premiums by increasing the deductibles, co-payments, and coinsurance  that employees must pay out of pocket. In addition, several states have  introduced requirements that employees must work a certain number of  years before becoming eligible for various levels of retiree health benefits.  California introduced such vesting requirements for partially paid retiree  health benefits for workers hired in 1985 and thereafter; and Michigan  introduced similar requirements in 1997. In 2006, North Carolina enacted  legislation requiring that employees hired after February 1, 2007, must  have 20 years of service to be eligible for retiree health benefits. Other  states have reduced the benefits provided and/or instituted health savings  accounts. Oregon has discontinued its retiree health care support for those  hired since 2003. Also, to reduce state costs, Utah recently discontinued its  policy of providing retirees a month of health insurance for every day of  unused sick leave (a policy initiated when health insurance costs were  substantially lower). Instead, Utah now deposits wage amounts equal to  unused sick leave into health savings accounts that retirees can use to  purchase their own health insurance.", "State and local governments indicated that they may take a range of  actions in response to the new GASB standards. At the locations we  visited, all the officials we spoke with said that their governments were  planning to comply with the new standards and report their liability for  retiree health benefits. However, while various options were being  discussed, none of the officials we spoke with said that their governments  had developed plans to address their unfunded liabilities. In California, for  example, the governor had established a 12-member Public Employee  Post-Employment Benefits Commission to propose ways to address the  state's growing postemployment benefits and retiree health care  obligations, with a recommended plan due by January 1, 2008. According  to Oregon retirement system officials, their state had also formed a  workgroup to study options related to GASB 45. In Detroit, the city budget  director said that city officials would wait to find out if any practices  emerge that gain wide support before deciding their next steps. San  Francisco is also taking a wait-and-see approach with respect to devising a  strategy for dealing with the unfunded liability. A senior city official said  that the city wants to have several years\u2019 experience estimating the  unfunded liability to feel confident that the estimates are valid before  negotiating any remedies with the unions. Otherwise, he noted, if the costs  end up being greater than anticipated, it could be difficult to reopen  negotiations with the unions and the city would then have to deal with the  greater costs on its own."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Across the state and local government sector, the ability to maintain  current levels of public sector retiree benefits will depend, in large part, on  the nature and extent of the fiscal challenges these governments face in  the years ahead. While public sector workers have thus far been relatively  shielded from many of the changes that have occurred in the private  sector, provisions that lend stability for public sector pensions and retiree  health benefits are subject to change. Pension benefits are often protected  by state constitutions and city charters, but these protections can be  amended if voters feel the need to rebalance priorities as fiscal pressures  increase. In fact, our recent work on state and local government fiscal  conditions indicated that persistent fiscal challenges will likely emerge  within the next decade. Retiree health benefits are generally easier to  change simply through the annual budget process.", "As we heard from some state officials, the impetus for changing retiree  benefits often surfaces when the projected costs for these benefits starts  to grow faster than expected. When this occurs, governments may  eventually have little choice but to reduce future benefits or raise taxes.  One way state and local governments can address unexpected gaps in  funding is to prefund the promised benefits. Even though our simulation  suggests that the sector as a whole is generally on track with funding its  pension obligations, continued diligence will be necessary to ensure that  funding is adequate in the future. When state and local governments take  breaks from their regular contribution schedules, such as when  investment returns are high, they may be putting their ability to pay future  retiree benefits at risk. According to our simulation for state and local  governments, to ensure that they have the resources they need to meet  future costs, they will have to maintain (and as a sector, increase slightly)  their contributions to their pension funds. Moreover, our long-term  projections indicate that if future returns turn out lower than expected,  governments may need to ratchet up their contributions substantially.", "The provision of retiree health benefits presents an entirely different  scenario. Given that our simulations show that over the next several  decades, the cost of providing health care benefits for public sector  retirees will more than double as a share of salaries, state and local  governments may find it difficult to maintain current benefits levels. It is  clear from our model and from discussions with budget officials that  health care inflation is driving these future costs. Budget officials with  whom we spoke said that they will face challenges financing future health  care benefits in general\u2014including Medicaid benefits and health benefits  for active government employees, not just for their retirees. As state and  local governments begin to comply with GASB reporting standards,  information about the future costs of the retiree health benefits will  become more transparent.

These analyses  relate to defined benefit plans only. We project the following key factors  for each year during the simulation time frame: (1) the number of state and  local government employees, (2) the state and local government real  wages, (3) the number of pension beneficiaries, (4) average real benefits  per beneficiary, and (5) yearly employee contributions to state and local  government pension plans.  1. Steps to Project Future Employment Levels   Future growth in the number of state and local government retirees\u2014 many of whom will be entitled to pension and health care benefits\u2014is  largely driven by the size of the workforce in earlier years. To project the  level of employment in each future year, we assume that state and local  employment grows at the same rate as total population under the  intermediate assumptions of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and  Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trustees. The implication of these  assumptions is that the ratio of state and local employment to the total  population remains constant. The Trustees assume that population  growth gradually declines from 0.8 percent during the next decade to a  steady rate of 0.3 percent per year beginning in 2044. Accordingly, state  and local government employment displays the same pattern in our  projections. The relationship used to project total state and local  government employment (egslall) is shown in equation 1:  np is population in the indicated year  egslall is the number of state and local employees in the  indicated year  2. Steps to Project Future State and Local Government Real Wage   The pension benefits that employees become entitled to are a function of  the wages they earned during their working years. As described below, we  developed a rolling average real wage index for different cohorts of  workers to estimate the average real pension benefit of the recipient pool  in each future year.", "First, we assume that the real employment cost index for the state and  local sector (jecistlcr) will grow at a rate equal to the difference between  the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumptions for the growth in the  employment cost index (ECI) for private sector wages and salaries and  inflation as measured by the consumer price index for all urban  consumers (CPIU), as published in the January 2007 CBO Budget and  Economic Outlook. These data are available through 2017. For later years,  we hold the growth rate constant at the rate that CBO assumes between  2016 and 2017.", "CBO\u2019s assumptions for growth in the ECI and the CPIU are 3.3 percent and  2.2 percent per year respectively, implying a real wage growth of 1.1  percent per year during the simulation time frame. Since the analysis is  scaled to the real wage bill over the simulation time frame, we calculate  that aggregate amount for each future year. As shown in equation 2,  aggregate real wages are assumed to grow at the combined rate of growth  in the real employment cost index (jecistlcr) and employment (egslall).  where:  jecistler is the real employment cost index in a given year  gsclwageallr is the real wage bill of the state and local sector  As noted previously, population growth slows from 0.8 percent in the  upcoming decade to a steady rate of 0.3 percent after 2044. Because  population growth drives employment in our projections, this slowdown  implies that aggregate real wage growth slows from 1.9 percent per year to  a steady long-run rate of 1.4 percent.  3. Steps to Project Growth in the Number of Pension Beneficiaries   While actuaries use detailed information and assumptions regarding the  age, earnings, service records, and mortality rates applicable to the entities  they evaluate, information in such detail is not available for the state and  local government sector as a whole. This lack of detailed data necessitated  the development of a method of projecting aggregate state and local  beneficiary growth that is much simpler than the methods that actuaries  employ.", "The method we developed reflects the logic that each year\u2019s growth in the  number of beneficiaries is linked to past growth in the number of  employees. Total state and local government employment from 1929  through 2005 was obtained from the National Income and Product  Accounts (NIPA) tables 6.4a, b, c, and d. The Census Bureau provided a  continuous series of data on the number of state and local pension  beneficiaries from 1992 through 2005 during which continuous  observations were available.", "Cyclical swings in the employment series were removed using a Hodrick- Prescott filter. Then, both the employment and beneficiary series were  logged and first-differenced, transforming the data from levels to  proportionate changes. We developed a routine that searched across 45  years of lagged employment growth to select a set of weights for the years  in which past employment growth best explained a given year\u2019s growth in  beneficiaries. The routine included the restrictions that the weights must  be non-negative and sum to 1. The method produced the relationship  shown in equation 3, where beneficiaries is equal to the state and local  pension benefit recipients, eglsall is state and local employees, and the  coefficients are weights, derived from the estimation, that reflect the  contribution of a particular past year\u2019s employment change in explaining a  given year\u2019s change in retirees. In particular, the estimated relationship  suggests that beneficiary growth in a given year is largely determined by  employment growth 34, 21, 22, and 23 years prior to the given period. This  pattern appears consistent with the categories of workers that the sector  employs. Many fire and police positions, for example, offer faster pension  accrual or early retirement due to the physical demands and risks of the  work, while many other state and local workers have longer careers. ) d.", "560 d. ) ) log d. d. ) ) where:  beneficiaries is the number of retirees receiving pensions in the   indicated year.  4. Steps to Project Real Benefits per Beneficiary   While, in the long run, the average real benefit level should grow at the  same rate as real wages\u2014that is, at 1.1 percent per year\u2014in the first  decades of the projection the average real benefit will be affected by real  wage changes that occurred before the projection period. Accordingly, we  developed a relationship that reflects how the average real benefit level  will change over time according to changes in the number and average real  benefit level of three subsets of the retiree population: (1) new retirees  entering the beneficiary pool, (2) new decedents leaving the pool, and (3)  the majority of the previous year\u2019s retirees who continue to receive  benefits during the given period. Each group\u2019s real benefit is linked to the  real wage level in the average year of retirement for that group. Thus, to  determine the average real benefit overall in any future year, we need  weights and real wage indexes for the three groups that can be used to  develop a rolling average real wage of the recipient pool in each future  year.", "Equation 3 above projects the percentage change in the total number of  beneficiaries between two successive years, but this difference is actually  composed of two elements: the percentage change in new retirees minus  the percentage change in decedents. Therefore, to determine the weight  for new retirees, we also need an estimate of the number of new decedents  in each year. In order to estimate a \u201cdeath rate,\u201d we utilize Social Security  Administration data on terminated benefits and total OASDI recipients,  which excludes disability recipients. Our estimate of the \u201cdeath rate\u201d for  the forecast period is assumed to be equal to the number of terminated  Social Security recipients divided by the total number of OASDI recipients  in 2003 (3.67 percent). This analysis then enables a derivation of weights  for each of the three groups as follows:    weight for new retirees: the number of beneficiaries this year, less the  number of beneficiaries last year who are still alive, divided by the  number of beneficiaries this year ( )    weight for continuing recipients is equal to last year\u2019s beneficiaries  divided by this year\u2019s beneficiaries ( )    weight for the deceased is the death rate (3.67 percent) multiplied by  last year\u2019s beneficiaries divided by this year\u2019s beneficiaries ( )", "Mathematically the weights are calculated as follows: 0367 .", "Next, we need to identify the real employment cost index that determines  the real benefit level for each of these three groups. We do so by  estimating the average retirement year applicable to each of the three  groups. First, we assume the average retirement age is 60. We developed  this estimate based on an analysis of the March Supplement to the Current  Population Survey (CPS) for 2005-2006, which indicated that the average  state and local government retiree had retired at 60 years of age. We also  analyzed detailed data on the age distribution of OASDI recipients  provided by the Office of the Actuary of the Social Security  Administration. These data showed that the average age for new  decedents is about 81 during the initial years of OASDI\u2019s simulations, and  we thus used a 21-year lag\u201481 minus 60\u2014to estimate the real wage  applicable to this group. For the newly retired group, we use the current  year\u2019s employment cost index. For the remaining retirees\u2014those already  retired and remaining in the group\u2014we use information from CPS for 2005  that indicated that the average age of a retired state or local retiree was 68.  Therefore, we apply an 8-year lag to the real employment cost index to  determine real benefits of this group.", "Using the weights shown in equation 4a and the appropriate periods\u2019  values for the real employment cost index (jecistlcr), the rolling average  jecistlcr is constructed as follows:  where:  wjecistlcr is the rolling average employment cost index for retirees  in year t.", "This equation approximates the average employment cost index at  retirement of the retiree pool in a given year. To do this we take the  employment cost index 8 years prior to the given year and weight this by  the portion of the total retirees in the given year who were already retired  last year. We add to this a factor to account for new retirees who have a  higher employment cost index because they just retired. Finally, because  some of the retirees from last year have deceased, the first factor  overstates the number of retirees, and therefore we subtract a factor for  those who have died, weighted by the cost index 21 years ago, when, on  average, this group entered retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Projections of Necessary Contributions to Pension Funds for State and Local Government Sector", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of the pension simulations is to estimate the level of  contribution that state and local governments would need to make each  year going forward to ensure that their pension systems are fully funded  on an ongoing basis.

Future wages are simulated within our  model. The logic of this estimation is that the benefits that are promised to  employees (including liabilities already made and promises that will be  made in the future) must be paid from three sources: existing pension  funds in 2006, contributions that employees will continue to make to those  funds in the future, and contributions that employers will make to those  funds in the future.", "Our analysis estimates the steady level of employer contribution, relative  to wages, that would need to be made in every year between 2006 and  2050 to fully fund promised pension benefits. Although we are only  interested in developing necessary contribution rates over the simulation  time frame\u2014that is, until 2050\u2014we actually have to derive the  contribution rate for a longer time frame in order to find the steady state  level of necessary contributions. This longer time frame is required  because the estimated contribution rate increases as the projection  horizon increases and eventually converges in a steady state. If the  projection period is of insufficient length, the steady level of contribution  is not attained and the contribution rate necessary is understated. As  such, all of the flows in the calculation extend 400 years into the future.

To estimate  the costs of retiree health benefits in future years, we made many of the  same assumptions as for the pension analysis. In particular, we use the  same method to develop projections of employment in the sector, the  number of retirees, and the level of wages.

To develop this measure,  we use data from two sources. The Census Bureau\u2019s State and Local  Government Employee-Retirement System survey provided data on the  total number of state and local retirees, and the Health and Human  Services Department\u2019s Medical Expenditure Panel Survey provided data  on state and local government retirees who are covered by prior employer- provided health insurance.

The cost of health care has been growing faster than  gross domestic product (GDP) for many years. As such, we developed  assumptions about how much faster health care costs would grow, relative  to the economy, in future years. The extent to which the per person cost of  health care is expected to grow beyond GDP per capita is called the  \u201cexcess cost factor.\u201d We developed these estimates based on our own  research and discussions with experts. In particular, we assume that the  excess cost factor averages 1.4 percentage points per year through 2035,  and then begins to decline, reaching 0.6 percentage points by 2050.", "Using these assumptions, we develop a growth projection for the per  capita costs of health care for retirees each year through 2050.

In 2006, these costs amounted to  approximately 2.0 percent of wages, and we project that by 2050, they will  grow to nearly 5.0 percent of wages\u2014a 150 percent increase. As with the  projections of necessary pension contributions, our estimates of retiree  health benefit costs are highly sensitive to certain of our assumptions. In  particular, the assumptions regarding health care cost growth are critical.  For example, if health costs were to only rise at the rate of GDP per capita,  these costs would only grow, as a percentage of wages, from 2 percent  today to 2.9 percent by 2050.
