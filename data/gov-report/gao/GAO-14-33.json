Many of the federal requirements governing these benefits were developed at a time when family structures, work patterns, and pensions were very different from what they are today. In recent decades, marriage has become less common, more households have two earners rather than one, and many employers have shifted from DB plans to DC plans. In light of these trends, GAO was asked to examine the issue of marriage and retirement security. Specifically, GAO examined: (1) the trends in and status of marriage and labor force participation in American households, (2) how those trends have affected spousal benefits and retirement savings behavior within households today, and (3) the implications of these trends for future retirement security.

During this period, the proportion of unmarried and never-married individuals in the population increased steadily as couples chose to marry at later ages and live together prior to marriage. At the same time, the proportion of single-parent households more than doubled. These trends were more pronounced for individuals with lower levels of income and education and for certain racial and ethnic groups. Over the same period, labor force participation among married women nearly doubled.", "Taken together, these trends have resulted in a decline in the receipt of spousal and survivor benefits and married women contributing more to household retirement savings. From 1960 through 2011, the percentage of women aged 62 and older receiving Social Security benefits based purely on their spouse's (or deceased spouse's) work record declined from 56 to 25. At the same time, the percentage of women receiving benefits based purely on their own work records rose from 39 to 48. Further, as of 2010, among married households receiving pensions, 40 percent had elected not to receive a survivor benefit. Rising labor force participation among married women enabled them to contribute more to household retirement savings. From 1992 to 2010, married women's average contributions to household retirement savings increased from 20 to 38 percent.", "In the future, fewer retirees will receive spousal or survivor benefits from Social Security and private employer-sponsored pension plans, increasing vulnerabilities for some. Eligibility for Social Security spousal benefits among women is projected to decline, in part, because fewer women are expected to qualify based on marital history and more are expected to qualify for their own benefit based on their own work record. For many women, this shift will be positive, reflecting their greater earnings and capacity to save for retirement. However, women with low levels of lifetime earnings and no spouse or spousal benefit may face greater risk of poverty in old age. For private plans, the shift from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) plans increases the vulnerability of spouses because of different federal protections for spouses under these plans. DB plans are required to offer survivor benefits, which can only be waived with spousal consent. In contrast, DC plan participants generally do not need spousal consent to withdraw funds from the account."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the institution of marriage has served to help protect the  financial health of couples, especially couples and surviving spouses in  old age.

First, single retirees living alone do not benefit from  sharing the cost of living expenses and caregiving.

Moreover,  unmarried individuals are more vulnerable to economic shocks, such as  job loss, than their married counterparts.

Alternatively, the spouse that is expected to survive the spouse receiving  the pension might have access to his or her own retirement income.

According to SSA analyses among  whites, blacks, and Hispanics, as of 2012, proportionally, black women  were already the most likely to receive retired worker benefits (see fig.  19). Furthermore, between 2012 and 2040, black women are projected to  experience the highest growth in this category. In addition, the  proportions of dually-entitled/spouse white and black women are  projected to decrease by about half between 2012 and 2040, with a small  decrease among Hispanic women. Moreover, the proportion of women  who are expected to receive widow-only benefits is projected to decrease  for all three groups and, by 2040, differ by no more than two percentage  points. Unlike these trends, the projections for dually-entitled widows  diverge by race. More specifically, the proportion of white dually-entitled  widows is projected to increase by 12 percent, while blacks will likely see  a 35 percent decrease. These projections do not suggest any change  among Hispanic dually-entitled widows."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Trends Suggest a Growing Proportion of the Elderly Will Be at Risk of Living in Poverty During Retirement", "paragraphs": ["As the population that is ineligible for spousal and survivor benefits based  on marital history\u2014i.e., those who are not married or divorced without a  marriage of at least 10 years\u2014is projected to increase, the proportion of  people who will depend entirely on their own earnings and savings in  retirement is expected to increase as well. For many elderly, women in  particular, this shift is likely to be positive, reflecting their higher earnings  and greater capacity to save for retirement. However, elderly with low  levels of lifetime earnings, who have no spouse, or who do not receive a  spousal benefit\u2014a group that is disproportionately represented by black  women\u2014are expected to have correspondingly lower retirement  benefits. As a result, a growing proportion of the elderly\u2014especially  black women\u2014may be at risk of living in poverty in retirement due to the  higher cost of living and lower income associated with being single. As  our past work has shown, elderly married individuals have higher levels of  median household income and lower poverty rates than those who are  never married, divorced, or widowed.income levels of this expanding group of never married elderly will  continue to be lower than that of their married counterparts, according to  SSA projections.", "The preretirement income used in this example is the annual equivalent of the average  indexed monthly earnings used to calculate Social Security benefits. relative to what a couple needs.

However, working  women\u2019s increased earnings and personal savings may potentially offset  the lower level of survivor benefit, mitigating this issue to some extent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Social Security Policy Options May Offset Effects of Changes in Marital Patterns", "paragraphs": ["Past GAO work has identified a number of options suggested by experts  to improve the retirement security of populations vulnerable to poverty by  changing the Social Security eligibility rules or benefit structure, although  each option has limitations. Some of these options focus specifically on  modifying benefits for spouses and survivors, while others would affect  broader populations of vulnerable individuals, and may also benefit those  affected by changing marital patterns. For example, one option would  change the eligibility requirements for divorced spousal benefits by  reducing the required length of marriage from 10 to 7 years, with the goal  of helping more of the divorced elderly remain out of poverty. Another  option would increase benefit amounts for widow(er)s from the current  maximum of 67 to 75 percent of the combined amount the couple had   This  received, with the aim of preventing poverty among widow(er)s.option could be targeted specifically toward low-income survivors by  capping the surviving spouse\u2019s benefit amount at the average retired  worker benefit. However, concerns have been raised that these options  may not effectively target other economically vulnerable groups like low- income Social Security retired worker recipients who never married.  Further, both of these options could provide benefits to higher-income  elderly who may not be particularly economically vulnerable.", "Other reform options target the vulnerable population of low-income  people who do not qualify for spousal or survivor benefits, such as those  who never marry, and who would otherwise receive retired worker  benefits. Retired worker benefits are generally calculated on the basis of  a worker\u2019s average indexed monthly earnings for the worker\u2019s highest 35  years of earnings. While Social Security\u2019s benefit structure is progressive,  meaning that its retirement benefits replace a higher percentage of  earnings for lower-income workers, a lifetime low-wage worker would still  have correspondingly low benefits. Furthermore, the current benefit  formula does not distinguish between low average wages caused by low  lifetime earnings or low average wages caused by years of  unemployment. One set of proposed options aims to increase benefit  adequacy for lifetime low wage workers by increasing the level of the  Special Minimum Primary Insurance Amount (also referred to as the  \u201cSpecial Minimum Benefit\u201d)\u2014a minimum Social Security benefit that is  based on the number of years a worker has spent in Social Security- covered employment. The Special Minimum Benefit is paid to an eligible  retired worker if it is higher than the benefit amount computed using the  typical Social Security benefit formula based on the worker\u2019s highest 35  years of earnings. Increasing the Special Minimum Benefit could help  more elderly avoid poverty. However, it is difficult to effectively target  lifetime low earners with this option because it is possible for high-wage  earners who work part-time or sporadically to accumulate 11 years of  covered employment\u2014the minimum required under current law to qualify  for the Special Minimum Benefit.", "In addition to revising the Special Minimum Benefit, another option targets  those who have shorter periods of covered employment because they  were providing care to a family member and do not qualify for spousal  benefits. More specifically, this option could change the Social Security  benefit structure to provide earnings credits to caregivers (known as  caregiver credits) during years in which they do not have earnings  because they were providing care to children or elderly relatives.  However, according to experts, this option may not reach its target  population either because, for example, low-income people are less likely  to take time out of the labor market to provide care for a family member.  Consequently, people who have relatively higher incomes may benefit  more from the creation of caregiver credits.", "These policy options have costs that would place greater strains on the  Social Security trust funds, which are already projected to have  significantly depleted assets by 2033, at which time claimants would only  receive 77 percent of their entitled benefits. The cost each option might  impose varies depending on several factors, including: (1) the number of  additional beneficiaries that would become eligible, (2) whether other  additional adjustments\u2014such as including a minimum work requirement  for divorced spouses\u2014would be included, and (3) their potential to offset  the new costs.", "The administrative burdens associated with implementing such changes  are also important factors. For example, caregiver credits would be  complex to administer due to the challenges associated with verifying that  care was provided to a qualifying person and the amount of care that was  provided."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Shift Away from Defined Benefit Plans Also Increases the Economic Vulnerability of Elderly Spouses", "paragraphs": ["The transition in private employer plan sponsorship from DB to DC plans  has increased the vulnerability of spouses due to differences in the level  of spousal protections between these retirement plans. While over half of  U.S. workers do not participate in employer-sponsored pension plans,  those with spouses who do participate may have different federal  protections depending on whether their spouse participates in a DB or DC  plan. In DB plans, current law requires spousal consent if the participant  wishes to waive the survivor annuity for his or her spouse. In contrast,  under DC plans, there is generally no federal requirement to provide an  annuity option and participants do not need spousal consent to withdraw  funds from the account\u2014either before or at retirement. While spouses are  generally required to be the default beneficiary of the remaining account  balance upon the death of the participant, there is no protection against  the assets being invested unwisely, inadvertently spent down too quickly,  or simply withdrawn fully upon a job change and rolled into an IRA, with a  change in beneficiary. In a worst case scenario, the spouse who  participates in the DC plan could withdraw all the assets and spend them  in ways that do not provide for the couple\u2019s retirement security. While the  increases in dual-earner couples and women\u2019s coverage under DC plans  have the potential to mitigate these concerns by providing alternative  sources of retirement income, spouses with lower or no earnings may  remain vulnerable.", "We identified these policy options for DB and DC plans through interviews and  consultations with retirement policy experts representing a range of perspectives and from  different types of organizations including government, academia, advocacy groups, and  the private sector. The listed options are not intended to be exhaustive and we are not  recommending or endorsing the adoption of any particular policy option. Rather, we  identify them as potential options for policymakers to consider, along with other relevant  proposals, as they address retirement security issues. could slow down the retirement process. For example, one expert  explained that DC plan benefit elections can be done electronically and in  a matter of days. In contrast, DB plan elections typically take about 30  days, in part because the pen and paper process of obtaining notarized  spousal consent in order to elect something other than a qualified joint  and survivor annuity (QJSA) holds up the process. Additionally, one  agency official we interviewed questioned the need for DC plans to adopt  spousal consent features, pointing out that spousal protections under DB  plans were instituted to protect nonworking spouses at a time when  women generally did not have the same level of access to and  participation in retirement plans as they do today.", "Despite their relatively greater level of spousal protections, some policy  advocates have also proposed revising spousal provisions that apply to  DB plans. First, similar to the concern that the Social Security survivor  benefit amount is too low, one expert has suggested increasing the  minimum amount for DB survivor annuities from 50 percent to at least  two-thirds of the prior annuity amount. Such a change would help  surviving spouses better maintain their standard of living. However, such  a change would entail lowering the initial annuity amount, which may be a  hardship for some retirees and could deter some participants from  electing the QJSA. Another policy option would seek to remedy the  unequal treatment of widow(er)s under DB QJSAs. Typically, in a QJSA,  the amount of the annuity that the couple receives while both spouses are  alive does not change if the worker\u2019s spouse dies first. In other words, the  worker would see no change in DB household income if widowed. On the  other hand, if the worker dies first, the annuity amount that the surviving  spouse receives may be reduced to as little as 50 percent of the prior  amount. To remedy this imbalance, two experts have suggested paying  the widow(er) a predetermined amount, regardless of which spouse dies  first. This \u201csymmetric\u201d joint and survivor annuity option is currently  available for plan sponsors to offer, but they generally have not done so.  Accordingly, one version of this policy option would be to make this option  the normal form of benefit for married participants, requiring spousal  consent to opt for a different form of payment. A symmetric joint and  survivor annuity has the advantage of requiring a smaller benefit  reduction on account of the survivor benefit than a standard joint and  survivor annuity, which could lead to more participants taking this option.  However, one agency official noted that employers expressed concern  that beneficiaries with this option might not report the death of their  spouse to avoid incurring any benefit reduction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 50 years, major societal changes in the United States have  had important consequences for how Americans live, work, and save for  retirement. Indeed, unlike in decades past, fewer people are getting  married, and those who do often marry later in life and for shorter periods.  These trends have consequences for economic security because  unmarried individuals are unable to take advantage of the economic  benefits and efficiencies of marriage and may therefore be at greater risk  of poverty in old age. Moreover, these trends have disproportionately  occurred within the nation\u2019s most vulnerable populations\u2014low-income,  less-educated, and some minorities. If these trends continue, many  Americans\u2019 economic security\u2014both in their working years and in old  age\u2014could further deteriorate.", "While marriage rates overall have declined, the role women play in the  labor market has expanded. As a result, women have become major  contributors to household income and household retirement savings. For  many households, these gains could enhance economic security in old  age. However, low-wage workers who never marry or were not married  long enough to qualify for Social Security spousal benefits may not be  able to accrue sufficient retirement savings to offset the lack of a spousal  benefit in old age. Even within two-earner households, the Social Security  survivor benefit declines as earnings for both spouses become more  similar. Survivors are therefore likely to depend on other forms of  retirement income to maintain their standard of living prior to their  spouse\u2019s death. Further, the shift to DC plans\u2014which typically offer fewer  protections for spouses and fewer possibilities for participants to annuitize  within their plans\u2014will likely result in more retirees outliving their assets.", "These trends and their consequences raise important questions for  existing programs, such as Social Security, and current protections for  spouses in pension plans.

These non-sampling  errors can influence the accuracy of information presented in the report,  although the magnitude of their effect is not known.", "We also encountered limitations specific to our study. First, in using the  2008 SIPP Gold Standard Data to analyze the characteristics of female  Social Security beneficiaries, we were unable to analyze information for  approximately 6 percent of the female respondents age 62 and over who  did not provide their Social Security numbers because Census uses the  SSN to match the information respondents provide in the SIPP survey  with the information from administrative files. Second, in using the SCF  to evaluate changes in the retirement savings behavior of households, we  were unable to analyze the decisions of households to opt out of the  survivor benefit prior to 2001 due to changes in the SCF questionnaire. In  addition, in using the SCF to analyze near-retirement households, we  widened the age range we examined from 55-64 to 50-64 in some  instances to improve the precision of our estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Literature Review and Interviews", "paragraphs": ["To gain an understanding of the trends in marriage and labor force  participation and their implications for retirement security, we conducted  an extensive literature review and interviewed a range of experts.
