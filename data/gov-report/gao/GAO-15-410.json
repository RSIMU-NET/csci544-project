Projected completion has been delayed over 3 years to fall 2017.

Without security standards or other guidance to guide temporary facility construction in conflict environments, State inconsistently applied alternative security measures that resulted in insufficient and different levels of security for temporary offices and housing, as well as increased cost and extended schedules.

Industry standards cite the value of plans that comprehensively assess existing facilities, identify needs, and document decisions on meeting those needs. In Kabul, however, State constructed a guard facility without proper design review or applying for a building permit, leading to fire safety deficiencies that State corrected at extra cost. Finally, State formally assigns responsibility for strategic facilities planning but lacks policy that governs implementation of such planning.

In the report we examine (1) the extent to which construction  cost and schedule have changed and why, (2) State\u2019s use of temporary  facilities on-compound, and (3) State\u2019s planning for projected embassy  facility needs.", "To conduct this review, we obtained information from agency planning,  funding, and reporting documents and interviewed officials from State\u2019s  Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO); Bureau of Diplomatic  Security (DS); Office of Acquisitions Management; Bureau of South and  Central Asian Affairs (SCA); Office of the Special Representative for  Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP); and Office of Management Policy,  Rightsizing, and Innovation.

We also met with contractor officials in Kabul and in the United States. In  addition, our Kabul Field Office conducted follow-up meetings with  officials in Kabul and their successors through December 2014. We  incorporated audit work from our February trip and relevant material  gathered for our July 2014 report into this audit. In addition, we obtained  State funding information on all such projects over $1 million in Kabul. We  determined that these funding data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "To examine the extent to which construction cost and schedule have  changed and why, we collected and analyzed State and contractor  documents and met with relevant officials. We analyzed contract files for  the fiscal years 2009 and 2010 Kabul construction projects, including  requests for proposals, site surveys, project authorization documents,  design drawings, contract modifications, cost estimates, approved  schedules, and other contract documentation. We also examined OBO  and other State planning and oversight documents, such as space  requirements programs, trip reports, rightsizing reviews, site plans, OBO  briefings to State management, and progress reports. In addition, we  examined Office of Management and Budget and State policy and  procedures governing construction planning and implementation,  including those pertaining to value engineering (cost containment) and  risk assessment. We also met with relevant officials in OBO, DS, and  SCA, and in Kabul to discuss the original planning of the 2009 and 2010  contracts, as well as current construction progress.", "To examine State\u2019s use of temporary facilities at the embassy, we  inspected the temporary offices and housing currently on-compound and  reviewed related State planning, design, construction, and contract  documents for the temporary facilities within the 2009 contract. We also  reviewed State budget justifications to Congress related to State\u2019s use of  temporary facilities and security concerns about those facilities. In  addition, we examined State physical security and building standards for  State-built facilities, as well as Department of Defense security and  building standards for temporary facilities. We also obtained funding  information from State on what it has allocated to the construction of  temporary facilities in Kabul since 2002. In addition, we interviewed  embassy management officials, OBO\u2019s on-site project director for  construction, and OBO facility managers in Kabul. We also met with  OBO, DS, and SCA officials in Washington to discuss State\u2019s  construction, use, and plans for temporary facilities.", "To examine State\u2019s planning for projected embassy facility needs, we  analyzed State coordination and planning documents, as well as funding  proposals for new construction in Kabul. In addition, we reviewed State  policy regarding master planning and strategic facilities planning. We also  consulted best practices for such planning established by the  International Facility Management Association (IFMA), as well as GAO  and Office of Management and Budget capital planning guidance.discuss changing post facility needs and the various coordination efforts  to address those needs, we met with State officials from OBO, SCA,  SRAP, and DS, as well as with post officials responsible for management,  facilities, and security in Kabul.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to May 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
