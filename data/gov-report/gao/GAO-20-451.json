CNS was awarded the management and operating (M&O) contract for both the Y-12 National Security Complex (Y-12) in Tennessee and the Pantex Plant (Pantex) in Texas. Those savings represented about 80 percent of the approximately $640 million CNS proposed it would save through the end of fiscal year 2018. CNS achieved most of the savings through labor savings\u2014for example, by reducing positions. While CNS's and NNSA's methods for calculating and verifying savings evolved in the early years of the contract, GAO concluded the $515 million in reported cumulative savings represents a reasonable estimate. However, due to differences between proposed and achieved savings through fiscal year 2018, and annual savings projections that are lower for the remaining years of the contract, it may be difficult for the contractor to achieve its total proposed $2.9 billion in savings over the potential 10-year contract that would end in 2024.", "NNSA officials identified three key benefits of the Cost Savings Program\u2014achieving savings, reinvesting in site infrastructure, and increasing financial transparency\u2014but has not determined whether the program could be implemented at other sites to improve its M&O contracts. For example, NNSA officials said achieving cost savings at other sites could be useful, and most M&O contracts include a clause under which sites could implement a Cost Savings Program with some attributes of the program at Y-12 and Pantex. However, NNSA is not planning to implement the Cost Savings Program\u2014or a variation of it\u2014at other sites. NNSA officials and contractor representatives were uncertain about whether the Cost Savings Program could be exported to other existing or future contracts because NNSA has not gathered information on nor documented its analysis of the Cost Savings Program. GAO has previously found that leading organizations gather and analyze data to identify opportunities to reduce costs, among other reasons. By performing such an analysis, NNSA officials and contractors' representatives could make better-informed decisions about whether to implement aspects of the Cost Savings Program under existing contracts or as part of future M&O contracts to achieve additional savings in the future."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that NNSA document its analysis of the Cost Savings Program to determine whether it is exportable to other contracts.

NNSA\u2019s Production Office (NPO) is the federal field  office that provides local oversight of CNS operations at both sites. NNSA  entered into the consolidated contract at Y-12 and Pantex with several  objectives, one of which was to reduce the cost of performing work at  both sites. As a result, NNSA required that the contractor create a Cost  Savings Program to reduce costs and operate facilities in a more efficient  and effective manner, where process improvement is continuously  emphasized. CNS proposed that it would be able to save approximately  $2.9 billion over the potential 10-year contract.

In  September 2017, however, NNSA and CNS modified the contract so that  delivery of cost savings is only taken into consideration in conjunction  with CNS\u2019s performance, as documented in NNSA\u2019s annual Performance  Evaluation Reports, when deciding whether to extend CNS additional  option terms, also known as gateway decision points. NNSA officials  told us they made this modification prior to the first gateway decision in  September 2017 because CNS was very close to achieving 80 percent of  its proposed cost savings, but it was unclear if CNS would achieve 80  percent. In addition, the initial contract requirements placed equal  emphasis on cost savings and the contractor\u2019s performance in meeting  the mission, but NNSA officials said they do not view those two goals as  equal. Cost savings in and of themselves are only helpful\u2014and only  creditable under the contract\u2014if they do not negatively affect the mission,  and therefore NNSA officials do not view achieving cost savings as equal  to the contractor\u2019s performance in meeting the mission.

The Cost Reduction Proposal is to be updated annually, no  later than September 1 prior to the upcoming fiscal year. Each cost  reduction initiative has a defined lifecycle, from identification and  development to validation and sustainment.

The change control phase is continuous  throughout the fiscal year and allows CNS and NNSA to document and  trace changes to the scope, schedule, and cost that affect the Annual  Controlled Baseline and the Cost Reduction Proposal. Changes made  during this phase to the Annual Controlled Baseline and the Cost  Reduction Proposal are generally limited to changes outside of the control  of the contractor, including congressional direction or reprogramming,  changes to the programmatic mission, additional contractual  requirements, and any NNSA-directed or approved changes.", "Performance phase. During the performance phase, which is also  continuous throughout the year, the contractor is to report interim  performance against the approved cost reduction initiatives for NNSA to  evaluate accordingly, according to NNSA Cost Savings Program  procedures. This interim reporting allows NNSA to monitor potential  effects on the mission and offer feedback and course correction as  needed. NNSA and CNS officials responsible for the Cost Savings  Program collaborate regularly via biweekly meetings and tri-annual  reviews to monitor CNS\u2019s progress on cost reduction initiatives  throughout the fiscal year.

These reports detail the performance of the M&O contractor and  progress made against proposed cost savings targets, and list the  amount of savings CNS is claiming to have achieved in that fiscal year, to  include both annual new savings and savings sustained from prior years.  CNS is to submit the Validation Report for each previous fiscal year no  later than November 15.", "Verification phase. After the end of the fiscal year, between November  and January, NNSA uses verification checklists to review and verify  CNS\u2019s claimed savings for each cost reduction initiative. NNSA can use  these verification checklists to record, among other evidence, any  observations, interviews, document reviews, analyses, and  measurements that NNSA has undertaken to confirm the savings claimed  by CNS in the Validation Report. For each cost reduction initiative, NNSA  is to verify, among other things, that CNS implemented the initiative, that  the initiative resulted in efficiencies that produced cost savings, and that  the initiative did not negatively affect the mission. NNSA is also to verify  that CNS set aside the claimed savings. Additionally, NNSA is to verify  that CNS sustained savings claimed in prior years.

Upon completion of the verification phase, in January  and February, the distribution, or disposition, of net savings occurs in  accordance with the contract. Net savings are verified savings after  accounting for execution costs. The contract allows those verified net  savings to be shared among the government, the contractor, and site  reinvestment projects to improve Y-12 and Pantex.", "Under the contract provisions, NNSA is to verify and distribute only those  savings that remain after deducting the execution costs required to  administer, develop, or implement the cost reduction initiatives. For  example, the cost of purchasing a machine to automate a process that  will, in turn, save labor hours from the previous non-automated process  would be an execution cost. Therefore, NNSA-verified savings for each  cost reduction initiative should reflect net savings from having  implemented the initiative\u2014that is, the gross savings minus the execution  costs associated with the initiative.", "Verified net savings are to be distributed to the contractor, the  government, and for site reinvestment projects.", "Contractor.

The remaining approximately 30 percent of the  verified net savings is for site reinvestment projects. As noted above,  however, the site reinvestment share for savings related to employee  benefits is 50 percent.

In each fiscal year, CNS validates and NNSA  verifies sustained savings resulting from cost reduction initiatives  implemented in prior years. For example, CNS can claim sustained  savings for each year it does not hire back employees into positions  that were reduced in a prior year and for which CNS claimed savings.", "Cumulative contract savings. Cumulative contract savings is the  sum of all contract savings that have accumulated from annual new  savings and the sustainment of savings produced in prior years. For  example, annual new savings verified in fiscal year 2015 would be  multiplied by 10 if they are sustained through the life of the potential  10-year contract. Likewise, annual new savings verified in fiscal year  2016 would be multiplied by 9 if they are sustained through the life of  the potential 10-year contract, and so forth. These cumulative contract  savings are also known as \u201cgateway savings\u201d because NNSA  considers the verified cumulative contract savings when making  gateway decisions on whether or not to extend the contract for  possible option terms. Table 1 shows how CNS proposed it could  achieve approximately $2.9 billion over the life of the 10-year contract  using this method of calculating cumulative contract savings.", "Hard savings\u2014savings that directly reduce the overall cost of  operations\u2014are the only creditable type of savings under the contract.  NNSA is only to verify savings if they do not negatively affect the mission.  Examples of hard savings include a reduced number of personnel  working to conduct the same scope of work or fewer labor hours required  to complete a process due to operational efficiencies achieved, as well as  savings in benefits packages (e.g., by requiring employees contribute  more to their benefits). NNSA and CNS classify hard savings into four  categories: (1) labor, (2) benefits, (3) supply chain, and (4) non-labor (see  sidebar). generated by leveraging collective buying  power agreements, utilizing competitive  sourcing tools, and taking other actions to  reduce the price of goods purchased. For  example, in fiscal year 2016, CNS noted  in its Validation Report that it used  strategic sourcing to realize procurement  savings. known as demand management  savings\u2014are savings generated through  reductions in purchased materials  quantities, subcontract costs, or licenses.  For example, in fiscal year 2016, CNS  assumed responsibility for some  information technology work\u2014including,  among others, help desk support and  network administration\u2014that had been  previously handled by subcontractors.  Doing so reduced contract costs because  CNS was able to perform the work at a  lower cost than the subcontractor. products or services such as, for example, slowing the rate of a cost  increase. NNSA officials said another example of a cost avoidance  would be if the contractor has the option to buy more expensive  airplane tickets for travel between the two sites but chooses to buy  less expensive airplane tickets; the difference between the most  expensive option and the actual tickets purchased is a cost avoidance  and not considered hard savings that would be creditable under the  contract."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CNS Has Achieved Most of Its Proposed Savings, and Changes to Oversight and Methodologies Have Addressed Some Problems That May Affect Actual Savings", "paragraphs": ["NNSA verified approximately $170 million in annual new savings and  approximately $515 million in cumulative contract savings from fiscal year  2014 through fiscal year 2018.

As of the end of fiscal year 2018, NNSA  verified approximately $515 million in cumulative contract savings (see  table 2).", "We found that this $515 million in cumulative contract savings represents  a reasonable estimate of the cumulative savings achieved. As part of our  review, we traced information from 22 of about 90 cost reduction  initiatives for which CNS claimed savings to source documents and  reconciled discrepancies with NNSA and CNS officials to understand how  NNSA verified the cost savings. Further, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s  documented procedures for verifying CNS\u2019s reported data and  interviewed officials about that process. Additionally, other reviews  provide support that NNSA\u2019s reported $515 million in cumulative contract  savings is a reasonable estimate of savings achieved. Specifically, as  part of the savings verification process, NNSA\u2019s federal cost accountants  ensured that CNS had set aside the money associated with the cost  savings and confirmed that the funds were available for distribution under  the cost-savings sharing arrangement. DCAA also reviewed CNS\u2019s  claimed cost savings for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and NNSA and  DCAA officials said the two entities used similar methods and came to  similar conclusions.", "Labor savings, which include reductions in positions, comprised the  largest portion of savings, at nearly two-thirds of the cumulative contract  savings achieved from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018. Savings  through changes to employee benefits comprised nearly a quarter of total  cumulative contract savings over the period (see fig. 4).", "NNSA documents we examined showed that CNS, the government, and  site reinvestment projects received a certain share of the $515 million in  cumulative contract savings that NNSA verified from fiscal year 2014  through fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the terms of the contract.  According to NNSA, approximately $262 million of the $515 million was  available for the three parties to share during this period. The amount  available to the three parties is determined by sharing periods of no more  than 2 years negotiated for different categories of savings under the  contract. According to NNSA documents, CNS earned about $78 million  in cost-savings incentive fees, the government received about $97 million  in savings, and site reinvestment projects received about $88 million of  the available savings from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018 (see  fig. 5).

Specifically,  CNS proposed approximately $67 million in cumulative contract savings  through fiscal year 2015 and NNSA verified approximately $78 million.", "From fiscal years 2016 through 2018, however, CNS achieved less in  cumulative contract savings than it proposed (see fig. 6).", "As described above, achieving approximately $2.9 billion in savings over  the life of the contract assumed meeting all proposed annual new savings  targets and fully sustaining those savings in each year of the contract.

CNS proposed it could save $594 million over the  life of the contract through adjustments to employee benefits, but as  of March 2020, CNS officials told us that CNS\u2019s projected benefits  savings would total $399 million over the entire 10-year contract, a  decrease of almost $200 million from its proposal. According to these  officials, several factors have contributed to CNS\u2019s decreased benefits  savings estimate, including delays in bargaining unit transition to  benefit plans and rates and a decrease in employee contributions to  pensions, among other reasons.", "Fiscal year 2016 labor savings. In fiscal year 2016, CNS claimed  approximately $30 million in new labor savings based on a claimed  reduction of 283 full-time equivalent employees, but NNSA rejected all  of those savings. According to the fiscal year 2016 NNSA Verification  Report, CNS failed to realize efficiencies that resulted in full-time  equivalent growth in other areas, which offset CNS\u2019s claim of new  labor savings. Rejection of these fiscal year 2016 labor savings  could result in a loss of approximately $270 million in cumulative  savings through the end of the potential 10-year contract period when  factoring in potential sustained savings.", "NNSA officials emphasized that any amount of cost savings is beneficial  to the government and that NNSA\u2019s priority for CNS is safe and secure  performance of its mission. NNSA officials noted that if CNS does not  implement any additional cost reduction initiatives and sustains the  savings from all previously-implemented cost reduction initiatives, CNS  will still save about $1.7 billion through fiscal year 2024.", "CNS officials told us that CNS will continue to work toward its cumulative  proposed savings of approximately $2.9 billion and hopes to meet or  exceed that estimate. According to these officials, doing so will allow CNS  to realize its proposed savings and provide the maximum benefit to the  government and taxpayers. To achieve its proposed savings, CNS would  need to sustain all previously implemented savings, achieve verified  annual new savings of approximately $57 million per year every year, and  sustain those additional savings through 2024. However, CNS\u2019s  proposed annual new savings are substantially lower for fiscal year 2019  through the end of the contract (averaging about $30 million per year)  than they were from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018. This  decrease is, in part, because many cost reduction initiatives with high  savings potential\u2014such as labor streamlining and changes to employee  benefits\u2014have been implemented. For example, CNS eliminated 270  positions and provided voluntary separation severance packages to  another 182 employees in fiscal year 2014. This accounted for more than  40 percent ($221 million) of the cumulative contract savings because  CNS sustained those savings in fiscal years 2015 through 2018. CNS has  already implemented many cost reduction initiatives with high savings  potential, so it may be difficult for CNS to meet its proposed cumulative  contract savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodologies for Calculating Cost Savings and NNSA\u2019s Oversight of the Program Have Evolved to Address Factors That May Affect Actual Contract Savings", "paragraphs": ["CNS and NNSA initially encountered problems with calculating and  verifying cost savings\u2014problems that may affect actual contract  savings\u2014but methods for calculating and verifying savings have evolved,  and NNSA\u2019s oversight of the Cost Savings Program has improved.  Specifically, CNS and NNSA initially encountered problems\u2014which have  largely been addressed\u2014with:  (1) calculating and verifying execution costs;  (2) calculating and verifying labor savings; and  (3) communicating and collaborating about the Cost Savings Program  throughout the year.", "Calculating and verifying execution costs. NNSA encountered early  problems with verifying execution costs for CNS\u2019s cost savings initiatives,  but CNS changed its methodology for calculating execution costs each  year that ultimately addressed those problems. Since the contract\u2019s  inception, CNS has relied on a subcontractor to operate much of the Cost  Savings Program. In fiscal year 2014, costs for this subcontractor  totaled approximately $7 million. CNS believed that approximately  $546,000 of the $7 million should be considered execution costs and  counted against the cost savings for that year, but NNSA believed the  entire $7 million should be considered execution costs. NNSA and CNS  reached agreement that a proportional factor\u201419.3 percent\u2014of the  subcontractor\u2019s time was spent on activities that would qualify as  execution activities under the contract for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.  NNSA instructed CNS to capture and report the subcontractor\u2019s actual  execution costs beginning in fiscal year 2016. CNS began using the  subcontract\u2019s actual execution costs in fiscal year 2016, according to  NNSA officials. However, NNSA officials said CNS used a proportional  factor of the subcontract\u2019s execution costs from previous years to  estimate the execution costs of CNS employees for fiscal year 2016.  NNSA noted in its fiscal year 2016 Verification Report that using the  proportional factor approach for estimating execution costs may not  reflect the actual execution costs. CNS officials said they believe this  estimation was conservative because it resulted in higher CNS  administrative and development costs than subsequent years.", "Additionally, in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, CNS reported estimates for its  total execution costs rather than tracking the actual execution costs for  each individual cost reduction initiative, which NNSA officials said made it  difficult to verify net savings. In fiscal year 2017, CNS developed a  methodology for allocating execution costs\u2014administrative costs,  implementation costs, and development costs\u2014to individual cost reduction initiatives and began reporting execution costs at this level in  the fiscal year 2017 Validation Report. According to NNSA officials, CNS  also began reporting execution costs by individual cost reduction initiative  for its subcontractor beginning in fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2018,  CNS developed execution cost charge codes that allowed CNS to report  actual hours spent on cost reduction initiative execution activities\u2014 including amounts for its subcontractor\u2014for the first time since the  contract began. NNSA officials told us that they are generally satisfied  with the way CNS is now capturing execution costs and that the use of  charge codes has improved their confidence in CNS\u2019s reporting of certain  execution costs. However, CNS\u2019s use of the proportional factor of 19.3  percent of the subcontractor\u2019s execution costs, lack of detail on execution  costs for individual cost reduction initiatives, and use of estimated\u2014rather  than actual\u2014execution costs could mean that the actual execution costs  for fiscal years 2014 through 2017 are not fully captured in reported  cumulative savings and actual contract savings could be higher or lower  than the reported amount. Even if the actual contract savings are higher  or lower than the reported amount, we believe $515 million is a  reasonable estimate of the savings achieved to date.", "Calculating and verifying labor savings. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015,  CNS used a headcount methodology to calculate labor savings and  demonstrate sustainment of those savings. Using a headcount  methodology, CNS could claim labor savings if it could demonstrate and  maintain a reduced number of employees to conduct the same scope of  work. According to NNSA and CNS officials, one potential problem with  using a headcount approach is that CNS could maintain a reduced  number of staff but have those staff work overtime. If this occurred, it  would result in overall increased contract costs, thereby reducing the net  savings from the cost reduction initiative. In fiscal year 2016, CNS  modified its methodology for calculating labor savings to use labor hours  rather than employee headcounts. Under this modified approach, CNS  could claim labor savings if it could demonstrate and maintain reduced  labor hours regardless of the number of employees, a method that NNSA  and CNS officials said is a better measure of labor savings. However,  under this methodology, CNS calculated labor savings based on planned,  rather than actual, reductions in labor hours. In fiscal year 2017, CNS  modified its methodology again to begin using actual reduced labor hours  rather than planned reduced labor hours. However, CNS\u2019s use of  headcounts and planned, rather than actual, reduction in labor hours  could mean that the labor savings for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 are  not accurately reflected in the verified cumulative contract savings, and  actual contract savings could be higher or lower than the reported  amount. As noted above, even if the actual contract savings are higher or  lower than the reported amount, we believe $515 million is a reasonable  estimate of the savings achieved to date.", "Communicating and collaborating about the Cost Savings Program.  According to NNSA officials, early years of the contract were marked by  limited oversight and poor communication between NNSA and CNS. CNS  delegated responsibility for the Cost Savings Program to a subcontractor,  and according to NNSA and CNS officials, CNS had limited involvement  in the Cost Savings Program and did not communicate with NNSA about  cost savings matters. Similarly, NNSA officials told us that one or two  individuals at NNSA managed the cost savings component of the contract  for the federal government and that communication was poor between  those individuals and the technical personnel responsible for evaluating  the implementation of CNS\u2019s cost reduction initiatives. As a result of this  limited oversight and communication, NNSA officials said CNS did not  understand NNSA\u2019s expectations for cost savings data and had to submit  five iterations of its first Validation Report.", "In fiscal year 2017, NNSA established a collaborative working team\u2014 known as the Integrated Project Team and consisting of personnel from  NNSA and CNS\u2014which meets biweekly to discuss issues related to the  Cost Savings Program. Also in fiscal year 2017, NNSA began conducting  tri-annual reviews of active cost reduction initiatives. For these reviews,  CNS submits performance reports and briefs knowledgeable NNSA  officials on the status of individual cost reduction initiatives. NNSA uses  this information to identify potential gaps in cost-savings reporting data  and, among other things, informs CNS of any concerns with its  methodology or NNSA\u2019s ability to verify the cost savings. NNSA officials stated that the increased collaboration and more frequent communication  has resulted in improved Validation Reports and fewer revisions. For  example, NNSA stated in its fiscal year 2017 Verification Report that the  quality and completeness of CNS\u2019s fiscal year 2017 Validation Report  \u201cdemonstrated substantial improvement\u201d over the fiscal year 2016 report.", "While CNS\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s methods for calculating and verifying savings  and conducting oversight evolved in the early years of the contract to  improve the accuracy of cost savings calculations, we believe the $515  million in reported cumulative savings represents a reasonable estimate  of the contract savings achieved to date for reasons we described  earlier."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NNSA Identified Benefits of the Cost Savings Program but Has Not Fully Used Them to Improve M&O Contracts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Identified Three Key Benefits of the Y-12 and Pantex Cost Savings Program but Has Not Planned on How Best to Use Site Reinvestment Funds", "paragraphs": ["NNSA officials said three key benefits of the Cost Savings Program are  (1) achieving savings;  (2) increasing financial transparency; and  (3) funding site reinvestment projects.", "Achieving savings. As discussed previously, the Cost Savings Program  resulted in total new annual savings of approximately $170 million and  $515 million in cumulative contract savings, from fiscal year 2014 through  fiscal year 2018. According to NNSA officials, these cost savings would  not have materialized without the Cost Savings Program. We have  previously found that DOE could better assess M&O contractors\u2019 cost  performance\u2014i.e., their performance on spending, budgeting, strategic  sourcing, and cost-effectiveness\u2014to help strengthen contractor oversight  and better inform acquisitions decisions. Demonstrating contractors\u2019  efforts to achieve cost savings and NNSA\u2019s associated efforts to evaluate  contractors\u2019 cost effectiveness provides evidence that for the CNS  contract, NNSA is placing importance on cost performance while overall  resource needs are increasing. For example, NNSA has identified an  increasing weapons program workload and a need to recapitalize or  replace aging facilities and equipment to meet nuclear weapons  modernization programs over the next decades. To help achieve these  goals, NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2021 budget request included a 25 percent  increase for NNSA\u2019s weapons activities appropriation, which funds  programs at NNSA sites including Pantex and Y-12. Identifying cost  savings could help NNSA minimize budget increases in an era of  increasing workload and assure congressional decision-makers that  NNSA is working to effectively steward federal resources.", "Increasing financial transparency. Because of the Cost Savings  Program, which required the establishment of the Annual Controlled  Baseline in order to measure potential savings, NNSA has better and  more thorough information on the costs of running the two sites, NPO  officials said. The Annual Controlled Baseline provides more information  because in order to demonstrate savings CNS had to first establish a cost  baseline, which required complete information on funding streams as well  as how certain rate structures are established, according to NPO officials.  Officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project Management also  said this was the first time that NNSA has been able to gain insight into  the actual costs of certain activities at Y-12 and Pantex, as a result of the  Annual Controlled Baseline being established. None of the other M&O  sites have an established site-wide baseline against which to measure  costs or cost savings, according to NNSA and M&O officials we  interviewed. Officials from the Office of Acquisition and Project  Management said having an Annual Controlled Baseline at other sites would give them additional insight into the cost of certain activities, as  opposed to the traditional budget-based view they have into M&O  activities. At other M&O sites, NNSA uses a budget-based model, which  consists of the government obligating a certain amount of money and  getting as much product or service for that amount of money as the sites  will provide, NNSA officials said. Instead, NNSA is employing a cost- based model at Y-12 and Pantex, which involves determining the cost to  produce a certain amount of product, NNSA officials explained.", "Funding site reinvestment projects. As part of the Cost Savings  Program, a certain percentage of the achieved savings is reinvested back  into the sites. According to NNSA officials, this process has allowed  NNSA to allocate funds to site reinvestment projects to improve the Y-12  and Pantex sites\u2019 aging infrastructure. As of fiscal year 2019, NNSA  reported about a $4.8 billion deferred maintenance backlog throughout  the nuclear security enterprise. We previously found that facilities  considered not mission dependent\u2014such as cafeterias, parking  structures and excess facilities\u2014comprised about 40 percent of the  deferred maintenance backlog. NNSA officials said addressing deferred  maintenance at these types of facilities is low priority, beyond keeping  facilities in a safe condition, because the agency targets scarce budgetary  resources to mission critical facilities. According to NNSA officials, NNSA  would not likely have allocated funds for these site reinvestment projects  at Y-12 and Pantex without the Cost Savings Program because they are  often considered lower priority projects. As a result, the nuclear security  enterprise as a whole potentially benefits from these site reinvestment  projects at Y-12 and Pantex since those reinvestment projects serve to  reduce overall deferred maintenance and potentially make funds available  for projects to address aging infrastructure at other sites.", "Site reinvestment projects may lead to additional cost savings as well,  NNSA officials said, if, for example, NNSA uses site reinvestment funds  to purchase a machine that automates a process and saves labor hours  as a result. For example, NNSA invested in a machine to replace three  different machines that were previously required to produce a screw. This  improved throughput and turnaround time and saved labor hours,  according to NNSA documentation.", "NNSA approved a total of 80 site reinvestment projects at Y-12 and  Pantex as of April 2020, for a total of approximately $75 million that was  available for reinvestment into the sites. For example, CNS used about  $1.2 million in site reinvestment funds to replace analog cameras along  Y-12\u2019s perimeter fencing with digital cameras (see fig. 7). This site  reinvestment project improved physical security and reduced camera  maintenance costs, as well as the security team\u2019s ability to assess alarms  and manage alarm response, according to NPO documentation. Because  the analog cameras were still functioning, they may have otherwise been  a lower priority to replace without the site reinvestment funding, NPO  officials said.", "In addition, the John C. Drummond Center, a new administrative support  complex at Pantex, was partially built with savings from the Cost Savings  Program (see fig. 8). According to NNSA documentation, the new facility  helps eliminate approximately $20 million in deferred maintenance costs  of the older administrative buildings it replaced.", "Although NNSA identified site reinvestment projects as one of the key  benefits of the Cost Savings Program, NNSA and CNS had not  committed approximately $13 million of site reinvestment funds available  at Y-12 and Pantex as of April 2020. NNSA and CNS had not yet  committed the site reinvestment funds to specific project efforts, in part  because they have not evaluated how best to use the remaining available  site reinvestment funds or developed a plan for doing so. The $13 million  is currently distributed across several different layers of accounts, in  some cases in amounts too small to execute a site reinvestment project.  To aggregate the funds in amounts large enough for certain projects,  NNSA may need to move funding from one account to another.", "The funds for site reinvestment projects are distributed in accordance with  the terms of the contract and are spread across different programs,  projects, or activities (PPA). Beneath the PPA is the DOE budget and  reporting code level, which DOE also tracks in its official accounting  system (see fig. 9).", "According to NNSA officials, there were 68 PPAs with 97 budget and  reporting codes underneath them that, as of April 2020, had funds  available for site reinvestment. According to NNSA officials and CNS  representatives, this distribution makes it difficult to use all of the site  reinvestment funds. This difficulty is because a given site reinvestment  project may require funds to be aggregated across budget and reporting  codes in order to have enough funds for executing the project, and while  NNSA can move funds between budget and reporting codes that are  within the same PPA, movement of funds among PPAs (reprogramming)  could require congressional approval.", "As of April 2020, of the 68 PPAs with available funds for site  reinvestment, 17 (or about 25 percent) had multiple budget and reporting  codes underneath them, according to NNSA officials. Those 17 PPAs had  between 2 to 6 budget and reporting codes underneath them, according  to those officials (see fig. 10).", "We have previously found that comprehensive plans can help  organizations identify potential problems before they occur and target  limited resources. A comprehensive plan can also detail milestones and  key goals, which provide meaningful guidance for planning and  measuring progress. Such plans can establish deadlines for achieving  objectives and assign responsibility for any implementation. Most of  NNSA\u2019s appropriations are \u201cno-year funds\u201d and are, therefore, available  for obligation until expended. Without evaluating and developing a plan  for how best to use funds for site reinvestment projects\u2014to include  determining whether to reprogram funds\u2014NNSA and CNS are not fully  utilizing available site reinvestment funds, and the funds could be  rescinded from NNSA\u2019s appropriations in later years if the unspent  balances persist.", "NNSA has not sought congressional approval to combine site  reinvestment money across different PPAs in order to aggregate these  funds to execute larger site reinvestment projects, officials said. Also,  while NNSA moves funds weekly between budget and reporting codes  that are within the same PPA to execute its work, officials said NNSA has  not moved any site reinvestment funds from different budget and  reporting codes within the same PPA to fund site reinvestment projects.  Once NNSA develops a plan on how best to aggregate or use the  remaining and potential future site reinvestment funds, it would be better  positioned to: move some funds between budget and reporting codes within the  reprogram funds between PPAs, including seeking congressional  approval where it may be required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Is Not Fully Using Information on the Benefits of the Cost Savings Program to Improve M&O Contracts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NNSA Has Not Analyzed Whether to Implement the Cost Savings Program in Other Existing or Future M&O Contracts", "paragraphs": ["NNSA officials identified the achievement of cost savings as a benefit of  the Cost Savings Program that could be useful at other sites and to the  nuclear security enterprise generally; however, the officials said they are  not planning to implement the Cost Savings Program as part of other  future or existing M&O contracts. Most existing NNSA M&O contracts  include a \u201cCost Reduction\u201d clause, under which sites could implement a  Cost Savings Program with some attributes of the program at Y-12 and  Pantex. According to GAO\u2019s Framework for Assessing the Acquisition  Function at Federal Agencies, leading organizations gather and analyze  data to identify opportunities to reduce costs, among other reasons.  Further, the framework states that incomplete data can prevent an  agency from maximizing information tools for strategic acquisition  planning and analysis.", "According to officials from the Office of Acquisition and Project  Management, they do not plan to implement the Cost Savings Program or  anything similar to it as part of future M&O contracts because of  uncertainties regarding (1) the opportunities for similar savings at other  sites and (2) the federal costs involved in implementing and overseeing  the Cost Savings Program\u2014including the time and effort needed to verify  cost savings\u2014and how these costs affect the overall net savings.", "NNSA site officials and contractor representatives we interviewed also  raised questions about these issues. For example, according to NNSA  officials and representatives at two sites, the Cost Savings Program may  not be exportable to other sites, in part because other sites may not be  able to identify cost savings initiatives that would yield the same level of  savings as at Y-12 and Pantex. The officials believed that much of the  savings identified at those sites resulted from merger savings\u2014savings  stemming from consolidating the two sites\u2014that would not be possible  without combining two sites under one contract. However, as mentioned  previously, our analysis found that the majority\u2014about 90 percent\u2014of  annual savings at Y-12 and Pantex resulted from transformation  initiatives, or savings based on improving standardization, quality, and  efficiency. Merger savings contributed only about 10 percent of the total  new annual savings identified from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year  2018.", "NNSA officials and contractor representatives at other NNSA sites also  raised questions about whether the cost of implementing and maintaining  a formal cost savings program might outweigh the benefits at a site.  According to NNSA officials, a large number of government employees  are involved in implementing and overseeing the Cost Savings Program.  According to an official from the Office of Acquisition and Project  Management, NNSA has not analyzed the total costs of implementing the  Cost Savings Program, including the costs associated with the  government effort to oversee the program. For the Cost Savings  Program, NNSA verifies net savings after accounting for CNS\u2019s execution  costs. However, the verified savings do not take into consideration federal  costs for implementing, maintaining, and overseeing the Cost Savings  Program. To provide a sense of the scope of the oversight effort, NPO  officials said about 100 of the approximately 130 employees at NPO at  the end of fiscal year 2018 had some role in the Cost Savings Program,  although only one full-time position is dedicated to the Cost Savings  Program.", "Further, NNSA is likely to start its acquisition planning for some M&O  contracts in 2022 and 2023. However, NNSA officials, as well as site  officials, were uncertain about whether the Cost Savings Program could  be exported to other existing or future contracts, including the cost  effectiveness of the program, because NNSA has not gathered  information on and documented analysis of the costs and potential  benefits of the Cost Savings Program.

For example, at Pantex, the contractor discovered it could conduct  fewer recurring injections of treatment wells but still achieve the same  technical results and comply with standards, according to NNSA officials.  This initiative saved over $500,000, according to NNSA\u2019s Verification  Report.

Although officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition and Project  Management said it would be beneficial to have the Annual Controlled  Baseline at other sites in order to gain additional insight into the cost of  certain activities, they believed a drawback to requiring other sites to  institute such a baseline would be deploying the considerable effort and  resources to establish the baseline similar to those that were required at  Y-12 and Pantex.", "NNSA has not evaluated whether to require the other sites to have an  Annual Controlled Baseline, either for the entire site or for certain  programs at different sites. The 2019 DOE Acquisition Guide states that  in the context of acquisition planning, good technical, schedule, and cost  baselines are essential for developing realistic and measureable targets.  By evaluating whether to require all sites to implement an Annual  Controlled Baseline, either for the entire site or for certain programs at the  different sites, NNSA may be in a better position to achieve greater  financial transparency at sites across the nuclear security enterprise. This  action, in turn, could potentially identify opportunities for cost savings,  help NNSA better understand their contractors\u2019 cost performance, and  help the agency administer its sites more efficiently."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the Cost Savings Program at Y-12 and Pantex has  realized hundreds of millions in savings to the nuclear security enterprise,  dozens of site reinvestment projects, and increased financial  transparency. Although NNSA has identified site reinvestment projects as  one of the key benefits of the Cost Savings Program, NNSA and CNS  have not committed approximately $13 million of site reinvestment funds  available at Y-12 and Pantex, in part because they have not evaluated  and developed a plan on how best to aggregate and use the funds. If  NNSA develops a plan on how best to use the remaining and potential  future available site reinvestment funds, it would be better positioned to  aggregate funds for site reinvestment projects. Further, if funds for site  reinvestment projects persist in PPAs for too long, NNSA risks their  rescission in future years\u2019 appropriations.", "NNSA officials were uncertain about whether the Cost Savings Program  could be exported to other existing or future contracts, including the cost  effectiveness of the program, because NNSA has not gathered  information on and documented its analysis of the costs and potential  benefits of the Cost Savings Program.

However, in its  written comments, NNSA stated that the Cost Savings Program was  uniquely intertwined with the consolidation of the two sites, Y-12 and  Pantex, under one contract. As we discussed in the report, roughly 90  percent of the savings from the Cost Savings Program were attributed to  transforming site operations to create a more efficient and sustainable  enterprise, and not associated with merging the two sites. We continue to  believe that by gathering data and documenting an analysis of the Cost  Savings Program for its exportability, NNSA will be able to make better- informed decisions about whether to implement the program at other  existing or future contracts.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of NNSA, and  other interested parties.
