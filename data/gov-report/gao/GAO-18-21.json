U.S. regulations require the stores to have procedures to provide reasonable assurance of export of cigarettes and the exporter to report export information on transactions valued at over $2,500. U.S. Census Bureau (Census) data show that about 18,500 such transactions involving cigarettes occurred from 2010 to 2015. According to information from U.S. and Mexican officials, the Mexican government limits the amount of duty-free cigarettes that can be brought into Mexico (see figure). U.S. agencies identified three schemes to evade U.S. and Mexican cigarette-related tax and other laws: (1) diversion from a duty-free store into U.S. commerce; (2) smuggling into Mexico through U.S. ports; and (3) smuggling back into the United States after export to Mexico.", "U.S. agency officials said that some smuggling of duty-free cigarettes across the southwest border has links to organized crime, supplies the illicit tobacco market in Mexico, and poses oversight and enforcement challenges.

Inexpensive cigarettes made in the United States are part of the trade in duty-free cigarettes along the southwest border, including brands that a Mexican official stated are prohibited for sale in Mexico.

From 2007  through January 2017, the price adjustment factor for cigarettes was  $11.46\u2014about one-fourth of its current value\u2014with a minimum of $8.87  and a maximum of $27.39.", "Census\u2019s current price range for cigarettes is not appropriate for cleaning  data to analyze trends in duty-free cigarette exports because it may  significantly underestimate a reasonable expected price range for  cigarettes. Approximately 39 percent of the observations in the  unprocessed, duty-free cigarette data are associated with sales prices  below Census\u2019s minimum price or above Census\u2019s maximum price. We  estimated minimum and maximum expected prices for cigarettes that are  substantially greater than Census\u2019s current price adjustment factor range  for cigarettes.", "To estimate a minimum expected price for cigarettes, we examined  commodity prices, production costs, and revenue data from a large,  publicly traded cigarette manufacturer. We found that the  manufacturing cost of cigarettes exceeded Census\u2019s estimated  minimum sales price by 30 percent, $14.26 per 1,000 cigarette sticks  instead of $11. Thus, even if the manufacturer sold its cigarettes  directly to a duty-free store, and neither the manufacturer nor the  duty-free store made a profit, we would still expect a price greater  than Census\u2019s lower bound.", "This expected minimum retail price increases significantly if we  account for cigarette manufacturers\u2019 revenue. Using revenue data  from the public accounting statements of the same manufacturer, and  again conservatively assuming direct sales to a duty-free store that  itself sells for no profit, we would expect to see a price of $43.65 per  1,000 cigarette sticks, which is nearly 300 percent greater than  Census\u2019s lower bound of $11 per 1,000 cigarette sticks and about 9  percent larger than Census\u2019s current price adjustment factor of $40  per 1,000 sticks.", "To estimate a maximum expected price for cigarettes, we examined  the price of a premium cigarette brand listed for sale on a duty-free  store\u2019s website. We found that this price was 163 percent higher than  the upper bound in Census\u2019s price range, $197.50 per 1,000 cigarette  sticks instead of $75 per 1,000 sticks.", "For any observed prices in trade data outside of this expected range for a  given tariff code, Census officials said that they attempt to correct these  observations by adjusting the reported quantity such that the reported  price is equal to the price adjustment factor\u2014$40 per 1,000 cigarette  sticks. For example, if a reported sale is $80 per 1,000 cigarette sticks,  Census will adjust the reported quantity to 2,000 sticks while leaving the  reported value unchanged, so the reported price (value divided by  quantity) becomes $40 for each unit of 1,000 sticks. Census officials  stated that this data cleaning process is sufficient for their use in  producing aggregated trade statistics because of the volume of  transactions they must review and the ease with which Census analysts  can apply this method to clean trade data.", "Census\u2019s process of correcting missing or outlying data (unreliable data)  with its price adjustment factor is not appropriate for our use because it  would significantly alter the relationships among subgroups within our  data, distorting trends that we otherwise would intend to analyze. For  example, in a hypothetical dataset where the average sales price is $40  per 1,000 cigarette sticks across exports from the United States,  Census\u2019s replacement of missing and outlying data using a price  adjustment factor of $40 would not change this overall average. But if one  state in the data has an average sales price lower than the national  average, reflecting lower costs of doing business, any missing or outlying  data replaced with the same price adjustment factor as other higher  costing states would increase the state\u2019s reported average sales price.  The distinction between high-price states and low-price states would thus  become less clear.", "Moreover, we cannot determine the appropriateness of Census\u2019s decision  to preserve reported value and adjust reported quantity when processing  data to manage the relationship between value, quantity, and price. This  is because we cannot determine whether the unprocessed value or the  unprocessed quantity data are reliable. Applying our minimum expected  price for cigarettes, discussed above, excludes many transactions in the  unprocessed data, indicating problems with value, quantity, or both.  Census officials stated that they believe the value data are more reliable  than the quantity data and so change the reported quantity data when  processing the data, though they also stated that this is a general  assumption without specific insight as to whether or why this method may  be valid for cigarettes. While CBP officials stated that high-level postaudit  checks can be used to ensure that a store\u2019s AES system is working  properly, they said that these checks are rare, and the inventory control  system compliance review does not otherwise provide assurance that  data self-reported into AES are reliable. CBP officials stated that they  were not confident about which transaction data in AES were more  reliable: value or quantity. Because neither agency\u2019s control process  provides strong assurance that either the value or the quantity data are  reliable for our use, we cannot appropriately use value, quantity, or price  as a benchmark to correct the other variables."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluating Alternative Data-Processing Techniques", "paragraphs": ["Alternative methods for determining appropriate replacement values for  outlying data, referred to as imputation, would not make the duty-free  cigarette data reliable for our intended use. For example, stochastic  regression imputation replaces a missing or excluded variable value  within an observation by drawing randomly from within the error  distribution of a best-fit model. Correctly specifying such a model allows  data processing to occur while preserving the dataset\u2019s overall average  values, correlations, and variation. However, identifying the observations  that require correction remains a challenge. As discussed above, we can  estimate the approximate manufacturer\u2019s sales price for cigarettes. In the  absence of additional proprietary data, we are unable to determine a price  range that accounts for retail store costs and profit. Without this  information, and given that the duty-free cigarette data include significant  and questionable variation of reported prices even within our estimated  price band, it is not possible to identify which observations require  correction or deletion with appropriate levels of confidence. Lacking a  clear basis for finding either the value data or quantity data reliable, we  also cannot appropriately determine how to manage the relationship  between value and quantity if we were to impute replacement price levels  for these observations."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Emil Friberg (Assistant Director),  Farhanaz Kermalli (Analyst-in-Charge), Giff Howland, David Dayton, Neil  Doherty, Andrew Kurtzman, and Grace Lui made key contributions to this  report.
