We previously  reported that, from 2010 through 2013, enrollment in most states was  concentrated among the largest issuers in each of the three types of  health insurance markets: the large group market (coverage offered by  large employers), the small group market (coverage offered by small  employers), and the individual market (consisting mainly of coverage sold  directly to individual consumers who lack access to group coverage). We  also reported that these trends continued in 2014, which was the first year  in which a number of provisions from the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA) took effect. For example, we found that  enrollment was similarly concentrated among a small number of issuers  during the first year of operation of the health insurance exchanges that  were created under PPACA. Health insurance exchanges are markets  that operate within each state\u2019s overall individual and small group market  where eligible individuals and small employers can compare and select  among qualified insurance plans offered by participating issuers. A highly  concentrated insurance market may indicate less competition and could  affect consumers\u2019 choice of issuers and the premiums they pay.", "PPACA also included a provision for us to conduct a study on competition  and concentration in health insurance markets. For the current study, we  describe changes in the concentration of enrollment among issuers in  each state\u2019s:  1.  overall individual health insurance market, including the individual  2.  overall small group health insurance market, including the small group  3.  overall large group health insurance market.", "To analyze changes in concentration in the overall individual, small group,  and large group markets in each state, we analyzed 2015 and 2016  Medical Loss Ratio data that PPACA requires issuers to report annually  to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Data for 2016 were the most  recently available at the time of our analysis. We previously analyzed  2011 through 2014 data from this same source in our prior reports on  concentration; we present that information alongside our new analyses in  this report. Within the overall individual, small group, and large group  markets for each of the 51 states, we determined the state-level market  share for each issuer by calculating the ratio of the total number of  covered life-years for each issuer in a state to the total number of covered  life-years in that state.", "To analyze changes in concentration in the individual market exchanges,  we obtained data from CMS and states for 2015, 2016, and 2017, the  most recently available at the time of our analyses. CMS operated  individual market exchanges\u2014referred to as federally facilitated  exchanges\u2014in about three-quarters of states. For these states, CMS  provided us with data from its data warehouse, the Multidimensional  Insurance Data Analytics System, for each enrollee who obtained health  insurance coverage through federally facilitated exchanges for 2015,  2016, or 2017. These data included, among other information, the  enrollees\u2019 coverage start and end dates, the issuers from which the  enrollees purchased coverage, and the states and rating areas\u2014 geographic areas established by states and used, in part, by issuers to  set premium rates\u2014in which the enrollees lived. For the remaining  states, which operated their own individual market exchanges, each state  generally provided us with comparable enrollment data by rating area.  We used the CMS and state data to calculate the total number of issuers  that participated in each state and rating area, as well as each issuer\u2019s  market share\u2014measured using covered life-years\u2014within the state and  each rating area. Rating areas represent defined localized markets within  a state and issuer participation can vary across rating areas. Market  concentration can vary by rating area and the largest issuer in the state  may not be the largest issuer in every rating area. To account for this  variability, for our analyses of the number of issuers and issuer market  share in each state\u2019s individual market exchange, we calculated averages  across rating areas that were weighted for differences in the size of total  enrollment in each rating area. For example, to obtain the average market  share of the largest issuer in a state\u2019s rating areas, we calculated the  market share of the largest issuer in each rating area in the state and  then calculated the average of those market shares, weighted by the  number of covered life-years in each rating area.", "To analyze changes in concentration in the small group exchanges\u2014 referred to as the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP)\u2014we  obtained data from CMS and states for 2015, 2016, and 2017, the most  recently available at the time of our analyses. CMS provided enrollment  data from its SHOP Enrollment Database for states that utilized federally  facilitated SHOP exchanges operated by CMS\u2014about two-thirds of  states. These data included, among other information, the coverage  start and end date for each enrollee and the issuers from which the  enrollees purchased coverage. Each of the remaining states operating its  own exchange provided us with enrollment data for each exchange  issuer. We used the CMS and state data to calculate the number of  issuers that participated in each state, as well as the state-level market  share of each participating issuer, for each year from 2015 through 2017.  SHOP exchange enrollment data at the rating area level were generally  not available.", "For each state\u2019s overall markets and exchanges, we counted issuers as  participating in a market if they had enrollment in that market; we did not  count issuers as participating if they offered coverage in a market, but did  not have any enrollment. Because there can be multiple issuers within a  market that share a single parent company, we aggregated such issuers  to the parent company level; if there was no parent company, we  analyzed the data by the individual issuers. We did this to more fully  account for the portion of the market held by each parent company. We  calculated the three-firm concentration ratio\u2014the combined shares of  covered life-years for the three largest issuers in that market\u2014and the  market share of the single largest issuer in that market. We considered  states\u2019 overall markets or exchanges to be highly concentrated if three or  fewer issuers held at least 80 percent of the market share. Finally, while  states may have multiple local markets with differing concentrations of  enrollees among health issuers, the data we used to measure  concentration were generally limited to enrollment at the state level, with  the exception of our individual exchange enrollment data\u2014thus  precluding our ability to measure concentration within local markets  except for the individual market exchanges. For all other markets, we  present state-wide issuer market share, although issuers may not have all  participated across the entire state.", "We analyzed enrollment data from all of our sources as they were  reported by issuers to CMS or states. We did not otherwise independently  verify the accuracy or completeness of the information with the issuers.  We assessed the reliability of the CMS and state data in several ways,  including through discussions with CMS and state officials, reviewing  relevant data manuals and other documentation, performing electronic  tests of the data to identify any outliers or anomalies, and comparing the  data with data from published sources. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to March  2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Private health insurance is the leading source of health coverage in the  United States. Small and large employers may offer fully insured group  plans (by purchasing coverage from an issuer) or self-funded group plans  (by setting aside funds to pay for employee health care). Most small  employers purchase fully insured plans, while most large employers self- fund at least some of their employee health benefits. While the majority of  health insurance coverage is provided through the small or large group  market, Americans without access to group health coverage, such as  those with employers that do not offer health coverage, may choose to  purchase it directly from an issuer through the individual market. (See fig.  1 for total covered life-years reported by issuers to CMS in the individual  and fully insured small and large group markets.)", "We previously identified several factors that can affect concentration in  health insurance markets. High concentration levels have often been  the result of consolidation\u2014mergers and acquisitions\u2014among existing  issuers. In addition, concentration can persist because of the difficulty for  new issuers to enter the market. For example, new issuers that do not yet  have large numbers of enrollees may have greater challenges negotiating  discounts with health care providers.", "PPACA contains provisions that may affect market concentration and  competition among health issuers, such as the establishment of health  insurance exchanges within each state\u2019s overall individual and small  group markets. One goal of the exchanges is for issuers to have an  incentive to compete with one another on price and value because  consumers can visit a website to compare and select among health plans  participating in the exchanges. Issuer participation in the exchanges is a  key factor in assuring that consumers have a choice of health plans.  While PPACA does not require issuers offering coverage in an overall  market to participate in the exchanges, issuers have an incentive to do so  in order to access additional consumers. For example, certain consumers  earning from 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible to  receive premium tax credits that can reduce premium costs, but only for  plans purchased through an exchange. The federal government and  some states have also instituted other provisions to encourage issuers to  participate in the exchanges. For example, PPACA required the establishment of the Consumer Oriented and Operated Plan (CO-OP)  program, which provided loans to new consumer-governed, nonprofit  issuers that are required to offer health plans in the individual and small  group exchanges. In addition, in Maryland, certain issuers that offered  plans outside of the exchange are also required to offer plans through the  exchange. PPACA also established other key market reforms that apply  both within and outside of the exchanges, such as requiring that issuers  offer coverage to all individuals regardless of health status and limiting  the ability of issuers to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to  individuals and small groups based on health risks or certain other  factors. Since the enactment of PPACA in 2010, there have been  additional federal policy changes that may influence an issuer\u2019s decision  about whether to participate in health insurance markets. For example, in  2014, HHS announced that a program that made payments to issuers  whose losses exceeded a certain threshold\u2014known as risk corridor  payments\u2014would be budget neutral, which resulted in reduced payments  for some issuers. One issuer told us that this lower than expected  funding was one of multiple factors that contributed to its decision to  reduce the number of insurance markets in which it participated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overall Individual Health Insurance Markets and Exchanges Generally Remained Concentrated in Recent Years, with Increasing Concentration in Many States\u2019 Exchanges Overall Individual Health Insurance Markets Generally Remained Concentrated in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["States\u2019 overall individual health insurance markets were generally  concentrated in 2015 and 2016, similar to what we reported for previous  years.

A  single issuer held at least 50 percent market share in 33 states in 2016,  with significantly higher levels of concentration by the largest issuer in  some states. For example, in 2016, a single issuer held at least 90  percent of the market in Alabama and at least 80 percent of the market in  5 other states (Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, South Carolina, and  Vermont). Further, this largest issuer position was held by the same  company in 2015 and 2016 in 49 states; and, in 47 of those states, the  largest issuer position has been held by the same company since 2011.", "The extent of concentration in the overall large group market remained  relatively constant when comparing 2014\u2014the last year of data on which  we previously reported\u2014to 2016. The market share of the 3 largest  issuers increased in 24 states and decreased in 24. (See fig. 11.) The  largest increase was in Wisconsin, where the market share of the 3  largest issuers increased from 38 percent in 2014 to 44 percent in 2016,  and the largest decrease was in New York, where the market share of the  3 largest issuers decreased from 55 percent in 2014 to 47 percent in  2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.
