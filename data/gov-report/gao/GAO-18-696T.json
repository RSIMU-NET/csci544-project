For example,", "Between July 2008 and January 2010, GAO issued reports on VA's and DOD's efforts to set up the office, which highlighted steps the departments had taken, but also identified deficiencies, such as vacant leadership positions and a lack of necessary plans. GAO recommended that the departments improve management of their interoperability efforts by developing a project plan and results-oriented performance goals and measures.", "In April 2009, the Interagency Program Office was assigned responsibility for establishing a lifetime electronic record for servicemembers and veterans, called the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record. GAO reported in February 2011 that, among other things, the office had not developed and approved an integrated master schedule, a master program plan, or performance metrics for the initiative, as outlined in the office's charter. Accordingly, GAO recommended that the departments correct these deficiencies to strengthen their efforts to establish the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record.", "In March 2011, VA and DOD committed to jointly developing a new, common integrated electronic health record system and empowered the Interagency Program Office with increased authority, expanded responsibilities, and increased staffing levels for leading the integrated system effort. However, in February 2013, the departments abandoned their plan to develop the integrated system and stated that they would again pursue separate modernization efforts. In February 2014, GAO reported on this decision and recommended that VA and DOD take steps to better position the office to function as the single point of accountability for achieving interoperability between the departments' electronic health record systems.", "VA and DOD stated that they agreed with the above GAO recommendations. However, in several cases the departments' subsequent actions were incomplete and did not fully address all recommendations.", "In June 2017 VA announced that it planned to acquire the same electronic health record system that DOD has been acquiring. GAO testified in June 2018 that a governance structure had been proposed that would be expected to leverage existing joint governance facilitated by the Interagency Program Office. At that time, VA's program officials had stated that the department's governance plans for the new program were expected to be finalized in October 2018. However, the officials have not yet indicated what role, if any, the Interagency Program Office is to have in the governance process.

Electronic health  records are particularly crucial for optimizing the health care provided to  military personnel and veterans. While in active military status and later  as veterans, many DOD and VA personnel, along with their family  members, tend to be highly mobile and may have health records residing  at multiple medical facilities within and outside the United States.", "VA and DOD operate separate electronic health record systems that they  rely on to create and manage patient health information. In particular, VA  currently uses its integrated medical information system\u2014VistA\u2014which  was developed in-house by the department\u2019s clinicians and IT personnel  and has been in operation since the early 1980s. Over the last several  decades, VistA has evolved into a technically complex system comprised  of about 170 modules that support health care delivery at 170 VA Medical  Centers and over 1,200 outpatient sites. In addition, customization of  VistA, such as changes to the modules by the various medical facilities,  has resulted in about 130 versions of the system\u2014referred to as  instances.", "For its part, DOD relies on its Armed Forces Health Longitudinal  Technology Application (AHLTA), which comprises multiple legacy  medical information systems that were developed from commercial  software products and customized for specific uses. For example, the  Composite Health Care System (CHCS), which was formerly DOD\u2019s  primary health information system, is used to capture information related  to pharmacy, radiology, and laboratory order management. In addition,  the department uses Essentris (also called the Clinical Information  System), a commercial health information system customized to support  inpatient treatment at military medical facilities.", "In July 2015, DOD awarded a contract for a new commercial electronic  health record system to be developed by the Cerner Corporation. Known  as MHS GENESIS, this system is intended to replace DOD\u2019s existing  AHLTA system.

Thus, a means for sharing information among providers, such as  between DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s health care systems, is by achieving  interoperability.", "The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, within the  Department of Health and Human Services, has issued guidance,  describing interoperability as:  the ability of systems to exchange electronic health information and  the ability to use the electronic health information that has been  exchanged from other systems without special effort on the part of the  user.", "Similarly, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014  defines interoperability, per its use in the provision governing VA\u2019s and  DOD\u2019s electronic health records, as \u201cthe ability of different electronic  health records systems or software to meaningfully exchange information  in real time and provide useful results to one or more systems.\u201d Thus, in  these contexts, interoperability allows patients\u2019 electronic health  information to be available from provider to provider, regardless of where  the information originated.", "Achieving interoperability depends on, among other things, the use of  agreed-upon health data standards to ensure that information can be  shared and used. If electronic health records conform to interoperability  standards, they potentially can be created, managed, and consulted by  authorized clinicians and staff across more than one health care  organization, thus providing patients and their caregivers the information  needed for optimal care. Information that is electronically exchanged from  one provider to another must adhere to the same standards in order to be  interpreted and used in electronic health records, thereby permitting  interoperability.", "In the health IT field, standards may govern areas ranging from technical  issues, such as file types and interchange systems, to content issues,  such as medical terminology. On a national level, the Office of the  National Coordinator has been assigned responsibility for identifying  health data standards and technical specifications for electronic health  record technology and overseeing the certification of this technology.", "In addition to exchanging the information, systems must be able to use  the information that is exchanged. Thus, if used in a way that improves  providers\u2019 and patients\u2019 access to critical information, electronic health  record technology has the potential to improve the quality of care that  patients receive and to reduce health care costs. For example, with  interoperability, medical providers have the ability to query data from  other sources while managing chronically ill patients, regardless of  geography or the network on which the data reside."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA and DOD Have a Long History of Efforts to Achieve Electronic Health Record Interoperability", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, DOD and VA have relied on a patchwork of initiatives  involving their health information systems to exchange information and  increase electronic health record interoperability.
