The federal program\u2014which began on an experimental basis in 1938 after private insurance companies were unable to establish a financially viable crop insurance business\u2014was restructured and greatly expanded by key legislation in 1980 and 1994. A major component of the 1980 legislation was the enlistment, for the first time, of private insurance companies to sell, service, and share the risk on federal crop insurance policies. In 1994, the Congress further broadened the program by offering farmers catastrophic risk insurance. This coverage, established at a minimum level, incorporated elements of the former crop disaster assistance program into crop insurance provided jointly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and private insurance companies.", "USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency administers the federal crop insurance program through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). FCIC pays the participating companies a fee, called an administrative expense reimbursement, that is intended to reimburse the companies for the reasonable expenses associated with selling and servicing crop insurance to farmers. The reimbursement is calculated as a percentage of the premiums paid, regardless of the expenses incurred by the companies. In addition to this reimbursement, participating insurance companies share with FCIC any gains or losses\u2014known as underwriting gains and underwriting losses\u2014that result from the insurance policies they sell. In 1994, 22 participating insurance companies received $395 million from the program\u2014about $292 million in administrative expense reimbursements plus about $103 million in underwriting gains. In 1995, 19 participating insurance companies received $506 million from the program\u2014about $373 million in administrative expense reimbursements plus about $133 million in underwriting gains. Expense reimbursements and underwriting gains varied by company according to the amount of premiums written, the amount of risk retained, and the management of the risk retained."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "How Federal Crop Insurance Works Under the Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994", "paragraphs": ["Federal crop insurance offers farmers two primary types of insurance coverage\u2014catastrophic and buyup. Both types of coverage are available for most major crops under the changes made by the Congress in the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-354, Oct. 13, 1994, title I). This act created catastrophic risk insurance as a replacement for expensive crop disaster assistance. Catastrophic insurance provides farmers with protection against extreme crop losses for a small processing fee. Buyup insurance provides protection against more typical and smaller crop losses in exchange for a farmer-paid premium. Participating insurance companies offer both types of insurance, whereas USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA), through its local offices, offers only catastrophic insurance. Under the terms of a negotiated agreement, participating insurance companies sell crop insurance and process any claims in exchange for an administrative expense reimbursement and for the opportunity to share in the potential for underwriting gains. The government pays the total premium for catastrophic insurance and a portion of the premium for buyup insurance. FCIC establishes the premiums, terms and conditions for both types of insurance.", "Under the 1994 reform act, farmers who had not previously purchased crop insurance were required to purchase at least catastrophic insurance coverage if they signed up for USDA\u2019s annual commodity programs; obtained USDA\u2019s farm ownership, operating, or emergency loans; or contracted to place land in the Conservation Reserve Program. Subsequently, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127, Apr. 4, 1996) eliminated this mandatory linkage by permitting farmers, effective for crops harvested in 1996, to forgo crop insurance for any given crop without losing eligibility for other programs, provided they waive all rights to any possible crop disaster assistance in connection with the particular crop.", "Catastrophic insurance, which protects farmers against extreme losses, is often referred to as minimum coverage because it provides protection at the lowest production and price levels offered. Catastrophic insurance pays farmers only when they experience production losses greater than 50 percent of their normal crop. A normal crop is determined on the basis of a farmer\u2019s production history as reported to USDA\u2019s local office or to the insurance agent. For production losses greater than 50 percent, farmers are paid 60 percent of FCIC\u2019s projected market price for the crop.", "Farmers desiring protection above the minimum price or production levels provided by catastrophic insurance can purchase buyup insurance. Unlike farmers who purchase catastrophic insurance, farmers purchasing buyup insurance must choose both the coverage level (the proportion of the crop to be insured) and the unit price (e.g., per bushel) at which any loss is calculated. With respect to the coverage level, farmers can choose to insure as much as 75 percent of normal production (25-percent deductible) or as little as 50 percent of normal production (50-percent deductible) at different price levels. With respect to unit price, farmers choose whether to value their insured production at FCIC\u2019s full projected market price or at a percentage of the full price. FCIC adjusts farmers\u2019 premiums according to the production and price levels selected.", "The following example illustrates how a claim payment is determined under catastrophic insurance, which insures 50 percent of production and 60 percent of the price. A farmer whose normal crop production averages 100 bushels of corn per acre and who chooses catastrophic insurance will be guaranteed 50 percent of 100 bushels, or 50 bushels per acre. Assuming that FCIC had estimated the market price for corn at $3 per bushel, the farmer will be guaranteed a price of 60 percent of $3, or $1.80 per bushel. The farmer\u2019s total coverage per acre will be $90 (50 bushels x $1.80 per bushel). This total amount will be paid in the event of a complete crop failure. Should an event like drought cut the farmer\u2019s actual harvest from 100 to 60 bushels, the farmer will not receive a payment because, in this example, catastrophic insurance only pays if the yield drops below 50 bushels per acre. If a more severe problem caused the yield to fall to 25 bushels per acre, the farmer will be paid for the loss of 25 bushels per acre\u2014the difference between the insured production level of 50 bushels and the actual production of 25 bushels. In this case, catastrophic insurance will pay the farmer\u2019s claim at $1.80 x 25 bushels, or $45 per acre.", "If this same farmer chooses buyup insurance at the 75-percent coverage level, the farmer will be guaranteed 75 percent of 100 bushels, or 75 bushels per acre. Assuming that the farmer had chosen the maximum price coverage of 100 percent, and that FCIC had estimated the market price for corn at $3 per bushel, the farmer\u2019s price coverage will be $3 per bushel. Accordingly, the farmer will have coverage in the event of a total crop loss of $225 per acre (75 bushels x $3 per bushel). Should drought or other perils cut the farmer\u2019s actual harvest to 60 bushels, the farmer will be paid for the loss of 15 bushels per acre\u2014the difference between the insured production level of 75 bushels and the actual production of 60 bushels. In this case, buyup insurance will pay the farmer\u2019s claim at $3 x 15 bushels, or $45 per acre. In the event of a more severe loss that reduced production to a level of 25 bushels per acre, the farmer will be paid for the loss of 50 bushels per acre\u2014the difference between the insured production level of 75 bushels and the actual production of 25 bushels. In this case, buyup insurance will pay the farmer\u2019s claim at $3 x 50 bushels, or $150 per acre."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Insurance Companies\u2019 Role in Crop Insurance Delivery", "paragraphs": ["According to a written agreement between FCIC and participating insurance companies\u2014called the standard reinsurance agreement\u2014FCIC pays the participating companies a uniform reimbursement for administrative expenses at a preestablished percentage of total premiums to deliver\u2014sell and service\u2014catastrophic and buyup insurance. This base rate can be, and has been, supplemented to provide additional funding in years when administrative costs were high because of excess losses or when other factors require the companies to conduct additional work. Beginning in 1994, as part of the agreement, FCIC required each participating company to report its delivery expenses to FCIC for the prior year to help determine the long-term adequacy of the reimbursement rate. In addition to providing an administrative expense reimbursement, this agreement governs the participating companies\u2019 share of any underwriting gains or losses resulting from the policies they sell.", "FCIC does not directly reimburse the participating companies for their actual costs of administering the program. Instead, FCIC pays all participating companies a uniform administrative expense reimbursement at a preestablished percentage of total premiums (including the farmer-paid premium, government premium subsidy for buyup insurance, and the imputed premium for catastrophic insurance). FCIC pays participating companies an administrative expense reimbursement that is intended to reimburse them for the expenses that can be reasonably associated with the sale and service of federal crop insurance, including the expenses associated with adjusting claims. Because the reimbursement is not tied to specific expenses, the companies are not obligated to spend the payment they receive on selling or servicing crop insurance policies; the payments can be used in any way the companies choose. Since 1980, in fact, the reimbursement rate has evolved as a result of negotiations between FCIC and the participating companies and budget concerns and has not been based on a systematic evaluation of companies\u2019 expenses.", "For buyup insurance, the administrative expense reimbursement base rate under the standard reinsurance agreement has declined from a high of 34 percent of total premiums between 1988 and 1991 to 31 percent between 1994 and 1996. In 1995, the administrative expense reimbursement for buyup insurance totaled 32.6 percent of buyup premiums. This reimbursement rate included a base administrative expense reimbursement of 31.0 percent of premiums and a supplemental reimbursement of 1.6 percent of premiums associated with extra adjustments for crop losses in 1995. The 1994 reform act requires FCIC to limit the reimbursement rate for selling and servicing buyup insurance to no more than 29 percent of total premiums in 1997, no more than 28 percent in 1998, and no more than 27.5 percent by 1999. While this reduction in reimbursement rate was mandated by the act, the established rates were not based on a systematic evaluation of the costs associated with selling and servicing crop insurance.", "For catastrophic insurance, companies were paid a lower base reimbursement rate\u201413.8 percent of the imputed premiums\u2014for delivering catastrophic insurance and were allowed to keep most of the $50 processing fee paid by farmers. In 1995, compensation for catastrophic insurance totaled 24.0 percent of catastrophic premiums, including (1) a base administrative expense reimbursement of 13.8 percent of premiums;(2) a retained farmer-paid processing fee of $50, equating to 9.3 percent of premiums; and (3) a supplemental reimbursement of 0.9 percent of premiums associated with extra adjustments for crop losses in 1995.", "Beginning in 1994, FCIC began to require companies to submit a detailed expense report in a consistent format following standard industry guidelines for the prior calendar year\u20141993. However, not all companies complied with the new requirement until 1995 when they reported 1994 expense data. This expense reporting has to comply with a number of guidelines, such as those that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners issues on allocating expenses among lines of business. These expense reports do not directly affect the amount paid to the companies but rather provide support and serve as an indicator for establishing future reimbursement rates for administrative expenses. Included in the expenses reported are loss adjustment costs, sales commissions paid to local insurance agents, and the general administrative expenses associated with operating the insurance companies, such as payroll, equipment, travel, training, and rent. Currently, FCIC is developing a new standard reinsurance agreement, including new expense reimbursement rates, that will be completed with the participating companies in June 1997.", "In addition to receiving an administrative expense reimbursement, the participating companies share any underwriting gains or losses with FCIC that result from the policies the companies sell. Underwriting gains occur if the premiums exceed the claims paid on the policies. In the same manner, underwriting losses occur when the claims paid exceed the premiums. The participating companies are able to vary the extent to which they share in the risk. In general, the companies choose to retain more of the risk on the historically lower-loss producers and share more of the risk with FCIC for those producers who have a history of more frequent or more severe loss experience. In addition, to protect participating companies against high underwriting losses in years with extreme crop losses, FCIC limits the total loss that participating companies must share.", "The number of companies selling and servicing crop insurance for FCIC has decreased from 27 in 1990 to 16 in 1996 because of business acquisitions and changing business relations. Insurance premiums written by participating companies during this same period increased from $747 million in 1990 to $1.6 billion in 1996. As shown in table 1.1, FCIC paid participating companies significantly larger administrative expense reimbursements than the companies earned in underwriting gains between 1990 and 1996.

Not all participating companies reported these expenses to FCIC in a consistent format until 1994; furthermore, 1996 expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance were not complete at the time of our review. We assessed expense data for crop insurance at nine participating companies that represented about 80 and 85 percent of the crop insurance premiums in 1994 and 1995, respectively. To gain an understanding of crop insurance expenditures, we interviewed representatives from participating companies and obtained an explanation of all reported expenses. In addition, to evaluate the reasonableness of reported expenses, we used as guidance FCIC\u2019s listing of allowable expenses, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\u2019 guidelines, generally accepted accounting principles, federal acquisition regulations, and the Internal Revenue Code.", "Within the framework of these standards and guidelines, we made judgments about what we considered to be reasonably associated expenses for selling, processing, and adjusting crop insurance policies for the federal government and discussed these judgments with the FCIC officials responsible for administering the program. Generally, we considered as reasonable those expenses associated with (1) interacting with farmers, (2) reviewing insured property, (3) processing policy and claims paperwork, and (4) related overhead and indirect costs, including the training and travel of staff. As part of our review, we examined participating companies\u2019 complete list of reported expenses. For a judgmental sample of these reported expenses, we traced the expenses to source documents. Our results reflect only the findings at the companies we reviewed and do not necessarily reflect the conditions for other companies selling federal crop insurance. We did not specifically validate companies\u2019 accounting systems, but we did review each company\u2019s audited financial statements to ensure ourselves that the financial data provided were reasonable. Appendix II provides a list of the participating companies we visited.", "To examine the cost differences to the government between USDA and private-sector delivery of catastrophic insurance, we analyzed the government\u2019s costs to use participating companies in comparison with the costs of using USDA. To perform our analysis, we obtained 1995 data on the costs to deliver catastrophic insurance through USDA, including costs for USDA\u2019s headquarters in Washington D.C.; its main field offices in Kansas City, Missouri; and its state, regional service, district, and local offices. We reduced the costs for USDA\u2019s delivery system by the amount of processing fees the Department collected from farmers for catastrophic insurance. We made the reduction because USDA uses these fees to reduce other government expenditures. To identify the government\u2019s costs to use participating companies to deliver catastrophic insurance, we obtained data from FCIC on administrative expense reimbursements as well as underwriting gains paid to companies that participated in the catastrophic insurance program in 1995.", "To identify alternative methods for expense reimbursements, we interviewed officials of selected participating companies, trade associations, and USDA. We then narrowed the compilation down to four distinct alternatives and analyzed them against the 1995 crop insurance experience, where reasonable, to measure their impact as if they had been in place for that year. We also determined qualitative factors associated with each of the methods through discussions with industry and FCIC officials.", "To determine the status of procedural and administrative simplification, we reviewed FCIC\u2019s summary of completed and in-progress simplification and paperwork reduction actions; and we reviewed potential simplification actions proposed by FCIC and by representatives of the crop insurance industry.

We focused on delivery costs because, in researching the legislative history of this mandate, we found that in the context of funding this program in a deficit reduction environment, the paramount congressional interest was in controlling the costs of reimbursing crop insurers. Furthermore, we confirmed our interpretation of the mandate in a commitment letter sent to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority Members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the House Committee on Agriculture.

From 1995 to 1996, basic premium rates for buyup insurance increased 3.6 percent, on average. FCIC projects premium rates to further increase in 1997. The increase in premium rates combined with the increase in crop prices resulted in an overall increase in premiums of about 13 percent.

Conversely, if premiums decline, the companies would receive a proportionate decrease in their expense reimbursement.", "The increase in the companies\u2019 reimbursement resulting from the higher premiums that have occurred since 1995 will not be accompanied by a proportionate increase in the companies\u2019 workload. Company administrative work processes remain essentially the same regardless of the premium charged. For example, the cost of data entry and transmission is a function of the number of documents and data elements processed and transmitted, not the premiums those documents represent.

In January 1997, FCIC\u2019s board of directors authorized the expansion of this program to additional crops and states. The revenue guarantee policy protects producers against a decline in the value of the insured crop. The decline in value could occur because of crop loss, as with traditional crop insurance policies, or it could result from decline in commodity prices, or some combination of the two. Because of the increased risk borne by the revenue guarantee program, premiums are considerably higher than those charged for conventional crop insurance. Thus, because the companies\u2019 reimbursement is based on a percentage of total premiums, they will receive higher reimbursements without a commensurate increase in workload.

In its proposed 1998 standard reinsurance agreement with the private insurance companies, FCIC has included changes to the expense reimbursement rate for delivering both buyup and catastrophic insurance. Additionally, in this proposed agreement, FCIC has clarified the types of expenses that the administrative reimbursement is intended to cover, and it plans to monitor companies\u2019 expenses in the future as a result of our review.

In addition, without being specific, the industry stated that a lower reimbursement rate\u2014in the range of 24 percent\u2014would \u201cdestabilize\u201d the industry.", "With respect to the time period examined, we selected 1994 and 1995 to provide a picture of expenses for delivering crop insurance before and after the implementation of the 1994 reform act. Furthermore, these were the first 2 years that the industry consistently provided the detailed data in a format needed to fully analyze the expenses associated with the selling and servicing of crop insurance. The industry stated that we understated administrative expenses by using 2 years in which crop losses were relatively low. We disagree. Crop losses for buyup coverage in 1995 were equal to or higher than crop loss experiences throughout the 1990s, except for 1993. Furthermore, we found that high crop losses did not significantly increase companies\u2019 loss-adjusting expenses\u2014the delivery cost factor most likely to be affected by high crop losses. For example, for buyup insurance, while companies paid out $1.28 in loss claims for every dollar of premium received in 1995 and $0.58 in loss claims for every dollar of premium received in 1994, their related loss adjusting expenses as a percent of premium for these 2 years were not substantially different. Therefore, although losses were higher in 1995 than in 1994, the companies\u2019 loss adjusting expenses for processing these claims did not increase commensurately. In addition, loss adjusting expenses are not a significant portion of total administrative expenses (about 3.5 percent of premiums on average for the nine companies we reviewed). Furthermore, since the 1980s, the crop insurance companies have received additional reimbursements in years of high crop losses.", "Second, the standards we used to identify reasonable costs for delivering crop insurance were developed on the basis of a number of different widely recognized accounting, insurance, and acquisition standards. FCIC agreed that the standards used were appropriate. We recognized all expenses reasonably associated with selling and servicing crop insurance. However, we continue to believe that the government should not be expected to reimburse companies for such expenses as those related to maximizing underwriting gains, acquiring other companies\u2019 business, payments to executives to refrain from joining or starting other companies, payments to parent companies with no measurable benefits to the program, profit-sharing bonuses, and payments to lobbyists. We believe that these expenses should not be included in determining an appropriate future reimbursement rate for administrative expenses.", "Third, two factors that have emerged since the 1994-95 time period that we reviewed\u2014higher premium rates and higher crop prices in 1996 and 1997\u2014should be considered in evaluating the appropriate, future reasonable reimbursement rate because these factors did increase companies\u2019 revenues without increasing expenses. Furthermore, USDA projects that crop prices will generally increase through 2005. If crop prices decline, FCIC could reevaluate the reimbursement rate.", "Finally, we disagree that a lower reimbursement rate\u2014in the range of 24 percent\u2014would destabilize the industry. Such a rate represents the companies\u2019 current expenses that are reasonably associated with the sale and service of crop insurance and as a result should not diminish service to the farmer nor destabilize the program. Companies will still have the opportunity to realize underwriting profits. In 1994 and 1995, for example, the companies realized underwriting profits of $103 million and $133 million, respectively.

When only the first and second components were considered, the costs to the government for both delivery systems were comparable.

The costs of basic sales and service for USDA\u2019s delivery included expenses associated with activities such as selling and processing policies, developing computer software, training adjusters, and adjusting claims. This cost also included indirect or overhead costs such as general administration, rent, and utilities. Included in the 1995 direct and indirect costs for USDA delivery was the Department\u2019s one-time start-up costs for establishing the USDA delivery system. Direct costs for basic delivery through USDA amounted to about $91 per crop policy, and indirect costs amounted to about $42 per crop policy, for a total basic delivery cost to the government of about $133 per crop policy. Appendix V provides more detail on the components of total government costs to deliver catastrophic insurance through USDA and insurance companies.", "The basic delivery cost for company delivery consists of the administrative expense reimbursement paid to companies by FCIC and the cost of administrative support provided by USDA. The administrative expense reimbursement amounted to about $73 per crop policy, and USDA\u2019s support costs amounted to about $10 per crop policy, for a total basic delivery cost to the government for company delivery of about $83 per crop policy.", "The second component\u2014offsetting income from farmer-paid processing fees\u2014reduced the basic delivery cost to the government for both delivery systems, but had a much larger impact in reducing the cost to the government for the USDA delivery system. In 1995, farmers buying catastrophic insurance were required to pay a $50 processing fee for each crop they insured, up to certain limits. For USDA\u2019s delivery, processing fees paid by farmers reduced the government\u2019s basic delivery cost of about $133 by an average of $53 per crop policy. For company delivery, fees paid by farmers and remitted to the government reduced the government\u2019s basic delivery cost of about $83 by $7 per crop policy. For company delivery, the effect on the cost to the government was relatively small because the 1994 reform act authorized the companies to retain the fees they collected from farmers up to certain limits. Only those fees that exceeded these limits were remitted back to the government. Combining the basic sales and service delivery costs and the offsetting income from farmer-paid processing fees, the government\u2019s costs were comparable for both delivery systems.", "The third component\u2014underwriting gains paid by FCIC only to the companies\u2014is the element that made delivery through USDA less expensive. The insurance companies can earn underwriting gains in exchange for taking responsibility for any claims resulting from those policies for which the companies retain risk. In 1995, companies earned an underwriting gain of an estimated $45 million, or about a 37-percent return on the catastrophic premiums for which they retained risk. This underwriting gain increased the government\u2019s delivery cost for company delivery by $127 per crop policy. Underwriting gains are, of course, not guaranteed. In years with a high incidence of catastrophic losses, companies could experience net underwriting losses, meaning that they would have to pay out money from their reserves in excess of the premiums paid to them by the government, potentially reducing the government\u2019s total cost of company delivery in such years.", "Table 3.1 summarizes the three components of the government\u2019s cost to deliver catastrophic insurance through USDA and companies in dollars per crop policy for 1995.", "The table shows that, overall, the government\u2019s cost for delivering catastrophic insurance through USDA was about $124 less per crop policy than the delivery cost through companies in 1995.", "The 1995 catastrophic underwriting gain of about 37 percent was the critical component in the difference in comparative costs between USDA and company delivery.

The 14 states are Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming.", "According to the American Association of Crop Insurers, crop insurance industry executives unanimously support securing the remaining 36 states for private delivery, beginning with crops harvested in 1998. According to the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, the Secretary of Agriculture must make the announcement for any additional states where USDA delivery is to be phased out by April 30 of the year preceding the year in which the applicable crops will be harvested."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["If only 1995 is considered, the delivery of catastrophic insurance through USDA is less expensive to the government than through companies because of the underwriting gains companies earned. These gains, 37 percent of catastrophic premiums on which the companies retained risk, were far higher than FCIC\u2019s long-term target gain of 7 percent. Over time, gains and losses may offset each other, and the target gain may be realized. However, if underwriting gains do not become more commensurate with FCIC\u2019s target gain, the potential for high government costs and high company profits will continue. FCIC is aware of this situation and is currently studying the issue of an appropriate long-term rate of return for companies participating in the program. Furthermore, this issue of potentially high costs and high profits takes on added importance because of the requirements of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. This act requires USDA to transfer its delivery of catastrophic insurance to private companies in areas where there are sufficient private company providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation to the Secretary of Agriculture", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture direct the Administrator of the Risk Management Agency to closely monitor the experience of the catastrophic insurance program to ensure that over time the underwriting gains earned on catastrophic insurance by the companies do not routinely exceed FCIC\u2019s long-term target."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA and Crop Insurance Industry Comments", "paragraphs": ["FCIC agreed with our conclusions and recommendation and has already changed the proposed 1998 standard reinsurance agreement to ensure that underwriting gains on catastrophic insurance will be more closely in line with its long-term target.", "The industry, however, questioned our methodology for comparing the cost to the government of the USDA and company delivery systems. Specifically, it stated that the processing fees paid by farmers and the underwriting gains paid to companies should not be considered in analyzing the costs to the government for catastrophic insurance delivery. It also suggested that restricting our analysis to 1995 provided a distorted picture of underwriting gains because it only represented 1 year\u2019s experience. It further stated that our analysis did not take into account that, in its view, the quality of service provided to farmers by the companies was much higher than that provided by USDA.", "We disagree that an analysis of the comparative costs to the government of company- and USDA-delivered catastrophic insurance should exclude the processing fee and underwriting gains components. In computing the overall costs to the government, all revenue and payment components have to be considered. With respect to the industry\u2019s concern about our period of analysis, 1995 was the only year in which a comparative assessment could be made at the time we conducted our review because it was the only year in which both USDA and the companies were delivering catastrophic insurance. Since then, however, we note that underwriting gains paid to the companies in 1996 exceeded those paid in 1995. This would serve to make the cost to the government for company-delivered catastrophic insurance even higher. With respect to the issue of comparative service quality, we did not make this a principal focus of our review. However, during the course of our work, we found little to suggest that the service provided by companies or USDA was less than satisfactory.", "The industry\u2019s comments also indicate that it believes our conclusions might mislead public policymakers by implying that delivery of catastrophic insurance by private industry should be reduced. We do not believe that this is the case. We did not conclude or recommend that the industry should have its role in catastrophic insurance delivery reduced.

We identified four alternative reimbursement arrangements that offer the potential to reduce FCIC\u2019s reimbursements and to more closely match reimbursements with expenses.

However, the workload, or cost, associated with administering the policy generally does not increase proportionately. Therefore, for policies with the highest premiums, there may be a large differential between FCIC\u2019s reimbursement and the costs incurred to administer those policies. For example, in 1995, the largest 3 percent of the policies received about one-third of the total reimbursement. In fact, the five largest policies in 1995 had reimbursements ranging from about $118,000 to $472,000.

A larger farm may require more time to measure and inspect the component fields and more contacts with the farmer. This alternative is designed to recognize both the fixed and variable aspects of selling and servicing crop insurance policies. For example, FCIC could reimburse companies a fixed amount (such as $100) for each policy written to pay for the fixed expense associated with each policy.

These types of fixed expenses decrease as a percent of total premiums written as premium volume increases.
