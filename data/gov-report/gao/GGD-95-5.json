CAPR data showed that staff in the service centers\u2019 Code and Edit Sections sometimes overlooked that taxpayers had not included the required Schedule EIC.

What is unclear is (1) how much of this growth is due to increased fraudulent activity rather than an improvement in fraud detection and (2) how much additional fraud might be going undetected.", "In an effort to better control filing fraud, IRS has taken several steps. For example, IRS has (1) added additional up-front computer checks in an attempt to prevent fraudulent returns from entering the electronic filing system, (2) added staff to its fraud detection teams in the service centers in an attempt to detect more fraudulent returns, (3) initiated studies in an attempt to better understand the fraudulent schemes confronting IRS, and (4) engaged the services of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in an attempt to improve IRS\u2019 ability to identify fraudulent refund claims through the use of artificial intelligence and thus reduce expensive manual screening procedures. Also, at the request of the House Committee on Ways and Means and its Subcommittee on Oversight, the Secretary of the Treasury, in April 1994, established an interagency task force to investigate refund fraud.", "Additional steps are planned for 1995.

They said that we focused on the number of calls rather than the number of callers, thus overlooking the fact that many callers could be using features, such as automatic redial, that enable persons to continuously redial until they get through\u2014thus inflating the real demand for IRS assistance. Although we agree that the number of callers trying to reach IRS would be less than the number of calls being made, IRS does not yet have a viable way to measure accessibility based on the number of callers.

We first reviewed IRS\u2019 performance during the 1985 filing season. In 1985, a combination of insufficient computer capacity, inefficient software, and inadequate training played a major role in creating returns processing backlogs and document control problems. As a result (1) more refunds were delayed in 1985 than in the past and interest payments on late refunds increased substantially, (2) many taxpayers had to file duplicate returns to expedite receipt of their refunds, (3) many erroneous taxpayers notices were issued, (4) correspondence and other inventories increased, (5) the number of telephone calls from taxpayers grew, (6) overtime costs increased, and (7) the productivity of service center personnel declined significantly.", "Since then, IRS\u2019 service centers have acquired more computer hardware; and computer programs that took many hours to run in 1985 are now running more efficiently. IRS also improved its procedures for dealing with computer-related problems and implemented ways that taxpayers could file returns that bypass the labor intensive and error-prone paper processing system. IRS also established the National Office Command Center in 1986 to coordinate and monitor the resolution of hardware and software problems. The command center helps ensure that problems are addressed in a timely manner and helps identify problems involving multiple locations.", "As a result of these changes, IRS\u2019 filing season performance has generally improved over the past several years. Receipts of unpostables, error resolution, and adjustments/correspondence cases have decreased (see tables I.1, I.2, and I.3), refund timeliness has increased, receipts of returns on other than paper have increased along with the overall increase in the number of returns received (see figs. I.1 and I.2), and telephone tax law accuracy has increased (see fig. I.3). However, not all of the trends are positive. The number of detected fraudulent refunds has increased dramatically (see table I.4), and telephone accessibility has decreased by 37 percentage points since 1989 (see fig.
