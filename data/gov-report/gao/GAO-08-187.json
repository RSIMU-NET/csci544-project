Also, CBP reached its targets of operating CSI in 58 foreign seaports, and thereby having 86 percent of all U.S.-bound cargo containers pass through CSI seaports in fiscal year 2007--representing a steady increase in these measures of CSI performance. To strengthen CSI operations, CBP has sought to address human capital challenges and previous GAO recommendations by increasing CSI staffing levels closer to those called for in its staffing model and revising its human capital plan. However, challenges remain because CBP continues to rely, in part, on a temporary workforce; has not determined how to optimize its staffing resources; and reports difficulties in identifying sufficient numbers of qualified staff. In addition, CBP has enhanced relationships with host governments participating in CSI. However, hurdles to cooperation remain at some seaports, such as restrictions on CSI teams witnessing examinations. CBP improved its evaluation of CSI team performance at seaports, but limitations remain in the evaluation process that affect the accuracy and completeness of data collected. CBP has not set minimum technical criteria for equipment or systematically collected information on the equipment, people, and processes involved in CSI host government examinations of high-risk, U.S-bound container cargo. Also, CBP has not developed general guidelines to use in assessing the reliability of these examinations. Thus, CBP potentially lacks information to ensure that host government examinations can detect and identify weapons of mass destruction, which is important because containers are typically not reexamined in the United States if already examined at a CSI seaport. CBP refined overall CSI performance measures, but has not fully developed performance measures and annual targets for core CSI functions, such as the examination of high-risk containers before they are placed on vessels bound for the United States. These weaknesses in CBP's data collection and performance measures potentially limit the information available on overall CSI effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Oceangoing cargo containers play a vital role in the movement of cargo  Oceangoing cargo containers play a vital role in the movement of cargo  between global trading partners.

Every time responsibility for cargo in containers changes hands  along the supply chain there is the potential for a security breach, and  thus, vulnerabilities exist that terrorists could take advantage of by placing  a WMD into a container for shipment to the United States. While there  have been no known incidents of containers being used to transport  WMDs, criminals have exploited containers for other illegal purposes,  such as smuggling weapons, people, and illicit substances, according to  CBP officials. Finally, while CBP has noted that the likelihood of terrorists  smuggling WMD into the United States in cargo containers is low, the  nation\u2019s vulnerability to this activity and the consequences of such an  attack are potentially high. In 2002, Booz Allen Hamilton sponsored a  simulated scenario in which the detonation of weapons hidden in cargo  containers shut down all U.S. seaports over a period of 12 days.

For example, in  response to our concerns about staffing imbalances across seaports and  shortages at the highest-volume seaports, CBP has increased staffing  levels, bringing them closer to those called for in its staffing model\u2014 resulting in a parallel increase in the volume of container cargo that is  targeted.  Also, CBP has added 15 staff to CSI targeting duty at the NTCC  since 2005, composed of temporary and permanent officers. In addition, in  fiscal year 2007 CBP deployed an additional 125 permanent and 68  temporary officers to CSI seaports. Considering the officers at both CSI  seaports and the NTCC, as of November 2007, CBP had deployed 209 CSI  officers, which exceeds the 203 called for in the CSI staffing model. As a  result of these efforts, CBP officials told us that they had increased their  targeting of U.S.-bound container cargo from 65 percent in April 2005 to  100 percent in September 2007.", "The agency also developed cost estimates for placing a mix of permanent  and temporary staff at CSI seaports (with permanent staff costing about  $330,000 per year and temporary staff about $275,000 per year) in response  to our recommendation. CBP reported that the advantages of placing  officers at CSI seaports on a permanent rather than a temporary basis  include greater opportunities for enhanced communication and  coordination with host governments, and less disruption due to fewer  rotations into and out of the country. At one CSI port that we visited, host  government customs officials told us that the presence of permanent staff  facilitated increased information sharing, which over time could lead to a  decrease in unnecessary examinations.", "Despite the progress it has made, CBP continues to face staffing  challenges. CBP officials told us, for example, they continue to face  challenges in obtaining sufficient numbers of qualified officers to be  permanently deployed at CSI seaports. For example, CBP officials  reported that only 9 qualified applicants applied for 40 permanent  positions at CSI seaports. Officials told us that CSI must compete for staff  with targeting or seaport experience with other CBP programs or  positions, such as C-TPAT or other programs that operate at the NTCC. To  fill open positions at CSI seaports, CBP officials reported that in some  instances officers have been deployed who have not received all of the  required training. In addition, CBP evaluation data we reviewed showed  examples of CBP officers at CSI seaports lacking key skills, such as the  ability to target proficiently or communicate in the local language.", "In addition, CBP has taken action to enhance its human capital planning  process for CSI, but has not yet included important factors in its staffing  allocation model. As we reported in 2005, one of the features of the CSI  staffing model that may contribute to staffing imbalances was its reliance  on placing officers overseas at CSI seaports.  It did not consider what  functions could be done in the United States. In May 2006, in response to  our recommendations, CBP issued a human capital plan that did not  specify that CSI targeting positions be located at CSI seaports, thus  recognizing that officers could support CSI seaports from the NTCC in the  United States. CBP officers assigned to the NTCC perform many of the  same roles as officers at CSI seaports, including reviewing bills of lading.  CBP officers at the NTCC review bills of lading for high-volume seaports  where the placement of the number of CSI officers required to review all  bills of lading is unfeasible. In addition, according to CBP officials, CBP  officers at the NTCC review bills of lading for U.S.-bound cargo from CSI  seaports where no CBP officers are stationed. Though CBP\u2019s 2006 human  capital plan generally recognizes that some CSI functions can be  performed at either a CSI seaport or at the NTCC, the staffing allocation  model used to calculate the number of targeters necessary to review bills  of lading for each CSI port does not include factors that specify where  these positions should be located.", "In addition, CBP\u2019s staffing allocation model does not take into account  activities other than targeting\u2014such as witnessing host government  examinations\u2014that CSI officers perform at CSI seaports. According to  CBP, the agency stations as many of the total officers needed as possible  at the CSI seaports, but if the number of officers needed is higher than the  number of officers allowed by the host government or available to be  stationed in the seaport, then the remainder of the officers target from the  NTCC. However, we found that CBP has still not systematically  determined the optimal number of officers that need to be physically  located on-site at CSI seaports to carry out duties that require an overseas  presence (such as coordinating with host government officials or  witnessing the examinations they conduct) as opposed to other duties that  could be performed off-site in the United States (such as reviewing bills of  lading and databases). Also, CBP\u2019s revised CSI human capital plan does  not include costs related to placing temporary staff at the NTCC and thus  does not have the data needed to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for  determining the optimal location for its CSI officers. As we noted in our  2002 report on a staffing framework for use at U.S. embassies, federal  agencies should consider factors such as cost and physical security of  foreign operations and consider options such as relocating staff to the  United States, as part of their framework for determining the right number  of staff to be placed overseas. Determining optimal staffing levels is  particularly important in light of ongoing challenges CBP reports facing to  identify sufficient numbers of qualified individuals to hire for the program,  and in light of the program\u2019s recent expansion to additional seaports  around the world.", "While CBP has taken steps to implement the recommendations from our  April 2005 report, further action is needed regarding the staffing allocation  model.  Specifically, as we recommended in 2005, the model should be  revised to consider (1) what functions need to be performed at CSI  seaports and what functions can be performed in the United States, (2) the  optimum levels of staff needed at CSI seaports to maximize the benefits of  targeting and examination activities in conjunction with host nation  customs officials, and (3) the cost of locating targeting positions overseas  at CSI seaports instead of in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Level of Collaboration between U.S. and Host Customs Officials Has Improved, but Challenges Remain at Some CSI Seaports", "paragraphs": ["CSI\u2019s strategic plan emphasizes the importance of CBP\u2019s continued efforts  to foster partnerships with foreign customs officials at CSI seaports to  improve CSI operations. Specifically, according to CBP headquarters  officials, when CSI teams stationed at foreign seaports develop strong  interpersonal relations with foreign government officials, it leads to  increased trust and information sharing and thus improved targeting and  examination of high-risk cargo. While the extent of cooperation across all  of the 58 CSI seaports now operating is difficult to quantify, our  observations at 6 CSI seaports and our review of select CSI team  evaluations provide examples of how collaboration can benefit the CSI  program, and conversely, how the lack thereof can hinder progress.", "At all 6 CSI seaports we visited, CBP officers or host government officials  told us that the relationship between the CSI team and the host  government has been positive or has improved over time. CBP and host  government officials we spoke with at all of the seaports we visited  reported that establishing trust and collegiality has led to increased  information sharing, resulting in more effective targeting and examination  of high-risk container cargo. For example, CBP officers noted instances in  which host customs officials would occasionally notify them of container  cargo they thought could be high-risk, so that CBP could take a closer look  at the information available in ATS related to the container cargo. In  addition, a few CBP officers or host government officials stated that the  presence of CSI teams at foreign seaports has in many instances helped to  prevent unnecessary examinations because information provided by host  government customs officials has led to lower risk profiles for certain  container cargo.", "Moreover, CBP officials reported that strengthened relationships with host  government officials and the trade community have led host governments  to bolster their customs and port security practices. CBP officials we  spoke to emphasized that, like the United States, most foreign customs  administrations have traditionally focused on revenue collection and the  seizure of contraband, rather than security concerns. During our visits to  CSI seaports, the CBP and host government officials we spoke with  reported several examples of how the presence of CSI teams at seaports  has helped to expand the focus of the efforts of these foreign customs  administrations and the trade community to include enhanced security  practices. For example, one country developed databases with trade  information to achieve its customs goals and to assist CSI after seeing how  gathering historical data benefited CBP. Furthermore, at a couple of the  CSI seaports we visited, the CSI team or host government officials  arranged outreach meetings with the trade community to raise companies\u2019  awareness of security practices and the benefits of providing correct and  complete data about their cargo.", "During our visits to CSI seaports and our review of data CBP collected  during its evaluations of CSI teams, we also identified instances where  cooperation between CSI teams and their counterparts in the host  government could be improved\u2014though, as CBP officials noted, some of  the factors involved are beyond CBP\u2019s ability to control directly. For  example, in some locations, CBP officials reported that a country may  have laws that hinder the collaboration of host government officials with  CSI teams. We identified the following issues during our observations at 6  CSI seaports as well as from our review of CBP data collected in fiscal  year 2007 at an additional 12 CSI seaports (for a total of 18 CSI seaports):  At 9 CSI seaports, the CSI teams there reported that they only  interacted infrequently with their host government counterparts or the  host government officials did not readily share information that would  benefit CSI, such as knowledge about potentially suspicious container  cargo.  In one instance the lack of interaction was attributed to the host  government\u2019s competing priorities.", "At 6 CSI seaports, host governments restricted CSI teams from viewing  nonintrusive inspection equipment examinations conducted by host  customs authorities or the resulting images of the container\u2019s contents,  which is one of the key purposes for staffing CBP officers at CSI  seaports.", "At 4 CSI seaports, host governments prohibited the use of hand-held  radiation detection devices by CBP officials, which is considered by  CBP to be an important way to identify a potential anomaly in a high- risk container. According to CBP officials, a few of the countries  prohibit the equipment due to safety and health concerns about the use  of the equipment.", "At 3 of the CSI seaports, host customs officials lacked access to  technical equipment, such as computers or nonintrusive inspection  equipment that worked properly, which CBP believes could limit their  ability to share customs-related information with CSI team members or  efficiently conduct examinations.  According to CBP officials,  sometimes host governments lack resources to meet these  technological needs.", "At 6 CSI seaports in 2 countries, CBP officers at the seaport reported  that host customs administrations did not provide a sufficient number  of staff to assist CSI teams or the host government officials were often  unavailable, which, according to CSI teams, can sometimes lead to  delays in examining high-risk containers.", "At 3 CSI seaports, there was evidence of challenges to effective  communication, such as some CSI teams having limited proficiency in  the local language.", "These examples are not intended to represent the CSI program as a whole,  but are included to illustrate the types of challenges that CSI teams at the  seaports and CBP program managers face. CBP officials responsible for  managing the CSI program have reported that overall there has been a  high level of cooperation at CSI seaports, though they acknowledged that  the degree of involvement and participation that CBP officers have with  foreign customs officials during the examination of high-risk cargo varies  by country. It is also important to note that while CBP negotiates a  written, nonbinding arrangement stating expectations for inclusion in the  CSI program with the participating foreign governments, the agency  cannot compel foreign governments to offer information for the purposes  of CSI or to examine high-risk containers. Later in this report, we describe  the processes CBP has in place to address difficulties that may be  identified at the CSI seaports as part of its program oversight and  monitoring efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seaport Environment and Logistics Present Challenges to CSI Operations", "paragraphs": ["Another factor that can affect CBP\u2019s ability to conduct CSI program  operations involves logistical challenges that are inherent to many seaport  environments. For example, as illustrated in figure 6, foreign government  officials we spoke with at CSI seaports reported that many seaports are  densely packed with equipment and personnel, which can make it difficult  for host government customs officials to examine container cargo.", "According to CBP, open space to place scanning equipment or to conduct  physical searches of containers can be scarce at some CSI seaports. For  example, in two of the CSI locations we visited, scanning equipment and  examination sites were placed several miles from where container cargo is  unloaded, loaded, or stored. According to the CBP officials we spoke with,  this adds to the costs and time required for examination and may result in  logistical difficulties in having high-risk U.S.-bound containers examined  before being loaded onto the shipping vessel. In addition, at one port we  visited, the host government limited the number of containers it would  examine, in part to limit the cost of examination and the amount of delay  caused by moving these containers, according to the CSI team we spoke  with. CBP officials reported that despite this limit to examine no more  than 250 containers (out of the over 115,000 container cargo shipments to  the United States from this seaport in fiscal year 2007), the country has not  denied many examination requests\u2014only two in fiscal year 2007.  However, this ceiling was not based on risk factors, and an increase in  denied requests could lead to additional containers with high-risk cargo  departing for the United States without being examined.", "Finally, CBP officials stated that containers at seaports are generally  stored in a container yard before they are loaded onto the shipping vessel.  These container yards may be very large, and containers in these yards are  often stacked to minimize the time required to load container vessels. As  shown in figure 7, containers on a vessel may be stacked several layers  deep.  Accordingly, CBP and host government officials we spoke to at a  few CSI seaports reported it can sometimes be challenging to access a  container for examination. CBP officials noted that any examinations  requested but not conducted in the CSI seaport would occur at a U.S.  seaport upon arrival."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Enhanced Its CSI Evaluations at CSI Seaports and Performance Measures but Still Does Not Capture Critical Information about Host Government Examination Systems", "paragraphs": ["CBP has enhanced how it collects CSI data by strengthening its approach  to conducting periodic evaluations of CSI officers at CSI seaports through  on-site evaluations of performance.

For example, CBP does not systematically collect  information on the equipment, people, and processes that are part of the  host government\u2019s overall examination system.

Specifically, CBP uses these on-site evaluations to assess  CSI team operations and capabilities, such as how well CSI team members  use ATS to determine the risk levels associated with U.S.-bound  containers passing through CSI seaports. CBP\u2019s CSI strategic plan states  that these periodic reviews are intended both to ensure that deployed CSI  teams are adhering to standard operating procedures as well as to evaluate  the relationships between the teams and the host customs administrations.  In fiscal years 2006 and 2007, CBP reported conducting 42 and 45  evaluations, respectively. Since the program\u2019s inception in 2002, the  agency reported conducting a total of 202 evaluations.", "In November 2006, CBP significantly changed the way it conducts CSI  team evaluations. Prior to that time, CBP officials reported that its  evaluators relied on self-reported information from CSI team members on  how proficiently they performed CSI program activities. CBP\u2019s current  approach to conducting CSI team evaluations seeks to provide a more  thorough review of CSI team performance.  According to CBP officials, the  agency now requires the CSI team members under review to demonstrate  their targeting competence to an evaluator, such as by physically showing  the evaluator how they review information about container cargo to  determine its risk level. To better assess the deployed CSI team\u2019s  performance, CBP augmented its evaluation teams with officers who have  expertise in areas such as targeting and intelligence gathering.", "Also, CBP has developed a new software tool that enables evaluators to  record evaluation data electronically, using laptop computers to conduct  the on-site evaluations. This tool, CSI Team Evaluation (CSITE), consists  of a series of yes or no questions that cover the various areas of CSI team  performance, including whether all of the container cargo that the CSI  team designated high-risk were examined and whether these actions were  properly documented. The CSITE tool also provides guidance on each  question and prompts evaluators as they conduct their review by, for  example, directing them to ensure that the CSI team is using the correct  settings in ATS. In addition, employing CSITE, CBP reported it can now  aggregate the results of some or all of its evaluations, a capability it  previously lacked, and can conduct statistical analyses of the results of the  evaluations. The agency can determine, for example, what percentage of  CSI team members successfully demonstrated proficiency in targeting  high-risk containers. According to CBP officials, CSITE will eventually  allow the agency to make comparisons of CSI performance across  seaports. Moreover, CBP now retains the information it collects at CSI  seaports and the resultant evaluation reports in a more systematic fashion.  CBP officials acknowledged that the agency did not always store this data  effectively prior to the implementation of the new evaluation system and  could not provide us with documentation of all of the evaluations it had  conducted since the program\u2019s inception.", "While these efforts should help to strengthen the CSI team evaluation  process, CBP is still not consistently collecting all available data to aid in  its analysis of CSI team performance, and we identified instances in which  the agency did not reconcile contradictory information it had collected.  Based on our review of CBP\u2019s documentation associated with 34  evaluations to assess the information the agency collected and its methods  for doing so, we found that evaluators do not always answer all of the  questions contained in CSITE.  For example, the software tool instructs  the CBP evaluation team to collect information on whether  recommendations made in prior evaluations have been implemented. This  information could allow CBP to determine whether past problems have  been addressed, but it is not always provided by the evaluation team. We  also identified discrepancies between (a) the CSITE checklist of questions  that the evaluation team completes during the onsite evaluation, and (b)  the resulting evaluation report produced by CBP headquarters officials for  2 of the 14 locations for which we had both documents to compare. At one  seaport, for example, the CBP evaluation team indicated in the CSITE  checklist that the CSI team did not have all of the data systems it needed  to effectively target outbound shipments, whereas the evaluation report  stated the team had access to all of the appropriate targeting tools and  databases. With more complete information, collected in a consistent  manner, CBP may be better able to determine how well CSI teams are  performing, what corrective actions may be needed to improve the  program, or whether the CSI program is achieving its security goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Lacks a Process for Systematically Gathering Information on Host Government Examination Systems, Which Include Equipment, People, and Processes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Host Government Examination Systems\u2014 Equipment", "paragraphs": ["In April 2005, we recommended that CBP establish minimum technical  criteria required for the capabilities of nonintrusive inspection equipment  at CSI seaports, while considering sovereignty issues with participating  countries. CBP agreed to evaluate the feasibility of establishing such  criteria. In 2006, section 205(e) of the SAFE Port Act required DHS to  establish minimum technical capability criteria for the use of nonintrusive  inspection equipment and nuclear and radiological detection systems in  conjunction with CSI, but noted that these criteria should not be designed  to conflict with the sovereignty of host countries. In 2007, the 9/11 Act also  required the Secretary of DHS to develop technological standards for  scanning systems that will be used to conduct 100 percent scanning at  foreign seaports in the future and to ensure that these and other actions  implementing the act\u2019s 100 percent scanning provisions do not violate  international trade obligations and are consistent with the World Customs  Organization framework or other international obligations of the United  States. CSI host governments, which are responsible for conducting  examinations of container cargo, purchase and operate nonintrusive  inspection equipment, though as of November 2007, 13 CSI seaports use  equipment on loan from the United States. The capabilities of this  inspection equipment vary by manufacturer and model. The equipment  may differ, for example, in its ability to penetrate steel shielding in order  to generate an image of container contents, or may scan containers at  different rates. Appendix IV describes the capabilities of this equipment in  greater detail.  As of November 2007, CBP had not yet implemented our  prior recommendation or taken actions to meet the SAFE Port and 9/11  Acts requirements for setting minimum technical criteria. CBP officials  stated that the reason for this is that they do not consider the agency to be  a standard-setting organization. While CBP refers host governments to the  World Customs Organization\u2019 SAFE Framework regarding the  procurement of inspection equipment, this document does not include  specific technical criteria or standards. Moreover, they added that it is  important to acknowledge the inherent challenges involved in efforts to  ascertain the capabilities of nonintrusive inspection equipment that is  owned and operated by CSI host governments.", "In May 2005, however, CBP put forth minimum technical criteria to  evaluate the quality and performance of nonintrusive imaging inspection  equipment being considered for use at U.S. seaports.

To determine whether  certain types of nonintrusive inspection equipment were acceptable for  use at domestic seaports\u2014and could meet the criteria that had been set\u2014 CBP conducted tests comparing the capabilities of nonintrusive imaging  inspection equipment provided by seven manufacturers with its technical  operating standards.

Without information on host governments\u2019 examination  systems, CBP management may not be able to determine the reliability of  the host government\u2019s inspections of high-risk U.S.-bound container cargo.  This is of particular concern since, according to CBP officials, most high- risk cargo that has already been examined at a CSI seaport, is generally  not reexamined once it arrives at a U.S. seaport.  CBP officials stated that  if problems are found in the examination process at a CSI seaport, then  high-risk container cargo would be reexamined upon arrival in the United  States.", "As already noted, CBP must respect participating countries\u2019 sovereignty.

Whereas CBP\u2019s CSI team evaluations and program  monitoring activities help to evaluate CSI operations at the seaport level,  CBP uses performance measures to gauge the effectiveness of the overall  program in meeting its broader strategic objectives for CSI across  seaports. By definition, performance measures are a particular value or  characteristic used to quantify a program\u2019s outputs\u2014which describe the  products and services delivered over a period of time\u2014or outcomes\u2014 which describe the intended result of carrying out the program. A  performance target is a quantifiable characteristic that establishes a goal  for each measure; agencies can determine the program\u2019s progress, in part,  by comparing the program\u2019s measures against the targets.

In addition, leading  organizations recognize that performance measures can create powerful  incentives to influence organizational and individual behavior.", "In the past 2 years, CBP has made efforts to refine and modify its  performance measures as the CSI program has matured. Since 2005, for  example, CBP has eliminated five performance measures that it had used  to track the implementation of seaports participating in CSI, measures that  CBP determined were no longer needed because CSI operations were  under way at the majority of planned CSI seaports. Also, in our April 2005  review of CSI, we identified a CSI performance measure that was  calculated inappropriately, and in response, CBP modified how the  measure was calculated to address our concerns. Specifically, for the CSI  measure that tracks the number of container examinations waived  because they are determined to be unnecessary, CBP began excluding  inappropriate data that made the results of the performance measure  misleading. This was an important modification because, as we reported  in November 2002, measures that are defined inconsistently with how they  are calculated can be confusing and create the impression that  performance is better or worse than it actually is.", "CBP has made efforts to enhance CSI performance measures, but we  identified limitations in the information available for CSI program  managers to assess the program. In the past, we and the Office of  Management and Budget have encouraged federal departments and  agencies to measure whether programs are achieving their intended  outcomes, such as CSI\u2019s purpose of protecting global trade from being  exploited by international terrorists. However, we and the Office of  Management and Budget have acknowledged the difficulty in developing  outcome measures for programs that aim to deter or prevent specific  behaviors. In such an instance, we have reported that proxy measures  should be designed to assess the effectiveness of program functions. CBP  officials reported the agency has not been able to develop a way to  measure the deterrence effect of the program, as CSI is designed to  support the CBP mission to prevent and deter terrorists and terrorist  weapons from entering the United States. Examples of CSI program  functions include targeting and examining high-risk container shipments  before they are loaded on vessels bound for the United States, and in our  2005 review of CSI we provided guidance on an alternative method of  developing proxy measures to evaluate program performance. Further,  according to the Office of Management and Budget, proxy measures  should be closely tied to the intended program outcome, and it may be  necessary to have a number of proxy measures to help ensure sufficient  safeguards are in place to account for performance results. According to  CBP officials the following three of its existing performance measures  were proxies for program outcomes.(1) The percentage of worldwide U.S.-bound containers passing  through CSI seaports\u2014since these containers are to be targeted  and, if determined high-risk, may be examined by host government  officials, this is a measure of the program goal to detect and  prevent WMDs headed to U.S. seaports from leaving foreign  seaports.  (2) The number of foreign mitigated examinations (that is,  examinations determined to be unnecessary due to information  provided by host government officials and thus waived) by  category\u2014developed to quantify whether collocating CBP officials  at CSI seaports increases information sharing and collaboration.   (3) The number of intelligence reports based on CSI foreign sources\u2014 intended to measure whether having CBP officials located at  foreign seaports leads to increased collaboration with foreign  customs officials.", "The Office of Management and Budget has stated that performance  measures should capture the most important aspects of a program\u2019s  mission and priorities. However, CBP does not have a measure that tracks  the extent to which U.S.-bound containers carrying high-risk cargo are  examined at CSI seaports, despite the fact that this activity is a core  element of the CSI program.", "CBP has taken other actions to address our April 2005 recommendation  that includes ways to improve CSI performance measures, but we found  additional weaknesses as well. The strategic plan demonstrated how each  performance measure corresponds to the three strategic goals of CSI,  which include (1) securing U.S. borders, (2) building a robust CSI cargo  security system, and (3) protecting and facilitating trade. This marked an  improvement, as this linkage had not been made previously. In addition,  CBP addressed an additional aspect of our prior recommendation by  establishing performance targets for four of the six CSI performance  measures currently used.  However, only one measure had a target for  multiple years.  In addition, since issuing the CSI strategic plan the agency  has not updated its performance targets for fiscal year 2008 or beyond for  any of its measures. Without this information about the performance  targets, it may be difficult for CBP to determine whether the results were  more positive or negative than expected.", "Also, we identified a weakness in how some CSI performance measures  are calculated. As we noted earlier in this report, as the number of CSI  seaports has increased in recent years, program activities have increased  as well. However, CBP does not appropriately control for this program  growth in how it calculates three of its six performance measures. For  example, since the \u201cnumber of foreign mitigated examinations by  category\u201d\u2014the number of container examinations determined to be  unnecessary due to information provided by host government officials\u2014is  not calculated on a per-container basis (i.e., per 10,000 containers), it may  be difficult to determine whether fluctuation in the numbers across years  is due to (1) increased collaboration with foreign government officials or  (2) simply an increase in the number of containers reviewed and  considered for examination at the increasing number of CSI seaports.  Similarly, the number of intelligence reports and the number of  investigative cases initiated may be due to an increase in the number of  operational CSI seaports, not increased collaboration with host  government officials. Without controlling for program growth, CBP\u2019s  calculation of results for its performance measures may be misleading or  confusing to CBP and DHS program managers or the Congress, who  provide program oversight."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since we began reporting on the CSI program in 2003, CBP has made  significant progress in expanding and developing the program. However,  CBP continues to face several management and operational challenges,  which may limit CBP\u2019s ability to ensure that the CSI program provides the  intended level of security for U.S.-bound container cargo moving through  the international supply chain. Also, balancing security concerns with the  need to facilitate the free flow of commerce remains an ongoing challenge  for CBP.", "Recognizing that program evaluation data are important for program  managers to understand why results occur and what value a program  adds, CBP has taken actions to enhance its evaluation of CSI team  activities. The revised evaluation program has increased the information  available to make policy and programmatic decisions regarding the  operations at the CSI seaports. However, limitations that remain in CBP\u2019s  evaluation process affect the accuracy and completeness of the program  information available for making sound management decisions about the  CSI program as a whole. Specifically, when CBP\u2019s evaluation teams do not  complete the evaluation tools or resolve contradictory information,  program managers may receive limited or inaccurate information. Further,  when the data collected using the CSI evaluation tool during the  evaluations are not reliable and readily available for assessment, CBP\u2019s  planned programwide trend analyses of the CSI program may be  misleading.", "In assessing CSI performance, CBP lacks information about a very  important aspect of the program\u2014the overall examination systems used  by the host governments to examine high-risk cargo shipped in containers  as requested by CBP. CBP\u2019s efforts have led to the successful participation  of a wide array of foreign governments in the CSI program, and CBP has  established many cooperative relationships with its foreign partners. While  we acknowledge the agency cannot force security requirements upon  foreign governments, the lack of information systematically gathered  about the examination systems used by participating governments is  problematic. Data about the equipment, people and processes involved in  the examination system are vital for determining whether high-risk U.S.- bound containers have been properly examined or should be examined or  reexamined upon arrival at a U.S. seaport. CBP lacks guidelines and  criteria for most of the equipment and the people and processes used by  host government examination systems\u2014as required, in some instances, by  the SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts\u2014for evaluating CSI seaport operations and  determining overall program effectiveness. In light of the new 9/11 Act  requirement that 100 percent of U.S.-bound container cargo be scanned in  the future at foreign seaports before leaving for the United States, it is  important that that CBP have programs in place to gather the information  necessary to ensure that cargo container examinations\u2014and the  equipment used as part of the examination process\u2014are reliable,  regardless of the point of origin.", "Program evaluations are just one source of information that managers  need to make decisions, and evaluation data must often be coupled with  performance measurement to assess overall program results. Measuring  the overall impact of the CSI program remains difficult due to the  challenges involved in creating effective performance measures, and  because of great difficulty in measuring the deterrent effect of the  program. As we and the Office of Management and Budget have reported,  performance measurement can be very valuable to program managers, as  the process can indicate what a program is accomplishing and whether  intended results are being achieved. Measuring program performance  encourages managers to focus on the key goals of a program and helps  them by providing information on how resources and efforts are best  allocated to ensure effectiveness.  Though CBP identified performance  measures it considers proxies for program outcomes (given the difficulty  in assessing the deterrent effect of CSI), these measures do not cover a  key core program function, for example a performance measure for the  number of high-risk U.S.-bound containers examined at CSI seaports.  Finally, without clearly developed performance targets for each of its  measures, program managers, Congress, and the public lack information  needed to determine the extent to which the CSI program is performing as  intended. Taken as a whole, the lack of clearly articulated performance  measures and accurate and reliable evaluative data may hinder CBP\u2019s  ability to ensure that the resources it expends for CSI effectively achieve  its goal of helping to secure U.S. borders against terrorists and terrorist  weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that CBP has the information needed to assess its  achievement of CSI program goals to help enhance supply chain  security\u2014while at the same time balancing security concerns with the  need to facilitate the free flow of commerce\u2014we recommend that the  Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Commissioner of U. S. Customs  and Border Protection to take the following actions in three areas:  Strengthen CBP\u2019s process for evaluating CSI teams at overseas ports  by (a) systematically capturing and maintaining all relevant evaluation  data and documentation so that it can be used by CBP management to  guide operating decisions, monitor program performance, and inform  resource allocation decisions; (b) ensuring that CSI evaluation teams  follow established evaluation procedures; and (c) monitoring the  completion, within established time frames, of recommendations made  in previous evaluations.", "In collaboration with host government officials, improve the  information gathered about the host governments\u2019 examination  systems\u2014which includes people, processes, and equipment\u2014at each  CSI port by (a) establishing general guidelines and technical criteria  regarding the minimal capability and operating procedures for an  examination system that can provide CBP with  a basis for determining  the reliability of examinations and related CSI activities; (b)  systematically collecting data for that purpose; and (c) analyzing the  data against the guidelines and technical criteria to determine what, if  any, mitigating actions or incentives CBP should take to help ensure  the desired level of security.", "Enhance CSI performance measures to better assess CSI performance  overall by (a) developing measures for all core CSI program functions  designed to have a deterrent effect, (b) establishing annual  performance targets\u2014based on explicit assumptions\u2014for all  performance measures, and (c) revising how performance measures  are calculated to take into account CSI program growth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of State and the  Department of Homeland Security for their review and comment.

In  commenting on a draft of this report, DHS noted that it concurred with  one recommendation and partially concurred with the remaining two  recommendations.", "In its written comments, DHS and CBP concurred with our  recommendation on strengthening its process for evaluating CSI teams at  overseas locations.  Specifically, CBP noted that by June 2008, it planned  to establish a database that would contain all recommendations and action  plans as a result of CSI port evaluations as well as due dates for  implementing recommendations and actions taken.  To ensure that CSI  evaluation teams follow procedures, CBP indicated that it would make it  mandatory that the teams complete all database fields.  Furthermore, CBP  reported that it would assign values to questions in its evaluation tool on  the basis of the criticality of the activity evaluated in each question to  CSI\u2019s mission as a whole.", "DHS commented that CBP partially concurred with our second  recommendation to improve information gathered about host  governments\u2019 examination systems by (a) establishing general guidelines  and technical criteria regarding the minimal capability and operating  procedures; (b) systematically collecting data for that purpose; and (c)  analyzing the data against the guidelines and technical criteria.  CBP  agreed on the importance of an accepted examination process and noted it  continues to take steps in addressing improvements in the information  gathered about host government\u2019s examination systems at CSI seaports by  working directly with host government counterparts, through the World  Customs Organization, and providing capacity building training and  technical assistance.  While CBP does engage in capacity building, it does  so with only 5 of the 33 countries with CSI ports.  CBP also stated that it  will continue to use the WCO through its SAFE Framework of Standards  to address a uniform customs process and technical standards for  equipment.  However, the SAFE Framework mentions no specific  technical capability criteria for inspection equipment.  Additionally, CBP  does not systematically collect or assess information on the people,  processes, or technology used by these host governments to examine high- risk U.S.-bound containers.  CBP also noted in its comments to this report,  that equipment used for inspection of containers in foreign countries is  equal to or better than the equipment used by CBP at its domestic ports.   While CBP has performance information for the 16 seaports that have  inspection equipment on loan from CBP, it is not in a position to assess the  performance of equipment used at the remaining 42 CSI seaports.   Although we repeatedly requested systematic information regarding the  equipment technical capabilities in these other ports, CBP officials were  unable to provide it to us.  In response to our 2005 report, CBP stated that  it would evaluate the feasibility of technical requirements for nonintrusive  inspection equipment, but a legal issue may exist regarding CBP\u2019s ability to  impose such requirements.  While we understand CBP\u2019s position, it could  still gather information on such equipment\u2019s technical capabilities.   Because the CSI inspection might be the only inspection of a container  before it enters the United States, it is important that information on the  people, processes, and equipment used as part of CSI be obtained and  assessed to provide some level of assurance of the likelihood that the  examination system could detect the presence of WMD.  If a port\u2019s  examination system were determined to be insufficient, CBP could take  mitigating actions, such as re-examining container cargo upon its arrival at  a domestic seaport.", "Finally, DHS commented that CBP partially concurred with our third  recommendation to enhance CSI performance measures to better assess  CSI performance overall.  CBP stated that it believes its current measures  address core program functions of targeting and collaboration with host  governments to mitigate or substantiate the risk of a maritime container  destined for the United States.  We disagree.  As discussed earlier in this  report, a core element of the CSI program, specifically the extent to which  U.S.-bound containers carrying high-risk cargo are examined at CSI  seaports, is not addressed through CBP\u2019s performance measures.  In its  comments, CBP stated that its outcome performance indicator captures  the number of foreign mitigated examinations by category, however CBP  did not respond to our requests for more information regarding these  categories, including whether risk was a category.  Although it considers  action on this recommendation completed, CBP noted its intention to  continue to refine, evaluate, and implement measures to track progress  toward meeting CSI objectives. As previously stated, since issuing the CSI  strategic plan, CBP has not updated its performance targets for fiscal year  2008 or beyond for any of its measures.  Thus, we believe additional action  is warranted.  Establishing annual targets for performance measures is  important, as agencies can determine the program\u2019s progress, in part, by  comparing the performance measures against the targets.  In addition,  CBP did not address whether it plans to reconsider how it calculates some  of its performance measures to control for CSI program growth. Without  doing so, CBP\u2019s calculation of results for its performance measures may be  misleading or confusing to CBP and DHS program managers, or the  Congress, who provide program oversight.", "DHS and CBP also provided technical comments, which have been  incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me  at (202) 512-9610 or at caldwells@gao.gov.

In addition, to  measure CSI\u2019s progress in meeting its performance goals, we reviewed and  analyzed CBP data related to the number of CSI seaports, the cargo CBP  targeted and referred to the host government to examine, and the number  of cargo containers that were (and were not) examined by host  government officials at the CSI seaports.

We also reviewed the CSI human capital  plan and spoke to CBP officials about actions the agency has taken to  ensure that CSI human resources are appropriately allocated. As part of  that process, we met with officials at CBP headquarters and at the  National Targeting Center - Cargo (NTCC) in Virginia to discuss the  agency\u2019s decision to conduct some targeting of high-risk containers from  the NTCC rather than at CSI seaports. In addition, we spoke to CBP  officials at three domestic seaports, selected according to geographical  location and container volume. We also visited six CSI seaports located  overseas, and selected the locations based on geographic and strategic  significance, container volume to the United States from the seaports,  when the seaports began conducting CSI operations, and whether the  seaport was involved in CBP\u2019s Secure Freight Initiative. At the CSI  seaports, we also interviewed host government officials and CSI teams to  discuss the frequency and level of collaboration involved in their  interactions with each other, circumstances at seaport facilities that affect  CSI operations, and financial cost issues associated with examinations.

For each of  the evaluations reviewed, we assessed any available materials, which  could include a narrative report and/or a checklist of yes or no responses.  While our sample covered various aspects of CBP\u2019s evaluations, our  sample was not selected using statistical sampling techniques.

The container  targeting and examination activities conducted at the foreign seaports for  U.S.-bound cargo (exports) are very similar to activities CBP conducts at  domestic seaports for arriving containers (imports). Figure 8 illustrates the  various steps and decision points involved in targeting and examining  high-risk U.S.-bound containers at CSI seaports.", "Under CSI, the targeting of cargo can include the targeters\u2019 review of the  Automated Targeting System (ATS) score and the information on which it  is based, the bills of lading\u2014which include data about the cargo\u2014and  additional information provided by host government officials. CBP  targeters at CSI seaports are to access bills of lading through ATS, a  system that automatically uses its hundreds of rules to check available  data for every container arriving in the United States and assigns a risk  score to each cargo shipment. Targeters review the bill of lading, making  a cursory check for discrepancies and anomalies in the name and address  of the importer, the commodity, the cargo description and other data  elements.  On the basis of the initial review of the bill of lading, CBP  officials are to either (1) categorize the cargo as low risk, in which case,  the container holding the cargo is loaded onto the departing vessel without  being examined, or (2) conduct further research in order to properly  characterize the risk level of the cargo.  Further research entails targeters  using automated resources, such as the Treasury Enforcement  Communication System or AutoTrack, as well as nonautomated resources,  such as information provided by host government officials, to obtain  applicable information to determine the validity of the shipment. Further  research may also be conducted by the team\u2019s intelligence research  specialist.

After receiving a referral from CSI teams, host customs officials  are to review the bill of lading and the reasons for the referrals to  determine whether or not to examine the container cargo. Some host  governments collect intelligence information on U.S.-bound cargo  independent of CSI, which host officials also consider in decisions of  whether to examine the referred cargo. If host government officials agree  that the cargo is high-risk, they will proceed with an examination.  According to CBP, in general, CSI team members are to observe the  examinations and review and document the results. On the basis of the  results of a nonintrusive examination, such as if an anomaly is apparent in  the image of the container, the host government and CBP officials must  decide whether the host government will conduct a physical examination  of the a container.", "Alternatively, the CSI team may waive an examination referral if (1) host  government officials provide the CSI team with additional information that  lowers the risk level of the cargo or (2) logistics prohibit an examination,  such as if the cargo container were already loaded on the departing vessel.  Finally, if the host government officials determine, on the basis of their  review, that the cargo is not high-risk, they will deny examination of the  cargo. For any high-risk cargo for which an examination is waived or  denied, CSI teams are to place a domestic hold on the cargo, so that an  examination will be conducted upon arriving in the United States.  However, if CSI team members are adamant that a cargo container poses  an imminent risk to the carrier or U.S. seaport of arrival but cannot  otherwise convince the host officials to examine the container, CSI team  members are to contact and coordinate with the NTCC to issue a do-not- load order for national security. According to CBP officials, this order  advises the carrier that the specified container will not be permitted to be  unloaded in the United States until a time when any associated imminent  risk to the cargo container is neutralized. Once the risk is neutralized, the  container is to be loaded back onto the carrier and placed on hold for a  domestic examination.

Radiation detection equipment, such as a  radiation portal monitor (RPM) and radiation isotope identifier devices  (RIID) detects the presence of radioactive material that may originate  from a container.  However, only the RIID can determine whether the type  of radiation emitted by the material actually poses a threat or is a normal  emission of radiation, such as that found in ceramic tile.
