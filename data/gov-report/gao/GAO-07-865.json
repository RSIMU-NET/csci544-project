TIRB, in  turn, is to review the scoring results and provide its recommendations to  Treasury\u2019s executive investment review board, which is then to select  which investments will be included in the department\u2019s IT investment  portfolio that is ultimately submitted to OMB for funding considerations.", "Investments do not technically exit the select phase until they are  terminated, since they must be reviewed annually for reselection. The  bureaus are responsible for conducting their own select process for  nonmajor investments.", "Control Phase ensures, through timely oversight, quality control, and  executive review, that IT investments are managed in a disciplined and  consistent manner. This phase is characterized by Treasury\u2019s Office of the  CIO initiating quarterly control reviews, which focus on ensuring that an  investment\u2019s projected benefits are being realized; that cost, schedule, and  performance goals are being met; that risks are minimized and managed;  and that the investment continues to meet strategic goals. Through Office  of the CIO quarterly data calls, bureau project managers are to update data  as of the end of the previous quarter for cost and schedule, performance  measures, and risk assessments for both major and nonmajor investments.  This updated data is to be entered into the department\u2019s automated IT  portfolio management tool, which the bureau project managers and the  bureau CIOs are to certify for accuracy using a certification form within  the tool. Next, Treasury\u2019s CPIC team is to evaluate the data and provide  feedback to the bureaus through the bureaus\u2019 CPIC coordinators, giving  the bureaus an opportunity to remediate missing or erroneous data.

The age and the life cycle stage of the  investment determine which of these two subprocesses is conducted on an  investment.", "The purpose of the PIR is to assess the performance of an investment that  has been fully developed and has moved into the operational and  maintenance stage of its life cycle. An investment\u2019s project manager is to  initiate a PIR 6 to 18 months after an investment has moved into its  operational and maintenance stage. During a PIR, an investment\u2019s actual  performance is compared to its expected performance to identify lessons  learned for improving both the investment and Treasury\u2019s CPIC process.  The PIR is also intended to measure the strategic impact, user satisfaction,  and whether the investment is meeting cost, schedule, and performance  metrics. The results of the PIR are to be documented in Treasury\u2019s  portfolio management tool. Once the PIR is completed, Treasury\u2019s CPIC  team is to evaluate the results, provide feedback to the project manager  and the respective bureau management, and provide summary information  to TIRB. TIRB, in turn, is to report lessons learned from the PIRs  conducted and any recommendations it may have to the department\u2019s  executive investment review board in order to promote the lessons  learned across the department\u2019s IT investment portfolio.", "The purpose of the OA is to identify those investments in operations and  maintenance for which PIRs have been conducted that are likely to require  modification, acceleration, replacement, or retirement, and to help  determine the remaining useful life of an investment. However, because of  the newness of Treasury\u2019s PIR requirement and the age of certain  investments that have been in the operations and maintenance stage of  their life cycle, a PIR may not have been performed on these investments  prior to the required OA. Similar to a PIR, in conducting the OA, Treasury  focuses on two key areas: (1) program objectives, looking at alignment to  cost, schedule, and strategic goals; and (2) meeting user needs. In  determining how well the investment aligns to program objectives, data  are to be captured on an annual basis---most likely from established  sources, such as the quarterly control reviews and annual select phase  process. To determine whether user needs are still being met by the  investment, the investment\u2019s project manager, in coordination with the  investment\u2019s business owner, is to solicit user input, using such means as a  survey, focus groups, or regular user group meetings. The results of the  OA are to be documented in Treasury\u2019s portfolio management tool and can  entail recommending the investment continue operations as is, be  modified, or be terminated. Based on further analysis by the CPIC team, a  review meeting may be scheduled to discuss the results and the  recommendations. The results of these meetings are to be shared with  TIRB and the executive investment review board, as appropriate. Prior to  exiting the evaluation phase, the executive investment review board must  approve the disposal, retirement, or replacement of major investments.", "Figure 2 shows the schedule of select, control, and evaluate activities that  take place throughout the year.

The ITIM is a  maturity model composed of five progressive stages of maturity that an  agency can achieve in its investment management capabilities. It was  developed on the basis of our research into the IT investment management  practices of leading private- and public-sector organizations. In each of the  five stages, the framework identifies critical processes for making  successful IT investments. The maturity stages are cumulative; that is, in  order to attain a higher stage, the agency must have institutionalized all of  the critical processes at the lower stages in addition to the higher stage  critical processes.", "The framework can be used to assess the maturity of an agency\u2019s  investment management processes and as a tool for organizational  improvement. The overriding purpose of the framework is to encourage  investment processes that increase business value and mission  performance, reduce risk, and increase accountability and transparency in  the decision process. We have used the framework in several of our  evaluations, and a number of agencies have adopted it. These agencies  have used ITIM for purposes ranging from self-assessment to redesign of  their IT investment management processes.", "ITIM\u2019s five maturity stages represent the steps toward achieving stable and  mature processes for managing IT investments. Each stage builds on the  lower stages, and the successful attainment of each stage leads to  improvement in the organization\u2019s ability to manage its investments. With  the exception of Stage 1, each maturity stage is composed of critical  processes that must be implemented and institutionalized in order for the  organization to achieve that stage. These critical processes are further  broken down into key practices that describe the types of activities an  organization should be performing to successfully implement each critical  process. It is not unusual for an organization to be performing key  practices from more than one maturity stage at the same time, but efforts  to improve investment management capabilities should focus on  implementing all lower stage practices before addressing higher stage  practices.", "In the ITIM, Stage 2 critical processes lay the foundation for sound IT  investment processes by helping the agency to attain successful,  predictable, and repeatable investment control processes at the project  level. Specifically, Stage 2 encompasses building a sound investment  management foundation by establishing basic capabilities for selecting  new IT projects. It involves developing the capability to control projects so  that they finish predictably within established cost and schedule  expectations and have the capability to identify potential exposures to risk  and put in place strategies to mitigate that risk. It also involves instituting  an IT investment board, which includes defining its membership,  guidance policies, operations, roles, responsibilities, and authorities for  one or, if applicable, more IT investment boards within the organization,  and, if appropriate, each board\u2019s support staff. The basic selection  processes established in Stage 2 lay the foundation for more mature  selection capabilities in Stage 3, which represents a major step forward in  maturity. In this stage, the agency moves from project-centric processes to  a portfolio approach, evaluating potential investments by how well they  support the agency\u2019s mission, strategies, and goals.", "Stage 3 requires that an organization continually assess both proposed and  ongoing projects as parts of a complete investment portfolio\u2014an  integrated and competing set of investment options. It focuses on  establishing a consistent, well-defined perspective on the IT investment  portfolio and maintaining mature, integrated selection (and reselection),  control, and evaluation processes, which are to be evaluated during PIRs.  This portfolio perspective allows decision makers to consider the  interaction among investments and the contributions to organizational  mission goals and strategies that could be made by alternative portfolio  selections, rather than focusing exclusively on the balance between the  costs and benefits of individual investments.", "Stages 4 and 5 require the use of evaluation techniques to continuously  improve both the investment portfolio and the investment processes in  order to better achieve strategic outcomes.

The organization selects board members to ensure  they are knowledgeable about policies and procedures for managing  investments. Organizations at the Stage 2 level of maturity also take steps  to ensure that executives and line managers support and carry out the  decisions of the investment board.

In  implementing the plan, the Chief Information Officer should ensure that  the resources are available to carry out the plan and that progress is  measured and reported periodically to the Secretary of the Department of  the Treasury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In e-mail comments on a draft of this report, the Acting CIO stated that the  report reflects both Treasury\u2019s shortcomings as well as progress to date  and recognized the need to take proactive steps to strengthen its  investment board operations and oversight of information technology  resources and programs. Treasury also commented on the need for an  executive review board, nonmajor investments, and the department\u2019s  authority to redirect funding from one Treasury bureau to another.", "Regarding the need for an executive investment review board, Treasury  noted that, in addition to the Technical Investment Review Board chaired  by the CIO, an E-Board consisting of Treasury executives previously  existed. We acknowledge the establishment of these boards in our report  but emphasize that there currently is no executive investment review  board composed of executives from IT and business units that is actively  engaged in the investment management process. The department  recognizes this in its comments, stating that it agrees it needs to  reconstitute its executive board such that it is actively engaged in the  investment management process.", "Regarding nonmajor investments, Treasury commented that nonmajor  investments have not been a priority because the major investments the  department has chosen to devote its resources to represent the more  significant portion of the portfolio in terms of dollar value, visibility to  OMB and Congress, and importance to Treasury\u2019s mission. We recognize  the importance of the major investments in our report and acknowledge  that it is reasonable to focus attention on these investments. Nevertheless,  we maintain that nonmajor investments should require a certain level of  oversight given the amount of funding involved (about $480 million in  estimated expenditures for fiscal year 2007) and the fact that they  represent the bulk of most bureaus investment portfolio. Treasury also  stated that its CPIC guide contains guidance on managing nonmajor IT  investments and that the department conducts quarterly control reviews of  all IT investments, both major and nonmajor. While the guide requires all  IT investments to comply with its provisions, it clearly states that the  select phase described applies to major investments and that bureaus are  responsible for conducting their own select process for nonmajor  investments. In addition, while, as we note in the report, Treasury requires  bureaus to report on the cost, schedule, and performance of its nonmajor  investments on a quarterly basis, this information is not provided to TIRB  for review. Treasury noted that it is currently developing guidance and  reporting requirements for nonmajors that integrates enterprise  architecture and capital planning.", "In its comments, Treasury also noted that the department\u2019s ability to  exercise effective management of its IT portfolio requires that the CIO (as  chairman of the Technical Investment Review Board) be empowered to  make recommendations to the executive board concerning IT budgetary  requests across the department. Additionally, the executive board needs to  be empowered to make decisions across organizational lines on behalf of  the department. Treasury added that, currently, neither the Treasury  Department, including the Acting CIO, nor the executive board has the  prerogative (authority) to redirect IT funding from one Treasury bureau to  another. While this particular authority was not the subject of our review,  we agree that not having it could present a challenge to effectively  managing the IT portfolio. Nevertheless, effective portfolio management  requires the collective decisionmaking of executives from both IT and  business units, which highlights the importance of having an executive  investment review board that is actively engaged in the investment  management process.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking  Minority Members of other Senate and House committees that have  authorization and oversight responsibilities for Treasury and other  interested congressional committees; the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget; the Secretary of the Treasury; the Assistant  Secretary for Management and Chief Financial Officer; and the Chief  Information Officer.

We  reviewed written policies, procedures, and guidance and other  documentation providing evidence of executed practices, including  Treasury\u2019s Capital Planning and Investment Control Policy Guide,  Earned Value Management Policy Guide, Exhibit 300 Scoring Guide,  Alternative Analysis Policy Guide, FY06 IT Portfolio Alignment  Summary, IT Modernization Blueprint Volume 2: IT Strategic Plan,  portfolio management tool guidance, and various memorandums. We also  reviewed TIRB and CIO Council meeting materials. In addition, we  conducted interviews with officials from the Office of the CIO, whose  main responsibility is to oversee and ensure that Treasury\u2019s IT investment  management process is implemented and followed.", "We compared the evidence collected from our document reviews and  interviews to the key practices in ITIM. We rated the key practices as  \u201cexecuted\u201d on the basis of whether the agency demonstrated (by providing  evidence of performance) that it had met the criteria of the key practice. A  key practice was rated as \u201cnot executed\u201d when we found insufficient  evidence of a practice during the review or when we determined that there  were significant weaknesses in Treasury\u2019s execution of the key practice. In  addition, Treasury was provided with the opportunity to produce evidence  for key practices rated as \u201cnot executed.\u201d We did not assess progress in  establishing the capabilities found in Stages 4 and 5 because the  department acknowledged it had not executed the key practices in these  higher maturity stages.", "To determine the level of guidance the department is providing to its  bureaus, we interviewed officials and obtained written responses from the  Bureau of the Public Debt, Financial Management Service, and the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) to determine the level of investment management  guidance and oversight that is provided by the department. As part of our  analysis, we selected one enterprisewide and three bureau-level IT  projects as case studies to verify that the critical processes and key  practices were being applied. The projects selected (1) are in different life- cycle phases, (2) represent a mix of headquarters and component bureau  investments, (3) support different functional areas, and (4) required  different levels of funding. The four projects are described as follows:  1.  Customer Account Data Engine (CADE). The database initiative is the  foundation for managing taxpayer accounts in IRS\u2019s Business Systems  Modernization effort. CADE is being incrementally designed,  developed, and implemented to form the data foundation for a  modernized IRS by replacing the Individual Master File and its related  applications with new technology, new applications, and new  databases. The system\u2019s purpose is to enable IRS tax specialists to post  transactions and update taxpayer account and return data using an  online interface tool. Updates are to be available daily to authorized  personnel who have access to this data, which provide a complete,  timely, and accurate account of the individual taxpayer\u2019s information.  The project is a major investment and has an estimated life-cycle cost  of over $1.3 billion.  2.  Savings Bond Replacement System (SaBRe). SaBRe supports two of  the President\u2019s Management Agenda initiatives: financial performance  and expanded e-government. It processes cash and security  transactions that result when accrued savings bonds are sold or  redeemed by Federal Reserve Bank processing sites or by financial  institutions and corporate entities designated as fiscal agents. Federal  Reserve Bank processing sites consolidate and report to SaBRe daily  issue and retirement transactions generated by processing cash and  security transactions. SaBRe processes the transactions, updates  electronic records that are used for customer service, and reports daily  financial transactions for inclusion in the Daily Treasury Statement.  The project is a major investment and has an estimated life-cycle cost  of over $57 million.  3.  Treasury Receivable, Accounting, and Collection System (TRACS).", "TRACS is to provide Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service with a  tool for supporting its Payment Business Line for the accounting, debt  billing, collection, and reporting requirements associated with  Treasury\u2019s check claims business process. It is to aid in the processing  of check claims accounting, authorization of payments, issuing of bills,  debt collection, and funds transfers from and to federal program  agencies. Currently all funding for TRACS  will be used to maintain  and enhance the system. The project is a nonmajor investment and has  an estimated life-cycle cost of over $11 million through fiscal year  2012.  4.  Treasury Foreign Intelligence Network (TFIN). TFIN exists to assist  Treasury analysts in their ongoing efforts to provide meaningful  intelligence to senior Treasury management as well as to other  agencies within the intelligence community. It was originally built as a  customized in-house network over 10 years ago. In early fiscal year  2005, Treasury identified a need to modernize TFIN due to the age of  the system, outdated components, and performance issues, and to  address Treasury\u2019s expanding mission in the fight against terrorism.  The system is currently listed as a major department-level  development, modernization, and enhancement effort, with total  estimated life-cycle costs of $43 million.", "For these projects, we reviewed project management documentation, such  as project plans, and status reports. We also obtained investment  information from the bureau officials responsible for managing the  projects.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and evaluated documents  showing what management actions had been taken and what initiatives  had been planned by the agency. This documentation included the IT  Modernization Blueprint Volume 2, IT Strategic Plan, The Department of  the Treasury\u2019s Strategic Plan, and a contractor work request for an  independent validation and verification of Treasury\u2019s capital planning  program support process. We also interviewed officials from the Office of  the CIO to determine efforts undertaken to improve IT investment  management processes.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed legislation, including the  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the E-Government Act of 2002, and OMB  guidance to determine the roles and responsibilities of CIOs regarding  investment management. We also reviewed the practices laid out in GAO\u2019s  IT investment management framework. We reviewed documentation and  conducted interviews with Treasury officials, including the Associate CIO  for Capital Planning and Information Management, to determine the extent  of the CIO\u2019s involvement in selecting, controlling, and evaluating the  department\u2019s IT investments. We conducted our work at Treasury  headquarters in Washington, D.C., from August 2006 through July 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sabine Paul, Assistant Director;  William Barrick; Camille Chaires; Neil Doherty; Nancy Glover; and Tomas  Ramirez; made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
