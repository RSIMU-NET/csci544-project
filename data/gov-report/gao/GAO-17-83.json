This provision was briefly applied in the United States and, in 1940,  Congress enacted legislation to apply it in Puerto Rico as well as the U.S. Virgin  Islands.   Beginning in the 1970s, Congress passed legislation that set minimum wages for  certain industries in these two territories to equal the federal minimum wage and  created a schedule of increases for minimum wages in the remaining industries to  eventually equal the federal minimum wage. These minimum wage increases were  subject to potentially higher increases as recommended by the SICs.

Because future minimum wage increases under either an indexed or a  schedule-based approach would be automatic, either approach could  potentially require minimal administrative activity. However, an  indexed approach would likely require somewhat more ongoing  administrative activity because of the need to monitor the cost-of- living index. Additional resources would also likely be needed if  components of the two general approaches were combined, which  could involve calculations to determine to what extent increases  should be adjusted upward.

First, the data needed to  monitor such indicators may not be readily available. For example, the  federal government does not collect certain labor market information for  American Samoa, which impedes measurement of unemployment levels  in the territory. In addition, collecting and monitoring economic data  would require considerable administrative activity, and an administrator  might be needed to determine when the safeguard should be triggered.  For example, in California the Governor is authorized to use his or her  discretion to temporarily suspend that state\u2019s minimum wage increases if  certain economic conditions are met.

For example, given American Samoa\u2019s island  economy and dependence on the dominant private sector tuna canning  industry, the sudden exit of a cannery owing in part to an increase in  minimum wages would occur before the cannery\u2019s exit affected  unemployment levels and before a safeguard could be triggered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Reviewers\u2019 Views on Increasing the Minimum Wage in American Samoa", "paragraphs": ["Four external reviewers of our report, with expertise encompassing labor  economics, Pacific island economies, and fisheries, provided their  perspectives on increasing minimum wages in American Samoa.

One reviewer suggested that in small  economies, such as American Samoa\u2019s, increasing the minimum  wage may in turn lead to increases in the cost of living. Another  pointed out that indexing to the cost of living may not be feasible in  American Samoa. Given that a cost-of-living index is typically based  on household expenses, one reviewer pointed out that the standard  definition of \u201chousehold\u201d used in the United States may not apply in  American Samoa given the territory\u2019s cultural ethos of sharing with  extended family and fellow villagers.", "Setting minimum wages in American Samoa commensurate with,  not equal to, the federal minimum wage. One reviewer suggested  setting a minimum wage in American Samoa that is proportionate  rather than equal to the federal minimum wage. For example, if a full- time minimum wage worker in the United States earns, on average,  35 percent of the U.S. median household income, the American  Samoa minimum wage would be set at 35 percent of the median  household income in American Samoa.

In addition, we reviewed data  and interviewed officials from the U.S. Departments of Commerce, the  Interior, and Labor, and the American Samoa government. We also spoke  with, and gathered information from, representatives of the four major  tuna companies operating in the United States, two of which currently  operate tuna canneries in American Samoa. In addition, we took the  following steps:  To estimate American Samoa employment and earnings, we analyzed  data from the American Samoa Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of  Taxation as well as tuna canning industry employers\u2019 responses to our  questionnaire. The Office of Taxation data\u2014numbers and annual  earnings of persons employed at any point during the tax year\u2014came  directly from the office\u2019s tax system, with the exception of data for  American Samoa government employees in 2013 and 2014, which the  office provided separately. The Office of Taxation was unable to provide  2014 data for the American Samoa Medical Center; therefore, we used  the values reported for 2013. In accordance with other federal  employment surveys and with the methodology we employed in preparing  our 2010, 2011, and 2014 reports on the impact of minimum wage  increases in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands (CNMI), our employer questionnaire requested wage  data for mid-June pay periods in 2014 and 2015, with the addition of  information on a pay period in January 2016. The questionnaire asked  separately for data regarding workers paid an hourly wage and workers  paid an annual salary. For hourly wage workers, respondents were asked  to provide the number of employees paid at each wage rate. For salaried  workers, respondents were asked the number of full-time and part-time  workers paid at each salary level.", "Before sending our initial questionnaire on this topic in 2009, we  pretested it over the phone with three employers in the CNMI and two in  American Samoa to make sure that the questions were clear and  comprehensive, the data were readily obtainable, and the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on employers. While we eliminated some  questions in our current questionnaire, revisions to remaining questions  were minor and did not require additional pretesting.", "We administered the questionnaire in February 2016. We sent the  questionnaire to StarKist and Tri Marine, the two canneries currently  operating in American Samoa, and received two completed  questionnaires for a 100-percent response rate. Employers received the  questionnaire by e-mail in an attached form that they could return  electronically after marking checkboxes or entering responses in open- answer boxes.

In compiling the  questionnaire-based earnings data for a given year, we assumed that all  hourly cannery workers earned the minimum wage for that year and  worked all year. When the minimum wage changed midyear, we assumed  that the original wage applied for the first half of the year and the revised  wage for the second half of the year.

Using these data, we determined both the  median wage rate and the number of workers that would be affected by  future minimum wage rates because their wages were at or below future  scheduled minimum wages. We estimated the cost of future scheduled  minimum wages by, first, calculating the cost to the cannery of increasing  each worker\u2019s wages to scheduled levels and, second, averaging the  results of this calculation for all current workers. This estimate assumed  that workers worked full time and all year (i.e., 2,080 hours) and that the  minimum-wage increase would not affect the wages of workers currently  earning more than the minimum wage.", "We interviewed cannery representatives to obtain their views on  competitive challenges facing the industry, including changes in minimum  wage rates, access to fishing grounds, and preferential trade status. To  illustrate other potential tuna production scenarios, we developed a tuna  model where tuna production relocates from the current status quo in  American Samoa to one of three possible scenarios of loining or canning  tuna, or both, in other locations. Changes in labor and tariff costs are  compared to the status quo scenario in American Samoa. The model  uses the tuna employment count from the questionnaire responses,  World Bank data on minimum wage rates in other countries, and  information obtained during interviews with tuna cannery employers.

We  identified common economic measures or indices of change in the cost of  living that are generated by the U.S. government and one generated by  the American Samoa government. To estimate how long it would take for  American Samoa\u2019s minimum wages to converge with the federal  minimum wage if they were indexed to the cost of living, we projected  future increases based on historical trends in DOL\u2019s CPI for the U.S. City  Average and Honolulu, Hawaii.

We also  estimated the length of time it would take for American Samoa minimum  wages to reach the federal minimum wage given schedules dictating  future increases of differing amounts and frequency (see app. IX for these  projections). In addition, we developed scenarios illustrating how indexing  and schedule-based approaches could be combined to meet both criteria  set by Pub. L. No. 114-61 for GAO\u2019s review (see app. X).

According to cannery officials, the canneries\u2019 current operations in  American Samoa are not competitive with other business models. To  illustrate tuna canning costs for other business models, we compared the  labor and tariff costs associated with four potential business scenarios for  the cannery operations currently located in American Samoa. The  following analysis provides cost estimates for the four possible models,  assuming constant total production under each model and including four  models that we presented in a 2011 report. Our analysis considers only  labor costs and tariffs, to show the effect of variation in different countries.  Our analysis excludes other associated costs, including transportation,  refrigeration, opening of a new plant (if needed), as well as costs  associated with establishing multiple production locations. Our analysis  also excludes nonwage labor costs, such as the costs of employer payroll  tax contributions.", "Model A (tuna loining and canning located in American Samoa).", "Tuna processing currently performed in American Samoa would  remain entirely in American Samoa. Canneries located in American  Samoa would hire local and foreign workers to loin (clean, cook, and  cut) and can the fish. In addition, the plant would process some loins  imported from countries with lower wages. The canned tuna from  American Samoa would be exported directly to the United States and  would benefit from tariff-free access to the U.S. market. With an  estimated workforce of 2,700 employees in American Samoa, the  associated labor cost would be $29 million in 2016, with zero tariff  costs.", "Model B (relocating tuna loining to Thailand or another country  with lower labor costs and canning processed loins in the U.S.  states). The loining operation\u2014the most labor-intensive part of the  operation\u2014would move to low labor-cost countries, such as Thailand,  Trinidad, Fiji, Mauritius, or Papua New Guinea, where the fish loin  would be cut, cleaned, and cooked and then placed in pouches. The  fish would then be exported to the United States, where it would be  canned. The imported fish would carry a tariff of $11 per metric ton,  and workers would be employed in a low labor-cost country at $1.20  per hour; the combined tariff and labor cost in 2016 would be $21.4  million. No workers would remain in American Samoa cleaning fish,  and 540 workers would be employed in the 50 U.S. states at $14.00  per hour. However, according to an industry expert, relocating  operations from American Samoa could affect the canneries\u2019 eligibility  for certain U.S. government contracts that require U.S.-sourced and - processed fish.", "Model C (relocating all loining and canning to a tariff-free  country). Loining would take place in a country with zero tariffs on  canned tuna exported to the United States. Workers would be  employed at $1.20 per hour as in Model B. Under this model, the  American Samoa canneries would close, and all 2,700 positions  would be relocated to a tariff-free country. The cost would be $6.6  million for 2016, assuming no wage increases in the tariff-free country.

The remaining 50 percent of production would move to a  country that exports canned tuna tariff free to the United States. For  this model, we assumed that 50 percent of the current workforce  would remain in American Samoa and the other 50 percent would be  located in a tariff-free country.

Model B\u2014moving the loining  operations to a country with lower wages\u2014also presents significant cost  savings; however, importing processed loins to the United States would  incur tariffs, and wages for canning in any of the 50 U.S. states would be  higher than in competing tuna processing countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Projected Timeframes for American Samoa Minimum Wages to Equal Federal Minimum Wage", "paragraphs": ["Table 10 shows projected timeframes for American Samoa minimum  wages, if indexed to the American Samoa cost of living on an annual  basis, to converge with the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 given  hypothetical annual increases in the cost of living.", "Table 11 shows the projected timeframes for the American Samoa  minimum wage to equal the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 under  a schedule-based approach, given varying hypothetical amounts and  frequency of scheduled increases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: Examples of Combining an Indexed Approach with a Schedule-Based Approach", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Example 1", "paragraphs": ["If an indexing approach were selected as the primary adjustment  mechanism to increase American Samoa\u2019s minimum wages, it could be  combined with a target timeframe and schedule for equaling the federal  minimum wage.
