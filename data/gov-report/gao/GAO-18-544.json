RRP automatically assigns selected returns to  the appropriate treatment based on the characteristics of IDT or other  refund fraud RRP detected. Examples of treatments include the  following:  Identity theft refund fraud. Returns selected by an IDT filter are  automatically assigned for treatment in the Taxpayer Protection  Program. IRS notifies taxpayers that they must authenticate their  identity before IRS will process the return or issue a refund.  Taxpayers can verify their identity by calling an IRS telephone  center, visiting a Taxpayer Assistance Center, or in some cases,  authenticating online or via mail.

Lowering the threshold would help IRS use RRP to verify returns  before issuing refunds. This proposed change has been included in H.R.  5444. As of June 2018, H.R. 5444 passed the House and was being  considered by the Senate Finance Committee.", "We have also suggested that Congress grant IRS broader math error  authority, with appropriate safeguards against misuse of that authority, to  correct taxpayer errors during tax return processing. IRS officials told us  that this type of corrective authority would allow IRS to develop more  efficient treatments for returns selected by RRP with obvious errors.  Although the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 gave IRS additional  math error authority, it is limited to certain circumstances. Giving IRS  broader math error authority or correctible error authority with appropriate  controls would enable IRS to correct obvious noncompliance, would be  less intrusive and burdensome to taxpayers than audits, and would  potentially help taxpayers who underclaim tax benefits to which they are  entitled. As of June 2018, Congress had not provided Treasury with such  authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Not Fully Considered Opportunities to Improve Data Available to RRP", "paragraphs": ["IRS has additional opportunities to improve data available to RRP to  enhance RRP\u2019s detection and accuracy.

RRP\u2019s access to useful and  timely information enables IRS to more fully utilize RRP\u2019s analytic  techniques to detect suspicious returns, leading to more accurate  selection and treatment decisions. Given RRP\u2019s importance to IRS\u2019s  mission, it is critical that IRS considers and addresses risks that could  affect the accuracy and effectiveness of RRP\u2019s detection and selection  activities.", "According to the Office of Management and Budget, risks include not only  threats but also opportunities that could affect an agency\u2019s ability to  achieve its mission. IRS and Congress have previously considered  opportunities and taken steps to enhance some data made available to  RRP. For example:  IRS expanded RRP\u2019s use of relevant data from electronically filed  returns and information returns. For example, as mentioned  previously, IRS incorporated a number of data elements identified  through the Security Summit into RRP. In 2016 and 2017, IRS used  these data elements to develop additional business rules and models  specific to electronically filed returns. IRS also expanded RRP analytic  techniques to incorporate data from Forms 1099-MISC, which  taxpayers may use to report non-employee compensation.", "Consistent with our prior reporting, in 2015 Congress enacted  legislation to help IRS prevent invalid refunds associated with IDT and  other refund fraud. This change allows IRS more time to use RRP to  match wage information to tax returns and to identify any  inconsistencies before issuing refunds. Since 2017, employers have  been required to submit W-2s to the Social Security Administration by  January 31, about 1 to 2 months earlier than in prior years. The act  also required IRS to hold refunds for all taxpayers claiming the Earned  Income Tax Credit or the Additional Child Tax Credit. In 2018 we  made recommendations that IRS fully assess the benefits and costs  of using existing authority to hold additional taxpayer refunds as well  as extending the date for releasing those refunds until it can verify  wage information. IRS outlined a number of actions it plans to take to  address these recommendations. Taking these actions could prevent  IRS from issuing millions of dollars in invalid refunds annually.", "IRS officials told us that they are taking steps to enhance RRP\u2019s  ability to detect fraudulent returns filed using prisoners\u2019 Social Security  numbers. To do this, IRS is working to load updated prisoner data into  RRP more frequently and developing additional business rules. The  Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) has  reported that refund fraud associated with prisoner Social Security  numbers is a significant problem for tax administration, accounting for  IRS\u2019s issuance of potentially fraudulent refunds worth tens of millions  of dollars in 2015.", "Based on our prior work, we found that there may be additional  opportunities for IRS to enhance RRP by improving data made available  to it:", "Making W-2 information available more frequently. In January  2018, we reported that IRS\u2019s ability to verify information on tax returns  early in the filing season was affected by limitations with its IT  systems. IRS receives and maintains information return data,  including W-2 and 1099-MISC forms, through the Information Return  Master File (IRMF) system. IRMF then makes the data available to  RRP for systemic verification, the automated process that uses W-2s  to verify that taxpayers accurately reported their income and other  information on their tax returns. IRS receives the W-2 data from the  Social Security Administration daily\u2014up to 25 million W-2s per day\u2014 but only loads the data into IRMF and RRP weekly. According to IRS,  to add new information returns to IRMF, IRS staff need to reload all  existing information at the same time. As employers and financial  institutions send more documents to IRS during the filing season,  reloading IRMF can take 3 days or more because updates take more  time as IRMF\u2019s file increases in size, ultimately containing billions of  information returns.", "IRS officials told us that having W-2s available for analysis sooner  would benefit RRP detection and selection of fraudulent returns. In  addition, matching W-2 information can also provide sufficient  assurance of a valid return, even if characteristics of the return might  otherwise raise suspicion. According to our analysis of RRP data for  the 2017 filing season, matching available W-2s resulted in RRP  excluding 367,027 electronically filed returns that RRP otherwise  would have selected as suspicious. Having W-2 information loaded  more frequently and available for RRP\u2019s systemic verification helps  IRS improve its use of limited enforcement resources by more  accurately identifying fraudulent returns and excluding legitimate  returns.", "As of April 2018, IRS officials had drafted but not yet approved a work  request to send IRMF data to RRP daily between January and March  during the 2019 filing season. In preparing the draft request, IRS  officials told us they are assessing how frequently the agency can  efficiently load data into IRMF as the filing season progresses.  Federal standards for internal control require federal managers to  analyze and address risks to agency objectives. As noted  previously, risks include not only threats but also opportunities.  Leading practices in fraud risk management further state that  managers should take into account external risks that can impact the  effectiveness of fraud prevention efforts. Until IRS makes incoming  employer W-2s available to RRP more frequently, IRS will not address  an opportunity to expand the use of RRP\u2019s systemic verification  process to more accurately detect and select invalid refund returns for  additional action.", "Making more information available electronically from returns  filed on paper. RRP\u2019s analytic techniques could be strengthened if  the program had electronic access to additional information from filers  of paper returns. While about 90 percent of individual taxpayers file  their returns electronically, over 19 million taxpayers filed on paper in  2017. To control costs, IRS transcribes a limited amount of  information provided by paper filers into its computer databases. This  practice limits the amount of information readily available for  enforcement and other tax administration activities that rely on  digitized information. We also reported that according to IRS officials,  digitizing and posting more comprehensive information provided by  paper filers could facilitate enforcement efforts, expedite contacts for  faster resolution, reduce handling costs, and increase compliance  revenue.", "In October 2011 we found that IRS considered a number of options to  make more information from paper returns available electronically,  including increasing manual transcription, optical character  recognition technology, and barcoding technology. An optical  character recognition system would read text directly from all paper  returns using optical scanners and recognition software and convert  the text to digital data. A 2-D bar code is a black and white grid that  encodes tax return data allowing IRS to scan the bar code to digitize  and import the data into IRS\u2019s systems, such as RRP. We  recommended in 2011 that IRS determine whether and to what extent  the benefits of barcoding would outweigh the costs. In response to  our recommendations, in 2012 IRS updated an earlier evaluation of  implementing barcoding technology for paper returns. The agency  estimated that implementing and using barcoding technology over a  10-year period from fiscal years 2015 to 2025 would yield about $109  million in benefits, compared to about $13 million in costs\u2014a  substantial return on investment. IRS estimated benefits based on  anticipated reductions in staff hours dedicated to the coding, editing,  transcription, and error resolution functions of paper return  processing.", "However, because of statutory limitations, a legislative change is  necessary to require individuals, estates, and trusts to print their  federal income tax returns with a scannable bar code. In each of its  congressional justifications for fiscal years 2012 to 2016, IRS  requested that Congress require returns prepared electronically but  filed on paper include a scannable code printed on the return. The  National Taxpayer Advocate made a similar legislative proposal in  2017. As of June 2018, Congress had not taken action on the  proposal.", "In addition to barcoding, there are other technologies IRS could use to  digitize more information from paper returns to further improve tax  administration and enforcement activities.

All individual returns (Forms  1040) are loaded into RRP as part of return processing. However, RRP is  used to prevent IRS from paying invalid refunds as part of IRS\u2019s pre- refund enforcement activities and, therefore, according to IRS officials,  RRP has been limited to detecting and selecting individual returns  claiming refunds. Currently, IRS does not use RRP to support other  enforcement activities that detect misreporting or noncompliance on  individual tax returns not claiming refunds, which also contribute to the tax  gap\u2014the difference between taxes owed and what are paid on time.", "Underreporting of income represents the majority of the tax gap, with the  average annual underreporting of individual income tax on both refund  and non-refund returns for tax years 2008 to 2010 estimated by IRS to be  about $264 billion or 57 percent of the total gross tax gap of $458 billion.", "Given the large amount of revenue lost each year due to underreporting,  it is important that IRS consider opportunities to improve its enforcement  efforts and promote compliance. IRS\u2019s enforcement of tax laws helps fund  the U.S. government by collecting revenue from noncompliant taxpayers  and, perhaps more importantly, promoting voluntary compliance by giving  taxpayers confidence that others are paying their fair share.", "According to IRS officials, RRP has benefited IRS\u2019s pre-refund  enforcement activities by enhancing detection of IDT and other refund  fraud, providing more cost-effective treatment, and enhancing data  analytics for improved enforcement. Based on this review of RRP\u2019s  capabilities and our prior work on tax enforcement and administration, we  identified a number of activities and processes that could be improved  and enhanced if IRS expanded RRP to analyze returns not claiming  refunds, in addition to returns with refunds. For example:", "Enhanced detection and selection of potential noncompliance.", "IRS reported that RRP significantly enhanced its detection of IDT and  other refund fraud over prior systems. In January 2018 we  recommended\u2014and IRS outlined planned actions\u2014that IRS assess  the benefits and costs of additional uses and applications of W-2 data  for pre-refund compliance checks, such as underreporting,  employment fraud, and other noncompliance. Underreporting occurs  when a taxpayer underreports income or claims unwarranted  deductions or tax credits. As previously noted, underreporting  accounts for the largest portion of the tax gap. To detect  underreporting by individuals, after the filing season and after refunds  have been issued, IRS uses its Automated Underreporter (AUR)  program to electronically match income information reported to IRS by  third parties, such as banks and employers, against information that  taxpayers report on their tax returns. During our review, we found that  this process of matching income information is similar to RRP\u2019s pre- refund systemic verification process that occurs during return  processing, but only applies to returns claiming refunds. IRS should  consider expanding RRP\u2019s capabilities to use RRP as a platform to  perform AUR matching on all individual returns during return  processing and post-processing, as more information returns are  available for matching. In May 2018, IRS officials told us that, in  response to our January 2018 recommendation, IRS is assessing the  possibility of using RRP to perform some AUR checks. However, until  IRS expands RRP to analyze returns not claiming refunds, these  compliance checks will not cover all potential underreporting.", "During this review of RRP, we also found that IRS could implement  predictive models of noncompliance in RRP to select returns for  audits. Audits are an important enforcement tool for IRS to identify  noncompliance in reporting tax obligations and to enhance voluntary  reporting compliance. IRS\u2019s Small Business and Self-Employed  (SB/SE) division conducts audits of individual taxpayers after the  return has been processed. SB/SE staff review the returns identified  for potential audit by various processes. One of these audit selection  processes is a computer algorithm\u2014discriminant function (DIF)\u2014that  uses models to score all individual returns (with and without refunds)  for their likelihood of noncompliance, an indicator of their audit  potential. The DIF models are developed from a unique data set and  include variables IRS has found to be effective in predicting the  likelihood that a return would have a significant tax change if  audited. The additional information available in RRP, such as  taxpayer history, has the potential to improve the DIF models and  therefore the DIF scoring. IRS officials told us that they plan to  examine opportunities to use RRP for some SB/SE audit selection  processes, such as incorporating DIF scoring into RRP. However, as  of April 2018 IRS had not taken any action.", "More efficient and effective treatment of potentially noncompliant  returns. IRS reported that RRP automated and streamlined many of  IRS\u2019s selection and treatment processes for preventing the issuance  of invalid refunds. Using RRP to improve IRS\u2019s detection and  selection of potentially noncompliant returns during return processing  could lead IRS to consider treatment options, such as soft notices,  that engage taxpayers earlier, to help IRS and taxpayers resolve  issues more quickly. A soft notice does not always require a response  from the taxpayer; instead, it provides information about a potential  error and asks taxpayers to review their records. Consequently, soft  notices can be more efficient than other treatments, such as  telephone calls or in-person interactions. This treatment option is  consistent with IRS\u2019s strategic objective to reduce the time between  filing and resolution of compliance issues. One strategy IRS highlights  to achieve this objective is to review and refine IRS\u2019s risk-based  systems, like RRP, to detect potential issues early.", "Currently, IRS\u2019s enforcement activities, including SB/SE audits and  AUR, occur after the return has been processed and the filing season  ends. For example, AUR begins matching information returns to  individual tax returns in July after the filing season has ended, and  according to TIGTA, routinely identifies more than 20 million individual  tax returns with discrepancies each year. In 2013 we reported that  IRS took on average, over 1 year\u20142 years in some cases\u2014to notify  taxpayers about discrepancies. These delays are a challenge for  IRS and the taxpayer. For example, when additional tax is owed, as  time passes taxpayers may be less likely, or less able, to pay the  original debt owed and any associated penalties that may have  accrued since the time of filing. Taxpayers may also be less likely to  have the relevant tax records needed to respond to IRS questions.  Notifying taxpayers earlier of a potential error could help bring them  into compliance more effectively than other enforcement options.", "We found that IRS could also expand RRP\u2019s capabilities to use RRP  to identify and generate soft notices for taxpayers that do not pay  taxes owed at the time of return processing. IRS does not contact  electronic filers with an unpaid tax balance until mid-May, weeks after  the April payment deadline. This treatment option could help IRS  collect taxes owed and also help taxpayers by making them aware of  payment options earlier and allowing them to avoid interest and  penalties. IRS officials agreed that it is more likely to recover any debt  owed if the taxpayer is notified earlier.", "Enhanced data analytics for improved enforcement. Just as IRS is  using RRP data and reporting capabilities to better target resources  for enforcement activities associated with refund returns, we found  that IRS could increase its access to useful data if it expanded RRP to  analyze returns not claiming refunds. For example, using RRP\u2019s  enhanced data analytics, including access to multiple data sources,  IRS could better identify characteristics of other types of  noncompliance to improve detection and enforcement. This approach  is consistent with IRS\u2019s strategic goal to advance data analytics to  inform decision making and improve operational outcomes. Officials  from IRS\u2019s Office of Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics told  us that RRP is a valuable data source for research on IDT and other  refund fraud.
