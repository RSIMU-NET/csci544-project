Officials from 7 of 8 states visited said they did not have data systems that could track teacher qualifications for each core subject they teach. Both state and district officials cited many conditions in the GAO survey that hinder their ability to have all highly qualified teachers. State and district officials reported teacher pay issues, such as low salaries and lack of incentive pay, teacher shortages, and other issues as hindrances. GAO's survey estimates show that significantly more high-poverty than low-poverty districts reported hindrances, such as little support for new teachers. Rural district officials cited hindrances related to their size and isolated locations. State officials reported they needed assistance or information from Education, such as in developing incentives to teach in high-poverty schools, and Education's strategic plan addresses some of these needs. To help meet the requirement for highly qualified teachers, state survey respondents reported they planned to spend about 65 percent of their Title II funds on professional development activities authorized under Title II, and districts planned to spend an estimated 66 percent on recruitment and retention. Both state and district officials planned to spend much larger amounts of funds from sources other than Title II funds on such activities. High-poverty districts planned to spend more Title II funds on recruitment and retention than low-poverty districts.

Recently, a body of  research has shown that quality teachers play a significant role in  improving student performance. However, research has also shown that  many teachers, especially those in high-poverty and rural districts, were  not certified and lacked knowledge of the subjects they taught. NCLBA  established the requirement that all teachers be highly qualified for each  core subject they teach by the end of the 2005-06 school year. The criteria  for meeting this requirement vary somewhat by grade level and experience  but generally require that teachers have (1) a bachelor\u2019s degree, (2) state  certification, and (3) subject area knowledge for each core subject they  teach. This represents the first time the federal government has  established specific criteria for teachers. Title II, Part A, of NCLBA  replaced the Eisenhower Professional Development and Class Size  Reduction programs with the Teacher and Principal Training and  Recruiting Fund and Congress appropriated $2.85 billion to help states and  districts meet the requirement. In addition, Title II directed these funds to  be spent on specific activities to help states and districts recruit, retain,  and develop highly qualified teachers. The Department of Education  (Education) administers Title II and is responsible for oversight of states\u2019  implementation of NCLBA.", "Given the need for states and districts to meet the requirement for highly  qualified teachers by the end of the 2005-06 school year, you asked us to  determine what they were doing to have their teachers meet the  requirement.

The student  enrollment for the responding states represented 85 percent of total  student population in kindergarten through 12th grade. In addition, we  surveyed a nationally representative sample of 830 school districts. We  received a response from 511 or 62 percent. We compared relevant  characteristics of these respondents to the universe of districts and found  them to be similar, which along with the response rate allowed us to  report national estimates. For our comparisons of high- and low-poverty  districts, we included responding districts that had 70 percent or more of  their students approved for free and reduced-price meals as high-poverty  and those with 30 percent or less of their students approved for free and  reduced-price meals as low-poverty. We visited and interviewed officials in  8 states selected with a range of characteristics that might affect their  ability to meet the requirement\u2014California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa,  Maryland, North Carolina, Delaware, and Wyoming. We visited 2 districts  in each of the states and 1 school in each district. We interviewed U.S.  Department of Education officials, and officials from professional  organizations and unions that represent teachers.

For example, a 1996 study  by Sanders and Rivers examined the effect of teacher quality on academic  achievement and found that children assigned to effective teachers scored  significantly higher in math than children assigned to ineffective teachers.  Research has also shown that many teachers, especially those in high- poverty and rural districts, were not certified and lacked knowledge of the  subjects they taught. For example, a report from The Education Trust  found that in every subject area, students in high-poverty schools were  more likely than other students to be taught by teachers without even a  minor in the subjects they teach.", "States are responsible for developing and administering their education  systems and most have delegated authority for operating schools to local  governments. States and local governments provide most of the money for  public elementary and secondary education. In 2002, Education reported  that 49 percent of the revenue for education was from state sources,   44 percent from local sources, and 7 percent from federal sources.  Therefore, it is mostly state and local funds that are used to cover most of  the major expenses, such as teacher salaries, school buildings, and  transportation. Although the autonomy of districts varies, states are  responsible for monitoring and assisting their districts that, in turn,  monitor and assist their schools.", "The federal government plays a limited but important role in education.  The Department of Education\u2019s mission is to ensure equal access to  education and promote educational excellence throughout the nation by,  among other things, supporting state and local educational improvement  efforts, gathering statistics and conducting research, and helping to make  education a national priority. Education provides assistance to help states  understand the provisions or requirements of applicable laws, as well as  overseeing and monitoring how states implement them. With the passage  of the No Child Left Behind Act, on January 8, 2002, the federal  government intensified its focus on teacher quality by establishing a  requirement in the act for teachers across the nation to be \u201chighly  qualified\u201d in every core subject they teach by the end of the 2005-06 school  year.", "While the act contains specific criteria for highly qualified teachers by  grade and experience levels, in general, the act requires that teachers:   (1) have a bachelor\u2019s degree, (2) have state certification, and   (3) demonstrate subject area knowledge for each core subject they teach.  Table 1 lists the specific criteria by grade and experience levels as defined  in the act.", "For Title II, Part A of the act, Congress appropriated $2.85 billion to the  Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund in fiscal year   2002\u2014about $740 million more than states received in fiscal year   2001 under the previous two programs that it replaced\u2014the Eisenhower  Professional Development and Class Size Reduction programs. The  purpose of the fund is to increase student academic achievement by  providing support for states and districts to implement authorized  activities cited in Title II to help them meet the requirement for highly  qualified teachers.

All  applications were due by June 2002, and states received the funds by  August 2002. The funds were to be distributed according to the formula  defined in the act. Specifically, states and districts received an amount  equal to what they received for fiscal year 2001 under the two previous  programs. The additional $740 million was distributed to states and  districts based on the number of families with children ages 5 to 17 who  had incomes below the poverty threshold and the relative population of  children ages 5 to 17. The act requires states to ensure that districts target  funds to those schools that have the highest number of teachers who are  not highly qualified, the largest class sizes, or have been identified as in  need of improvement.", "To help states understand and implement the new law, Education took a  number of actions.

Officials also did not have all the  information they needed to develop methods to evaluate subject area  knowledge for their current teachers. Accordingly, officials in all of the  states interviewed and nearly all surveyed said they needed complete and  clear guidance before they could comply with the law. Most of the states  we visited also did not have data systems that could track teacher  qualifications by core subject taught, which they would have to do to  ensure that teachers were teaching only those subjects for which they had  demonstrated subject area knowledge. Finally, many state officials we  visited were reluctant to say that their certified teachers might not be  highly qualified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "States Did Not Have Complete or Consistent Criteria to Determine the Number of Highly Qualified Teachers", "paragraphs": ["During our review, Education changed its criteria for teachers who were  in alternative certification programs and it reissued the draft guidance to  qualify only teachers in certain programs. The revised draft guidance  stated that only those teachers enrolled in alternative certification  programs with specific elements, such as teacher mentors, would be  considered highly qualified. As a result, state officials had to recount this  group of teachers by determining which alternative certification programs  met the standard and then which teachers participated in those programs.  In one state we visited, there were about 9,000 teachers in alternative  certification programs and all were considered highly qualified until the  revised draft guidance was issued. As of May 2003, an official said she was  still trying to determine the number of teachers who were highly qualified.", "Also during our review, state officials were uncertain about the criteria for  special education teachers. The draft guidance that was available during  most of our visits did not address special education teachers. As a result,  state officials could not know, for example, whether a special education  teacher teaching math and reading would have to demonstrate subject  area knowledge in both or neither of the subjects. For school year   1999-2000, special education teachers represented about 11 percent of the  national teacher population, so that, on average, state officials were  unable to determine whether at least a tenth of their teachers met the  highly qualified criteria. In some districts, special education teachers  represented a larger portion of the workforce. For example, in one high- poverty urban district that we visited, special education teachers were   21 percent of their teachers. Education issued final Title I regulations on  December 2, 2002, with an appendix that discussed the highly qualified  requirements for special education teachers, among other things.  However, the requirements are not discussed in the federal regulations nor  are they discussed in the Title II draft guidance that was issued December  19, 2002. In addition, as of March 2003 some officials still had questions  about the requirements. Perhaps because the guidance was issued in an  appendix, it was not given the prominence needed to ensure that all  officials would be aware of the information.", "Furthermore, neither Education\u2019s draft guidance nor its regulations  provided more information than the law to help state officials develop  methods other than tests to evaluate their current teachers\u2019 subject area  knowledge. The law allows states to use a \u201chigh, objective uniform state  standard of evaluation\u201d instead of a test. Education\u2019s draft guidance  repeated the language of the law, but provided no further interpretation. In  addition, Education officials said they would review states\u2019  implementation of this provision when they conduct compliance reviews  and then determine if the state evaluation is in compliance with the law.  State officials said they needed more information, such as examples, to be  confident of what Education would consider adequate for compliance with  the law. State officials prefer evaluations instead of tests, according to an  official at the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), because  they expect evaluations to be less expensive, more flexible, and more  acceptable to teachers and unions. Such evaluations might be done  through classroom observations, examination of portfolios, and peer  reviews. In March 2003, CCSSO held a conference attended by about   25 state officials and several Education officials to discuss the  implementation of state evaluations. At that conference, state officials said  Education\u2019s lack of specificity was particularly a problem for evaluating  middle and high school teachers who had not demonstrated subject area  knowledge. According to our survey data, 23 of 37 state officials said they  would have difficulty fulfilling the highly qualified requirement for middle  school teachers and 14 anticipated difficulty for high school teachers.  According to district survey results, 20 percent anticipated difficulties in  meeting the federal criteria for middle school teachers and 24 percent for  high school teachers. Furthermore, as table 2 shows, a significantly higher  percentage of high-poverty districts reported they would have greater  difficulty fulfilling the requirement for teachers, especially at the middle  and high school levels, than would low-poverty districts.", "State officials from the 8 states we visited said they could not determine  the number of highly qualified teachers because the draft guidance was  changing, not clear, or incomplete.

In our state survey, officials indicated that they needed more information  from Education on professional development programs, best practices,  and developing incentives for teachers to teach in high-poverty schools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State Officials Cited Several Problems as Hindrances", "paragraphs": ["Many state officials responding to our survey reported that pay issues  hindered their ability to meet the requirement to have all highly qualified  teachers. These issues included low salaries, lack of incentive pay  programs, and a lack of career ladders for teachers. For example,   32 of 37 state respondents said low teachers\u2019 salaries compared to other  occupations was a hindrance. Officials we visited said that because of the  low salaries it has been more difficult to recruit and retain some highly  qualified teachers, especially math and science teachers. Several  occupations are open to people with a bachelor\u2019s degree in math and  science, such as computer scientists and geologists. During the late   1990s, there was an increase in demand for workers with math and science  backgrounds, especially in information technology occupations. Between  1994 and 2001, the number of workers employed in the mathematical and  computer sciences increased by about 77 percent while the number of  teachers increased by about 28 percent and total employment increased by  about 14 percent. Furthermore, the math and science occupations have  generally paid higher salaries than teaching positions. The U.S.  Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate that in   2001 average weekly earnings was $1,074 for mathematical and computer  scientist positions and $730 for teachers. Some research shows that  teacher salary is only one of many factors that influence teacher  recruitment and retention. For example, the American Association of  School Administrators explained the relationship between pay and  working conditions in a report on higher pay in hard-to-staff schools. The  report stated \u201cHow money matters becomes much clearer if salary is  viewed as just one of many factors that employees weigh when assessing  the relative attractiveness of any particular job, such as opportunities for  advancement, difficulty of the job, physical working conditions, length of  commute, flexibility of working hours, and demands on personal time.  Adjusting the salaries upward can compensate for less appealing aspects  of a job; conversely, improving the relative attractiveness of jobs can  compensate for lower salaries.\u201d", "Many state survey respondents also cited teacher shortages as a  hindrance. Specifically, 23 of the 37 state officials reported teacher  shortages in high-need subject areas\u2014such as, math, science, and special  education. Additionally, 12 state officials reported a shortage in the  number of new highly qualified teachers in subject areas that are not high  need, and 12 reported that having few alternative certification programs  hindered their efforts. Education experts have debated the causes and  effects of teacher shortages. Some experts argue that the problem is not in  the number of teachers in the pool of applicants but in their distribution  across the country. Others argue that poor retention is the real cause of  teacher shortages. As for alternative certification programs, they were  established to help overcome teacher shortages by offering other avenues  for people to enter the teaching profession. However, in 1 state we visited  officials said the success of these programs had been mixed because the  content and length of the programs varied and some alternative  certification teachers were better prepared than others.", "Although states have been facing teacher shortages in some subject areas  for years, the new requirement for highly qualified teachers could make it  even more difficult to fulfill the demand for teachers. The new law  requires states to ensure that teachers only teach subjects for which they  have taken a rigorous state test or evaluation, completed an academic  major or graduate degree, finished course work equivalent to such  degrees, or obtained advanced certification or credentialing in the  subjects. Previously, states allowed teachers to teach subjects without  such course work or credentials. From its Schools and Staffing Survey,  the National Center for Education Statistics, within the Department of  Education, reported that in 1999-2000, 14 to 22 percent of students in  middle grades and 5 to 10 percent of high school students taking English,  math, and science were in classes taught by teachers without a major,  minor, or certification in the subjects they taught. Also, the report  indicated that in the high school grades, 17 percent of students enrolled in  physics and 36 percent enrolled in geology/earth/space science classes  were taught by out-of-field teachers.", "Some states also cited several other conditions that might hinder their  ability to meet the requirement for highly qualified teachers. For example,  13 of the 37 state respondents reported few programs to support new  teachers, and 9 reported large classes as hindrances. State respondents  also cited work environment factors such as teacher performance  assessments, a lack of principal leadership, and lack of school supplies  and equipment as hindrances. See table 3 for more information on  hindrances reported by state officials.", "Additionally, 7 state officials who responded to our survey cited union  agreements as a hindrance. Officials in 5 states that we visited said that the  teachers\u2019 unions objected to testing currently certified teachers for subject  area knowledge, and officials in 2 of these states also said that current  teachers might leave rather than take a test. An official representing the  American Federation of Teachers (AFT), an organization that represents  teachers, school support staff, higher education faculty and staff, among  others, said that AFT supports the federal definition for highly qualified  teachers and incentive pay for teachers in high-need subject areas and that  certified teachers should have a choice between taking a test and having a  state evaluation to determine subject area knowledge. The National  Education Association, an organization with members who work at every  level of education, issued an analysis of the NCLBA that identified several  changes it believes should be made in the law, including clarifying the  requirement for highly qualified teachers. The union officials we spoke  with from 2 states we visited said they also support the requirement for  highly qualified teachers but expressed concerns about how their states  would implement the legislation. One state union official said the current  state process for certification requires multiple tests\u2014more than is  required in the legislation\u2014and the union is concerned that the state will  collapse the testing and streamline the teacher preparation process as part  of its changes to meet the requirement. The union official from the other  state said that his union was concerned because the state\u2019s approach for  implementing the requirement for highly qualified teachers has become a  moving target and this causes frustration for teachers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School Districts Reported Hindrances Similar to Those Reported by States and More High-Poverty Districts Reported Certain Hindrances", "paragraphs": ["School district estimates from our survey show that, similar to state  respondents, salary issues hinder districts\u2019 efforts to meet the requirement  for highly qualified teachers. Almost 60 percent of district officials cited  low teacher salaries compared to other occupations as a hindrance, with a  significantly higher number of high-poverty than low-poverty district  officials reporting this as a hindrance. During our site visits to 4 rural  districts, officials said that their salaries could not compete with salaries  offered in other occupations and locations. One official said that pay in the  rural districts was low compared to teacher salaries in surrounding states.  Both state and district officials also said that these salary conditions affect  the recruitment and retention of highly qualified teachers.", "Our survey estimates also show that conditions related to teacher  development were hindering districts\u2019 ability to meet the highly qualified  teacher requirement. The conditions reported by districts included   (1) weak training for teachers in the use of technology (28 percent),   (2) few alternative certification programs (18 percent), and   (3) professional development programs that are not of sufficient duration  to improve teacher quality (23 percent). Weak training programs can leave  teachers unprepared to deal with all the challenges of teaching and lead to  job dissatisfaction. Table 4 provides estimates of the percentages of  districts reporting conditions that hinder their ability to meet the  requirement for highly qualified teachers.", "While the ranking of most of the hindrances reported by districts and  states were similar, three conditions were reported among the top third of  hindrances for districts but among the bottom third for states. Specifically,  these conditions were (1) alternative certification programs do not provide  teachers with adequate teaching skills, (2) teacher preparation programs  do not provide teachers with adequate subject matter expertise, and   (3) training for teachers in the use of technology is weak. The first two of  these conditions relate to programs that are usually responsibilities of the  state departments of education. States or districts can address the third  condition, technology training. These conditions indicate areas in which  states and districts can work together to improve programs and help meet  the requirement for highly qualified teachers.", "A significantly higher number of high-poverty districts than low-poverty  districts identified some conditions as hindrances. As table 5 shows, in  addition to teacher shortages and pay issues, a larger percentage of high- poverty districts cited few programs to support new teachers and few  alternative certification programs, among others, as hindrances to meeting  the requirement.", "During our site visits, officials from high-poverty districts told us they had  great difficulty retaining teachers. For example, officials in one district  said that although the district provided training for new teachers in the  skills they needed, these teachers became more marketable after they  completed the training and often left for higher paying teaching positions.  According to these officials, the schools in this district did not always  benefit from the district\u2019s training programs. High-poverty district officials  also said they could not compete with surrounding, wealthier districts in  teacher pay. Officials in these districts and at the American Association of  School Administrators also said that some unions do not support the use  of incentive pay for high-poverty schools because they believe that salary  scales should be equal for all schools within a district.", "Rural district officials we visited and also those who provided survey  comments said they faced unusual hindrances because some of them were  very small, isolated, or had only one or two teachers in total at some  schools. During our site visits, some officials from rural districts also said  that they were facing teacher shortages because not enough teachers were  willing to teach in rural districts. For example, one official in a large, rural  state said that the state had only one university, which makes it difficult  for teachers to obtain further course work to meet the federal criteria for  subject area knowledge. Since many teachers in this state\u2019s rural districts  had to teach more than one core subject, with limited access to subject  area training, they may not meet the highly qualified criteria for all  subjects they teach. One survey respondent also wrote, \u201cRural schools  have to assign teachers to several subject areas at  secondary level.  We do not have large numbers of students, and teachers have to wear  more than one hat. Rural schools are also a long way from colleges and to  require licensure in every subject they teach is ludicrous.\u201d In a 2001 report  to Congress, Education estimated that 84 percent of 4-year institutions  would offer distance education courses in 2002.

For example, in one state we visited,  officials planned to hold a workshop to provide middle and high school  math teachers with technology training so that they could incorporate  interactive Web sites in their instruction. Generally, state officials said  they planned to use Title II funds to continue activities that were begun in  previous years.", "While professional development activities were to receive the largest share  of funds, survey results show state officials planned to also spend Title II  funds on other activities cited in the act. Officials in 28 states planned to  spend about 18 percent on technical assistance activities, such as  providing information about the requirement for highly qualified teachers  to districts via the state Web site. Certification activities received the  smallest percentage of Title II funds\u20132 percent. These activities include  efforts to promote certification reciprocity with other states and efforts to  establish, expand, or improve alternative routes for certification.

The one  exception was technical assistance activities, where Title II funds  accounted for 77 percent of the total. (See fig. 3.)

Based on our survey, district officials planned to  spend an estimated 66 percent of their Title II funds on recruitment and  retention activities and 34 percent on activities related to professional  development. Class size reduction activities were the largest funded  recruitment and retention activity and accounted for 56 percent of total  Title II funds. In a majority of our site visits we learned that district  officials used these funds to hire additional highly qualified teachers to  continue activities developed under the previous Class Size Reduction  Program. Class size reduction activities may help improve teacher  retention because, according to an Education report, teachers in small  classes spend less time on classroom management and more time  providing instruction, thus raising the teacher\u2019s level of job satisfaction.  While class size reduction activities can be seen as a retention tool, they  may also increase the number of highly qualified teachers that need to be  hired. This may be a problem for some districts and states. In fact, officials  in one large state we visited said class size reduction activities presented a  challenge by increasing the number of classes not being taught by a highly  qualified teacher.", "Additionally, district officials in our site visits said that they implemented  or planned to implement a broad range of professional development  activities. For example, one district had a teacher-coach program for its  math and science teachers. This program used senior teachers as full-time  coaches to assist less experienced teachers with instructional strategies  and curriculum preparation. Other programs focused on math and reading,  varied instructional strategies for different types of students, and use of  technology. District officials in our site visits said most activities were in  place prior to the act.", "While all districts spent more on recruitment and retention activities than  professional development, there were differences between high- and low- poverty districts. From our survey, we estimate that high-poverty districts  planned to spend a significantly larger percentage of Title II funds on  recruitment and retention and a smaller percentage on professional  development activities than low-poverty districts.

Overall, 80 percent of the total funds districts planned to spend  on professional development activities came from other federal, state, and  local funds. Title II funds represented a larger percentage of total funds  spent on authorized activities for high-poverty districts than low-poverty  districts. For example, in high-poverty districts Title II funds were   48 percent of the funds they planned to spend for recruitment and  retention activities compared to 15 percent in low-poverty districts. There  may be several reasons for these differences. For example, Title II  allocated more funds to those districts with more high-poverty families,  and low-poverty districts may have had more local funds to contribute to  the total.

There was little difference between the percentages of high-  and low-poverty districts that targeted their funds or between urban and  rural districts. For example, 29 percent of high-poverty districts and   30 percent of low-poverty districts reported targeting some of their Title II  funds. Additionally, some district officials we visited said they did not  target funds according to the criteria listed in the act but that they targeted  funds in other ways such as to support math and science programs for  teachers and for administrative leadership programs.

Without this information state  officials are unsure how to assess whether their current teachers meet the  highly qualified requirement. This would also help them  accurately  determine the number of teachers who are highly qualified and take  appropriate steps, such as deciding on which activities to spend Title II  funds and targeting Title II funds to schools with the highest numbers of  teachers who are not highly qualified.

The response rate for the  state survey was 71 percent and for the district survey 62 percent. The  surveys were conducted between December 4, 2002, and April 4, 2003. We  analyzed the survey data and identified significant results. See figure 5 for  a geographic display of responding and nonresponding states.", "The study population for the district survey consisted of public school  districts contained in the Department of Education\u2019s Core of Common  Data (CCD) Local Education Agency (LEA) file for the 2000-2001 school  year. From this, we identified a population of 14,503 school districts in the  50 states and the District of Columbia.", "Sample Design. The sample design for this survey was a stratified sample  of 830 LEAs in the study population. This sample included the 100 largest  districts and a stratified sample of the remaining districts with strata  defined by community type (city, urban, and rural) and by the district\u2019s  poverty level.

All estimates produced from the district sample in this report  are for a target population defined as all public school districts in the   50 states and the District of Columbia for the 2002-03 school year.  Estimates to this target population were formed by weighting the survey  data to account for both the sample design and the response rates for each  stratum. For our estimates of high- and low-poverty districts, we defined  high-poverty districts as those with participation rates in the free and  reduced meals program of 70 percent or above. Low-poverty districts were  defined as those with free and reduced meals program rates at 30 percent  and below. One of the advantages of this approach was that it allowed for  a sufficient number of cases in each category to conduct statistical  analyses.", "Sampling Error. Because we surveyed a sample of school districts, our  results are estimates of a population of school districts and thus are  subject to sampling errors that are associated with samples of this size and  type. Our confidence in the precision of the results from this sample is  expressed in 95 percent confidence intervals. The 95 percent confidence  intervals are expected to include the actual results for 95 percent of the  samples of this type. We calculated confidence intervals for our study  results using methods that are appropriate for a stratified, probability  sample. For the percentages presented in this report, we are 95 percent  confident that the results we would have obtained if we had studied the  entire study population are within plus or minus 10 percentage points of  our results, unless otherwise noted. For example, we estimate that   34 percent of the districts target at least some funds to specific types of  schools. The 95 percent confidence interval for this estimate would be no  wider than plus or minus 10 percent, or from 24 percent to 44 percent.", "Nonsampling Error. In addition to these sampling errors, the practical  difficulties in conducting surveys of this type may introduce other types of  errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For example,  questions may be misinterpreted, the respondents\u2019 answers may differ  from those of districts that did not respond, or errors could be made in  keying questionnaire data. We took several steps to reduce these errors.", "To minimize some of these errors, the state and district questionnaires  were each pretested three times to ensure that respondents would  understand the questions and that answers could be provided. To increase  the response rate, sampled districts received two calls encouraging them  to complete and return the questionnaire.", "We also performed an analysis to determine whether some sample-based  estimates compared favorably with known population values. We  performed this analysis for 12 estimates providing information on  students, teachers, number of schools, and administrators that covered  major segments those groups. For example, we did an analysis on all full- time equivalent classroom teachers but not on teachers of ungraded  students, which is a very small proportion of all teachers.

Although these  characteristics were selected because they might be related to other  characteristics of district teachers and district administration, we do not  know the extent to which the survey respondents would reflect the  population characteristics for the specific questions asked on our survey.  For example, we are not certain whether districts responding to the survey  were further along in the implementation of Title II requirements than the  districts that did not respond.", "Our sample was not designed to produce geographical area estimates, and  we did not explicitly stratify our sample by state or region.
