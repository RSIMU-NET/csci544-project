GAO also reviewed and summarized VA information on the status of key management initiatives to enhance third-party revenue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's case study analysis of unbilled patient encounters at 18 medical centers, including 10 medical centers with low billing performance and 8 medical centers under VA's Consolidated Patient Account Centers (CPAC) initiative considered to be high performers, found documentation, coding, and billing errors and inadequate management oversight for approximately $1.7 billion deemed unbillable in fiscal year 2007. Although some medical services are unbillable, such as service-connected treatment, management has not validated reasons for related unbilled amounts of about $1.4 billion to assure that all billable costs are charged to third-party insurers. Because insurers will not accept improperly coded bills and they generally will not pay bills received more than 1 year after the date that medical services were provided, it is important that coding for medical services is accurate and timely. The 10 case study medical centers reported average days to bill ranging from 109 days to 146 days in fiscal year 2007 and significant coding and billing errors and other problems that accounted for over $254 million, or 21 percent, of the $1.2 billion in unbilled medical services costs. Although GAO determined that CPAC officials performed a more thorough review of billings, GAO's analysis of unbilled amounts for the 8 CPAC centers found problems that accounted for $37.5 million, or about 7 percent, of the $508.7 million in unbilled medical services costs. In addition, GAO's VA-wide statistical tests of collections follow-up on unpaid third-party bills of $250 or more identified significant control failures related to timely follow-up and documentation of contacts with third-party insurers on outstanding receivables. VA guidance requires medical center accounts receivable staff to make up to three follow-up contacts, as necessary, on outstanding third-party receivables. GAO's tests identified high failure rates VA-wide as well as for CPAC and non-CPAC medical centers related to the requirement for timely follow up with third-party insurers on unpaid amounts. GAO's tests also found high failure rates associated with the lack of documentation of follow-up contacts. VA lacks policies and procedures and a full range of standardized reports for effective management oversight of VA-wide third-party billing and collection operations. Further, although VA management has undertaken several initiatives to enhance third-party revenue, many of these initiatives are open-ended or will not be implemented for several years. Until these shortcomings are addressed, VA will continue to fall short of its goal to maximize third-party revenue, thereby placing a higher burden on taxpayers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides health care to eligible  veterans through a system of Veterans Health Administration (VHA)  medical facilities that comprise one of the largest health care systems in  the world.

VA third-party  billing and collection operations are carried out through a nationwide  network of 153 medical centers, 877 outpatient clinics, and 135 nursing  homes, residential rehabilitation treatment programs, and readjustment  counseling centers. During fiscal year 2007, about 5.6 million people  received treatment in VA health care facilities for service-related as well as  nonservice-related conditions and VA collections for health care services  totaled nearly $2.2 billion.", "In September 2001, we testified that problems in VA\u2019s collection  operations, including inadequate patient intake procedures for gathering  insurance information, insufficient physician documentation of specific  medical care provided, a shortage of qualified coders, and a lack of  automated information, diminished VA\u2019s collections. In May 2003, we  testified that VA had made improvements in these areas but operational  problems, such as unpaid accounts receivable, missed billing  opportunities, and billing backlogs, continued to limit the amount VA  collects. In July 2004, we reported that VA had increased collections of  third-party insurer payments by 49 percent from $540 million in fiscal year  2001 to $804 million in fiscal year 2003. However, we also found  continuing weaknesses in the billing and collection processes at the three  medical centers we visited that impaired VA\u2019s ability to maximize the  amount of dollars paid by third-party insurance companies.", "Over the past several years, Congress has provided funding for VHA  medical information management system improvements.

For our case studies, we selected the 10 medical centers with the  highest numbers of days to bill (lowest billing performance) and the 8  medical centers under the CPAC management initiative for regionalized  billing and collection activity that were expected to be high performers. To  achieve the second objective, we tested controls for timely collection  follow-up and documentation of contacts on third-party bills using a VA- wide statistical sample, and stratified subsets of our VA-wide sample for  CPAC medical centers and medical centers that were not under the CPAC  initiative. Because you were interested in learning whether medical  centers under CPAC had more effective controls over third-party billings  and collections, we separately analyzed CPAC billing controls and  separately tested third-party collection controls for CPAC medical centers.  To address our third objective on VA management oversight capability, we  reviewed management reports generated by key VA systems and  interviewed medical center and VHA officials about their oversight  procedures. We also obtained information on the status and targeted  implementation dates of key management improvement initiatives,  including two initiatives that were recently completed and six initiatives  that were under way at the end of our field work.", "In conducting our work, we interviewed management officials and  reviewed applicable laws, regulations, and VA policies and procedures.

For example, the medical centers did not always bill insurance companies  in a timely manner and they did not always perform follow-up on unpaid  receivables in accordance with VA policy. We identified insufficient  resources and a lack of performance standards as major causes of these  problems. Our 2004 report included several recommendations directed at  improving billing and collection functions.", "To improve the third-party billing function, we recommended that VA   (1) perform a workload analysis of the medical center\u2019s coding and billing  staff and (2) based on the workload analysis, consider making necessary  resource adjustments. To address these recommendations, VA formed a  work group and performed in-depth surveys at 148 medical facilities to  determine whether the medical facilities had established and implemented  productivity and accuracy standards that were recommended by VHA in  2002. The work group reported that the majority of the 148 facilities  surveyed had implemented coding productivity standards and these  standards were fairly consistent. In addition, the work group made several  recommendations directed at maximizing coding productivity and assuring  data quality. For example, the work group recommended that only  qualified, competent coders be used and that noncoding duties related to  assembly, analysis, preparation of coding records, and release of  information be assigned to other staff. The work group also recommended  that all coding must be completed through the national encoder software.  In November 2007, VA issued Handbook, 1907.03, Health Information  Management, Clinical Coding Program Procedures, which established a  minimum bill coding accuracy standard of 95 percent and minimum  standards (time frames) for coding productivity.", "Our 2004 report also made three recommendations directed at improving  the third-party collection function. Specifically, we recommended that VA  (1) reinforce to accounts receivable staff that they should perform the first  follow-up on unpaid claims within 30 days of the billing date, as required  by VA Handbook 4800.14, Medical Care Debts, and establish procedures  for monitoring compliance; (2) reinforce the requirement for accounts  receivable staff to enter insurance company contact information and  follow-up dates to better document follow-up actions; and (3) augment VA  Handbook 4800.14 by specifying a date or providing instructions for  determining an appropriate date for conducting second follow-up calls to  insurance companies on unpaid amounts. To address these  recommendations, VA modified and reissued VA Handbook 4800.14 to  explain requirements for performing and documenting the first, second,  and third follow-ups with third-party insurers. For example, for third-party  accounts receivable greater than $250, the reissued Handbook now  requires the first follow-up to be made within 45 days after the initial bill  is generated. The second follow-up is to be made within 21 days after the  first follow-up and the third follow-up is to be made within 14 days of the  second follow-up.

Of the total  $1.2 billion in unbilled medical services costs at the 10 medical centers,  service-connected (nonbillable) medical care accounted for nearly $116  million, or 10 percent, and nonservice-related not billable amounts totaled  $835.3 million, or 69 percent, including $170 million recorded as medical  procedures performed for uninsured veterans and $433 million recorded  as attributable to medical services that were not covered by veterans\u2019  private health insurance. Managers at the 10 case study medical centers  did not perform adequate reviews of the encounters assigned to these  categories to ensure that billing clerks appropriately classified them.  Coding and billing errors ($48.3 million), documentation errors ($10.4  million), and undefined other reasons ($195.4 million) accounted over  $254 million, or 21 percent, of the $1.2 billion in total unbilled medical  services costs at the 10 medical centers. Coding and billing errors include  incorrect clinical service codes and late filing of claims. The largest group  of billing errors included $25 million for which the billing time frame had  expired. According to a VA official, VA has entered into national and  regional contracts with many third-party insurance companies that bar  insurer liability for payment of bills received after a specified period of  time, usually 1 year, but sometimes as little as 6 months, after medical  services were provided. In addition, documentation errors accounted for  more than $10 million in unbilled amounts at the 10 medical centers.  Documentation errors include the failure of certification personnel to  provide documentation of physician and other health care provider  certifications; health care provider errors, such as physicians failing to  submit documentation of their services for coding; and veterans refusing  to sign Authorization for Release of Protected Health Information forms.  Insurance companies will not pay for services unless they receive  documentation that the physicians and health care providers are certified.

However,  the revised policy would extend the date for the first follow-up for bills  from $250 to $1,500 to be within 60 days of the initial bill. Going forward, it  will be important for VA to oversee and monitor the implementation of the  new policy as part of its management oversight process in order to  determine if the new policy is achieving intended results and, if not, to  perform additional analysis and make appropriate policy changes to  assure effective follow-up on unpaid third-party bills.", "VA also provided technical comments and corrections which we have  addressed in our report, as appropriate.

In addition, we summarized  the status of management initiatives undertaken to improve third-party  billing and collection processes.", "We used as our criteria applicable law and VA policy, as well as our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and our  Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool. To assess the  control environment at our test locations, we obtained an understanding  of VA processes and controls over the third-party revenue cycle. We  performed walk-throughs of these processes at several medical centers.  We interviewed management officials at selected medical centers about  their management oversight and accountability procedures over third- party billings and collections. We also reviewed applicable VA program  guidance and local policies and procedures at selected test locations and  interviewed officials about their billing and collection processes and  controls. In addition, to assure the reliability of data and information used  in this report, we reviewed VA documentation and interviewed key  officials. We also reviewed VA procedures for assuring the reliability of  data and information generated by key VA systems used in the third-party  billing and collection processes, including VHA\u2019s Veterans Health  Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and  Performance and Operations Web-Enabled Reports (POWER) systems.", "To determine if the third-party revenue offices at our 18 case study  locations had adequate management oversight and accountability for  assuring timely and accurate billings, we obtained and reviewed  management reports , including (1) Reasons Not Billable Summary and  Detailed reports and (2) Elapsed Days to Bill performance reports. We  compiled data from the Reasons Not Billable reports into a database and  established categories of reasons not billed for further analysis. We  coordinated with VHA officials on the identification of reasons not billed  categories. We interviewed medical center revenue officials at the 10 case  study medical centers with low billing performance and at CPAC, for the 8  CPAC case study medical centers, about their management oversight and  accountability procedures. Table 4 shows the two groups of case study  medical centers we examined and performance data on days to bill and  unbilled amounts for each location.", "We selected a VA-wide statistical sample of billing records to assess  whether medical center accounts receivable personnel were adhering to  VA policy for timely follow-up with private insurance companies on  unpaid third-party receivables. From the universe of fiscal year 2007  collections activity, we stratified the billing records into one stratum for  bills from CPAC and one stratum from all other VA medical centers. We  randomly selected 60 bills from the CPAC stratum and 200 from the  stratum for the rest of VA. We designed this sample for control testing with  a 5 percent tolerable error rate so that if there were no errors in one of the  strata, we would be able to conclude with 95 percent confidence that the  billing records for that stratum were statistically compliant.", "Our random sample of 260 bills included medical centers from each of the  21 VISNs. We used our statistical sample to assess the population of  follow-up contacts for receivables greater than $250 that were outstanding  for at least 45 days at any point during fiscal year 2007. We explain the  results of our statistical sample in terms of control attributes related to  adherence to VA policy guidance for (1) performing timely initial and  subsequent follow-up, as appropriate, on unpaid amounts, (2) whether  accounts receivable personnel properly documented follow-up contacts,  and (3) whether accounts receivable staff properly documented reasons  why adjustments to decrease billed amounts were made. We present our  statistical results as (1) our projection of the estimated error overall  (failure rate) and for each control attribute as point estimates and (2) the  95 percent, two-sided, confidence intervals for control failure rates. Our 95  percent confidence interval means that if you were to determine an  estimate for 100 different random samples, 95 out of 100 times, the  estimate would fall within the confidence interval. In other words, the true  value is between the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval 95  percent of the time. We generally report our statistical results as point  estimates that fall within confidence intervals. However, because  confidence intervals varied widely for our various control tests, we  focused on the lower bound of our confidence intervals as a conservative  estimate of our test results. As additional information, we present our  detailed test results below, including the point estimate and the upper and  lower bound of our 95 percent confidence intervals. Table 5 shows our  detailed test results for timely follow-up on unpaid third-party bills totaling  $250 or more.", "Table 6 shows the detailed results of our tests of VA-wide controls for  documenting the details of follow-up contacts made with third-party  insurers.", "Our tests of whether accounts receivable personnel adequately  documented reasons for adjustments to decrease billed amounts found a  VA-wide failure rate of 44 percent, as shown in table 7.", "To assess VA management oversight of third-party billing and collection  processes, we interviewed medical center and CPAC management officials  at our case study locations and reviewed available data and reports used  by these managers. Three of our 10 case study locations with low billing  performance and CPAC were also included in our statistical tests of  collection follow-up procedures. We also reviewed related VA and VHA  policies and available VHA CBO management reports. In addition, we  interviewed VHA officials about their oversight procedures, including  limitations in systems reporting capabilities.", "To follow up on management initiatives undertaken to improve third-party  billings and collections, we obtained and reviewed information and  interviewed VA managers on the objectives, status, and targeted  completion dates for eight major initiatives. We did not evaluate the  initiatives or independently assess the information provided by VA  officials. However, we evaluated billing controls and tested compliance  with controls for accounts receivable follow-up for the medical centers  under the CPAC pilot initiative.", "We briefed VA managers at our test locations and VA headquarters,  including VA medical center directors, VA headquarters information  resource management and property management officials, and VHA\u2019s  Chief Business Officer on the details of our audit, including our findings  and their implications. On April 30, 2008, we requested comments on a  draft of this report. We received comments on May 22, 2008, and have  summarized those comments in the Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  section of this report. We conducted our audit work from January 2007  through May 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
